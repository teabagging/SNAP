I only used this for carrying paperwork but found that i was unable to carry even a single A4 folder.

There are a couple of straps that are there to commpress the pack that fell apart about 6 months into use. I basically use this thing as a daily tote around bag with misc items in it. Its not quite big enough to carry my 14\\" laptop but can fit if there's nothing else in it. It is not waterproof nor does it claim to be but keep things fairly dry in the rain, I do lot of cycling and this thing goes with me everytime. It is also small enough to bungee onto my rack.

Not only was the Jansport huge but it was really expensive and I'll tell you he has not used it once(hopefully it'll come in handy when travleing), but the 20' cuscus single strap sling (this bag) goes EVERYWHERE with him. It's convient, comfortable and best of all he loves it. Since he's a police officer he's always taking his gun home with him it's nice that he can keep those personal items out of site.It's got a place for everything...even your ipod which is conviently located on the strap that goes over your chest.

I should have paid better attention to the reviews in regards to the zipper issue. In a week's worth of everyday use, the zipper kinked and the next day it broke off from the track.

Easily fit a standard sized 3 subject notebook, 2 novels and a Laptop with a 13.3in Screen.. It would also hold a small external drive and a couple decks of trading cards, All with out a hitch it even has slight waterproof capabilities!.. That was about a month ago.. Now, 1 of the Zippers for the main pocket is broken,and The flimsy fabric between the compartments is shredding (And being the type of material it is, It will not mend easily if at all) So Now I have one large pocket.. I'm thinking of repairing it with canvas or another more durable material, but for almost $40.. Shouldn't have to.. One plus is that the exterior material is holding up rather well..

Michael Watkins proposes the 'STaRS' model, which translated into four situations: sustaining success, turnaround, realignment, and start-up. Matching right strategy to each situation is key. How you position yourself with the team, with your boss, and even your own mental self will make or break or your career. The author walks through all of these steps offering numerous examples and great commentary - this book will not guarantee success, but it may well relieve some of the stress associated with the transition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent practical resource","review":"I got this with about a month to go to a new appointment as CEO and couldn't recommend it more highly. It works equally well as general read on leadership transitions and as a step by step manual on preparing for one in concrete, practical steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough substance","review":"The book is well organized and has some general ideas that are worthwhile, but also have been expressed in most other books of this genre. The generalities are not developed enough to help the reader really lay out a plan for the first 90 days. Each chapter begins with a brief anecdote of someone who either succeeded or failed in a new role. I found myself wishing the author had spent more time on these examples, rather than simply using a couple of paragraphs as an introduction to the chapter.I recommend \\"You're in Charge: Now What\\" over this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to help focus efforts in first 90 days","review":"The book helps to put a framework around starting a new job or transitioning to a new position.

I gave it only 4 stars however because at the end of the book he touts all the great resources you will find at [...] that you can use and share to get everyone on the same page. Well, there are no resources there that I could find (except to purchase more of his books). I was very disappointed, enough to feel it takes away from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on its own -- outstanding in tandem","review":"As an executive recruiter, this is an excellent book for insights on starting the new job. As the executives who I place can tell you, every new job situation is different and canned formulas don't always work.

I've had numerous transitions in my career, some with Fortune 500 companies, and the tools in this book would have been incredibly useful.

Unfortunately it's always been 'sink or swim'.If you have a job or position change in the offing, this book is a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not learn anything new from this book","review":"I felt \\"The First 90 Days\\" was full of common sense on how to succeed in a new position. It also offered half-hearted examples of why some executives failed. For instance, some of the advice I paraphrased below:- Figure out what makes your employees tick and how they fit into the role you have for them.- Understand that what helped you succeed in the last position might be your downfall in the new position.- Identify those who support or oppose you or who could do either depending on whether you can convince them to be with you or not.The text was so \\"blah\\" that it was hard to be engaged in the book and none of the advice that was peppered throughout was enlightening. I really think a high-level manager would be disappointed in reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a textbook","review":"I was unable to finish this book because of how bland and boring it was.

I don't believe that this skill can be taught. I agree with the book's idea that you need to establish credibility up front, by going after low hanging fruit, but I don't think that leadership can be taught. A leader is formed from their background in which character is built. I feel the time and effort that I put into this book would have been better spent on some other endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive General Guidance","review":"This is the best book on the subject I've read dealing with taking over a job as a new manager. It's comprehensive for all levels between first-level manager and CEO, and it's applicable to all industries and functional areas. It therefore obviously falls short of being specific for every manager's given situation, which forces the reader to filter out about 20% of the content. But this need to filter creates the desired effect of forcing the reader to think about the challenges of his or her next job while setting aside the parts that don't apply.Some of the diagrams are over-simplistic and of no practical use, but they all help stimulate thoughts to help the lessons sink in.The author identifies the pitfalls most managers make during transition and then offers insightful steps on how to navigate those early months. For most readers, there will be critical \`aha' insights, and this book can serve as a planning reference for every new manager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who is going to have a promotion - of any kind, to any level.

The CD has charts & whatnot to further expand upon content that doesn't come across in the audiobook and needs to be physically utilized.

Unfortunately they have both soy and gluten, which makes them off limits for a lot of people with food sensitivities (lost stars for that). But taste-wise, for everybody else, they are really good! The red sauce comes in hot, medium, and mild, and unlike some 'hot' sauces it doesn't sacrifice taste at all for the heat. The green sauce is very mild. My kid and friends love enchiladas made with either. I eat lowcarb, and often chop up cooked chicken, dice a little pepper/onion, and mix in a little enchilada sauce (sometimes a little cream cheese) and nuke it and stir. Yum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for your Mexican dishes that you make at home!","review":"We make chicken, beef or pork enchiladas and this is one of our favorite sauces to use.

I bought these to terminate cables for remote speakers into a Niles speaker box. While I don't think the Niles speaker spring clips are particularly dependable, these connectors were big disappointments and unreliable to the point that if you moved the speaker box at all, some of them would come loose. They did not grip the cable satisfactorily, their insulators kept falling off, and were generally unacceptable to handle heavy gauge cables.I use a lot of monster cable products, but these were a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous, cheap clip lets dog break free!","review":"I had the same experience as another reviewer (see additional listings for this leash) - less than five minutes into the first walk my dog popped off the leash! We live in a city and she is not car savvy, so it was quite a heart-stopping moment. After getting her home safely, I tested the clip by attaching the collar and pulling it in the direction of the pin - it popped open and released the collar ring with very little pressure! I had this problem with another leash, but (naively) trusted this one because it was from a 'good' manufacturer - never again! This appears to be another cheap, untested 'made in China' product. I will never walk my dog without thoroughly testing a leash again and will probably go back to using a carabiner as an extra reinforcement on all my leash clips.

I also purchased the martingale-type collar that goes with this leash. I have a 40 pound cowdog mix who pulls pretty hard on walks, and I must say that I had none of the problems the other reviewers experienced. Premier must have fixed the problem, or it may have been unique to the other users. Granted, I haven't tried this leash out with a 90 pound Lab. I give it four starts only because Premier seems to cheap to manufacture their products in the USA. It's good quality for Chinese-made goods, but the metal doesn't have the heavy, Made in the USA feel to it. I still recommend wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS LEASH DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"I originally bought this leash to match the harness which seemed pretty good. My fiance was walking our puppy one night and was getting into the elevator when the leash popped off. He told me this and I got worried. We live in the city and cars do not care nor stop for anything or anyone. I bought another premier leash thinking that maybe the leash was not properly put on or that one might've been defective. Since the company seemed like a reputable one, I bought another leash to replace it. This time I was NOT so lucky. I was walking my baby this morning and the leash just popped off. My baby knowing where the dog run is wanted to go and was running across a large avenue and was struck by a bus. She is now in the ICU of a veterinary hospital.

Even though it's only been a week, this leash has come off of his collar twice. As soon as I got my dog safely home, I sat and figured out what the problem is. The reason it pops off is the ring on the collar twists up against the trigger and pushes it back just far enough to release the ring. It WILL happen eventually if the ring gets in the right position. In my case, I was using this leash with a Gentle Leader collar. The ring on that collar is a very small diameter and round. I think this leash might work better with a collar that had a D-ring of a very thick diameter, but I'm not willing to risk it.I have another leash with a smaller more rounded trigger. I tried the same set up and I was unable to pop the trigger.If you already own this leash, consider replacing it or figuring out a backup method to keep it attached when it does fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong clasp for the application","review":"Years ago I had a saxophone neck strap with that exact kind of clasp on it. After about the third time I caught my 1960 Selmer Mark VI tenor by the thumb hook, I scrapped the strap.

It doesn't feel very durable, the swivel on the clasp looks far too thin and loose to withstand much stress. In addition, the clasp doesn't swivel properly which causes the leash to tangle. Also be advised that the length may be incorrect, I ordered a 6' but it measures 5' 6\\" (which rules it out for obedience compitions). I suspect this is a counterfeit, as the quality is not consistent with other products manufactured by Premier, it lacks the sewn in tag found in Primere's other nylon gear (the leashes pictured on their website also include a tag), and the packaging and labeling looked suspicious. You typically get what you pay for and if something looks too good to be true, then it probably is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't purchased this","review":"Very cheap feeling.

Do not buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"keep out of sunlight","review":"This cover fits well and seems A-OK out-of-the-box, but it doesn't hold up if exposed to direct sunlight. I've had two of these and each one only held up for one year. If you keep your grill in a covered area you should be fine, but mine is exposed all year and this cover just can't hold up. I saved my receipt on the 2nd one and I'm returning it today (at my cost) to get a replacement under warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Debut","review":"This band is GOOD!!! I am a huge fan of Folk/Viking metal, and this hit the spot directly. Masterful drumming, some of the blast beats are so fast it just doesn't sound human. Some great riffs, good usage of folk instruments and melodies. The vocals are also a very high point for the album. They alternate between black, death, clean, and even female. This band just signed a 4 album deal including this one, so we can expect more great things in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vey bad does not clarify much","review":"This book was bad to say the least i found my slef asleep after reading this book! this is a bad but for anyone! reading the book was a waste of my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who exactly thought THIS was a good idea?","review":"This book is just as pathetic as the \\"Beth dies on a waterslide ride\\" in Mexico storyline. If Guiding Light wants to explain the character of Lorelei to its long-suffering fans, maybe they should do it on the show. So far, they haven't. This book is truly a waste of paper. I just picked it up at the library; I'd never, ever buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star too many!","review":"This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've ever read!.Guiding Light unwisely choose one of the most unpopular \\"stars\\" of the show for a book! Those 'trashy romance novels' will seem like Hemingway after reading this!The woman who plays Lorelai isn't a writer either!!I only gave it a star because there's no option for ZERO!! Don't bother buying it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gossip Galore!!","review":"I loved this book-- I breezed through it in one sitting. The romance, the juicy gossip, the passion-- if you're a TRUE Guiding Light fan, you MUST read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing effort","review":"I am an aspiring writer(not yet published)and I have never seen the Guiding Light television show. I purchased this book after seeing Beth on The Early Show. I was intrigued at the idea that someone could write a novel in a week and get it published. That's almost ten thousand words a day.I was all set to pick this book apart paragraph by paragraph. Instead I was treated to an entertaining, easy read. It's not War and Peace, but I was never led to believe it was anything more than a romance novel. I enjoyed the angle of attack of writing in diary form and using the dream sequences.This is a simple, entertaining read and an amazing feat of writing for this first time author. I look forward to what she can produce with a year's worth of effort.Buy it, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"Would have rated lower if I could. Does not provide much new information to what you've seen on the show if you are a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"It's hard to focus on the content of this book - what little there is - when trying to muddle through the grammatical and mechanical errors. (I understand this is written as a diary - but come on! At least insert some personality in order to compensate for poor writing skills!) There's not much of a story to sink your teeth into and there's no continuity between the events of the book and the current storyline that is in place for the character. Ms. Chamberlin is a fine actress whose character is an important part of the show's long history; I'm hopeful she'll keep her day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointing book","review":"I am a huge fan of Guiding Light, but this book does not live up to my expectations. Only a few details were added to what was seen on the show. Where is the emotion and romance that fans have come to expect? I bought this book hoping to read more about Lorelei's relationship with Bill Lewis and really didn't learn anything interesting about Lorelei or Beth. Not worth the money I spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!!!","review":"I bought this book expecting to find out all the juicy details of Beth's life as Lorelei. Instead, all the book describes is a few uninteresting events, most of which we find out later was made up in the mind of the character based on partial similarities to Beth's life. For example, killing the step father and going to New York and all the happenings there. The story line on Guiding Light hints that the diary contains so much more, like a romantic connection to Bill Lewis for example. This book in my opinion is not worth your money. I bought it at the local bookstore and read it in one day, not because it was a good book, but because I wanted to keep reading to get to the good part, which unfortunately never came. I decided it wasn't worth the money and returned it the next day for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tree died for this awful book!","review":"I read this poor imitation of a romance novel with expectations of being entertained and 'moved'. Instead, I found myself making grammatical corrections with a red pen. Who wrote this book? Guiding Light has enough problems - adding a book about the most hated character ever to disgrace the show makes no sense. This Lorelei apparently wrote a book in the 30 day period while her alter ego character, Beth, was on vacation. Fans applauded and celebrated during the 4 week Bethless period - then Lorelei polluted our screens and it was Beth times two. Don't waste your hard earned money on this pathetic attempt at writing. In about 2 weeks the book should be at your local 99 cent store in the 'please take me away' bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really deserves - 100 STARS!","review":"This book that is being promoted as part of GL's 50th Anniversary is the biggest farce. The grammar and sentence structure are at best that of a third grader. The content is incredibly boring and full of run on sentences. I continued reading hoping it would get better. About half way through I gave up. It is a good thing that I split the cost with 10 other people. Of the 10 only 2 thought is was mildly entertaining. Best bet is to skip this book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This bed does not include a frame.They charged $80.00 plus dollars for shipping for something that weighs no more than 15 pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and easy to read.","review":"Liked the short story format. Can pick it up and read it any time. I could identify with the author in her every day experiences of life. There is always an uplifting thought when you come to the end of a difficult experience. Is a reminder that all things happen for a purpose and God is in control even when I'm 'frazzled.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Had My Doubts...","review":"I Had My Doubts, especially since the description does not have PSI RATINGS!!! I had to look on the reviews and bike forums to get more info. I bought the Slick 1.4 for my Cannondale Chase 3 and It is an Awesome tire!!! I wouldnt say I go much faster in these as I Maxed out my speed at 24mph with my old Kenda K-Rads which had a max psi rating of 80 and a consistent speed of 18-20mph. The Main difference here is Im able to consistently maintain a higher speed of 22mph and Above on the Slicks, as oppose to my Kendas which I can only do in Burst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy on a 12' natural gas hose","review":"This is actually a (stated) 12 foot flexible hose for a natural gas grill. $30 is a very good price for a quality hose, which this is.

Otherwise I've no complaints.**Just got round to setting out my gas connection and notice that the 3/8 male-male connection isn't there. So I'm forced to knock off a star to 2*.

And although I do like alot of music from the 80's and 90's, I don't like this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, pleased with this hearth guard","review":"Installation was pretty easy, no complaints there. It clamps on pretty firmly, our little one (9-1/2 mos) has not been able to pull it off, so far. It's perhaps a tad on the pricey side (once you add the extension, as we needed for our long hearth), but that's my only complaint. Overall, if you want peace-of-mind with the sharp corner on your hearth, this guard will give it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cautionary tale, for athletes and everyone else.","review":"This is a great cautionary tale about the dangers of sudden success. A young German cyclist finds his promising cycling career on the skids when he lets fame and fortune get to his head. Other mishaps along the way provide further distractions from his racing career, and he suffers for it. It seems that so many young cyclists are declared \\"The Next Merckx\\" or \\"The Next Armstrong\\", and time and again their potential is never realized. This book helps reveal why. If you want to know what has gone wrong with riders like Jan Ullrich, read this book. Don't think this is an entirely negative book. In fact, the ending is very well done so that everyone wants to see a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but Velcro can scratch under chin","review":"This is a great wearable blanket. It holds up well after numerous washings. However, the Velcro tab that covers the end of the zipper has scratched my baby's chin and neck a few times. She's on the chubbier side (meaning she has some adorable fat rolls under her chin) so perhaps this wouldn't be a problem for a skinnier-faced baby. I continue to use it but I'm careful to close the Velcro tab so little of the Velcro is exposed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"This dvd is great, although not as good as the last. They go to the sea of trees. There aren't any plot twists, but there are a lot of fights. There is still a story. We also get to see an episode for Benitora. This dvd has the best animation to date though. The battles are also clever. One more thing... Mahiro doesn't make that much of an appearence.

Talk about riding the coat tails of another act. Problem is...they don't have the chops. Does the lead guy even need the band, seriously. They don't deserve to mentioned among the indie rock elite. They are basically a bad local band who won the lottery. Last thing, change that horrible name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planned Obsolescence","review":"This smoothie maker works exactly as advertised: it doesn't leak, the motor is powerful, & the pour spout is a nice touch. The problem is, like every other blender, the clutch-gear (the fluted piece of rubber which connects the blades in the container to the motor) wears out. Eventually, the mating gear at the bottom of the container chews a clear path through the clutch-gear. The result is that the motor spins freely but the blades are not engaged & the smoothie maker is useless. I've gone through TWO of these machines. If it were an American brand, you could buy and replace the clutch-gear for $2.98, but I have been unable to find parts for this import anywhere on the web. This smoothie maker would be a bargain *IF* you could replace the part. Since you can't, it's overpriced for the short period you get to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it -- Until it Broke","review":"This smoothie maker was fantastic, until it broke during the fifth time I used it (I only owned it three weeks).

The jar is a very light plastic and the dispensing stem would always cross thread when putting it back together and leaked. If you forget to close the valve after cleaning you end up with a hugh mess to clean up when everything ends up on the counter. After the tenth use my fiance droped the jar and sheared off the valve. We just picked up the cuisinart SmartPower 600 watt blender/food processor I hope this one works better because the jar is glass and I am still wondering if the last breakup was an accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!

I will be taking the second one back tomorrow and asking for a refund (I foolishly didn't save the receipt the first time). They advertise it as having a \\"strong, ice-crushing motor\\" but the truth is that the motor can't hold up to ice-crushing every day. I've been making two smoothies per day to replace meals and apparently that's just too much work for this poor smoothie maker. I went ahead and bought the second one purely on the basis of trust in the manufacturer - Back to Basics - as their wheat grinder is extremely reliable. This smoothie maker is an absolute waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks better then it works","review":"I have to say that I was so excited to buy this blender but it has not lived up to all the features.

The power cord barely fits in a socket and the moment you breathe on it it falls out.But the most annoying thing is the rattling.

My tracklisting is totally off! The CD cover warns one to refer to the booklet inside for correct track listing (which moves song #15 (I Need You) to song #3, thus placing \\"Lost\\" in 4th position. So..when you play the CD the song titles do not match the song that's playing. After song #3 you're always going to be off by one song. SO Annoying. You have to go in and manually change the title off each song in your IPOD. Just another dent in an already poor release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I've been a Faith fan for a very long time and in no way am I the least bit disapointed.

I heard a new song by her today that is just more inane garbage that has no tonal quality, music quality, or merit on any basis in my opinion.

She turned her back on them, and wanted to be a Pop Diva. Her last songs have NOT been doing well at all. She is now at age 40 basically just the Opening Act for her second husband, Tim McGraw. She can not compete with the up and coming 20 year old country singers who are so talented and write all their own songs. She is not even nominated this year for any of the Award Shows. This CD is a desparate act by Faith Hill, as she knows they are calling her Faith over the Hill, and to put those failing 2 songs on a Greatest Hits cd is a rip off to listeners who did NOT go out and buy them before. The choice of songs on this CD is very disappointing and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with other reviews, a dissapointment...","review":"I think most of this has been covered but....1: Many missing hits....(and live versions, UGH)2:Track listing messed up (out of order which gets confusing if you want to go to a particular track and get wrong song)3: I HATE carboard packaging, it's flimsy ect and you don't want to take it in the car or whatever cause it will get messed up.

This one by far is the worst one.The sound quality was terrible. The singing by David Lee Roth was a joke, he would sing a few words of the song and due his famous squeal. The back ground singing was so bad that I couldn't wait for the dvd to be done(my ears were bleeding).On the plus side the guitar work by Eddie was fun to watch to see the different techniques to produce the different sounds. The band also had tons of energy running around every where.But I wouldn't buy this again if given the oppurtunity again. The music quality just wasn't there. It is better to remember this band in your memory and your tapes or cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"This product is the best ever. With my first baby I didn't know about the Lansinoh Disposable Nursing Pads, and would wake up every night soaking wet with breast milk when I would have a let down of milk at night. It was so annoying because I was wearing Gerber washable pads and they just did not help during the night or day. A friend of mine who also just had a baby told me about Lansinoh Disposable Nursing Pads, so I tried them and they are truely wonderful, they do not leak, I never again woke up wet, and my flows were bountiful, and they come individually wrapped, and each pad has an adhesive sticker at the back which actually stays put, unlike other pads, and I just changed them twice a day, once in the morning and once again at night. Don't hesitate to buy these pads, you will not regret it at all, well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"yep... these are the best","review":"Yes, I am posting this under my husbands account:Nursing for five years, tried them all. These are the best for a few reasons:1. contoured, thin and can be worn without seeing two big circles on your chest2. absorbent, no fears of leaking. Similar to disposable diapers in the way they absorb3. comfortable, dry next to the skin unless you really need to change them4. Enough padding to keep the nursing nipples from being headlights.5.The only improvement I can see being made is having two stickers(top/bottom) to secure to bra, the one doesn't work well with my padded t-shirt bras, but just fine with the non-padded ones.Megan Haney"},{"rating":"2","title":"no leaking","review":"I have tried pretty much all brands of nursing pads and these are the best. These are the only pads I could wear all night and all day without leaking even when the milk first came in. If I know a new mom will be breastfeeding I always get these for a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely THE BEST nursing pads around!","review":"I have tried most of the brands (Avent, Medela, Gerber and Dr. Brown's) and Lansinoh has BY FAR the best nursing pads. Thin but they are large enough and most importantly, hold a lot of breastmilk. I never even leak overnight with these. They are by far the best ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"These are not the best nursing pads in my opinion. After having them in for only a little while they start to smell sour and I am not that heavy of a leaker. The smell transfers to my nipples and I can smell it on my baby's face after he's done nursing. They are really good at preventing leakage so I only use them when I go out in public. They are pretty thin but they do crinkle and the adhesive strip does nothing for me. When I am at home I just use washable pads. I had begun to think that I just can't use disposable pads because of the odor but I had a Gerber sample of nursing pads and since I don't leak much I was able to wear them all day. No smell when I finally changed them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rash after 1 day","review":"I love Lanisoh's nipple cream and freezer bags, so I thought I'd try their nursing pads. I was excited about their size - it makes them much easier to hide under clothing compared to most other brands (I've tried Johnson and Johnson, Aveeno, and cotton). However, after just one afternoon, I started getting an itchy rash. I continued using them for another day or so, but the rash only got worse. I haven't had this problem with any of the other nursing pads I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it - very practicle","review":"I tried a couple of brands at first (whatever I had a coupon for) thinking that disposable nursing pads were all the same - NOT SO. These are by far the best. Here are the features I Love!1) Individually packaged, handy for stuffing in purse/diaper bag. Plus, the plastic wrap is recyclable, which makes me feel better.2) Holds a lot of liquid. I have a problem with leaking - a LOT, and these pads hold the liquid so I don't have to worry about leaking on my clothes.3) Thin - though you still have to wear a padded bra so they don't show at all.4) Big disc. Some of the others I tried were small, so there was more chance of leaking.5) Nice material. The material on Johnson's brand actually STUCK to me, which was very painful when I was already sensitive. These don't stick and they are soft.In all - these are the only brand I will continue to purchase while I nurse! Oh, and this package from Amazon is a good deal too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfy enough","review":"I have to update this.. I had opened a box of pads and stored them in my bag and threw the box out... they were NOT Lansinoh pads. I later found the box of Lansinoh under my sink. I do still prefer my First Year pads... but these are a close second.The Lansinoh pads are thin, soft, and absorbent, but I don't remember them ever feeling wet or cold. The First year pads do feel damp at times. But they are still my favorite.The Lansinoh pads are a little more discreat.The First year pads are soothing and more padded.I would give the Lansinoh pads four stars if I could change it. And I'm sorry for the bad review... these pads are very nice. I deleted my former bad review.That said, I do love lansinoh's lanolin! I use it a million times a day! But first Years also makes a spray, which is great if you're too sore to touch when you first start feeding.Anyway, hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I love these pads. I have discovered that when it comes to Breastfeeding essentials, Lansinoh is the way to go. I have tried every brand out there. I work and pump, and am able to use these all day. No changing necessary. Also, these are the only super absorbancy pads that do not show through you clothes. I do wear white shirts all the time to work, and have not had the problem of seeing the pink through it. Guess it just depends on how think your shirts are. Either way, you will not be disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"best brand","review":"I've tried various brands of nursing pads and these are the best (disposable).

Even when full of breast milk they don't feel wet on my skin. I don't use the sticky part to hold it to my bra, i find they bunch when I use it and they stay in place fine without it. On thinner bras, the letters on the back of the sticky part can be visible, but I've never been able to see it through my shirt too, i think you'd be able to see your bra through your shirt if your shirt was that thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great nursing pads at value price","review":"These nursing pads are thin, absorbent, comfortable, and invisible under clothing. I use them daily, and they're great -- I haven't used any other brand. I only wish they were sticky on both halves instead of just one side, but even so, they do stay in place. They come at a great value here at Amazon, especially at the Subscribe & Save price. I highly recommend them to all nursing mothers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pads Out There","review":"These breast pads work the best out of all the other brands.

These thick washable ones or even some of the disposable ones may work for you if you don't have hyperactive let-down. If you do, like me, none of the others will work for you. The Lansinoh disposable are the ONLY ones that will prevent leaking through for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Absorbent, Ultra Thin","review":"This is one of the most comfortable nursing pads I have used. I like the pads because they are:a. Absorbent: Pad absorbs milk right down to its core so you do not feel sticky from milk leakage.b.

Cheaper and thinner than any similar product e.g. Gerber premium contoured nursing pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best nursing pads!","review":"I have tried many brands of nursing pads and these are by far the very best! They are not bulky like other pads. They have a large circumference that provides excellent coverage without showing through clothes. When they get wet, the pads almost gel rather than feel wet to your skin like other pads. Perfect for breastfeeding moms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensitive skin beware!","review":"I guess my skin must be more sensitive than I thought -- I broke out in a really bad rash after using these for a few weeks. It got progressively worse and worse, perfect circles of red, bumpy, itchy, swollen, icky skin that were the exact size of the pad. The nipple and areola seem to be fine, it's my actual skin that's having issues. I have no idea what in the pad could've caused this kind of reaction. I'm a very light leaker, and change pads with every feeding (every four hours). I'm switching over to fabric pads in the hopes that the irritation will go away; in the meantime, I'm using my baby's washcloths as substitutes -- they're soft and much more comfortable, although they do look kinda funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"I found this product not very comfortable to wear because of the edge is rough.

At the beginning of the recipes section, there are diagrams of the angular cut under \\"master cut.\\" The organization could be more intuitive.

Armadillo, doing what he accused the author of doing, wrote a review in pure ingorance, taking ambiguous pieces of humor and taking them directly into technicality, a problem that many readers today seem to have with works of literature. The book is well-written and bases itself solely on what it is supposed to do: get into depth with Bill Parcells in his first year as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys and related material, which it does.The book is still a great read for, if nothing else, a retrospect of the 2003 Dallas Cowboys season, putting inspiration into a story and a team that is now, with the changes the team has gone through in the last three years, insignificant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arghhhhhhhhhh!","review":"The author is biased(he loves Jerry Jones), misinformed(lot of incorrect information), and just plain mean(blasting Jimmy Johnson, Houston, and Dave Campo).

It is amazing that this work was revealed toSr Maraia in the early 1700s and not put into print until 200 yrs later. The actual book was not released until the late 1900s. If you read St Theresa of Avila, you would swear she read the book before talking about the importance of St Joseph.

Some of the designs are not practical, but even so the book still serves as an inspiration.

Its not perfect but the character of Daros makes this a fresh and interesting read.

The book has a nice paced plot, lots of high majic, decent characterization. As I said, it isn't perfect...the women in the story are pretty typical of the women that have gone before in the series but that didn't detract much from the book. If you are a Tarr fan, I don't think this book will dissappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"rocks the box!","review":"carr does a first-rate job of analyzing these small illinois cities. . . which are really the epicenters of the surrounding area.

Baxter is presented as evil personified and all the other characters as pure, innocent beings who fall victim to her coniving, when in fact, they are all more than ready to believe the worst about Bellamy and McDonald, who, in fact, are not innocent - come on, a live-in model with the body of McDonald and our Vargas-like \\"artist\\" beyond suspicion behind closed doors?

By learning why my mother acted as she did sometimes, (badly), and why I, well, pretty much did the same helped us both. What I learned here allowed me to ease my mother's passage, and has in fact inspired me to finally get that nursing degree.

Excellent inetrviews, with Slick Ric, Arn and Tully in good form, straight shooting. Match selection a bit thin for hard core buffs, but still a trenchent reminder of just what makes Flair and Co great. Breakout star in this DVD Arn Anderson- he truly was a sensational wrestler in his day, and Blanchard was a terrific heel as well, his great skills worked with Anderson wonderfully-the tag team you loved to hate (the match vs Nikita Koloff and Sting is fantastic) The combination of the original Horsemen truly lightening in a bottle.The ironic scene is having the king of prelim jobbing bums, Paul Roma (whose selection in the Horseman can most charitably be described as a bizarre mistake)diss Arn and Ric. This will hopefully be the only WWE DVD he ever appears in.On the whole this DVD is a great trip down memory lane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was very good, wish there had been better selection of matches","review":"I really enjoyed the interviews on disc one. Honestly, that is what carried the whole set. I was disappointed that the selection of matches they selected. I mean, with all the legendary matches they had with superstars, they had the nerve to show Tully, Arn, and Ric, vs. Rocky King, Pez Whatley, and the Italian Stallion! People did not buy this set for those type of matches, I certainly did not. And the War Games from 1988?! The 1987 was the original and THE best! They left out how J.J. Dillon throwed champaign in Sting's face, the feuds with Ronnie and Jimmy Garvin (They showed that date with Precious) Dusty Rhodes beating the crap out of Tully Blanchard with a bat, and Tully and Arn's brief feud with the Midnight Express. again, very good, but the match selection could have been a whole lot better.

Jim was held in Japanese POW camps in China, Korea, and Japan. In addition to his eye-witness account of life as a POW, Jim's Journey also relates what happened to him when he was finally liberated and returned to America. It would be thirty-seven years before the U.S. government would official recognize that Jim and other eligible civilian POWs for their contributions to the dramatic defense of Wake Island against insurmountable hostile forces.

So now the mainstream has to try to co-opt the independent music scene (something that has been around forever and spans a huge spectrum of genres) and water it down and label it as a genre itself.So don't be a tool and get this CD. If you want to find out about new and interesting bands just check out Pitchfork or other music sites and listen to the songs they put up or go to Lastfm and listen to tracks from bands that seem interesting to you.Also, the MTV2 logo is on the cover of this CD and I think we all know what that means.

How he goes from country gentleman to a wanted criminal on the run, to toting a Kaloshnikov in the Caucasus is the subject of this masterfully written story - a story about the disorienting power of love and loyalty.

Which is fine, except the book is sold as a thriller, and the blurb is full of praise for the \\"tension\\" and \\"pace\\". Talk about false advertising! The story really only gets going in the last 70 pages or so, and then it suddenly ends without any resolution.Even considered as a character study with no pretensions as a spy thriller, this book disappoints. It's far too full of annoying \\"What-ho old chap\\" overgrown \\"public\\" (i.e. private) schoolboys, and the main characters are totally unsympathetic; Cranmer is a sad sack, Pettifer (encountered only in flashback) is a narcissistic boor, and Emma (likewise only seen in flashback) is a vacuous airhead.Thirty years ago, Le Carre might have taken this premise and made something worth reading out of it. Once every hundred pages or so, there is a flash of his former skill, which only makes the book more disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally it's over, thank god!","review":"I almost skip every other line in the final 50 or so pages. And in the end, I really don't know what has happened. I give credit for the author to fully develop two characters. Emma remains the same woman who comes from the dark with no background, no family and past history from beginning to end.What is the book really about? I don't know.

The way it does so is to show how to play a hand before talking about bidding.I remember how frustrated I was when I first learned how to play bridge: I had a bunch of rules dumped on me about how to bid, and had no conception of whether or not a bid made sense beyond seeing whether it followed those seemingly arbitary rules. If I had read this book then, it would have let me avoid all that frustration.There is one point about which prospective readers of this book should be aware: It is based on British bidding style rather than American style.

I was looking forward to learning more on how to share this message with non-believers and those who are anti-organized religion. However, in the first two chapters, I was quite offended for those who have not yet seen His glory. Our Maker created a world in which he gave us free-will and in that free-will we are able to choose to seek and see Him or turn our backs.

So much was just inappropriate; for instance, at one point he softly plays a piano for several minutes. Perhaps he is a wise man, but he does not communicate any of that wisdom here.

Big disappointment! As others have stated, the bubbles do NOT come out unless the handle is pulled all the way down and then held there for a second, and my son was terribly frustrated by that. Also, once the poor child is lucky enough to actually release some bubbles, only a handful come out (often less). In addition, we went through the bubble bottle in two days just through attempting to make it work, and later saw that it had leaked all over the bottom of the toy. This caused nothing but disappointment for both of us! He got much more fun out of a simple bubble wand that I used to blow bubbles for him which cost just 39 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing toy","review":"The concept of this toy is good but its performance was very disappointing. I bought this toy for a toddler preschool class and not one child could master it. Even when I used it bubbles only came out about every third or fourth push of the handle. The handle must be held down a few seconds to make bubbles come out and the kids let go too soon. Also, the children wanted to look down the hole and watch the bubbles come out and then the bubbles get in their face and eyes. I sent this toy back."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I would have read these reviews first~!","review":"I bought this as an impulse buy as an Easter gift for my nephew. I had high hopes for the thing.

It was so sad and I honestly was pretty aggravated that something was so useless.Please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My two year old loves bubbles, and wants to do everything herself, but is always spilling the soap. So I was excited when I saw this toy! When I bought this initially I assumed that particular one was broken and I exchanged it for another which was similarly broken. It was a disappointing birthday gift for my two year old. Upon pushing the lever there is simply a buzzing sound, no bubbles, maybe *one* bubble squeezes out after 20 tries. This is the worst toy I've ever seen. I can't believe it is still on the market!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Although my daughter is able to press the handle down to get the motor working, she only gets one bubble at a time. I have also tried to use this, and I get the same result. She loves bubbles, and gets very frustrated with the fact that she does not see any. She has also figured out that if she tips it upside down, the bubble solution will come out, and that is more fun to play with. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and I regret not reading the reviews written on this product sooner. I would not have purchased it if I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has been wonderful for my autistic son!!","review":"I have a 3 year old autistic son. It is very hard to find toys for him that he can learn how to play with appropriately. He is very motivated by bubbles and loves this toy!!!! It is the first \\"cause and effect\\" toy he has been able to master. He was able to learn how to do it with me only having to show him a few times. This was a breakthrough for him. The only thing is if you want it to blow a lot of bubbles, you have to put the Gazillion brand bubble solution in it. It is a thicker solution and works much better in this toy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with toddlers who cannot blow bubbles on their own yet and especially to children with disabilities!! The smile on my son's face now that he is finally able to play with something on his own and blow bubbles with his older brother is so WONDERFUL!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"This bubble machine is a complete hit in our house.

It is supposed to be leak proof for the active toddler but when my 15 month old daughter tipped it a certain way, the liquid bubble soap spilled out. Also, when it sat on our coffee table overnight, a huge puddle was underneath by morning. Hard to say if my daughter would have enjoyed it long term since it only lasted one day.

Watch the clip called \\"Flames on the side of my face\\". It's only about a minute long, and once it's over you will have seen the only funny thing in this movie. \\"Clue\\" squanders an above average cast on a painful exercise in mugging and door-slamming that's like Mel Brooks on a really off day. Maybe it's a good movie for eleven year-olds who are also fans of the board game, but everyone else should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Unhelpful Votes. In Fact, I Yearn For Them...","review":"...and it's a good thing too because I know this review will get slammed with them.A good, no, make that a GREAT cast is utterly wasted (not to mentioned completely embarrassed) in this dreadful piece of movie making which, judging by all the rave reviews it is getting here, proves once again that the lowest common denominator will win out.This is little more than lowbrow slapstick in the guise of using a classic board game as a gimmick to sell it. The characters are so flat, so one dimensional, that even the superb cast members playing them (Eileen Brennan and the wonderful Madeline Kahn are the most noteworthy) can't breath much life into them and the writing of the script comes across like it was done by a computer that had every single slapstick routine programed into it. The end result is a movie utterly lacking in any sense of creativity or imagination.Dreadful and simply quite painful to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a Clue","review":"One of the moives that was actually good in the eighties and got very little respect.

Except for Yvette; she's just dumb. Mrs. White(who blessed us with the aforementioned \\" \\") and Ms. Scarlett are the most interesting. We like the \\"Life Would Be a Dream\\" scene. This video is definetly more captivating than the board game. \\"I am your singing telegram....bang\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Goofy, ok movie","review":"The boardgame is brought to life. Movie is exactly like it. Pretty decent cast. A comedy that isn't funny, but just kind of goofy and a good watch. Good movie to pop in as background for whatever else you want to do. Not a classic, not extraordinary, but gets the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael McKean as Mr. Green","review":"For those of you who don't know, Michael McKean also played Lenny Kosnowski on Laverne and Shirley. Catch him in all of his movies. Maybe he'll be a little bit more appretiated. He has been in such classic films as \\"This Is Spinal Tap.\\" As far as the movie \\"Clue\\" goes, I have two opinions. 1: parts of this movie make you want to wonder why you are even laughing, and may cause you to think twice about even watching it. And 2: wonderful performances make this movie worthwhile, and the end is a good surprise. Perhapes the best scene is the end, when we find out the truth about Mr. Green (Michael McKean is, by the way, one of my favorite actors). A good investment for certain types, but don't expect a live version of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite movie of all time.....","review":"Both Tim Curry and Madeline Kahn give one of the best performances of their careers in this one. I was always a fan of the board game, but when this movie came out, I went wild. I already have worn out one VHS copy from watching so many times. Madeline's facial expressions, witty dialogue, and incredibly timely vocalisms just make me burst into laughter every time I watch it. the ending when the butler is reliving the entire evening for the guests is hysterical......and evette smiled (ding)! :)A Must have! An all star cast, and the three different endings give the viewer something funny to look forward to each time. Personally I think that none of the endings is how it really happened :) And if you watch closely, you can figure out the REAL ending that they SHOULD have filmed :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLUE RULZ!","review":"Clue is a riot from start to finish.

Having been a big fan of the board game, I went to the movie the week it came out. I ended up going to it several times. When the film originally aired in the theater, they randomly showed 1 of 3 different endings during each showing. This DVD has all 3 endings for your choosing. Even though the critics did not rate this film highly, I thought it was wonderful. The set was brilliant. . . exactly what you would expect out of a great murder mystery.

Over time, it was lost among moving, etc... I thought about it from time to time. Finally I invested in this DVD version. Transfer to DVD is great, I didn't notice any flaws in video or audio, title menu is workable and usable on either a PC-DVD, XBOX or DVD Player.This is a great family movie for families with kids over 10, I would say. It insinuates some sex and killing, but is done so in a humerous way that is noticeably fake and done just for the humor.I loved this when I was a kid, and it was great now as an adult.I would recommend to anyone who wants a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whodunnit?","review":"This a film based of the famous broad game. It was about six individualls who are invited to the Body Mansion to discuss a threat to all of them. Mr.Body is planning to blackmail all of them, for each has a dirty secret. Mr. Green(Micheal McKean) is a F.B.I agent who is an homosexual. Col. Mustard(Martin Mull) a war profiter who was working on a fusion bomb. Ms.Scarlett(Lesley Ann Warren) is a prositute in Washington. Mrs. Peacock(Eileen Brennan) her husbend is a corrupt sentor. Professer Plum is a U.N shrink who had an affair with his patitent. And Mrs. White(Madline Kahn) who's husbend was a nuclear fissist. And Wadsworth(Tim Curry) the butler who invitied them all. Then all of a sudden every one who is in the house and who comes in dies.

I wouldn't go out of my way to buy or rent it though.The acting is good and there are definitely some funny parts, but at times I felt myself becoming more annoyed than humored. The pace of the movie seemed to bounce between manic fast and very slow. There were a few times when I got the humor and thought to myself \\"Not funny, boring.\\"Not to generalize, but I think if you like Monte Python, you will like this. I don't like either one much.

Martin Mull, Christopher Lloyd, Madeleine Kahn and Lesley Ann Warren star as the roles in the game-Col. Mustard, Mr. Peacock, Ms. Plum, and so on. They're very much stock characters, so Curry is left to improvise. \\"Clue\\" is set during the McCarthy era, and the Red Scare is a theme. Were the screenwriters attempting something \\"daring\\" during the Reagan era? Trying to make a profound statement with a campy movie... doesn't quite work.\\"Clue\\" relies on gimmicks;namely,Curry,and its \\"three alternate endings.\\" For a time,it's engrossing,just as a concept.

You people who are reading this, I'm not telling anybody not to buy this DVD. Even though it's low on extras, it still deserves a home.

The top notch comedic performances of Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Martin Mull, et. al. never fail to get me laughing and to make a long story short (too late!) I couldn't wait for the movie to reach this format (DVD). My expectations may have been a little too high though. I really never expected the sound to be SATNDARD MONO. I have a top of the line in-home theater system and to hear all the sound come from the front center cube was no small shock, it wouldn't even simulate surround sound well. The picture is crisp with only slight artifacts to be noted. The bonus material...hello... what bonus material! The theatrical preview hardly counts as bonus material.

Mustard: Please, there are ladies present.SEE THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing book about a great topic","review":"This book is a valiant attempt to cover an interesting topic but in the end it just comes up short. It is very badly written and the prose is so academic that it does not even hold a candle to other books on the subject. (see any of Peter Hopkirk books). The book goes into voluminous detail that the only advantage is you get it in one book instead of five smaller ones. Overall though I would recommend you go with the five smaller ones which give you more detail and a better written story. Meyer just could not pull it off on this one which is unfortunate for such an interesting topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tournament of Shadows","review":"Because I'm a Great Game fan I was quite disappointed with the book. Too many names, too much useless stuff, too much gossip and too negative about Swen Hedin. I appreciate his research but he didn't stay focused on the Great Game, he was all over the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripping Good Read","review":"Fans of the Ripping Good Yarns school of historical writing (as in James/Jan Morris) will find this a pleasurable way to spend a few evenings. It goes very quickly, despite its heft."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of adventure stories!","review":"This is a most entertaining telling of the history of Central Asia, and what was called \\"the great game\\". The game was simply defined as keeping Russia out and Britain in control of the region. It is fascinating to learn the history of Afghanistan and the massive British defeat, and later the history of Tibet. Each chapter is like a short history lesson, or short story, illustrating via a principle player the actual events that lead us to the present day. The books structure reminds me of Allan Moorhead's two books on the Nile (The While Nile, The Blue Nile). Recommended to anyone who wants both a good overview of the Central Asian history of European empire that also in part reads like an adventure book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The best and most comprehensive Great Game book that I've read so far. It's very well written and fairly easy to read. Due to it's comprehensive coverage, it tied a lot of loose ends for me. A lot of characters that I had read about from other books are finally put into place in the grand scheme of things.At 631 pages including notes, this isn't for beginners but someone wanting a more indepth look. And for serious readers, this book is an excellent starting point for doing more serious research on the characters and events.Really, the only thing I had wished for was more maps, but I solved that by having an atlas next to me.A good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book on geographic exploration with no maps ?","review":"While Tournament of Shadows alternates between chronological accounts central Asian exploration and mini-biographies of the explorers, the book always revolves around the Great Game, or quest for central asia. This makes it all the more surprising that there are only a few, sparsely annotated maps throughout. The text frequently references cities or geographic features that are NOWHERE to be found on any of the maps, a particular source of frustration and (I think) an indication of very sloppy preparation. The front- and end-matter maps (which are identical, unfortunately) are blury and bleed into the spine, rendering certain important locations unreadable. The text itself is an enjoyable read but light-weight analytically (more of an extended time-line than a serious analysis), and the lack of maps is extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan-tastic","review":"I was surprised at the readability of this work. I was expecting a large and tediously detailed work, but my goodness what a whopping good read. The reader benefits from the fact that both authors have had experience in journalism and training in research at the graduate level. This makes for a detailed and exciting blend of prose and detail. I highly recomment this work for anyone interested in 19th Century Imperialism and background on the current woes of South Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"out-of-print great story","review":"It would have been nice to know that this is the British English version of the story my kids know well enough to complain about any changes.

She asks for it every night for reading time. She loves to say \\"Fix IT Duck\\" at the appropriate points in the story. The illustrations are great and add to the story. Make sure to pay attention to the pictures even on the non-worded pages (especially page1). I think this is the second book in a series of books about the Duck, Frog, Goat, and Sheep. I really like most of the books the the author has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fix-It Duck","review":"A great read-aloud for preschool through 2nd grade (at least). I love the way Jez Alborough has used the pages so creatively by varying the drawing \\"frames\\" and the text \\"boxes.\\" Kids will love how Duck fearlessly bumbles through trying to fix one thing and then another, making things worse and worse. The tension builds throughout the book until the surprise ending. Make sure you carefully examine the two-page spreads at the beginning and end of the book. The first sets the stage for what's to come, and the last one gives closure to the story. It reminds me of WATCH OUT, BIG BRO' IS COMING! by the perspective used in the pictures, and the surprise ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite, my childrens favorite.","review":"This book is wonderful - it has my 3 and 4 year old girls rolling with laughter. They know all the rhymes and and sometimes say them before me.We have had it almost a year and they still want to read it all the time. Fortunately it reads aloud so well that I am happy to oblige."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Duck Wreaks Havoc Again","review":"After leaving his friends stuck in the muck, Duck is living in the same rural area as Sheep, Frog and Goat. Unfortunately for them, Duck now fancies himself a handyman. However, his absent-minded ways make him more of a menace than a helper. In fact, his \\"Fix-It\\" skills are less than even any shade tree mechanic. Like with the first book, Alborough manages to surprise with a clever twist, that on second reading his foreshadowed throughout the book. Once again the clever story line is complemented extremely well by the outstanding illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeating pages","review":"There are two earlier pages that repeat later on thereby robbing us of two pages (an ruining the rhyme).I just saw that another person had a problem with pages being out of order.

Unless you are an extremely experienced baker you will be disappointed in the results. Nearly all the recipes I have tried needed adjustment to avoid failure.I have years of experience as a baker and have really struggled with this book because the pictures are so beautiful, but it is incredibly obvious that Dannenberg did not test the recipes.

This is not a book for beginning bakers, though. It requires some experience with home baking and patience because some of the quantities given are not exact and need a bit of adjusting and the essembly procedures need improvisation as well. Because many of the recipes are so involved, it takes some dexterity to reach the desired look and taste of the pastries. But when it works it is superb. I enjoyed the challenges, but buyers should beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"The book is probably the best Ophthalmology text ever written.

This is a excellent text. I think the organization is good, but that there is definitely room for improvement. The pictures are good, and the text is excellent, but could be slightly more concise. For these reasons, in addition to the very large size of the book, whenever there is something I need to look up, I generally reach for the Kanski textbook first as I find the pictures are just as good, the text slightly more concise but just as informative, and it is definitely easier on my back. I would recommend this book, but would look at Kanski too before you make your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it for Optometry","review":"This book is way too much. We were required to get it for Disease class and I regret it! This book has entirely too much information and goes into too much detail.

Bottom line, too much information for most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy install, but be careful!","review":"These Perrycraft/Dynacraft roof rails were moderately easy to install on my 1999 Toyota Rav4, and look great.The catch, you must be very careful during install.

After that comes a discussion of Shinto and Buddhism.In the next chapter, we a long and fascinating look at the macaques. I think this is the best part of the book.

Standard women's socks often cramp her toes and leave compression marks around her ankles or lower calf, depending on how high the socks rise on her leg.

If the military wasn't your cup of tea or you don't want to do it then please do not crush the people that make the decision to serve. This film is extremely offensive to people that serve/have served. Maybe there are some who are not proud of things they have done, but there are people that have had to kill to save theirs or their buddies lives. Going to war is not about killing innocent people, it is about serving your country and carrying out whatever it is they ask of you so that a mass draft does not have to be reinstated. This film is propoganda, hippie, and straight unamerican trash. Today's military is filled with affluent, intelligent individuals who have made a conscious decision to go do whatever their county asks of them.

It's not only a good introductory history of World War II in Europe, but an invaluable battlefield guide. If you're going to take a tour of WWII battlefields in western Europe, buy this book. The driving directions are superb. However, the maps are somewhat sparse and some of the route numbers have changed since the book was published, so you'll need to buy a good road atlas.

The book's title implies that Tolkien may have incorporated borrowed elements in his work. That's hardly news. What drew me was the variety of stories and their undemanding lengths. A perfect bedside addition and great inducer of sleep. This book is also my introduction to the lyrical writings of George MacDonald and Frank Stockton; the author of 'The Golden Key' and 'The Griffin and Minor Canon'. 'The Golden Key' is one of the most atmospheric fantasy piece I've come across.

I bought this movie because I had read the book with my 7th grade reading class. There was NO WAY I could show this movie to them. I knew it had a R rating but figured I would take the chance. Besides all the profanity, the movie DID NOT follow S.E. Hinton's story line. Emilio Estevez (he wrote the screen play ) defiated from it in so many ways. There are too many to list now. Even the ending was totally NOT the book. The character of Mark was played by Emilio and he \\"over acted\\" big time. I was not impressed by him. Kim Delaney is a great actress but the character of \\"Cathy\\" was NOT as protrayed in the book. The character of Bryon was by far the closest of all of the characters. Oh, and the character of Charlie....it was played by Morgan Freeman. Need I say more? This is definitely the movie that upholds the cliche'....THE BOOK IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!

I will never waste my money on or embarrass my students with anything scripted by him again. Too bad I did not read their reviews before I ordered or preview it before I showed it to my ninth graders (who are learning English as a second language). Their is no excuse or justification for such a rotten rendition of book used in schools for the past twenty years.

Maybe a note that the DVD is not recommended for classroom use would be helpful. In addition, it did not follow the plot in the book.

Okay, it's a common place, but i think that books should like the apps: to be updated every X months.This is the case of this book. I humbly think that this book is fabulous, but!! In some chapters lacks to be up to date. Security is explained without the new xml notations, who made me to rewrite when I reached a point where I didn't found solutions for the problems I had even on internet!! The wiring of the security isn't explained now as simple beans, but with the new xml notation that this book lacks.On the other side, it explains very well what is spring for and why you do need Spring.

I specially like the authors put the Spring MVC to relative late chapter, after detailed discussing of the framework as a whole.

They couldn't have.The explanations are fair, but the poor quality of the source examples makes you wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manning has serious problems with code examples","review":"This is my 3rd Manning published book. They ALL lack sufficient code examples. It's almost as if they don't expect you to EVER try anything out on your own. It's ridiculous. These books are great to read and to learn from, but only if you want to do lots of work to get their horrible code examples working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on Spring","review":"This book is very excellent! It covers a lot of aspects of Spring and any programmers with decent java skills can learn a lot. I especially like the humorous approach on the knights and Spring Idol.

Although I've read only the first 4 chapters (Spring Core), I can see how this book will help me to start writing web applications using Spring right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this book","review":"Pass on this book unless you're a seasoned Spring Developer. There are no examples to follow. There is a lot of detail about Spring, but if you're learning, you won't be able to follow along very easily as there are no practical examples in the book. You can download the source code of a fully built complex project, but staring at the source code isn't going to help most people trying to learn Spring. This is probably a good book to supplement a different book about Spring. Do not use this as your first Spring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be nice to have the code working ...not trying to debug it","review":"When I first started I thought the book really fulfills my expectations. Well ...that was until I reached chapter 5. From that point on the code is completely messed up.

I am very disappointed because the book without the code is...useless, at least for me. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally useless","review":"This is the worst book of all I have ever purchased. I have not been able to find anything useful from this book with the following three basic problems:1) Examples don't work and the author is not available to provide any help.2) Severely outdated - at least two major releases behind.3) The author keeps talking nonsense without being able to focus on the real hard core of Spring.The author seems to enjoy telling what he knows about Spring, but doesn't care about what a reader would learn and be able to apply to his/her project immediately. If you have trouble falling into sleep, you don't need to buy sleeping pills -buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book to get into Spring but very poor examples","review":"I have read 2 chapters so far. This book covers the modules that every developer needs to know about Spring. The think that I didn't like about the book is the silly examples the writer used.

SHould i learn it for running the sample, so i have to buy another book in order to read this book? I would be better if it is just eclipse project with maven.

I owned (and enjoyed) the 2nd edition and hoped this book would be up to the same standard. It is not. I have been developing with Java since version 1.0 and I have been using Spring on a number of projects. I had hoped this book would give me a deeper understanding, especially for Spring use with web-based applications. After chapter 5 I found the book very fragmented... There were a few \\"nuggets\\" of wisdom in there but never a complete picture of an example that worked. So, being the person that I am, I decided to just grab the source code and figure it out on my own... Bad idea... It can possibly be done but you have to enjoy searching the web for all the missing pieces. Frankly I just don't have the time.

But at no point do you actually get walked through setting up a spring project say in NetBeans or Eclipse.Thats the perspective throughout the book. You move from chapter to chapter being presented with a new angle of the framework and a high-level example of how its done but no \\"Sit down and build this in your IDE, then hook it up using the spring feature to actually SEE it work\\".Good book, but I know that I will need some additional info to be able to start using the framework."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Idea.","review":"Spends too much time ranting about knights tales than actually teaching you simple concepts in Spring that you can use.

The colours were so washed out that all reds were pink and everything had a sepia tinge. Also the film quality made everything look ghostly and insubstantial so it was virtually unwatchable. If the quality of this video had been acceptable, what I could actually see of it would have been well worth watching. I will not bother to watch it again as you strain your eyes trying to make things out.

A unique and satisfying novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"French Audio CD","review":"Although I believe the sequence of the training is good, I would have liked the CD to strictly follow the book. The tape also uses several French speakers and they all pronounce the words very differently, which to a beginner like me, is very confusing. The intent was good as they wanted folks to hear people with French accents from all over the world; however, to someone hearing and learning the language for the first time, I personally found this to be frustrating. For my level of expertise (none), I needed consistency in pronunciation and pronunciation I could understand so I could repeat. Folks who already are familiar with the language, may find this CD useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"This series (I also have the Spanish in 10 minutes a day) is wonderful. I have studied French in the past, and had a good grasp of the language. However, I rarely have an opportunity to use it. When my son began learning French at school, I bought this for us both to listen to on our long car rides to and from school. It has helped him get a grasp of the language, and allowed me to recall and recite what I already knew. I like that it begins with the most commonly used verbs. This is essential for someone travelling to a French-speaking country who wants to be able to have simple exchanges in French. Make no mistake; this program does not replace a serious study of the language for those who intend to become fluent in French. However, it is a great jump-start to learning French, and will make one quickly feel proficient as a tourist or a beginning student."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Thunder Dragon Kingdom adorned with sandalwood","review":"Lonely Planet is unbelieveable! They continually pump out the HIGHEST quality guidebooks, and they've done it again with this edition covering Bhutan. I have spent a good portion of my life researching, and hording information on Bhutan, and have found Lonely Planet's guidebook to contain everything and more that the traveller could ever want...with two exceptions. I think that the lack of the U'cen script in the language chapter is a serious mistake. Lonely Planet has the capacity to print in the U'cen script as they did so in their Tibet edition. My other qualm is with the sparse coverage of the smaller and admittedly FAR less visited dzongkhags (districts) (i.e., Daga, Samdrup Jongkhar, Pema Gatshel, Zhemgang, Tsirang, etc.). Lonely Planet, resolve these issues and your book will be the best it could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightfull and Practical","review":"If you desire to understand better the principles and processes involved with the preparation and delivery of the expository sermon, this is the book you need.Athough the book is not a \\"How To\\" for expository preaching, it does give helpful advise for the study and preparation of the expository sermon. Never before did I realize all of the different elements that are involved in accurately proclaiming the Word of God.

For anyone with back or hip problems, it is a great help. The broom is lightweight but adequate and the dustpan seals well with the floor.

It is made for use as an amusement park grounds keeper would use. The short broom is made that way intentionally to enable one to walk around with the broom in one hand, pan in the other, spot sweeping debris into the pan. Its' function is not made to sweep a complete floor although with effort I imagine one could though. Buy a regular sized broom for that task. Like all other Oxo products great value, quality made, very functional,and very durable. I swear by all their products and have yet to be disappointed with anything I have purchased from kitchen utensils, trash cans, to garden tools. A great company with great products. Not like some of the other guys crap I mistakenly purchased in the past and had to dump within a weeks use! Oxo is money well spent in my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and convenient","review":"The upright part is really important. A little hard to hold onto the broom handle but it can be done and certainly beats having to bend down with a little brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broom too short, dustpan doesn't stay flush with floor","review":"This combo looked like another great design from OXO. Unfortunately, it has 2 critical flaws.1) The broom is waaay too short. I'm 5'5\\" and my girlfriend is 5'3\\", both of us cannot use this broom without bending over completely. It's just flat out too short.2) The dustpan doesn't stay flush with the ground unless you step on it, which makes for very slow cleaning.I know how much weight the OXO brand carries, but pass on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second hand","review":"This item came to us with one inch all around of the broom part discolored and dust hanging from it in used condition.

Remember that dirt line that never disappeared no matter how much you swept? Well you won't have that problem any longer with this set. It gets rid of it the first time around.Some people have complained that it's a bit short, but it's okay for me because I'm short. It's still better than bending down and picking up the garbage any day. This is a great set for those quick pick-me-ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Kids!","review":"I am 5'6\\" and this is WAY too short for me to use. It has been great for the kids to sweep under the kitchen table though. I think they made this as a toy and didn't state that in the description.

And the storage is great...the way the broom attaches to the dustpan is genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Dustpan","review":"Tho OXO is a respected name, this dustpan set doesn't quite make it. The lip on the pan is too thick and does not pick up the sweepings well. Further, after a few uses, the flimsy dustpan flaps open and close at will when I go to empty the pan. Better to get a set that doesn't have the 'upright' feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sized just right FOR A CHILD!","review":"For the price I paid for this broom and dustpan set, I thought I'd actually be getting an adult sized broom set. When I opened the box I was in shock at how short it is. I STILL have to bend over since the broom set is so tiny. I am not exaggerating when I say it is the perfect size for my 3 year old Son. I am very dissapointed with this purchase.

Both were about hip-height, so they were hard to maneuver. In addition, the bristles were damaged upon arrival. I ended up returning the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far si good","review":"We bought this broom/dustpan for our RV. This is our first trip using it. I especially like the front edge. It really does direct everything to go into the dustpan not under it. I also like that it can hang up as space in an RV is limited. When it arrived it did not seem asstrong as I had hoped, but as I said in my title......so far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Height is the killer!","review":"The broom seemed like a convenient purchase and I thought since I'm only 5'2\\" it would be fine, but the height of the broom is so very uncomfortable! I have to hunch over to properly maneuver the broom. I do not recommend this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First return ever to Amazon","review":"If you're looking for a whisk broom with a longer handle or have just a small area, then this would be great. The product seems fine. I, however, was looking for a full sized broom.I already have this packed up to go back, so I can't take my tape measure to it, but the 9.3 inches width (in the description) must be the width of the dust pan. You can kinda extrapolate how wide the broom is since it fits inside the dust pan. And, as several people have mentioned, the handle is way too short for anything but a quick spot job.The reason for my one star is really to address Amazon's description rather than the product. I think if they made it a little clearer then all the ratings might be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Stay Upright Very Well","review":"I would not purchase this product. It is made for a shorter person like most of the reviewers have said, but that is not the reason I don't like it. It does not stay upright very easily. I store it on the floor in a closet and almost every time I open the door the broom and dust pan handle fall to the floor. It is very annoying that I cannot get the dust pan handle and broom to stay upright the majority of the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Size","review":"I should have paid more attention to the size of this item. It is very small. I am 5'4\\" and it's quite short for me to use. The broom also has a very small head. It is otherwise nice, and I'd love it if it were about 30% larger. As it is, it won't be sufficient to be the primary broom to clean my house, which is all wood floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical \\"Good Grips\\" quality","review":"I am a big fan of Oxo's Good Grips product line, and have been known to purchase items I have no actual need for, figuring if I ever do have a need, I want the best.This particular item, however, truly disappoints. The plastic tray is very flimsy. The hinging mechanism on the tray is not very good--I think it is intended to allow the tray to lock in either an open or closed position, but does neither very well. The center of gravity of the handles is such that it tends to tip over unless balanced perfectly or left leaning against a wall.I plan to keep my eyes open for a reasonably-priced commercial version to replace this as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...if you're three and a half feet tall","review":"I, like the majority of the world's adult population, am taller than 3 1/2 feet. I don't know what kind of moron designed this broom, but I'd have to walk on my knees in order to use it properly. It's my fault that I didn't notice the height of the broom on the product page, but a company putting out a broom this short needs to have their development team fired.The only bright spots are that it takes up very little room and that the dustpan lies so flush to the floor that there isn't an annoying line of dust left over once the dust pile has been swept into the pan.My five year old loves it, so I guess I'll keep it, but the size is truly ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short for even a short person","review":"Not worth it - I'm just over 5 ft tall and this broom is too short for me. Does a decent job of catching debris - but too hard on the back and hands because of the way you have to hold it to get leverage. Upside - good for spaces like behind the couch, on the side of the refrigerator, etc. I would not buy this again and now the search continues on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not expect a child's broom","review":"I should have read the reviews.

Oxo Good Grips Upright Broom and Dustpan Set, Silver","review":"I just had hip replacement surgery and needed a way to clean up stuff that I dropped (or my parrot does) that are too large for a small vacuum cleaner. I can't bend except a little and while this doesn't have a LONG handle, it's long enough to keep bending to a minimum. The pan's holding area is also nice and stiff so stuff doesn't just wiggle or fall out, and the broom bristles nice and firm. I was SOOOOO glad to get it yesterday and put it to use immediately. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"way too short","review":"i had to bend over to use it and i'm only 5'4\\". Even my 10 year old daughter felt it wasn't tall enough.

I'm not talking about squeaking on the floor, they actually squeak somewhere within the shoe/boot. It seems like it is coming from between the leather part and the sole.

Comfort is fantastic (better than even the rest of the already good line of Dr. Martens stuff), which is why it ended up an everyday boot rather than a specialty item. I even had a pair of dress pats tailored to them! Another good perk was that they're very easy to get on and off.

Most of them are certainly not the sort of works you can take home from the gallery - the heaviest weigh in at about a ton!- but the combination of colour & structure are unique - & it's good to see that recently he is finding a considerable following outside Belgium, France & the Netherlands.

(2) The \\"Grammatik\\" (Grammar) sections are nice, in that they succinctly lay out the finer points of grammar using both text and example sentences. (3) In the \\"Das passende Wort\\" sections, readers are taught the differences in context among many German verbs and nouns - especially helpful when German has several different words for a single English word.My only complaint with this book is that, as a student, it would have been helpful from time to time to have more examples here and there of some of the trickier grammar and context material.

They have strong opinions, many of which are out of fashion these days, which are tempered by their good humor and camaraderie. This is a terrifically candid look into the lives of a group of men who have lead full lives and are comfortable with who they are and what they've accomplished. They certainly could serve as a model for how to grow old gracefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and Introspective","review":"Wasn't quite sure what to expect.Read the reviews on the back cover, and the parts on the inside cover.

This one written for a lesser Hitchcock film, not a great favorite of the director's fans, features some incredibly simple chamber-music orchestration: often only a few instruments at a time, clarinets, string pizzicato effects, all underlining the tension of the story, but never overpowering it. This soundtrack proves that the simplest of musical effects can often be just as effective as a huge Max Steiner operatic orchestration. Hermann never tried to upstage Hitchcock; he always supported him. As Rota is to Fellini, Hermann is to Hitchcock. The perfect marriage of image and sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cast had their moments","review":"What happened? Tony had the lights, cameras, casting action..

The author, an elder's wife, uses Scripture, personal examples, and worksheets to help readers see the true condition of their spirits. She also teaches the meanings behind the words of several key Bible passages as they apply to our relationships with others so that we can apply those passages properly. Although this book is very helpful in dealing with the marriage relationship, I find it to be convicting as I examine my relationships with other women, as well. More than once, the teachings it presents have stopped me from reacting to a situation and making it worse! Ms. Lefler does a great job of not being preachy or condescending; she simply comes across as a friend who cares and wants to help you have a spirit that (as the subtitle says) is \\"of great worth to God\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle & Quiet Spirit","review":"Great reading.

The material is pretty heavy without the cheep vinyl feel of many of these. We have a charcoal grill and it has a nob on the chimney that has poked thru all the other covers we've tried but a few months in this one is still holding up. I was a bit disappointed with the velcro that is meant to hold the cover on. The wind can still get it off rather easily. We generally push it against the railing to hold the cover but if you don't have something to pin it against you might end up loosing it.

They weren't! First of all, when using them on an Xbox game, it GREATLY slows down the game, to the point that it is unplayable. When I tried to use these in my laptop, they were a no go! It wouldn't even read the disk and it sounded like my laptop was an airplane taking off due to my cd drive frantically trying to read the disk to no avail. On a desktop computer, it will read some data disks with the d-skin on it, but it's slow. You won't be watching an mpg or vcd movie with the d-skin on for instance. I don't know how well they work on a cd player with musical cd's, but anything else is definately out. Since I am an mp3 man, I have no need to play music cd's, so I haven't tried them.

The DVD would play from that point without another problem. We did try the disc in several differenct models of DVD players and they all froze at the same place.

I believe it is by-far a healthier alternative. The ingredients are very straight forward (natural and recognizable, not chemical), which I appreciate.

Boy, did I waste my money. It costs nearly $30 for only 16 oz, which is barely a quart. Also, each serving has only 11 grams of protein. Most supplements give you more protein for less money. Even though whey protein isn't the best thing for your heart, soy protein powders are also much cheaper and deliver more protein per serving. If you really want to go raw on the protein, eating raw garbanzo beans is a much better way to go. Garbanzo beans are inexpensive and have more protein per serving than this supplement.

This one however, did not work. The solder tip screws in fine to the threaded barrel, but when you want to make precise cuts into styrofoam as I do, you physically CANNOT attach the knife attachment to the threaded barrel. This is supposed to work the same way a knife tightens by spinning the textured barrel, yet the screws are not long enough to secure the blade.Simply put, if you want a cheap soldering iron with a useless hot knife attachment that doesn't heat up enough to cut foam, buy this-if not, select another model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words: DON\\"T BUY","review":"It's sad when we have come to a time when once reputable companies sell such substandard products. The review that said junk was being nice. The tip does not screw in far enough to secure to the iron. I worked around this by grinding some of the barrel so the tip would screw in further. This worked until the barrel split in half. We live in an age of a disposable society. Companies exist by making inferior products, and when they fail we just toss them and move on. Skip this product, the land fills are full enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"The knife does not work.","review":"It never heated up. The copper area where it connects got hot, but the tip itself did not.So. I thought I would use it as a knife without any heat, and its very awkward to hold.

The author did a wonderful job of interviewing some of the elderly folks around the country that were able to supply some of the kind of history (With a few embellishments I'm sure.) that would otherwise be lost forever once they are gone. I also received an unexpected education about the geology of Great Britain and bit of oceanography that was a pleasant addition to the text. I thought the book was entertaining and easy to read.

Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out.

It seems that all the artists on this cd decided to slow down the tempo on all the songs to make them sound as dreary as possible. I would describe the singing as labored.

I hope you can have the same experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh. eh.","review":"Phil Ochs is one of my favorites, but this \\"tribute\\" has a slightly musty odor. Why didn't they get more relevant musicians to perform on this? Instead they get lots of old and not so old folk musicians to give most faithful renditions of his songs. But why not include contemporary \\"protest\\" musicians? The tradition that Ochs was a part of no longer exists as it did within the confines of acoustic guitars. It exists in hip hop and it exists in bands like Rage Against the Machine. I'm not a huge fan of bands like RAGE, but why weren't they approached for this? Hell, aside from superficial musical similarities, Phil Ochs has much more in common with Rage then he does with James Taylor.To show that Ochs's music is relevant today (and I firmly believe it is), they should have approach an eclectic assortment of politically engaged and committed artists. Instead, this only reinforces the idea that this kind of music is for upper middle class, middle aged white people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"Has a lot of ideas about running your business and how to keep to God's rules in your business.

This book is filled with the history of linen. It is throughly documented with detailed indices. Translated from French, the details provided and pictures are glorious. Turning the pages is a true historical lesson in how linen was created, embellished, and used during times past. The use of lace and embroidery is stunning. I marvel at the complexity of the designs and when I sit with my needle and thread under a magnifying glass and high powered lamp I am in awe of the early needleworkers toiling away without the assistance of these tools.

Wonderful, different receipes - many using unusual ingredients (fresh pineapple jalapeno salsa or kiwi-cranberry conserve anyone?)- done in small batches that usually yield an average of 4 jars.

I can frequently with great success, and have never had the problems with other recipes that I have had with every recipe I have tried out of this book.I tried the Jalapeno Mint Jelly TWICE, and both times, it failed to set for me.I also tried the Thyme Lemon and Black Peppercorn oil, which tasted like straight olive oil - I even tried heating it for longer when it had no thyme/lemon/pepper taste after the initial cooking time, and it still tasted like straight oil.After much money and time wasted, I gave the book one more try with an infused vinegar recipe. By following the recipe EXACTLY, against my gut instincts, I manage to create a lovely, sludge-filled vinegar that smells moldy.I am very sad, because the pictures in this book are great and the idea is fantastic, but this book is going straight in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw This Book Out","review":"I have been canning for 20 years. Since the children are grown I wanted to get a book where I could make small batches and try different receipes. The first thing I have tried out of this book is the strawberry jam. I was very leary of the receipe. It called for letting the strawberry sit for 8 hours in sugar, then boiling then waiting another 24 hours. So I tried it and what I got was a surpy mess. It is not jam, it is not a consume, it is basically strawberry syrup. I should have trusted my gut and stuck to my old stand by.

How is that preserving??). They might be good recipes, but that's not what I was looking for in purchasing the book. The recipes that really are for canning (or other means of preservation) look fine, but not much different than you find in other books.

There has been talk of removing Benoit matches from the proposed Summerslam box set, the WCCW DVD was pushed back 4 months to edit it, and many other superstar's bio DVDs will be lacking some of their own better matches because Benoit was in them. What Benoit did was absolutely, unequivocally unforgivable, but he still has a place in wrestling history. Leave the product as is -- even the matches where Benoit chokes out his opponents.

Several basic steps are presented with clear instruction. Includes plenty of progressively more difficult material to continue advancing for some time.Best of all, the material is seperated in to chapters that are easily selectable from the menu so you can either follow the program from the beginning or jump in wherever you want. The DVD starts quickly at the menu and does not requre you to have to watch the intro every time you start the program.

It's more of a musing, a strange dream. What there is of a story here lacks focus. It's interesting for a bit, but grows tiresome. Perhaps the book's best part is a book within the book called 'The Manual for Sons', in which a number if differing father types are presented for satirical scrutiny: it's not a pretty picture; but it is entertaining.The praise this novel receives is most likely attributed to its 'differentness', and given the time it was published, in the mid '70s, when there were plenty of calls for the death of the novel and such, and the continued march of post-modern games masquerading as novels, it's not surprising that the 'lit-heads' of the time were fascinated by this one. So if you like that sort of thing, this is for you. Otherwise try out Barthelme's short fiction first; it's far more rewarding - his true metier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Barthelme","review":"\\"The Dead Father\\" is a novel by Barthelme who is far more famous for his short stories.

I noticed when I unpacked the box to throw the scale away that there were pistachio shells in the box.

I have another scale that I have been using for a few years that has a max capacity of 5 lb which has no problems with items weighing as little as 1 .oz but when I attempted to use this scale for the same items it either never registered or gave inaccurate readings.

From the look and feel of the product it seems a little cheap and the company sounds pretty marginal judging from the customer's experience with their service department. It's made in China, not that I think that's automatically bad but it's not inherently a harbinger of quality either. Unfortunately I can't find the product info, can't locate contact info for Weighmax and probably it's not under warranty anyway.

For the number of schoolage children up to 6th grade (and possibly beyond) this book tells a simple tale that transcends all age groups. While the primary student would enjoy the wonderful colored pictures and the story, the older children would enjoy the message: Its not cool to bully others around, try reading for life!

The other Sonja Blue books are excellent. But this one just sucks. The characters are all lame and flat, the plot is cliche, the writing is spotty, the motivations weak, the organization poor. It's VERY obvious that she just slapped it together due to the crossover deal with White Wolf. She deals poorly with the various White Wolf clans and terminology, and her \\"personal\\" vampire mythos doesn't square at all with the White Wolf world. There are lots of glaring inconsistencies.Don't waste your money on this garbage.

I realize that the company refers to the grit as mineral, but to be honest, the impression I got was of trying to eat after a sandstorm. Possibly I got a particularly sandy batch, because after I gave up on eating this, I used it for bath salt, and the tub looked like I had been to a beach party.

I don't think so.Maybe realsalt has sand in it so that it boosts the company's profit margins...

I think the salt has a wonderful mild flavor and I know my body is benefiting from all the minerals that are in it.However, I have one MAJOR issue with this product and that is the fact that it contains a lot of hard crystals, some send, etc. These crystals do not dissolve and if you bite on it, it will sound crunchy and even painful.Unfortunately, I've tried this product on 4 different occasions to make sure it wasn't just a bad batch, and they all had crystals that don't dissolve.I'm sad to report that I chipped two of my teeth over a period of 2 months. The chips are microscopic, but I do have quite a bit of sensitivity in those teeth.

Ashley Judd was as usual a show-saver but then her role was merely supportive to Kevin Kline's half-baked portrayal of Cole Porter.For a glimpse of Cole's ingenuity at its best, check out \\"Kiss Me Kate\\" directed by George Sidney in 1953 for the MGM studios.

Kevin Kline is a Decent Actor,but He is missing something here.the only Musical Number Highlights was when Natalie Cole was singing. the rest of those folks needed to exit ASAP. all they needed was Natalie Cole&Maybe throw in Nancy Wilson along with Harry Connick Jr for the musical Numbers.this film should have been way better than it was presented.I Mean the Guy was One of the most Important Songwriters ever.he deserves better.the film couldn't really flip the real life situation into a Proper Modern day feel.the reationships&whatnot felt generic."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a jazz fan, this is a must have movie!","review":"While this movie about Cole Porter's life is excellent in every respect, it is particularly dear to my heart because of the excellent performances of his music by contemporary artists. I loved the new, more modern arrangements that didn't shy away from contemporary jazz harmony.While I'm not a movie critic, the plot kept me engaged from beginning to end and I thought it was a fine overall production. I don't think you can go wrong here whether you are a Cole Porter fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVELY","review":"I like musicals and movies with music contexts and this one is one of my favorites. The story of Cole Porter is very interesting and the music is enchanting.The cast could not be any more perfect, Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd have an awesome chemistry together.Of course the best part of the movie are the musical numbers delivered by many cameos. Robbie Williams (a british singer from a former boy band group Take That)sings De-lovely, in a style and a spunk true to Cole Proter and present time. Elvis Castello, Diana Krall, Vivian Green, Natalie Cole, and Sheryl Crow are some of the well knowns that appear in the movie. My favorite was Alanis Morissettes rendition of Let's Do It (Let's fall in love). Her voice and style go so well together with that song is unbelievable.Also, Ashley Judd gives a go at singing with True Love.Its a fun movie, with a great story and wonderful music. Very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"De-Stinker","review":"I'm a very patient person with books and movies, continuing to plod on under the pretext that \\"it's got to get better\\". Sorry, it never happened with this movie. When it was in production, and having a weakness for old musicals and bios, I was avidly looking forward to it. But what a mess. A concept of flashbacks that also killed \\"Beyond the Sea\\" should be dropped - just tell the story. And Kevin Kline should shoot (or at least fire) the manager who keeps booking him with roles like this as and \\"In & Out\\". Kline should definitely go back to his \\"Wanda\\" comedic talent.One star for the beautiful costumes, but that doesn't make a movie. Read a book about Cole Porter, and put on some music of his instead, because after x number of times that the Porter is this film sits down at the piano, you'll want to scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing two key songs","review":"How can you do a biography of Cole Porter and leave out his two greatest songs--\\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" and \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\"???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get through it","review":"Ashley Judd was very good here, but the way the story was presented left me flat.. I could not get through it and rented it mainly for the performances of the musicians Alanis and Sheryl Crow, but I could even watch it to that point. I really like these actors but not here. How many films were produced from this mans era that the could have givin it a good feel but it played out to me like second rate, should have been more of a biography than a musical stage play,, sorry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not only was I disappointed with this film, I would say it is one of the worst films I have seen in a very long time, and that's saying something. The acting is unconvincing, why people like Robbie Williams and Elvis Costello have to be singing the songs I don't know, and the way the story is presented is lacking any imagination. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world???","review":"Can you give a movie less than 1 star? We tried to watch the movie but it was very boring.

Haven't seen anything quite this dishonest in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"d e lovely","review":"not worth the money. Should have read the credits - one star is too a high rating for this terrible imitation of the original film. I recommend it to no one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for Cole Porter fans","review":"I like Cole Porter and often play his CDs at dinner parties. He was an elegant, witty composer who led an interesting life as a gay man married to his best lady-friend and patron. This movie should have been made decades ago, but America had to get over its homophobia before an honest film was possible. That there are good movies like this being made points to a real sea-change; the human race is beginning to understand matters of sexuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kline is lovely in Delovely","review":"Whether you are a fan of Cole Porter or musicals, Delovely will keep your interest. Kline and Judd do a great job of showing how a couple could stay devoted to each other even through hard times. The movie is filled with Porter's music and the cameos of musical stars helps keep you watching each number. The movie is really good even and holds up against the flood of bio movies that came out this year. I would recommend the movie to anyone who has an interest in musicals or history. Kline does a great job of making the viewer see Porter and not Kline in old age make-up which is not always the case in bio movies. It does get a bit long towards the end and I would have liked to see some follow up information on the number of musicals that Porter wrote and what he eventually died from. Not having that information didn't hurt the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"There are two reasons why I don't rate this 5 stars. It is historically incorrect in several parts. For instance, Fred Astaire sang Night And Day on Broadway, not some guy named Jack. And there is a bit too much about the sex life of Porter. I just fast forward past those scenes and watch the musical numbers, which are great. People who complain about the arrangements are off the wall. This was made in 2004, why should they rehash the same old arrangements? The music is great and the sound and staging is beautiful. The CD is also terrific. We loved it. If you like musicals and you like classic songs, you'll enjoy it, as long as you truly believe that someone else besides Sinatra and Ella can perform these songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Entertaining","review":"I rented this movie not expecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised. One of the things that I enjoyed tremendously was listening to the different versions of the songs that I have heard for most of my life. I enjoyed Kevin and Ashley's performance. For me, this movie did what I wanted it to do. It entertained me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"The music of Cole Porter remains timeless, but his life story makes for less-than-compelling cinema, as evidenced by the mostly fictional \\"Night and Day\\" (1946). Unfortunately, director Irwin Winkler believed that young moviegoers would leap at the chance to see a Porter biography graced by contemporary vocalists such as Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morissette. For all his good intentions, Winkler should have left well enough alone. Instead, he made \\"De-Lovely\\" (2004) - the cinematic equivalent of rigor mortis. Despite sincere performances by Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd, the film never catches fire due to Winkler's incredibly flat direction, which sucks the life out of every Porter classic during its interminable two-hour length. There are better ways to honor Cole Porter's musical legacy. Avoiding \\"De-Lovely\\" is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Lovely","review":"Unconventional ? Yes. Entertaining ? Yes. Will it be viewed more than once? Yes. As Larry King is quoted on the packing box: \\"This is the best musical biography ever made\\". I find it hard to argue this.I have watched the movie at least 6 times and have yet to tire of it.The songs just come in a seamless connection to the story, which is secondary to the music. I choose not to pick on some of the weak points (which are few , in my judgement) and recommend this underated flick to anyone who cares for class in song making"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life's a musical","review":"This movie about Cole Porter shows his life in the form of a musical as it flashes back to important scenes, mostly between him and his wife Linda. She marries him, knowing full well that he is a homosexual and she tries mightily to pretend that it doesn't matter to their relationship. Porter's songs are woven throughout the movie and they are wonderful in quality and in number. Kevin Kline does a masterful job playing Porter as a young rogue and later as a bitter, aging man. The real tragedy of Porter's life is that despite the fact that he wrote beautiful and witty love songs, he struggled in his own life to discover what true love is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songwriter, HORRIBLE movie!!!","review":"Kevin Kline is his usual charming self, but the script, direction and Ashley Judd's acting are beyond atrocious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cole Porter movie","review":"The movie is good but the sound track is the best. If you like music, save your money and just buy the sound track. If you like movies, buy this one and watch Ashley Judd. She carries the movie. Kevin Klein, at times, is almost hateable (\\"stupid is as stupid does\\" Momma Gump)."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY MOVING DESPITE BEING HOKEY","review":"We never saw this when it came out based on some of the reviews of some critics...but we should have. It was very moving, and more honest about Cole Porter's life than anything prior. The music was inserted so well that it basically told the story, and once you start watching you really can't move away. Give it a whirl, it is truly a nice, but ultimately sad, film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, despite some of the music....","review":"a wonderful celebration of the life and music of Cole Porter. A great movie for musical theatre buffs. Wonderful to see a Hollywood movie pull no punches with the homosexual aspect as well. Only slight bad point is the use of some 'current' pop stars to sing some of Cole Porter's songs. But otherwise an excellent movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"i loved this movie. it was like if not better than watching a broadway show. there was comedy, drama, gorgeous sets, costumes, and best of all was the incredibly great music. i hope they bring this to broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great composer but,,,,,,","review":"I don't think i'll ever understand the new Hollywood. They almost had this one right but....When I go to see a film in the theatre, especially a musical or about a composer such as this, don't you just want to be razzled, dazzled? I do. I don't care about all the other crap that went on in peoples lives. Why do Americans have to know everything about the torrid lives of famous people. Why can't we just be entertained with great musical production numbers and light heartedness.The Hollywood of today just doesn't have a clue how to entertain people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable movie","review":"I've always really liked this movie. I think Cole Porter songs are pretty great and they managed to get a lot of really great people to sing them in this movie. Also, Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd do a wonderful job telling this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for Romantic Souls","review":"I loved the movie and bought the BluRay version. A friend wanted to see the movie also so I bought her the non-BluRay version; she doesn't have a BluRay player. She will get this as a Christmas present from another friend... and will love it also.(Note, after a negative comment I may just delete this review. There is a lack of holiday spirit showing.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Gem","review":"If you are a Cole Porter fan, this movie is a must-see....and if you're not, this movie will make you a fan!! The production number of \\"Be A Clown\\" is incredible and will give you chills. Ashely Judd is beautiful and Kevin Kline is his usual talented self. This movie is a treat you will enjoy over and over again and the soundtrack CD is a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Klein can't sing!","review":"I barely was able to endure 15 minutes of Kevin Klein's singing before I ran screaming out of the room. So Cole Porter couldn't sing; why not take some literary license and cast a good singer in the part so we could enjoy the music? Would his family have objected if his voice was improved on in the movie? I doubt it. The audience sure wouldn't.We should have been paid to endure Klein's voice, not the other way around. I rented the movie expecting to be entertained, not insulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Des-gusting","review":"Save your time and money and don't watch this abomination.

This music is vibrant and happy-sounding, heavy with piano rhythms and all written by Huey. All of his original charted hits on Ace records are here. The only loser in the bunch is the 1960 \\"Beatnik Blues\\" which reflects a changed style for the group as it fell out of popularity. Of historical note is the unreleased \\"Sea Cruise\\" recording by Huey which Ace rejected and turned into a major hit by another artist (Frankie Ford)."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Orleans Rocking Boogie Woogie Piano","review":"This CD is a great compliation of Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith's recordings for Ace Records. His music is pretty wild and crazy, and it really rocks, like most of the great early rock'n'roll of the 50's. It's not straight up rock'n'roll; it's really early rhythm and blues music.He has a great sense of humor. Many of the songs are very fuuny. His songs are very catchy and have great hooks in them. His piano playing is great on all of the tracks on this disc and there's great saxophone playing, too. Some of the best piano playing of the era next to Jerry Lee and Little Richard with a unique New Orleans style to it. His stuff can be hard to find; so if you find it,jump on it. If you like rocking piano playing and early rock'n'roll and r&b music, then this disc is a must for you. Go buy it, you won't be dissappointed. It's great music that should be listened to. The only downside to this disc is that it's less than 45 minutes long, but it's at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"spurs coffee cup","review":"Very satisfied with the product.

Boy, are they heterosexual!

I whittled them down to three 'keepers:' recordings by Artur Schnabel, Alfred Brendel and Claudio Arrau. All three have very special virtues in my opinion and I recommend all three heartily.Of these three, I listen to Arrau the most and derive the deepest and most consistent pleasure and uplift. And I tend to linger longer over Arrau's recordings than I do over the work of the other artists, though I love them dearly. After nearly twenty years of owning this recording, I still find listening to it a rare and deeply rewarding experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrau's recordings from the Sixties","review":"There is nothing to add to the comments on the musical quality of this release - they are great in the best and truest meaning of that word.I still hope that this information will be useful:a seller confirmed to me that these are NOT the recordings from 1970s and 1980s -Arrau's \\"late\\" und uncompleted cycle (for which I am almost desperately looking),but the famous 1960s recordings.Which I already have and treasure and which are available in Novemnber 2012 in two different boxes for a good price.Beethoven Complete Piano Sonatas, Collector's EditionSon.

In fact, the only highlight on this album is the sole Jermaine Dupri-produced track \\"Shady Girl\\". The first flop of a single entitled \\"Walked Outta Heaven\\" sounds exactly like their previous hit \\"Let's Get Married\\". No originality at all and the group's songwriting is far from up to par! Trust me, save your money and buy another album that isn't so bland, say 112's upcoming \\"Hot and Wet\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"These guys are very talented singers. You can really tell that 2 members are brothers, their harmonizing is excellent and their first album was wonderful. Slow groves that really put you in a sensual state of mind, made you fall in love again. But this one, oh my, was so darn boring it took me three tries to listen to the whole thing in one sitting, I kept turning it off. Finally after I had heard the entire album, I was glad I got it free. These songs are truly dull. Sorry guys, you had a miss with this one. The second song on the CD \\"Walked Outta Heaven\\" is simply a remake of \\"Let's Get Married\\" from their first one. Same song, different words. The only song worth listening to \\"Tryna be your Man\\" is too short and although it's not good it's the best one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jagged Edge puts out yet another fantastic CD","review":"I love this CD.

Gotta Be, Let's Get Married, True Man, Goodbye and the list goes on. The songs were great and I vowed to buy the next album they released. If only that album hadn't been Hard. I purchased the cd and gave it several play throughs only to give a cry in disgust.Most of the songs on this album are weak. The album seems to focus more on J.E.'s uptempo songs and well... they just aren't that great. Walked outta heaven is a great song and Hard is acceptable as well. If it weren't for these two songs... I'm not sure I would even have given the album a star.The group needs to stick with their slower songs.

Next they came out with jagged little thrill and that was pretty good, not as good as J.E. Heartbreak but it still touched the heart. Now its HARD and what a great cd! I don't think that there is a song that i don't like. It has some slow songs, relationship songs and some up beat songs that you can relate to. My favorite songs are girls gone wild, i don't wanna, like to be in love, in the morning, and walked outa heaven.I think that everyone interested in R&B should have a copy of Jagged Egde: HARD."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Same","review":"This is not a terrible album, but easily forgettable.

I was a bit disappointed that they didn't come through sharper then they did but they seem to take an edge pretty easily. They had been and maybe still are highly recommended by consumers report and that is what got me looking at them. The tang going into the handle and the rivets seem to afford them many years of happy cooking to come.

All the larger knives are good quality and can be sharpened to be very usable.The problem is with the steak knives and the serrated edged knives. They are all only edged on one side. In other words, they are perfectly flat on one side and the other has the slanted edge where you cut.This makes all these above mentioned pieces cut at an angle instead of straight as well as much less sharp. It is beyond me why they would do this. How much money could it save them, or were they just stupid?If not for this, I would have given this set 5 stars. As it stands, I would probably go with something else.Addendum: Scissors are pretty cheesy and the entire set was made in China, in case you couldn't guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you expect to receive this anytime soon.","review":"I would love to review this item but I can't because I haven't received them yet.

This product was not user friendly and the instructions that came with it did not help at all. In addition you have to go through Windows Media which has bugs of its own. The software on the product itself also left much to be desired. Maybe they have improved their operating system since this product but it was terrible. Don't even try to create a favorites list.

First, the original hard disk failed and I actually ordered a 40 Gig disk and put it in myself and doubled the capacity of the player. The reason why I have stuck with this player for so long is the ease of transferability and the lack of DRM you have to mess with like in modern players.

Performance from the Gateway has been great, the sound quality is exactly what I wanted in a portable unit. The battery life is great. The main reason for my purchasing this unit was it's sound quality and it's looks. Both are top notch. I contemplated the Ipod but was turned off by the Ipod's white factor, even with the Ipod Mini color selection there still is the white factor on the buttons.

I gave them the serial number and they don't keep a record of serial numbers for MP3 players. They flat out refused to talk to me about the unit because I had no order number or Customer ID number.

Perhaps not relying upon music as a means to a living allowed him to maintain a more positive sense of his rural upbringing and keep at bay the demons of the city. In any case this is a very strong, energetic and emotionally uplifting contemporary blues album with a vocal and guitar style as easy flowing as the Mississippi on an early summer evening a half-century ago.

Do not expect a biography by any means: much is \\"left out\\", e.g. his marriages, and other personal relationships, as well as much that would be connected to his profession as a famous actor.

The only appeal of Baars's work is its association with Catholic doctrine. But that religion is not a suitable basis for psychiatric treatment.No psychiatric residency program in this country teaches this type of mystical, New Age mumbo-jumbo.

I didn't do too much shopping around, but from what I did do, I thought that this seat had much more side impact protection (my car doesn't have side airbags) and was narrower than most (in a Liberty, space is at a premium in the back) and it had a 5 point harness system that lasted longer than most, and the seat will last a long time.

We had not expected it to be so simple to use and so absolutely comfortable for our little girl. We took it out of the car one evening, into the house to clean, and she ended up sitting in the seat for almost an hour! Not to mention how easy the seat is to clean.

It would have been easy to make it fit, but it doesn't. I have an Epiphone Alleycat and a Les Paul, it would not fit either one. Maybe it would fit an off brand guitar, who knows.The instructions are OK, but only deal with \\"typical senarios\\", which mine never are. I am an Electonics engineer so I was able to work it out, but the professional installation recommendation is a good one, if you want to go this route.If they spent more money on the product doing what they profess and less on the packaging, I would have been very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this item!!!!","review":"This helmet is a joke.

Rather, arguments develop by actually rereading what you have written, revising it so as to clarify the connecting ideas, and making assertions that require some kind of evidence to defend them. A little reseach along the way wouldn't be a bad idea either.

He feels that if you can isolate in your subject the correct color for the brushstroke you are about to paint, you cannot help but jump one of the biggest hurdles to having your painting look like the subject. The book is filled with his beautiful paintings, and lots of tips and techniques. I've been following his work since I purchased the book and going to the workshop, and my biggest mistake was not purchasing one of his paintings.

Then once again I charged it, not once has it shot a BB, I have recharged it 5 times now, and only the first two times it worked. Not only this but out of all the ammo the launcher holds mine only shot twice, then it stopped shotting a single BB.UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WASTE MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS GUN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Garbage.

Then, because the gears are plastic as well as a the gearbox itself, they screwed up. The gearbox cracked, the gears stripped each other and the gun was gone.

I only have two problems with this gun the fake R.I.S that holds the battery looks kinda stupid but the only other way to hold the battery is with the grenade launcher and i didnt want to put that on there.

The plunge paid off. The quality is top notch, tons of extra parts for various gun configurations that you would expect in a kit that's priced twice as much if not more. While it's true that there is no clear instructions to attach the M203, a quick look at the small nuts and bolts and the metal strips in the small polybag pretty much gives one the idea how to go about it.

Yes. The trigger. Very frustrating. It shot alright, but it lacks the distance and range you might want (after all, it is an LPEG (Low-powered-electric-gun). The barrel also wobbled a bit, but this was greatly reduced by adding the grenade launcher, which is a pain to attach.I can not recommend this gun in good conscious.

One plastic part did break on mine, but it's one I never use.The battery is much better than spring or gas. THe power is good but not scary, and I got shot intentionally and it hurts but it's sufferable. But one safety note - removing battery means kids can't get hurt.One note for those considering it - the magazine and reloading on this is great. You pour in about 150 bb's into the magazine, and roll a dial on the bottom to bring about 25 up to the chamber. Then shoot those 25 and simply roll the dial some more to bring another 25 into position. Thus you can go through about 150 or more without reloading!

This results in pure, bubble-brained hilarity! We get REX in all of his Wal-Mart-Halloween-costume glory- roaring, slobbering, and mutilating his way through the countryside!

Because of Barker's instinctive understanding was what's REALLY scary: not the Rawhead (in his ridiculous costume), but the underlying pagan and pre-Christian imagery. Notice that this is a \\"Green Man\\" production -- the most potent, the most potentially pervasive of all pre-Christian images. I also liked the close-ups of the tombstones in the Irish church yard ... again, reflecting that uneasy alliance between Celtic (or even pre-Celtic) gods and Catholicism.

The piece on the side (I think it's for the hem) I'm still trying to figure out. I also noticed that I still have to have my daughter try on the outfit before sewing it to be sure it is a good fit. The first one we tried on here still needed a small adjustment even though the measurements were correct. I think that has more to do with shape and I will probably look at buying the padding that can be applied to the dress form to make it more accurately resemble the body of the person.Overall, it has been useful as a holding spot for the pieces of clothing as I sew. It helps me get the skirt off the table while I work on the bodice. Fitting...still playing with it, but so far, it seems to be going okay.

It is also just as valuable for the more experienced engine builder/racer as it contains loads of info on carb mods, manifold design and mods, mixtures, atomization, etc. It also dispells many myths that do nothing except slow you down. Rather than writing books based on popular and expert opinions, DV's books are based on hard scientific fact. He does the work, and he has the results. Knowledge is horsepower! With DV's books, I've never gone wrong. On a horsepower per dollar basis, his books are the best investment you'll ever make."},{"rating":"2","title":"hook assortment","review":"these hooks were great for organizing my garage I used all the pieces and forn them very useful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for nervous mom and middle school son","review":"My son is in 7th grade.

The other four are: Behind Closed Doors; There Won't Be Anymore; A Very Special Love Song; Every Time You Touch Me I Get High.

I also noticed that it copied many of the video segments that were on the Kingston Trio DVD \\"50 Years of Havin' Fun.\\" (Probably to be used as a filler.)

Dordogne, Wales, the Mezzogiorno, Swiss cities, and the French wine country? Crickets. And this is a 1350-page book!Positive things I'll say is when the destinations are discussed, it is done well.

I carefully put them together and dropped them in my down spouts. I had a little bit of difficulty in getting them into the downspout holes of the gutter. They are working so far, but I really wouldn't recommend them. They are a cheap thin piece of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gutter Drain Screen","review":"This screen is really cheaply made.

This album, \\"Madvillainy\\" and his work with DJ Danger Mouse, \\"Dangerdoom\\" have been my introductions to his vast discography. So far, I've found his work to be both creative and innovative.In \\"Special Herbs, Vols. 7 & 8\\" he puts together a groovy blend of hip-hop beats and soul with a fun touch of chillout that remains timeless. It's an album you will probably be able to listen to without any problem 20 or 30 years from now.A definite five stars production, this album left me wanting to go back to hear more of the amazing music works by this hip-hop artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning (THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE ALBUM)","review":"I recently purchased this cd from Amazon. The packaging and artwork are correct on the case and the actual cd. When I put the cd in it had 10 tracks and was actually a John Denver cd. A very odd anomaly hopefully, but just be aware that when these are pressed they are normally done in thousands at a time. There could be a bad batch of these that are filtering through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I love GWAR but I thought this video was pretty weak.

Being the huge GWAR fan that i am, i must say this film is a true work of art.

It was the first movie that ever made me cry and ever since there have only been one or two others. Not violent or vulgar like some movies, The Caterville Ghost has a certain magic that keeps it great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring introduction to a world in transformation","review":"If like me you use the computer screen to communicate, but are hazy on how it works, and even hazier on how it can be made to work best, this is a book you must have. It not only makes it clear how words need to work on screen, but why and how as well. Götz is superb at explaining how the physical make up of screens and the demands of web design affect the way typefaces can be used, and her beautifully designed book is an inspiration and a pleasure to use. The challenges involved in converting a paper-based technology like type design to the electronic world are so diverse and fundamental that anyone interested in type will find much to learn here - and much in the witty and amused text to enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I read prodigiously, and this is the most disappointing debut novel I've ever read. It pales in comparison to Ian McEwan's spine chilling The Comfort of Strangers.With its weak utterly preposterous plot, Strangers on a Train is an insult to anyone's intelligence. The actions of Guy, the guy who's being stalked, are so unbelievable - not to say asinine - that I found them irritating. The private investigation into all the murders was equally unbelievable and downright farcical! Read the other 2 star review on here. It's right on the money!I should have just watched the movie. The book drags on and on for nearly 300 pages towards a most unsatisfying anticlimactic ending, which I don't want to give away. A waste of time. Pick up any \\"hard\\" novel by Georges Simenon. I recommend Dirty Snow, The Widow, The Train, and particularly The Man who Watched Trains Go By and The Engagement (!). And of course, the Comfort of Strangers by Ian McEwan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good!","review":"I have seen the Hitchcock version of this story and liked it very much however, I have really, really liked this book. Ms. Highsmith brings you into this story, i.e. you live it, you feel the instability of Bruno, the horror of Guy and the uncertainty of Anne as you read along. I hope to read more from this author.You won't be able to put it down...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abnormal Psych 101","review":"I had to join in this small but growing chorus of praise for Strangers on a Train. It is a wonderful read - and not just for suspense fans. Forget the film, this book is a dizzying ride through the mind of a man who is unexpectedly confronted with his darker half. Without giving too much away, check it out if only for the scene in the amusement park in Metcalf!By the way, this title is out of print in the U.S. but is in print and available from any British bookstore. I got mine over the internet, with a wait of several weeks for the package to arrive. It was worth the effort! Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Read","review":"Intense psychological drama and lush prose mark this expertly-crafted thriller. I'm impressed how Highsmith inhabits the mail psyche as a writer and it's a terror and a joy to experience her imagining of these two men's inner lives. Of course the book careens relentlessly towards tragedy as the doomed characters she's created never stood a chance. A pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to say it's not good.","review":"Perhaps this album is a little overproduced; sometimes it works, sometimes not. It's a very strange album any way. It's spoiled by a few very weak songs ('Give me a reason'(oh boy!), 'On s'est tant aimé', 'Au rythme du coeur' and 'Tout feu tout flamme'), but there are many jewels too ('Ce n'est pas rien', 'Ouvre moi le ciel', 'Plus rien n'est comme avant', and especially 'Les yeux d'Emma' and 'Rupture'). The sound is modern, with a firm emphasis on drum-beats, but there's a nostalgic element too. To be short: this album is sometimes surprisingly weak and ordinary, but mostly surprisingly good. Don't stop with the angel-like 'Rupture': after five minutes or so, another fine song follows as a kind of postlude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blistering Set","review":"This is a BLISTERING SET by The Hoax. Influinced by SRV (but not a copy) these young British musicians know how to rock the house. Non-stop jamming by dual guitarists makes me long for more. Too bad they are no longer together, they must have been a sight to see. Great job lads, wish you were still around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good British live blues album.","review":"Some people prefer their bands to record studio albums, whilst others like a live feel. This album is a pretty good live album although the sound quality does suffer a little. However the music itself is pretty good with good guitar, and vocal work in particular. Those familiar with Stevie Ray will be able to play spot the Stevie Ray song, but hey haven't lots of the greatest blues musicians used each others song for influence, or covered them themeselves. All in all a rollicking good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the prog band","review":"I bought this thinking it was the Hoax's new live album released since Manholepedroza left the band. Unfortunately this is the other Hoax that usesthe same name. The Hoax from Texas was the original and far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I was very underwhelmed by this book. Not a good \\"teach yourself to play bass\\" book at all. Might be better if supplemented with an instructor. Did an O.K. job of covering various musical genres hence the 2 stars. But not much information on how to apply the basics learned in each chapter to a wider variety of music. Overall there are better books out there and you don't have to look too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice instructions for a begginer bassist","review":"Wouldn't recommend this book if you already have a band, or if you already have taken some lessons in bass.I got disappointed with this book. I was expecting more. But, the only nice part is that it already gives you some ideas about a base line and encourages you to write your own lines/solo by providing an already empty sheet music with the basic chords on each compass."},{"rating":"1","title":"NKJV is Great , Words are too Large!","review":"The book is concordance and reference materials in this book are great and helpful. My problem is that the text is too large and crowded on the pages making it difficult to read and look up versus. Started giving me a headache after awhile. I would like to recommend the regular Nelson NKJV Reference bible. Its will be easier to read. Another great bible, the one I like the best, is the Nelsons SLIMLINE bible. Perfect to take to church because its smaller and lighter but the words are still large enough to read on a regular basis. I have the genuine leather edition and bought it on amazon and just LOVE it! Hope this helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I don't read much fiction, but I saw this book on Amazon and decided to pick it up. I'm glad I did, because then I couldn't put it down. The author has the rare ability to give thorough descriptions of people and places without getting heavy or dull. I majored in Literature in college, and have had a hard time finding really good writing in a novel. There are many interesting stories, but the writing itself leaves a lot to be desired. I would've enjoyed reading this even if it weren't such a gripping story, but it has that, too. I learned a lot about the Russian revolution in a painless, interesting way. Definitely worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel has it all!","review":"This novel has all the goods- romance, scandal, history, war... it made me cry and laugh, and taught me some interesting things about the Bolshevik Revolution, WWI, and life in Britain in the early 20th century, stuff you wouldn't necessarily learn in history classes. Alice Fry is a true heroine! Very well written by Read. A for sure recommendation all around!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the worst astronomical book I have ever seen!!!","review":"The title of this book is very attractive. That is why I bought it. But the programs it gives in its chapter won't work. All the tables do not make sense. I doubt the English ability of the author. There are at least hundreds of run-on sentences and fragments. The author even wrote many F-words in the book. I wonder what kind of background does this author have? I will avoid any book written by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even if you don't speak italiano","review":"Full Disclosure: The bits of the Italian language I can understand are those I picked up from my Grandma screaming at me when I was a kid.Still, I love this album. It's pure and joyful pop and the language barrier doesn't really matter. I saw Alex Britti perform on New Year's Eve 98 at the Forum in Rome. The crowd went crazy for him and after I heard the song that is track 2 on this album \\"Solo Una Volta\\" I knew I'd be buying the album the next day. I did and I don't regret it. Alex performed with just acoustic guitar when I saw him, but the arrangements are nicely fleshed out here. There are at least 5 songs on this album that you will end up singing along with even though you don't know what you are saying. Give it a shot. In a lot of ways he's stylistically close to Jovanotti (see the Soprano's soundtrack vol 2).Correction: The song the other guy who reviewed this is talking about \\"una su un milione\\" is not on this album. It is on La Vasca.

Upon receiving the package I opened it and much to my dismay the cap was a completely darker color than depicted.

I was skeptical at first but after stripping down a power wheels truck and painting all parts with Krylon Fusion I was impressed!Just make sure you shake the can extremely well and do not shortcut this instruction as the paint will not bond to the plastic if not shaken well. I also noticed as the can got low on paint (extremely low) I began to see the paint also began to have problem bonding to the plastic.After learning the above and completing my project I will have to say this Krylon Fusion paint is a must for any of those faded toys in the back yard or honestly changing the colors on any plastics around the house!One last note: Depending on the project you may want to consider getting a can of clear coat for glossy finish.

There were two reasons why I chose to use this book although I owned PR as well.This book is twice as thin as Princeton Review. Some may attribute PR's thickness to the fact that it contains materials for both B and C. However, the apparent thickness is important because it often determines whether one finishes a book.Secondly, the pages were white. In other words, the book was not made from recycled paper(like PR). This feature had a cathartic effect on my studying.

It describes the psychology behind the method. I trained my dog by this method and must say it worked almost too well. My dog is now 8 years old and has had an \\"accident\\" in the house only once in that time due to an illness. I attribute this success to the method discussed in this book as well as to the intelligence of my dog :) . I will say that the first two days are difficult, but after that the dog will understand the 'pen\\". Try it, it is far less cruel than other methods."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh","review":"I was kind of disappointed by this book because it didnt tell me anything that I didnt know already. The one thing that I did learn was that you cant really potty train a dog until its 4 months old because it doesnt have bladder control...which I actually read in another book later. Honestly, the best way to potty train your dog is to leave him/her for a weekend with a friends dog that is already potty trained. They learn things from a pack so much more quickly then they do from you. My dog used to go in the house at least 2 times a day, I went out of town and left her with my friend who also has a dog and she came back scratching the door when she needed to go. That following week she only went one time in the house, it was AMAZING. Sorry...a bit of a tangent, but thought some people may find it helpful.

Then it says to confine the puppy in the crate.I think it would have been beneficial to chapter each method and be consistant within each chapter. Our new puppy is primarily my 10 year old son's dog.

You read what the heroine and hero are thinking and then they say it aloud to each other. And they tend to think the same thoughts again and again and again without adding anything to the plot or character.Bordering on insanity is their lust. Right in the middle of being chased by thugs with guns, and they're climbing down the fire escape, they still have time to feel each other out and fantasize, really amazing.What also got tiring was how she kept trying to keep him out of her troubles by running away from him in the middle of being chased. When is she going to get smart enough to realize it's too late to 'keep him out of it' when they both have been id and chased already?? The book does not make her appear smart at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be sexy, but definately not smart","review":"I knew this book was going to be pretty hard to enjoy starting on about page 2--hijacking a pilot? Why? Bailey is already a stow away on a plane going exactly where she needs to go, so why bother revealing herself with a hijack when she could have just taken a nap and gotten there with no issues. How lucky that Noah's crush on the apparently hot Bailey is enough to make him risk his life for her--she's annoying, so why'd he stick around with her when his original plan was to hit the slopes and as many ski bunnies as possible I'll never know.Didn't like it. Its a Jill Shalvis book, so there are plenty of sex scenes, but for supposedly smart people on the run from the bad guys, they sure chose some stupid times to have sex. I have the other 2 books in the series from the library, but I'm not sure I'll give them any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"I just re read this story and fell in love with it all over again.

The only hitch is that he has a stowaway -the sexy widow of one of his clients. Bailey's husband died and left her with some huge debts due to his shady investors and they are willing to kill anyone close to her to get what is rightfully due to them. As Noah helps her traipse from one incomplete property started by Allan Sinclair to another searching for the loot, the two embark on a passionate affair, much to the consternation of his friends and fellow pilots.Shalvis combines intrigue, sexy characters, and a plot twist or two to tell a romantic and sensuous story. I particularly liked the camaraderie among the three \\"Sky High\\" pilots and look forward to their further adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good....but","review":"I liked this book as an easy, quick romp, but that is all. The suspense and adventure were lukewarm at best while the sex and passion were hot!I enjoyed reading it because it was fast paced and took little concentration.

There was adventure, great animation, and unless you told a kid back then, apart from noticing that the mouth movements didn't always match the words exactly you'd never known it was made in japan!My only qualm with the product is that, apart from the episodes included there are absolutely no extras! It might be a harsh criticism given the age of the DVD, but at least a trailer or interview with any of the makers (whether on the TBN side or the Japan side) would've been good to understand the context and how a Christian American show ended up being animated in Japan at a time where most shows, e.g. G.I. Joe & Thundercats, were being done locally.It would be great if they would release the entire series on DVD - it still has reruns on SmileofaChild TV and other stations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reknowned Medium Doris Stokes' terrific sequel","review":"Doris Stokes tells how her psychic powers have helped the family of one of the Yorkshire murder victim.

You'd have this movie.If you've ever wanted to listen to Samantha Morton drone on and on, in endless voice-over narration, then this is the movie for you. If you enjoy love stories where there's zero chemistry between the lovers, then this is the movie for you. And if you are having troubles getting to sleep, then - yes! - this is the movie for you.Dull and tedious and derivative. There's a reason you've never heard of this movie before. You've been warned...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightful Futuristic Drama","review":"I had to view this film about five times before I truly understood all the nuances contained within this production. My final viewing was with English sub-titles. Then, the film clicked in my head with a frightening prediction. What if these events really happen in the near future? We already have in-vitro reproduction. Inevitably, it will occur. Also, there were various psychological issues addressed in the film. For example, the complete lack of privacy, the devaluation of human life, incestuous love of a different kind, inimitable mind control, and the total ignoring of several pragmatic events laced throughout the film. Frankly, I enjoyed trying to solve the ambiguity of this film between the interacions of the William and Maria characters. Perhaps, someday we'll have the opportunity to watch film adaptions of code(s) 43, 44, or 45. And then, we'll find out how all this came too be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun heavy converstion based film","review":"Over all this will only be liked by poeple who whish theycould write movies.

If this movie has a story, it's not clearly indicated. The film is exceptionally slow moving. The movie is equivalent to turning on MTV without the sound or glamour--as it is nothing more than a montage of pale, stark images. This movie fails on all fronts of what makes a good movie. That is to say: Bad directing, bad acting, bad screenplay, and bad special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Realistic Futuristic Film with not much going on","review":"This film portrays a world in the future that I can imagine actually happening, a world where because of cloning, an emphasis is placed on one's genetic makeup, protection is needed against viruses when travelling to a new place, and it is safer to live in the city versus \\"outside.\\" It is comforting that despite all these worries, regulations and restrictions, fears, human emotions are still there.However, this film is much too slow paced with really not too much going on. The love story between the two main characters is not convincing at all. There are too many long close up shots of the Maria Gonzalez character that end up being more annoying and pointless rather than adding anything to the film's already skimpy plot.An alright movie that would have been better more as a half-hour show on Twilight Zone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me to tears!","review":"I couldn't agree more with the review posted by GLBT (below) -- this flic IS \\"dull, tedious, and derivative.\\" It's a visually sterile would-be Blade Runner with no interesting plot twists and no chemistry. I would also add that, while the sprinkling of French and Spanish phrases used by all the characters didn't faze me since I speak those languages, it was gratuitous, superfluous, and no doubt made the already-garbled dialogue harder to follow for many viewers. I'm usually a fan of Tim Robbins, but his acting was flat and uninspired (no doubt he was painfully aware of what a dud this film is). Samantha Morton was actually a bit more convincing, but she can't accomplish the impossible. If you're reading this before seeing the film, SAVE YOURSELF and see something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Sensibility","review":"The director has the ambition and vision of making a different kind of love stories; however, he lacked the craftsmanship and sensibility to achieve his goals and failed miserably.From the cinematography point of view, the movie is under exposure and in a tint of depressing green, which makes view a visual challenge.The direction is so lack of sensibility, which is a crucial element to deliver a romantic story. The dynamic between the two lovers (Robbins and Morton) just isn't convincing enough for audiences to believe that these two characters can actually fall in love for each other.Tim Robins is a wonderful actor, but he alone cannot save a film from disaster. This is probably one of the worst movies I watched in the past few years. It actually made me feel physically nauseous (...not being exaggerated or cynical)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Code 46 is code for a waste of time","review":"This is a boring movie that made me cut it off four times before I made it to the credits. Maybe I should give it a second chance and watch it from beginning to end, but I don't think I could make it. Robbins is bad in the movie and the plot goes hand in hand with his acting. I don't know where the money came from to produce this movie, but the producers should ask for it back. I would say more, but I already wasted a day trying to sit through it and don't want to devote any more of my life to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people nuts ?","review":"I am astounded by the many positive reviews of this film. It has no story and its actors seem bored and distance. It is no love story there are no sparks between the two leads.

More a mood piece than science fiction, writer Boyce is not Gattaca's Niccol in his piecing together of Gattaca sprinkled with Blade Runner. Nor does Code 46 have the chilling claustrophobia of 1984.Instead, although acted well, storylines are as vague as the form of the monolithic government that enacted the code. Compared with other sci-fi that offer more holistic views of alternate realities, Winterbottom's is fractured and at times nonsensical.I am warned when, after a film, I say to my wife \\"What did we just watch\\". Paraphrasing Gina Davis in The Fly, be warned, be very warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for weekly hire","review":"I got the chance to watch this movie last week, and based on Tim Robbins earlier movies, I was expecting a good story.The movie was very slow and after 40 minutes of stodgy acting, no direction and boring story, I felt compeled to turn the movie off.I won't spoil the story for those of you who do want to watch it, but for my money, there's a lot better out there to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highbredity in Cinema","review":"A really amazing film!!!!! Not your typical SciFi or love story. In the not so distant future a married man investigates a counterfeiter and he falls inlove.

A girl who does not realize she is the daughter of the stormy east wind develops into a weaver with magical talents of artistry and eventually wins her heart's desire. Here's a sample about her father so you can just imagine how lovely HER story is. \\"He found a girl who was not afraid of his wildness. They were wed.

There's a plot, of the flimsiest sort, concerning a paroled convict who's convinced, for no particular reason, one druggy dancer is his missing daughter -- cue for a series of scenes involving adult toys, familial recrimination and and turgid dialogue.

If you don't know how to play a G chord on a uke, you need another book to show you how. I returned this book because the quality of the arrangements and lack of chord diagrams were unsatisfactory.

When testing a focuser you want to see and image snap into focus then snap out. This field scope does exactly that. The internal baffling works well and the images are bright and crisp. The detail in objects this scope provides makes it superior to many others.I am confident when I recommend this as a Birding or Shooting scope.

I drove her car after she backed into a hitch and broke out her tail light a couple of weeks ago. This happened because she couldn't get traction in an inch of snow in parking lot. My car with Michelin Pilot Sport AS walked through it like it was nothing. I spent literally five minutes backing out and pulling out of the parking lot.

My friends and I have been watching the video for years - we put it on whenever a boozed-up night of shouting out the classic lines is required, e.g. \\"He was put away for doing something disgusting with a net.\\" Just typing it in makes me laugh, see the film and you'll see what I mean. Add to that a bizarre Mini car chase, a singalong Cockney soundtrack and an authentic swinging London 60s setting and it's a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"redrex","review":"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

It gives a good background before watching second Italian Job. You can really see how far the quality of movies has come in the past 30 years.I give both movies 4 stars for the quality of the acting and driving stunts.You have to see it for what it is a fiction movie that has a life of it's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remake was better if only for the ending for which the writers of the original didnt seem to know what to do with it.","review":"While the original, interesting only because it was the original, actually did not have the whimsy the Marky W. remake had and the ending of the original was stupid, and attempt at irony that failed badly and a real downer. Michael Caine, great, magnificent gentleman actor that you have always been, why did you do this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italian Job original vs Remake","review":"First of all, Amazon.com is a GREAT way to get quality items easily and quickly. The remake of The Italian Job is a great movie that I very much enjoyed. The original has a bit more depth. Michael Caine rocks. It's has a more classic feel but somehow more genuine. Yet neither of the two will disappoint. Some stories actually do carry over into \\"modern\\" times well. This is certainly one of them. But, my personal favorite is the original. Glad I made the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original Italian Job","review":"This was an excellent, movie, great combination of actors, especially with Micheal Caine, Noel Coward and Benny HIll.Extremely funny done to the end.

It goes to show how far movies have come since thenThis was painful at times to watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but Fun","review":"Once you get used to the thoroughly dated look and feel of this film and settle back to watch the 'pros' pull off the heist, it's a 'kick'. This is one of the 60's 'madcap' caper genre from Britain where the loose ends might continually slap you in the face but watching the youthful Michael Caine, the suave Noel Coward and the rest of the excallent cast 'pull your leg' right up to the bizarre ending is a great time. Not too much 'characterization' other than the actor's own but lots of chases all done with a wink of the eye. If you want to sample the 'different world' of the 1960's or maybe remember it, this is a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent copy","review":"The Italian Job, Special Collector's Edition, brings a high quality copy of the 1969 classic.Excellent sound and image.

Not just Minis but a lot of Alfa Romeos, Lamborghinis, Jaguars, Dino Fiats and Aston Martins."},{"rating":"1","title":"you've got to be kidding...","review":"I had heard the original version of \\"The Italian Job\\" was a great movie. I liked the new version that came out a few years ago and thought maybe the original would also be good. Unfortunately this has to qualify as one of the all time worst most boring stupid movies of all time. I can't imagine how the creators of the new one even considered a remake. It's good that there is virtually no similarity between this and the newer movie. It's just plain boring! I don't think this disc will be taking up space in my DVD shelves, it just ends up in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what all the fuss was about?","review":"I'd read about this movie for years in my British movie magazines. Apparently it's an institution over there. I can't imagine why. It's a badly dated film that plods along without any discernable humor or wit. Most of the dialogue is just characters endlessly explaining the plot, which still makes little sense despite all this exposition.The direction is badly paced and unfocused and the actors are eithed adrift or worse, like the talentless girl who plays Caine's girlfriend and sounds like she's reading her lines off cuecards while stoned. Yes she's gorgeous, but couldn't they have found a girl who could look good and also believably portray a human being.I wanted to turn this thing off by ten minutes in, but forced myself to keep it on in hopes that it would improve. It didn't. Avoid this at all costs, it's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!?","review":"Maybe I just don't get it but this movie was choppy and difficult to follow. And the ending was quite a let-down. The remake (2003-4?) was much much better.Get the original Ocean's 11 (with the Rat Pack) instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"In the late 60's, this movie might have been reviewed as a \\"whimsical farce\\" or some other such nonsense. I saw it last night. It was a waste of time. Michael Caine is supported by a large group of poorly trained actors in a movie that looks like some kid directed it while his dad was out to lunch. The almost nonexistent score consists of a few random notes and a very boring refrain near the end of the movie. I have great respect for Caine as an actor and I've enjoyed his work in many films since, but this must have been one he had to do to pay the rent.This is certainly one time where the remake is much better than the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie has stuck in my mind for years","review":"I saw this movie years ago and forgot its title. I kept telling people about the great moments and the premise -- Michael Caine a bit dimwitted with a rep as a master thief. Couldn't get anyone excited about it, so now I'm going to make them watch the video. The interview with the \\"king\\" in the prison bathroom, the mini cars zipping around the Fiat test track, the cliffhanger ending. I was in England recently and the London paper considered this a classic sleeper, possibly cult movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brit classic","review":"Reminded of this movie when seeing chase scene in recent released RONIN, I first saw this epic when first released in my home country in 1969. Stunned to find the VHS available, the whole movie reminded me of how well simple movies were made back then. Caine was superb, and was Noel Coward. Always thought the ending lacked substance. Having lived in the UK back then and drove a mini, I can assure you it was authentic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time","review":"Funny story, pretty girls, exotic cars, breathtaking European scenery.

Until recently I had believed that in fact this fil was a figment of my imagination and all the details were jumbled.I first remembered that Michael Caine was in it and then it was just a matter of time. I believed it was all about Monaco and then I heard Mr. Caine interviewed and he mentioned this film.I ordered it here. I watched it and thirty years after it was filmed its even more stylish, hip, sexy, and dashing than it was even ten years ago.Buy it. Own it. Don't wait for serendipity. It needs to be yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time classic car chase!","review":"This is the kind of movie that you see once by chance, then you have to see it again. There is so much more character development in this original version than you find in the 2003 remake. I recently bought both versions from Amazon, as they each have their own \\"style\\", but the original is from a time when there was no senseless violence, over-the-top graphics, or requisite vulgarity. A great bonus on the original DVD is the theatrical trailers, and documentatries on the making of the movie.This is a great Sunday afternoon \\"fun\\" car movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing & blundering","review":"I absolutely loved the remake -- partly because I'm very fond of those very sexy Minis -- so I was looking forward to watching the original, but this one's a bust. The movie drags, the superb actor Michael Caine comes across as oafish, the comedy comes across as inexplicable, and even the car chase scenes leave you wanting. In short, this one's worth skipping. Watch the new one if you've any interest in good car chases, reasonably interesting dialogue, or even a plot that makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"There is some good stuff there, however, it is not funny, it is predictable and it is slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy","review":"Some movies age well. This isn't one of them. Too much focus on what studs the guys are, and what totally clueless sex objects the women are. It's not even fun to watch as a period piece.

This one may be good for those that know nothing about Katt Williams. Not sure if Katt had anything to do with this one but I will say, THIS WAS NOT EXPECTED. The selling point should not be \\"never-before-seen stand-up from Katt's early career\\", this gives the illusion that there is going to be some comedy involved (whether we've seen it or not). There was little to no comedy on this dvd; a lot of talk about Katt's life. We've see enough of that on television so spare me.

Now I am no wiz with wires when it comes to stereo equiptment. But I must say this set up went without a hitch. I now can play the tv sound thru my JVC (NON-HDMI) receiver. The picture is great. The wife was always asking why do we need an HDTV? Well after she saw the picture on this unit she was spellbound. And get this....the DirecTV HD receiver has not arrived yet!!!!....

This has not been a good experience. Anyone else had these problems?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HDTV!","review":"So far this TV has been great. You really need to have an HD signal to appreciate the picture, however; viewing non-HD channels after watching HD channels is really disappointing. I don't have an HD DVD player, but regular DVD's look just fine on it. It seems that the signal is better using the component inputs rather than the HDMI input, but that might be because I bought a cheap HDMI cable. I looked at four different models in a store before I ordered this one, and this model had by far the best picture when viewing from a side angle; I find the side angle viewing to be impressive now that it is in my home. The built-in speakers give excellent sound and volume. I now have two of these TV's in my house and am quite happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture","review":"The Sony picture lives up to all the expectations.

The picture is sharp and clear and when playing movies on a Sony Blu-Ray player it's simply amazing. It seemed kind of weird to order a TV from amazon, but their price was the best to begin with and when they lowered their price a week after I ordered it, they credited my account for the difference.

And Alicia shows her years of performance experience has she effortlessly changes from her well-known high-energy little-girl voice to a more emotional, sultry voice on 'Soy Tu Muejer' and 'Culpable O Inocente'. Her voice is just absolutely incredible.Also, this CD supplies a hefty dose of the modernized uptempo Cumbia and Tejano rhythms similar to the last couple Limite CDs along with a couple of ballads thrown in for good measure.

I only wish there was more foxtrot music on the cd. That is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.Why waste the money on dance classes.

I must also point out that a lot of dialogue's been cut.But all these things don't matter; the music is simply GREAT. The \\"Mazurka de las Sombrillas\\" is one of the best things ever written and most of the arias could rival with the ones written by Puccini or Verdi.I totally recommend this DVD and I really hope that in the future some other zarzuelas sang by people like these can be released on this format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled by the set!!","review":"Based on other reviews I had high expectations for this but the production was spoiled for me by the use of a bright, white screen as a background for almost the entire production!

But I couldn't get past the background!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually unatractive","review":"In my opinion, opera should be fun to watch, not just fun to listen to. On this performance the staging is minimal and the wardrobe is plain and unatractive. There is what seems to be a projection screen behind the performers which presents a white rectangle on a black background that grows or shrinks according to the action. That is the sum total of the scenography for this opera, aside for some chairs and tables used by the performers on stage (!). Given the fact that the singing and the orchestral performance on this disc are excellent, this poor scenographic choice detracts from the value of the performance.

About 25% represents Parcels' philosophies on life, football, family, and friends, etc., and I would rate that at best a C-. Overall the book is a major flop. Don't waste your money on this one.

PEPPER'S or OK COMPUTER in terms of its scope and power.As for the new mix, it will blow your mind if you've got 5.1 sound and what not. It's all over the room, jumping from speaker to speaker and making full use of the soundscape.

If you read the liner notes that come with the album, for example, you'll see that on one track, they simply move the sound around the room in a clockwise direction. On another the bass moves around on every single note. It's almost like they had some presets they could program in rather than really looking at the music and thinking about what would sound best. Rather it sounds like they're \\"playing\\". Not that it's a bad mix. The Lips have a quirky sound, so a slightly quirky mix is not all bad. If something like a Led Zeppelin album were mixed like this, it would be awful. Since it's the Lips, it works okay.But simply moving the audio around the room quickly or on every note does *not* make an \\"awesome\\" mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ADORE these bottles!","review":"Even bottles that have age-appropriate nipples have a tendency to \\"drown\\" my 6-month-old daughter, and that's when I give her the newborn nipple! The Second Nature system certainly lives up to its name--she has no problem whatsoever switching between me and her bottles because they work so similarly to my body, only giving her as much as she sucks. The nipples are shaped quite differently from those of other bottles, which turns some people off, but the texture is so soft that my daughter has never seemed to notice anything amiss as she latches on to it, again, just as she does to me.I would highly recommend these bottles to anyone, but especially to those using both bottle and breast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breast Feeding Must","review":"I recently went back to work and my 3mos old son has to take a bottle while I'm at work. With regular bottles he was having a hard time going back and forth because the bottles are \\"free\\" flow. I found the Second Nature bottles and have been thrilled with the results! It has been much easier for him to go back and forth and my husband loves the wide mouth so it's easy to clean. I was ready to give up breast feeding until I found these bottles. I would highly recomend them and do so to all new moms I know - breast feeding or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"When first introducing the bottle to my 4 week old we tried the second nature as well as the playtex nurser bottle. With the second nature bottle the end of the nipple is flat and there is a small ridge that surrounds it. It also lacks a \\"latch on\\" base so when we gave it to the baby she lunged at it to latch on and choked herself. We prefer playtex because she latches on better. Just keep the bottle straight so it doesn't flow too fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"After a year or two the Korky valve starts to pulse when it shuts off. Cleaning the diaphragm buys a little time, but the only cure is to replace the diaphragm. This completely fixes the problem and is far easier than replacing the whole valve. This was an economical place to purchase it since they didn't overcharge for postage. To save further, I purchased two diaphragms at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks worse than...","review":"Leaks worse than the 10 year old part it was supposed to replace.

It was a total dissapointment. I mean there were people in the video that i had never heard of. The only good part in the video is for about 10 min, they show the boys when they were really young. It was like a homevideo thing. It is not a must have, but like me if you are a big fan you pobably will get it regardless of what people tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BSBfanfever.<3","review":"I have seen Video Hits Chapter One and that ranked way higher than this movie. Don't get me wrong i'm a huge fan of bsb, i have almost every song ever made but this movie is not worth buying .you might like the 15 minutes of the backstreet boys. The rest of the hour is taken up by back stage guys. If your looking for a movie with back stage footage this is not the one so keep looking. I hope this was helpful. This movie deserves half a star.

I have every one of their movies, including this one. This movie doesn't even include very much of them, though. Most of it is people talking about them. Plus, it was filmed so long ago, that they are WAY young. I would really recommend something more recent, like their new Homecoming: Live in Orlando one! I LOVE YOU BRIAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you get only ONE BSB video, don't get this one","review":"This video was not bad as much as it was stuff that most fans already know. There was footage from some interviews that haven't been seen in the U.S. but the narration was rather annoying with a thick accent and details any fan already knows. I would recommend that anyone who is getting a Backstreet Boys video consider \\"A Night out with the Backstreet Boys\\", \\"Live in Orlando\\", or \\"Live in concert\\" if you want live performance and \\"All Access\\" or \\"Backstreet Boys the Video\\". This video is unauthorized and the authorized videos have better footage and more interesting comentary because they assume you are a fan if you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, not the best, but worth watching.","review":"well, its not that good. its worth watching because of the behind the scenes of when they started out, nick looks so little. All of them do. but its pretty bad footage and its the same thing over and over. I would not personally recomend it but it does have some perks. It would be worth like renting and watching if it were available but not to own and watch over and over. Get the Live In Concert Video if you want a good one to watch, or even The Video, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE WORD- STINKS!","review":"so i'm glad i own this thing because it DOES have about 15 minutes of clips of the guys when they were jsut starting out, yknow, NICK, was like 13, all the guys are still in school practically. but the entire video is LOU PERLMAN talking about how he MADE them. That's about it. just DO NOT BUY IT! you can HAVE MINE! well not really, but just dont."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB video, gotta be good right?","review":"I think that this is not the best video because it is an unauthorized video and they probably did not have a real camera man. The rest of the video was funny though. They were all sooo young. Especially Nick, he was only about 13 or 14. He was so cute, he even said at one point in the video that he was joking about having a girlfriend and then he looked into the camera and said something along the lines of \\"all you girls out there, your my girlfriend.\\" How cute! This is a must have for any BSB fan. You'll get some laughs out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your money","review":"I have the video, and dont get me wrong I love the Boys but this video stunk. It was poor quality and the people had VERY limited footage which they kept repeating over and over again. I guess this would be a \\"must have\\" for some teeny-bopper but really if your smart you wont wast your money like I did. (and plus, all the stuff they said I knew already. And it was VERY REPETATIVE! )"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY","review":"My suggestions for this video would be not to buy it, first off it is unauthorized so someone is taking advantage of the boys, plus it is all old footage, with no interviews or anything, so as far as we know all the information could be false. I think you would be better off getting one of there other videos like Homecoming: Live in Orlando, that is a great concert on tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this video and was very sorry that I did. I love the Backstreet Boys & was glad to see that they were not shown in a bad light, but the video does not give the whole story. It gives half-truths & a lot of innuendo. The only nice thing about the movie is the old home movies. It was strange seeing the \\"Boys\\" when they were so much younger than they are now.Too bad that I could not have given the movie \\"0\\" stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young and Restless Backstreet","review":"This video rules if you want to see how they started and where they came from this is a great video. the camera shakes a lot because it's mostly home videos. If you want to see the boys when they were young this is a great video to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video was pretty good but old info","review":"This video is nice because of the boys but also for the reason that it is short 1hr. so you can watch it fast. I didn't like the interviews with the journalists because all I want to see are the guys and what they have to say. This video is really good otherwise. I wanted to say to all the other B-ROK fans- GET OFF HE IS MINE! I love you Brian. You are too sweet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video!","review":"The first part is my favourite! It's about the boys when they first started. They were SO young! Like the pics you can see in the official book!(red cover) Nick was just 13-14, I guess.

From the moment I picked it up I could not put the story down.I only wish there was a part two!I would and have highly recommended this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Learning Experience","review":"This book was one that I could not put down. It was depressing and intriguing at the same time. It reminded me of a soap opera almost due to all the different characters and their entanglment with each other. Adrian Nicole Leblanc did a great job. Read this book if you'd like a taste of what growing up in the Bronx is like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to confirm your prejudice (whatever it happens to be)","review":"If you are inclined to believe that the welfare system denies poor women adequate resources to take care of themselves and their children, and the criminal justice system perpetuates the plight of poor men of color, this book will confirm that view.If you are included to believe that the women on welfare are lazy, stupid, immoral, and neglectful of their children, and that poor men of color end up in jail because they're lazy, stupid, and immoral, too, and that they neglect their children and abuse their women as a matter of course, than this book will confirm that view, too.If the authors could have found case studies with more nuance, more gray, that might really have made this book useful -- there is a lot of critical public policy being made these days around issues of poverty, crime, and inner-city education, and a book like this in approach, with different subjects, might have been able to influence a lot of decisionmakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This book sounded so interesting I couldn't wait to read it. what a disappointment! The writing was awful. There was almost no dialogue. No character development at all. It reads like \\"first so and so has a baby. Then she leaves it with this person. Than this other person has a kid too. than they both go out and party.\\" absolutely terrible. There are so many characters you can't keep them straight. Since you don't really know anything about any of them you really don't care what happens.

Really painful to follow their inevitable foibles and complacent attitudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great story, very interesting concept.

A \\"Dramatis Personae\\" would be very useful.The book is a not much more that a descriptive chronology with too few observations and distillations by the author. It's also long and the story could have been effectively told with 50% fewer pages.Given that the subjects' lives are not inherently that interesting, Le Blanc needs to add something. After while it all starts to blur and, in the absence of an thematic development by the author, you wonder why are wading through this."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book fantastic book!","review":"This book is truly a work of art and many times, I \\"left\\" my world to visit Cocoa's world or Jessica's world and loved every minute of it. Sometimes, I re-read chapters because of the beauty in which she presented their story, their lives, their pains. I really fell in love with the people in this book - I felt like I lived in the same small apartments and lived through their experiences. You were truly transported into Tremont Ave.I want to thank the author so much. I often read books that I like or hate, rarely do I finish a book that I love and I really loved this book.

I was so awed by this work, that for the first time ever, I wrote to the author to express my gratitude for writing it. At first, it was difficult to comprehend the complexities of a culture do different from my own. As I progressed through the book, I developed a better understanding of the people and their struggles and choices they face daily. This book is a must read, it opens minds and develops a greatly needed awareness."},{"rating":"2","title":"The South Bronx","review":"Having known Boy George back in the eighty's and spending all my life in the South Bronx.

I'd like to say it changed my life - it has made me ask myself some questions I haven't asked in a long while. As a person, a woman, a mother - I found this book beautifully written and ultimately heartbreaking. Yet it was worth the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but too long","review":"I usually finish books in a week or two, but this book took me about 2 months to finish. The first half of the book was interesting and I kept thinking there would be a climax coming, but there never was. The second half of the book seemed to drag on and on, and I couldn't wait till it ended. The subject was interesting and some plots were unbelievable, but it never really had an official ending or climax. I understand it was a non-fiction but it bored me to death. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, fast shipment","review":"Shipment was fast and the book is great. Had no problems with this seller and though this book was recommended for a graduate course, I would have enjoyed reading it for leisure only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kinda thing.","review":"This book seemed as though it had potential but after reading it I realized it read like a long outline or something? Like a synopsis of the story instead of really getting into it. My two stars are way too much for this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"At least this book has the merit of not glamorizing a hard and painful lifestyle. On the other hand, it doesn't much reveal it as human, either. The book is written in a cold, neutral, deadly dull style that disinvites even the reader who was originally interested in the book. The book is written in the currently fashionable minimalist and deconstructive style, and it so objectifies and dehumanizes the central human characters that it could be portraying beetles, trees, or even nonhuman events with about the same amount of lack of human feelings, concerns, and credibility. It was a huge, huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"While reading this book, I noticed a lot of familiar things. I see these types of situations going on everyday, but for someone to capture the very essence of this lifestyle is truly amazing. Ms. LeBlanc wrote about the things that most people choose to ignore and turn their shoulder away from as if it doesn't exist. When I first started reading the book, I couldn't put it down, as I got further along, it did kind of slow down, but it eventually picked right back up. Also, this book was very unpredictable. I expected everything to turn out all right in the end, but I would realize that this is a true story, not a fiction. Overall, this was a great book, and I recommend it to anyone interested in what really goes on in poverty-stricken neighborhoods and how people cope with the disadvantages that life throws them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great piece of non-fiction","review":"My friend recommended this book to me and I asked her what type of book it was. When she told me that it was non-fiction, I informed her that I wanted to read a \\"story\\". She told be to just READ this book, and I am so glad that I did. Few fiction books manage to tell a tale as beautifully as LeBlanc's Random Family. After reading the stories of Jessica, Coco, Caesar, and others, you are left with an overwhelming yearning to find out how their lives turned out after this story was written. You will most likely gain a new thankfulness for your position in life even if you are \\"poor\\", because these people are beyond that word. It is amazing how LeBlanc puts a human face to those who may be that janitor's in your building, the homeless person at a shelter, or the 20 year old girl on the bus with 5 kids. This is one of the most moving books that I have ever read. A+++++........."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Helped Me Better Understand the Culture of Poverty","review":"I could not put this book down. I come from such a different background, yet I identified so much with these women in their struggles for love, acceptance and security. The valiant attempts of CoCo and Jessica to survive was mind boggling and inspiring. The author really captured the entire culture in a way that was neither condescending nor pitying.My only complaint with the book was at times it was hard to believe these women went back to the men and the life that had so harmed them. Although true to life, it was hard to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad Slice of Life, Well Told","review":"This book reflects with painful accuracy the cruel existence of so many poor people in the United States, particularly in New York. Walking these same streets every day, I can say that LeBlanc has captured the very essence of the lives of these people. It is not until one spends time--real time--in a community like the one described here, that one can understand the thinking that goes on. Babies being raised by grandmothers and greatgrandmothers, children being sexually abused by boyfriends of grandmothers, kids being carted off to see their parents in prison. These are real, everyday happenings. This book serves well as a warning call: Unless and until we--those of us who do not live in such an environment--are willing to help make things better, more and more children will be lost to this impossible existence. The author did a beautiful job of showing life as it is, and sadly will be for a long time to come, for so many poor people."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do professional reviewers like this one so much?","review":"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Anna Quindlen raved about it months before its publication. Other reviewers gave it glowing reviews. So when I began this book and found it boring and dull and monotonous, I wondered what was wrong with me! This book was a terrible disappointment--there's nothing in it but a recitation of daily goings-on among the various mostly unappealing residents of one Bronx neighborhood. There's no insight from the author and nothing to pull the book together. I do not recommend this one whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale about hoodrats","review":"These people live like cockroaches. Both sexes have a complete lack of stability. Constant shuffling around and having sex with whomever,there is an abject lack of self-worth in contrast to the dual presence of poverty and material wealth. I didn't even reach 200 pages. Stories like these are interesting only if you haven't witnessed it. I have seen much of this in my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A challenging book","review":"The people in this book have lots of sex, the guys sell drugs, the guys beat the women, the guys verbally abuse the women, the women have babies, the women keep coming back for more abuse and sex, the guys go to jail, the women go to jail. There are many, many characters in this book, most of whom have funny names. These characters drift in and out of the action and it's very, very hard to keep track of them. I guess this book provides insight into how one segment of society lives but reading it is like doing an assignment for sociology class.This is a non-fiction book but I am wondering how this author was a fly on the wall of these people's most intimate moments for years and years. I think it would be odd having a writer hanging around your house recording everything that went on for for, like, ten years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but not very good","review":"I was surprised to find wasabi peanuts for such a low price, but after receiving them I now know why. These will certainly clear your sinuses, but quality is poor. These would best be described as one part tiny, stale peanut and four parts crunchy wasabi coating dumped into 2 one pound bags.

These peanuts are covered first in a layer of soybean paste than a very thin coating of wasabi for color. I would say they are using a green food colored horseradish not true wasabi.If you like something crunchy and very mild heat, buy these. They are like eatting M&M; candies.

Unfortunately, she is too busy talking about herself, her daughter, her makeupartist - and everything BUT what she should be talking about. She goes on and on about how great her workouts are and how many celebrities and athletes she has trained. However, she gives very little instruction on how to do the exercises and very little advice on form. I don't have the time or patience to use the pause or slow motion button to figure out what exactly she is doing. Good form is the single most important factor while doing any exercize because without good form, you will not get the benefits of the exercise and you could possibly get injured. After trying this workout three times and still not quite sure on how to master the exercises, I've given up on the esmonde technique.... There's just too much guess work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Video","review":"This is NOT a stretch video. The \\"Athletes Intense Stretch\\" portion is an aerobics routine that looks like a mix between tai-chi and jazzercise. The only moves resembling stretching are dynamic, bouncing movements, which is the incorrect way to stretch.

I feel great after doing it and it shows. Definately check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"Well, I really liked this book too. I thought Lindsey and Judd had great chemistry and I really liked Judd's character (a typical sullen male)!! The way Judd reacted to certain situations was so male specific, I had to laugh. And of course I can't wait for Griffs and Nics book next year. Hurry up Mrs. Barton!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?!","review":"Too bad 1 star's the lowest rating that you could give a book...I'd give this a negative star if I could.This is just too gruesome for my taste. And I get the impression that the author really enjoys these violent scenes because there's just too many pages devoted to their graphic description. Even the ending isn't all that satisfying.With all these scenes depicting violence against women, I just can't believe that a woman would write this book! I honestly wouldn't classify this book as a romantic suspense... it's more like horror with a couple of sex thrown in.I actually did hear and read a lot of negative feedbacks about this book but I thought it couldn't be that bad since this is Beverly Barton, for crying out loud! Obviously, I should have just listened and not wasted my money buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was Barton For This One?","review":"I'm a fan of Beverly Barton because of the fast pace and suspence she puts in all her books...except this one.

This was Bartons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"Although I generally love Beverly Barton, there have been a couple of her books that have lacked her normal luster. This wasnt that bad per se but honestly, the main female lead, Lindsey McAllister, killed me. Im not one to dislike the weaker female leads but this was ridiculous. The girl had not one ounce of integrity or self respect and for the first time in any romantic book I have ever read I found myself wishing she would leave him. Who could stand it. I actually liked Judd more than I like her. However the story itself was good. Worth the read if youve got nothing else but I cant say I wasnt disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful Characters","review":"While the plotline of this book was interesting, I knew who the killer was immediately upon being \\"introduced\\" to him. Beverly Barton should've been less obvious about that because it really took away from the enjoyment of the storyline, which was otherwise decent.But I can only give it 2 stars because the characters were awful, especially Lindsay. What a pathetic, disgusting excuse for a woman. And Judd wasn't much better. It was hard to care about either of them or hope for anything other than them both being killed by the BQK.I hope the next book, which looks to be a continuation of this one that focuses on Griff and Nic, is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's only one reason to read this book!","review":"Beverly Barton usually delivers, but she lost me with The Dying Game. The lead characters are pathetic, needy, and unlikable. By the end of the book, I didn't care what happened to them. The only reason you should read this book is to get the background set up on Grif and Nic. Now there's a pair I'm looking forward to reading more about. Grif and Nic outshine the lead couple so much so that I found myself skimming parts just to get to Grif and Nic's interactions. Grif is really overbearing, but I have a feeling Nic is going to knock him down a peg or two in the next book in the series. The story line in The Dyine Game will keep you interested but you'll definitely get tired of the lead couple. Guaranteed! Treat this book as a prequel to the \\"real\\" story that's coming in Febuary, 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad, bad, bad","review":"The characters are annoying, unlikable and stereotypical. I was skimming through the pages at the end of the book. Not a good sign. There are also some blatant author errors, like a pregnancy where the birth is 10 months away, and a major clue thrown to this brilliant detective agency and the FBI that went completely unnoticed. If you're into the 70-80's style of romance writing that makes the guy a jerk and the girl an idiot, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Grusome for my taste...","review":"I bought this book before I read the previous reviews or I probably wouldn't have bought it. After reading 'The Dying Game', I find that I'm not in agreement with those reviews. While it was a bit too graphic for my tastes, the desire to see these sick murderers brought to justice drove me to read on. This is not a romance novel so I don't understand why the previous reviewers hated the main characters in the book. Judd was fighting his own demons and not the typical romantic male lead that overcomes adversity easily. Lindsay loved him enough to help him fight those demons even though her assistance was not initially appreciated by Judd.I loved the ending and also look forward to the next book but thought this was worth the read for its own story and not just for the introduction to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My God","review":"Please, reader of reviews, dismiss A. Nguyen's words. The poor lad has no idea who Fritz Leiber is, and seems to be a heathen by saying not to pay even ten bucks for this.

Although, Dark Horse is gonna publish, in November I think, the first volume of comics/ graphic novels based on Leiber's Lankhmar tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in good conditions","review":"The book is not in good conditions, Pages are highlitghed and have drawings, it hasn't meet my expectations, you can buy a new one in perfect conditions for just few more bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprofessional","review":"I recently had the opportunity to hear this man rant in the most unprofessional and bitter speech I have ever heard. It was too late for me...I had already purchased several of his books. They immediately went into the garbage where they belong! Teaching is my passion. I cherish the opportunity to work with every child. I was sad that this man represents teaching to many.

What about providing them with sound instruction? This is not something this man supports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Very pleased with the service.

There is some good advice in the book about techniques and publishing but the CREATIVE part that sucks me in was just not there!This books is more for the real serious writer wanting to know the ends and outs of what do with your writings once you have mastered your creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint hearted.","review":"Fictional account of two black young adults going from being for the most part normal people descending from that to full blown heroin addicts seemingly overnight. Also delves into the lives of other characters in the drug scene, one dealer in particular and a few other addicts. The author of this book, Donald Goines, along with Iceberg Slim (Iceberg Slim actually came first and was a big influence on Goines) more or less created the ghetto crime fiction genre. This wasn't a bad read but I found it to be a depressing story to read. I liked it but I wouldn't recomend it to the faint hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heironymous Bosch on Dope","review":"A brilliantly written and pitiless look into the mind and behavior of the dopefiend. Not a social commentary and neither is it trolling for sympathy. This is as bad as the human condition can get without the characters being afflicted with a cruel and/or psychotic predisposition to begin with. Find your way past the first chapter and you will feel yourself plunging ahead, sucked along by the inevitability of a powerful monster force. It is a great narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the head of a true dopefiend","review":"This was a very exciting book specifically because of it was told in the voice of a dopefiend and most other books that tell stories don't know what actually happens but this is a dopefiend and he knows what goes on and I just feel that it had a lot of insight and will help people understand more why people actually are pulled when pressured and how violence ties in to this lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Real","review":"This book was very realistic, i love this author and since reading this book i have purchased more of his books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Grody","review":"This book was a big hit in the drug treatment center where I teach. However, I could not get past the first chapter, as it was really graphic and upsetting, to me. Of course, I want my students to read, but I think I may have just been encouraging most of them to mentally relapse. I don't know what to think, but I won't be reading this book any time soon. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY A PAGE TURNER","review":"I read this book in one day. Once i opened the first page i could not put it down.

Donald tells the story of what happens when two young people go down the wrong hill of being drug abusers. I found the story of the young woman's spiral downhill to be alot more intresting to the read than her boyfriend's sprawl back and forth to the den. I found her conflict to be more troubling honest and heartfelt. I recommend this book as it is probably the most gut wrenching read on a drug addicts life and how they go back and forth from their own reality to the fanciful free fall into drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"dopefiend","review":"Donald Goines' is the preferred author for readers who can appreciate a sincere depiction of gritty urban life. His characters suffer with addiction phsychosis and embrace violence with an undaunted willingness. Goines, amongst others relays tales of the gangsta drug subculture, which apparently he became engrossed. Goines significance is enhanced when considering all the individuals who only read this material since it applies so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, terrible shipping and condition","review":"I ordered this for my wife for Christmas and recieved it very quickly. I guess for the price there is not much to complain about but the item was not in it's factory packaging although it was included in the shipping box. As a result it is marred and scratched up pretty badly and on of the mounting screws is missing.

But, like the weather, everyone talks about the issue and no-one does anything about it. Eccles et al have -- they have put forward concrete suggestions for making progress on this difficult issue. Congratulations also for the lucid and interesting prose style. This book belongs on every executive's book shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling read","review":"The ValueReporting Revolution is one of the best, if not THE best, financial book that I have read in the last few years.

A must read for both the investing community, who need to understand a company's true value, and the financial community, who report on and create a company's value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ValueReporting Revolution","review":"The ValueReporting Revolution brings together an astounding amount of real, relevant (and highly controversial) information on how the capital markets currently function, a terrific framework for understanding what is needed to enable greater transparency and therefore efficiency, and compelling arguments for change.Remarkably entertaining given the seriousness and ground-breaking nature of its central thesis.An important read for corporates hoping to understand how to achieve better public market valuations, and for buy and sell side analysts concerned about current industry trends."},{"rating":"1","title":"this thing sucks","review":"this thing broke in the the first time i used it the parts just fall right out of thhe lighter and the parts are very flimsey so if you try to fix i the parts just break i do not think this was a good buy on my part"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I was looking for a flint operated lighter with the same diameter and length as a cigarette.

I was further amazed when I learned that the government criminally prosecuted those among them who resisted the draft. This book tells this incredible story with balance, grace, and insight. The pages pull you along as you quickly get wrapped up in the lives of the resisters and those in the government and in their own ethnic community who opposed them. The highpoint of the book for me was Muller's account of the one resisters' trial that did not result in convictions. A lone federal district court judge bucked the government and dismissed the charges on the grounds that they offended basic notions of due process. This last story is a \\"profile in courage\\" particularly appropriate to our current circumstances. Read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Bad","review":"I had looked forward to reading this book. Alas, there is something that is not quite right with it. First of all, McAmis' definition of Malay is quite misleading. His definition is a bit too liberal and too broad. Malay first and foremost in today's terminological use refers to Malays in Malaysia. While some Malays in Malaysia are likely to see Southern Filipinos, Indonesians, etc as their distant kinsmen, they're not very likely to call them Malays. 'Malay' is very strictly defined in legal terms in Malaysia. To broaden this definition as McAmis does is akin to saying that Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians, Laotians are all 'essentially' Chinese. Apart from that, McAmis' research into Islamism in SEA isn't too illuminating. Judith Nagata has, in her essays, done a much better job. She has written about the dakwah movement and given such details that I am, as a Malaysian, completely amazed by how much she managed to ferret out of these communities."},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete","review":"It is christmas eve and we just opened this for my grandson.

The author took newspaper clippings and formed the book. He quotes himself throughout the book. Some of the challenges he has in the book are uninformed. Throughout the book he challenges government agencies and law enforcement. In the security field, the professional must partner with those organizations. I felt he discredited himself by page 100 and at that point, I found it difficult to read.

If I unplug the FS-6 to turn it off, and the other end is still plugged into the amp's select/solo footswitch jack, it locks up the amp into LEAD/SOLO mode, and manual switches on the amp can't change channels.

Not everyone wants a phone/computer/camera/e-mail retriever/Klingon translator/backhoe/satellite TV. Some of us just want a dependable phone with outstanding battery life, solid reception that doesn't drop calls and sounds good. This sturdy little unit does all that with aplomb, takes bearable pictures, has a very decent speakerphone, is bluetooth capable, and has PTT for those so inclined. I weathers abuse well and the battery life runs circles around every cell phone I've had previously. If you want a phone that does everything under the sun, but none of it very well, this is not the phone for you. If you're intent on a phone that is an outstanding phone, this unit should be on your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough","review":"I've had this phone for almost a week, and so far I am very pleased with the performance. It's a little thicker than most flip phones, but seems a lot more durable. My previous phone was the V220, and the transition to this one is seamless. This phone has everything I was looking for, bluetooth, mp3 capability (with purchase of micro-SD memory card), camera (VGA) with video capability. I used the phone mostly to check e-mail, but calls I've made with the phone are clear and loud. The duplex speakerphone is clear and loud, the music tones sound great! This phone also has Push-to-Talk capability (optional, service plan required), which if it's not used, doesn't get in the way. The phone has 5mb of storage built in, plenty for pictures and sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a cell phone that does what a cell phone should do.","review":"I've been using cell phones now since the \\"bag phone\\" first came out, and have seen phones go from great tools, to too small, and now, every gimmick you can think of.This phone does what technology should bring. After living with Nokia for the last couple of years, I'm back with Motorola, and so glad. Great reception, easy to hear, battery life is unreal compared to smaller phones, intuitive menu and great features. Bluetooth works great. With a memory card I resized my favorite photos and put them in my phone. It is bigger than most flip phones I've had, but I actually like the size now that I've used it for some time. I hope they keep making this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mobile phone I ever owned, but not for everyone","review":"I love this phone. It is sturdy, great reception, great speaker phone, very loud ring, bluetooth, long battery life. Everything 'I' want in a phone. With that said. . .If you want light, thin, great QWERTY keyboard, touch-screen, awesome camera and use for interent, emails, messaging, etc., this is not the phone for you.I don't use this phone for anything except talking, and I have had it for almost 3 years. Some minor scratches on the screen over time, but I don't keep in a case, and am rough on the phone. Very rugged.Love it and will miss when it eventually dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, not terribly impressed","review":"Lack of concise important information.

Would pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Chapter","review":"Sure it's short-- but really distinctive. This one twists and twirls together 'western' legends-- Billy the Kid morphs into a story about a tragic pedal steel player (and back again), with pointed satirical and touching evocations of the West. Beauty, humor, tragedy, absurdity, lust and a changing, kinda wild landscape all around. And musically, he touches on stuff from \\"Sentimental Journey\\" to Hendrix-feedback, spoken word akin to a 'Texasfied' Firesign Theatre, Willie & Waylon, maybe Tom Russell or Ian Tyson's psychologically complex cowboy songs, and his own work. Can't say the themes aren't also in his other work-- but the concentration and sometimes pointed phrasing here make it worthwhile. Compelling I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lightweight camera","review":"I love the zoom range and clarity of the lens. 28mm is perfect for those indoor family shots and you still get a great telephoto zoom for sports, etc. It also has a compact, sturdy aluminum body that's very lightweight & reassuring.

I have used this many times in my backwater florida canal and works just fine to attract fish believe it or not. I am super happy because this worked out better then the more expensive fish light from Bass Pro"},{"rating":"1","title":"These lights do not work very long","review":"I purchased three of these fountain lights. Two of them broke in less than one year. I was quite satisfied with the product until they stopped functioning. There appears to be a quality control issue with this item which should be resolved. I cannot recommend this item to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great as a white light, not as colored","review":"I used this for an above ground pool I set up in my living room. Nice if you want to use it as a white light. Not designed well enough to use with the color gels. The gels slip over the light but do not fit flush with the rounded bulb. So you get a large ring of all white light, then color in the middle.I wanted a blue pool. I got a pool with bright white ring in it, than a much dimmer blue mood light. This unit also gets very hot, so if you use this in a fish pond, in the summer time you might cook your fish, in the winter they might love you for it. They should get with the times and use LED lights though, and fix the issue that makes this unusable as a colored light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big difference","review":"Installed the pond light and it made a big difference to a small fish pond.

Not happy with this product at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, great product","review":"I had an older model of this light for my fountain and broke it trying to replace the bulb.

The CD was issued by Naxos in 1995. You will not regret!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful music, but intolerable breathing","review":"I love this music of Faure. Wonderfully played, but sadly, I simply could not stand the heavy breathing and had to trash the disk after only one play. I just don't understand how the recording studio can issue it like this. They could have at least given the performer a tissue beforehand. I also scrapped all my Glenn Gould albums for his humming, so it gives you an idea where I stand on this \\"bonus\\" material.

I love the tone and enthusiasm that Mr. Shaham brings to his playing. This album immediately grabbed my attention upon pressing play.

As a thriller, this movie presents interesting issues; the plot is a bit stock, but the fun is in how the characters arrive at their respective impasses. This isn't a film that has you holding your breath, or even leaves you jolted in surprise. However, its dramatic qualities - how the characters are unable to excape their own destructive behaviour, and how the ensuing results intertwine - that make this an enjoyable film. Moreover, the acting is superb.Bottom line, this is a bit of a psycho-thriller mixed in with a bit of drama. Inside of either genre, it is interesting. This one shines in how it brings the two elements together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoky goodness.","review":"Amazing product.

Unfortunately, the latest volume doesn't come up to the standard set forth in the series so far. It reads like a rough draft turned in under a deadline. While the actual premise is interesting enough, it's both unoriginal and so far-fetched that it's hard for this ordinary person to care about it. The writing is wooden and stilted, more a recitation of events than a good story. The new characters are lifeless -- not even a budding romance has any real zing -- and the old characters are predictable. Nothing new is happening in the town of Crozet; let's eat some orange glazed cinnamon buns. Even the animals can't really save this one; they talk a lot but don't really contribute much. A fan of the series will want to read _Catch as Cat Can_, but get it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book can not decide whether to focus on the murder mystery at hand or the social lives of its characters. The animals have lots of dull philosophical conversations that are unecessary and take away from the story as a whole. \\"Catch as Cat Can\\" is easily the worst book in the Mrs. Murphy series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"So my girlfriend made me read this book. I almost broke up with her because of it. I mean, come on people! Nothing happens in the book, the cats who are supposed to help solve the \\"mystery\\" don't lift a paw, the whole thing is so bad and convoluted that at the end, the author has to explain to you all the things that happend that she couldn't manage to fit into the book somehow, so there was no way for you to even have any clue at all what was happening.Look, I love cats. They're cool. This book made me want to kick cats and the author. Don't waste your time unless you like falling asleep in the middle of scenes that are supposed to be \\"action\\" or getting really angry that you paid for this book.

Again, Brown wraps up the plot neatly in the last few pages using information never divulged in the book -- is the mystery why anyone bothers to read a mystery that can't be deduced from the clues present in the book? And again, the animals get all the best lines. It would help if the humans got as much character development as the cats, dog, and horses (not to mention the owl and the blue jay!)And where's an editor when you need one -- to remind the author that her main character has always been a blonde?Bottom line -- not worth the time or the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad karma.","review":"If you are looking for junk to read this is the book to do it with. The only descent thing about it is that darling Rita has finally gotten around to calling Cynthia Cooper a deputy sheriff (which she is) rather than a police officer (which she isn't). It will be interesting to see if this holds true in the rest of the forthcoming books Rita insults our intelligence with in the Murphy series.This book, like the rest of the Murphy series, if basiclly for those of us with nothing better to do.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Mary Minor Hairsteen is a plucky, independent woman with loyal animal companions she adores, and who adore her.

There appears to be a lot of deaths - one looked like natural causes, one looked like suicide and one was murder, but as Harry and her pals delve deeper into the mire, it appears that the deaths are all connected and they were all murder. This book moves along at a pretty swift pace, and we have lots of hijinks with the fabulous thres pets as well as more contact with our old friends in Crozet. This is a great cozy series, and because of that we get to become good friends with the good citizens of Crozet.

Still, there needs to be just a little reality.A perfectly healthy young man falls dead at a party. A sheriff's deputy is there--yet NO ONE tries CPR. No one calls the paramedics, either. No one considers that it might be a crime scene, not does anyone try to convince the decedent's brother he ought to have an autopsy. (I believe in some jurisdictions an autopsy would be required for such a suspicious death. Even if not required by law, surely the law enforcement officers would encourage one.)Others' points about the quality of editing are also true.The illustrations are even more charming than usual, and almost worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"Having followed the Mrs. Murphy mysteries over the years, I am sorry to say that this volume leaves me wanting... wanting a good mystery! Ms Brown seems to have dipped into a formula method for compiling her books. What started the series as bright, witty and compelling, now lacks style, substance and charm. The animals have become more vocal and unbelievable with each new volume and the sidebars into instructional content and social commentary are too distracting. Perhaps it's time to put Mrs. Murphy and friends away for a bit until a real plot surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, worth the $$","review":"Bought this for my boyfriend, who is a sound engineer.

Overall I give this movie a two thumbs up if you're into action mixed with real emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and entertaining","review":"For the elementary school set, this book is filled with humor that will tickle the funny bone. Even a middle-aged dad (me) laughed out loud at a couple of sections.The story chronicles the further adventures of the Riot Brothers after their original outing in \\"Snarf Attack, Underfoodle, and the Secret of Life\\".

Moreover, Joan Carroll Cruz approaches this fascinating topic as one of the faithful. This makes for a refreshing change from the breathless and heretical blather put out by misguided New Agers.The book is well written and researched. But Mrs. Cruz uses the same stories and quotes from a handful of Saints, Blesseds, priests, etc. to make different points (be prepared to read the same passages, verbatim, numerous times throughout the book). I don't think this retreading, as it were, serves her or the reader particularly well. Still, there's something to be said for Mrs. Cruz's vignette, rather than narrative, approach -- despite the redundancies, it makes for a read that is not only fast, easy, and enjoyable, but also informative.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book...","review":"This book is easy to read and provides beautiful information about the Angels.

I will be making the \\"Christmas Wreath\\" this year, because it looks too gorgeous not to try.This book should be a must-have for every serious needle artist. Teresa Wentzler's work is miles above any other designer.The only reason I am giving this book only four stars, though, is because for projects as intricate as these, color patterns would really be helpful.

The plotlines were always humorous and original, and the character chemistry awesome.One of the biggest object lessons I got off of the Tick is the fact that the Tick never had anything bad to say of anyone who wasnt evil. He was the most powerful superhero of any profiled, but never displayed ego or condescension to anyone. 'Arthur' who had almost nothing to offer as a superhero, the Tick found of value due to his intelligence. Batmanuelle who ran away or avoided any fight was always treated as a friend and with respect.

But forces are at work to seek out Sira and take from her what only she has the right to give, and to destroy forever any hope that she and her human love can be together.Julie Czerneda has a unique outlook on life. The understanding with which she writes of races and cultures unknown to humankind is stunning and brilliant. Her prose is sprinkled with word-pictures so real that the reader becomes caught up in her fantasy world without even realizing it.

When I finally picked it up again, the plot began to move faster, and by the end of the book, things were happening so fast that I couldn't put it down. There were some nice, suspenseful moments towards the end.I liked the changes in the concept of the M'hir. I thought it made the plot more interesting. I also liked the new species, the Drapsk.

I found myself getting a bit annoyed with the 'little quirks' that were introduced. A few mysteries and revelations kept things going however - I wouldn't have minded a bit more focus on that.

However I have not been able to plow my way through this one; it just doesn't scintillate the way the two earlier books do. The Drapski (alien race) are really well done and demonstrate Czerneda's knowledge of biology and evolution, but her two main characters, Sira and Morgan, just don't click the way they did before.

As long as people are stupid enough to pay, they will be out there. Sorry, no Lou Gramm, no Foreigner. If you are lacking the distinctive voice that made the band, you are not that band.

However, when you purchase the saw blades for this you need to keep in mind that the width of the saw doesn't go completely through the material you are cutting. In other words, the x-acto saw blades have a portion of the blade that is too thick to go down through the mitre guides.

I'm looking foward to reading the rest of the books, my only complain is that it is too short (less than 300 pages) it could have used more story behind some events (like the battle with Totori) but all in all a good read for the series and the base for the rest of the books to take off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly in depth and excellently researched","review":"This book is excellently researched, and goes into enourmous depth (even if he has forgotten Rambo, there are hundreds of other films in here which are included!).Emphasis is more on the US and the UK, but there is also an impressive range of pictures and details from some very exotic corners of the world.A must read for any movie buff, and guaranteed to get you veering off the beaten track in your travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contained more than I expected","review":"i took a chance with this book. its description and contents were vague as to how it was organized.When I received it I noticed extra valuable movie facts and info and even special sections for: Sound of Music, Raiders, Potter and many classics old and new....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Lambada","review":"I've always loved this movie, that is why I purchased it.

The dancers are nice-looking, the dancing is certainly sexy, and the production is well-staged and the dancing well choreographed.

I was pretty anxious to get it on video and I did but it turned out to be a crummy movie! Yes, it does have good acting, good music by Danny Elfman, and a great all-star cast. But what else can I say this movie is pretty much dumb and it does make fun of Independence Day and Close Encounters of the Third Kind but that's not the reason why I don't like it. The reason why I don't like it is because it's cheesy, boring, and dumb. I am going to throw away my Mars Attacks video because it's stupid. I have no reason to put it in my movie collection. So whatever you do if you hadn't seen this movie yet, please do not rent it. You might be a little disappointed. It may be enjoyable for little kids but not adults. Adults might find it boring.

The morbid look of the Martians is actually quite humorous and their destructive bumbling over the Earth hillarious. What can stop their indestructible hordes? Nuclear missiles? Ships? Soldiers?

Using the infamous trading card collection as inspiration, Mr. Burton fleshes it out w/ non-stop hilarity and satire. The cast of big-name stars reminds me of the cast of IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD, WORLD. The martians are perfectly sinister in their bid to destroy mankind. The scene w/ Lisa Marie as the \\"hot\\" chick / martian in disguise is a classic!

And think severed fingers, hands, and heads are really funny at all? One amusing moment, however is when some big-wigged bimbo goes prancing into some guy's house to seduce him with a few grisly scenes thrown in.

Fox, Lisa Marie, Tom Jones and the veteran Sylvia Sidney.The whole plot is, of course, Mars attacking Earth after a seemingly bungled translation job. The President and First Lady (played by Nicholson and Close with aplomb) and their young daughter Taffy (Natalie Portman) are taken seige in the White House when the aliens nuke the entire House of Congress.The key to the alien's downfall belongs to the senile yet lovable old Grandma Norris (Sylvia Sidney).

I have a Pentax SLR camera with a 35-300 zoom lens. The quality of pictures that I get out of this film is amazing. Great colors, great details in all lighting conditions. I take a lot of pictures indoors (at school programs in extrememly difficult lighting situations) and quite frequently I am the only one who gets the shots of the kids. Outdoors the color saturation is excellent.I get my film developed at a custom photo lab (not a chain or department store) and the developer says he rarely ever has to use color correction on this film. In fact he recommends it to many of his customers who use a zoom lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack! GRAIN!","review":"I was not at all impressed with this film. I shot eight rolls under various conditions with my Nikon N80 and will not use it again.The colors seemed washed out and contrast wasn't there. However, my main complaint is graininess.

If you want to save money, and don't want to blow up your pics past the standard 4x6 I guess it's ok. If you are taking serious pics that are inportant to you, and wish to blow them up stay as far away from this film as possible. This film has way too much grain, and coloures are washed out. Best bet for that special weding or moment spend a coupple of more bucks and buy kadak royal gold 400 or 1000 you will be veary impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film has no reason for existence!","review":"This is the worse film I have ever used! It's a very high grain film with horrible color saturation. Shooting outdoors the colors look washed out and are often very overexposed, in low-light situations the shadows look very dark and unrealistic dark colors. If you want to shoot in low light without a flash then you're best going to 1000 or 1600 ISO. If you want to shoot outside/inside you are better off with the more common 400 or less with flash. The fact that this stuff is supposedly Kodak's biggest seller is mystifying, though. Is it all advertising hype, or are most people's standards really this low?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a Drama! This is a great familly movie.","review":"A must see for horse lovers!

The video largely consists of three pros talking about skiing, and then videos of them skiing. There are no slow-motion shots or enhanced videos with highlights/arrows, etc. showing the areas of the body to concentrate on. The pros are somewhat rigid and look like they are reading from a script. I would have liked to see more diagrams on the videos and less special effects that make the video attractive to watch, but have little information.

It is a full frame lens and thus is usable on both digital K10d, K20d, K100 Super, K200d etc. and also on full frame film cameras. Overall, small size and light weight are very convenient. Sharpness is quite good, more than acceptable, but not quite perfect. There were some blue-yellow chromatic aberrations but these were easily corrected in PhotoShop. Build quality seems quite adequate. I compared the images from this lens at optimum aperture and various focal lengths to the highly regarded Pentax FA 50 mm f 1.4 and the DA 16-45 mm f 4. The other lens may have been slightly better when viewed at 200% but 100% crops were virtually indistinquishable. A very good performance for a handy lens, given the low cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all purpose lens","review":"I bought this lens for go with my Samsung DSLR GX10.

It comes as no surprise to me that this recording sat around for 20 years before someone released it.If you really dig Level 42 (as I do), you'll want this to round out your collection.

It's continual lies in the face of contradictory evidence that killed his career and sealed his fate...this is not unjust persecution by fellow Christians, but a desire for Warnke to fully come clean and make a fresh start.

But if Warnke has repented, why does he continue to spread his lies? Warnke continues to perform a disservice to the whole of humanity and to the great religion to whom he grants little more than lip-service. A book that more properly gives born-again Christians reason to stand tall is \\"Selling Satan,\\" the investigation of Warnke that showed us all what he really is, written by a pair of born-again Christian investigators.

Kaplan is supposed to be a good company for study guides such as this yet they make typographical errors and especially when they are on the practice test portions you can imagine why this becomes a problem. Such errors as using \\"?\\" in place of the multiplication sign and the not equal to sign in place of the pie sign?

Anybody got any idea?P.S. as much as I enjoyed the karaoke music in the movie I think the omission of it in the soundtrack was a good move.

Until it falls apart.","review":"Well, I loved it until I actually tried using it for the first time yesterday. All I did was carry it around for about 20 min. and the plastic around the ball -that piece of plastic surrounding the ball, so that when you move your camera to the vertical position that plastic piece goes with it- just completely became loose from the top. So, if I would have wanted to take a vertical photo, I would have had to manually move the piece so that my camera could switch into the vertical position. And then I'd have to manually move it so that I could move it back into the horizontal position. It's ridiculous.

The normal tripod heads have many adjustments that take some time to align. This head,for a very small investment is made solidly and performs just as I had wished.

Although the account is, of course, fictionalized a bit, that fact does not deter from its charm. In fact, I would imagine those unfamiliar with the true events might even more interested -- and even compelled to read even more of the story.

It just seemed like nothing. This movie hardly had any plot. They're just trying to prove fairies exist. I remember me, my brother, Mat and my Dad being quite bored by it.

Just opening up our minds to the chance that fairies do exist made the movie very enjoyable. I highly recommend this movie for people of all ages - not just children.

I immediately looked her up online and purchased her Classic Stretch Arms/Abs - Legs/Butt DVD and was so impressed with it! When I learned she also had a back pain dvd, I couldn't order it fast enough! Today was my first day trying it and I'm very impressed. All of the motions are very gentle and she does a great job explaining what's going on.

But (sigh) I did it. This film was not to me sulty, sexy or smoldering, and it lacked the scented decadence that I've come to associate with a Tennessee Williams play. (He was a hero of mine in high school.) However, Williams didn't write this screenplay, though it's from a shorter work of his. It was a wonderful movie, everyone acted it to the hilt. Redford was great, and had his usual inflections and mannerisms. Wood covered all the emotions exactly, from nervous anxiety at the start, though joy, grief and horror, indignant rage, dreamy fantasizing, the works. I thought she deserved an Oscar. The flick also had a very young shy Robert Blake in it. I never hated a character so much in my movie-going life as I did Kate Reid, Wood's mother in the movie.

It is a timeless and powerful story of love and cultural differences. Owen grapples with his duty which is in conflict with his compassion. Alva's idealistic view of the world clashes with its realities. Her dreams are impractical yet they are exactly what Owen lacks and what draws them together. The rest of the cast delivers great supporting performances, especially Badham, Bronson and Blake. This is one of my favorite movies.

The only redeeming thing about it was Robert Redford and he couldnt even save this movie. First of all if you are looking for an uplifting movie with a happy ending, this one is not for you. Natalie Wood is gorgeous but I found her character to be so slutty that I did not like her at all and did not find her worthy of Robert Redfords character.

For example, almost 19 chapters are omitted regarding Waterloo. Not only is Hugo's telling of the battle moving, the artistic strokes of the pen, descriptions and insight are what classic novels and literature are all about. I suppose under Porter's cuttings, the Louve would only feature the Mona Lisa and sparsely anything else.Readers of this edition are robbed of fantastic writing and to try and claim you have read Les Miserables through this edition is like claiming to be a doctor by having a subscription to the journal of medicine.

But let's go back to Jean, he gets rich and powerful, with another name, he has a daughter, a foster daughter, but guess what?!!!!

After seeing the newest movie, I decided to read it again (50 years after the first read). I will never read another book by Victor Hugo... I wanted to see how the movie tracked with the book, and the tiny bits and pieces chosen for the movie track fairly well, comprising less than the equivalent of a short paperback, while the book is nearly 1,000 pages. That would be fine, but Hugo takes 20 pages to say a rose is red, shoes are worn, etc. But he was a poet. The endless rambling and describing every little detail 40 different ways while using every $100 word in the dictionary quickly becomes torturous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long to read","review":"Don't put this on your iPad!

I felt better that it wasn't me. I may purchase another version and hopefully be able to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable translation","review":"While I feel that Hugo could and should have made his prose more succinct, his writing is largely inspired and his social and political commentary is surprisingly still apropos.

Because of the \\"buzz\\" - something I rarely subscribe to - and because a canvass of the great works of world literature dictated I do so.I expected to confront a somewhat labored and overly drawn melodrama, and I did - but one, I found, whose characters are burned into your memory forever. A tremendous story of redemption and commitment, \\"Les Mis\\" resonates with anyone who loves, or has loved, deeply. Hugo is a storyteller of the first rank. Long after this read is over, you're willing to forgive some contrived coincidences and broad characterizations. Subtle, it isn't; grand, by all means. So I ended up making a leap of faith.And maybe, that's what Hugo had in mind all along with this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Les Miserables is the the best book I have ever read.

Well I was quite pleased as it was an intriguing read. I love books that are long because you really come to know the characters. Jean Valjean is a great role model for life, I believe the author made him a little bigger than life but that's OK. Diction is always a challenge with books this old, but it is a great example of a master writer weaving a spell binding story. Parts I don't like, I might have a French last name but am very ignorant of the French language and culture. I was tired of trying to pronounce French words in my head.

Then another 10 pages to describe his house. I've never seen the musical, or films, so maybe that's my problem? No wonder the book is so long. Nowadays editors say \\"show the readers, don't tell them\\" but I guess in Victor Hugo's time you could just tell them, and tell them, and tell them. A gazillion people love the musical so I guess there's a story in there somewhere, about D-------, or M----------, or whatever. I'll keep looking but if I pass 100 pages and still no plot I might just give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Duty","review":"This historical read is the most extreme thing I have ever tried to make it through.

It is extremely emotional, realistic, romantic, educational, entertaining, and humorous all at the same time. Near the end of the book the dramatic irony was killing me, I just wished that Jean Valjean would tell Marius everything! That is probably the author's intention though. I HIGHLY recommend reading this unabridged version. I have read one abridged version, and the power, completeness, and historical value of the book do not compare. It may seem like you have to labor through this book, but once you are finished, and realize all you have learned about 19th century French culture, social issues, history (Waterloo and the French Revolution), and religion, you will be extremely happy that you read it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"Les Miserables simply has to be one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. This book will literally change your life if you put the effort into understanding its deep message, and trust me its definitely worth the 1400+ pages to read. This book basically asks what does it mean to be a true Christian, to truly follow God? First, the bishop then Jean Valjean exemplify this to an excruciating degree. Hope rings true throughout this book in light of the horrible conditions that some of the characters had to go through. Whether it be Cosette consigned to basically slave labor for a greedy, ungodly family or Fatine pushed to the limit of desperation searching ceaselessly for money to pay for Cosette even selling some of her teeth at one point, or the incredible struggles that Jean Valjean went through, this book draws you into it, making you feel everything that the characters feel.

I highly recomend this story for all readers , due to the fact that it has a variety of themes. At the end of the story you are left with tears of both sadness and joy due to the beautiful character victor Hugo created as jean valjean.

I realized the potential and zeal of the human spirit. The triumphs and suffering of the characters hit my heart unlike any fictional book I have ever known.Although Hugo may be rather long-winded in his descriptions at times, such as the passages about the sewers, the battle of Waterloo, and convents, they are well worth reading, as he offers interesting metaphors and ideas along with these descriptions. I suggest reading the story, and then going back and reading the narratives for what they are worth.It's a beautiful book. Anyone can identify with one, if not all of the complex and interesting characters. A must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"So REAL. It's such a moving story.","review":"When I first started reading this book I thought it would be boring. Then when Jean Valjean enters the story and you learn about him I began to belive that this story really happened. The characters were in the room with me. I knew the pain Fantine felt when Javert comes for Jean Valjean. I knew what Eponine felt when she died in Marius' arms. Hugo put in words what happens in real life.

The development of the character of main protagonist Jean Valjean from ex-convict to redeemed wealth is riveting. His interaction with the other players in the novel, noticeably policeman Javert, is absorbing, while the love element, both romantic and familial is touching and sensitively handled. This is a must read for first timers and worth a revisit for those who are familiar with the plot.

I read theunabridged, and it took me months. This guy could not stay on track -rather than write a story, he wanted to write about EVERYTHING that has EVER happened EVER. When I got to the 40-page description of Paris's sewer system, I nearly killed myself.This story is not completely lacking. There is lots of drama, lots of touching sentiment. However, I also have a thematic problem with this book.Les Miserables GLORIFIES SUFFERING. If you suffer, you are noble and good. If you don't suffer, you are the enemy. Many fans of this book deny this, but it is true. Hugo was a champion of the little person, which is good, but he also embodied all the worst elements of modern liberalism.The musical based on the book is the same way. And you know, it's effective - we all sympathize with the downtrodden - but I really think Les Mis goes too far. And the b*****d should have edited his own work! Christ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable story, setting, characters and writing.","review":"Why is this garbage deemed a classic? It is thoroughly miserable, I give it that.

This book, unfortunately seemed 1000 pages too long. Victor, do we really need 4 full chapters about the sewers of Paris and the poetic side of excrement? And are we really supposed to believe that of all the thugs, thieves, murderers and other scoundrels haunting Paris, the one guy Inspector Javert is really intent on capturing is the guy who stole a loaf of bread 20-30 years before?

It has been called the greatest story ever written that does not appear in holy scripture. Even if you've seen the movies and the musical, you should read the unabridged version of this book. It contains so much more depth and power than the muscial does. Hugo's masterpiece shows Valjean's struggle to continue to do right and how Valjean is given opportunity after opportunity to change back into the wretched man that he was and how Valjean stays true to what the Bishop of Digne wanted him to do. Don't be afraid of the length of this book. It does take a long time to read, and you may have to take breaks, but this is one of the few books I've ever read that is worth reading again.

I'm also really excited to go see the movie musical in theaters soon.Now, I've wanted to read this so badly but I never got the chance to purchase or find at the library until last christmas when my friend Em got it for me. Best christmas ever!I almost immediately started Les Mis and loved it so much! I had a hard time not the cry on the end there. That's how much it means to me.

He does spend chapters just describing one character or historical refernce, but when he uses these in the action of the book, it is AMAZINGLY POWERFUL! I found myself sitting in awe or in tears or smiling or without breath. The impact is unlike anything I've read in fiction. The reader develops a intimacy with the characters that I long for in other works - they become dear. They become human and you feel their emotion and live their experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"how the French were polarized and Napoleonic dream lost through only a few generations","review":"The proud nation had stringent laws with disproportinate penaltiy for petty offense illustrated in the case of Jean Valjean, the victim of the system. Fearing to be identified and returned to the galley, he became so humble and passive as to be at the mercy of the most advanced of scheming and blackmail and threat of exposure. One love was left to him - Cosette - yet even she was kept away from him - by a jealousworthless lover who relented only too late; the ultimately high-minded man of great physical strength expired and passed to the realm of the angels, divested of the will to save himself.Victor Hugo was a writer who detailed both sides of each dilemma and his use of vocabulary appropriately fits to clarify his point.At times the writng becomes repetitive and the reading is tedious. Such, however, is the price extracted for this experience of the writng of this literary seer, a genius of his time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"Can't say too much except I didn't like.

The Step-By-Step series tell you you're gonna learn, how it applies in a realistic example, and walks you through the steps. They don't beat around the bush and they don't give you too much or too less.The screenshots were helpful as well.But what I liked most about the book -- which was an unexpected bonus -- is the little tidbits of Project Management wisdom thrown in to each chapter plus an entire chapter at the end.

In the prime of her youth, she displays her acting talents frequently and generously, both of them. And, even though the full frontal theatrical-release scene of Brooke Shields is cut from the video version, Sarandon takes up the slack admirably. She falls into the role of a New Orleans prostitute mother as if it required no acting at all.

But about 2008 they must have changed the ingredients and now they are very hard to light, don't stay lit easily, are very hard to break apart, and to separate, and compared to how they used to work, they are now a useless product. I wrote to Jarden Home Brands to tell them the product is now inferior but they did not respond, apparently not caring about customer satisfaction. Don't waste your money. This is a formerly great, user-friendly product that the manufacturer has ruined by making it with cheap ingredients.

An error of 5 deg. in marine coastal navigation could place you miles off course, and after comparing the binoculars to a hand-bearing compass and a GPS, I found that the error was actually closer to 7 deg. So, if you want a pretty good pair of binoculars with a novelty compass for fun, then these would be fine for you.

Could definitely benefit from a good editing or seven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash and burn","review":"Fly With Me is \\"a humorous guide to a better flying experience\\", written by flight attendant Tera Leilani Walker, and published by Dorrance Publishing.I recently recieved this book to review, and I'm a little surprised to find that all of the other reviews posted here are five stars. I found it painful to get through, which is pretty bad since it is only 43 pages, and took under an hour to read. The \\"chapters\\" (one or two pages each on topics like passengers with stinky feet) weren't terrible, but the poems at the end of each one were. The main problem I encountered was a surprising number of typos and spelling mistakes and other editing errors. I counted over eight, including a misspelled word in a chapter title, which is a LOT of mistakes for a 43 page book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Steves' France, Belgium, and the Netherlands","review":"Rick Steves' did it again. This book is a great guide for seeing the main areas of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. I stayed in one of the B&B's and a hotel he recommended for Brugge, and they both were everything he said. The information on Paris is exact and helpful, especially the way he separates Paris into three maps. The hotel prices for all countries are right on the money, even in the busy season. One of the best things about this book, is that he always includes helpful information; i.e. how to use the phones; where the tourist info. is; the approximate exchange rates, etc. I love his books and never go traveling without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREEPY","review":"The movie was awesome. I totally enjoyed it. I had chills down my spine the whole movie. The best part about it is there were not big and fancy special effects...it was left up to your imagingation! AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Others","review":"I was looking for a spooky movie and what I observed with this one was a big surprise. This is a good psychological thriller if you are into this type of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a twist of an ending","review":"This movie has everything the six sence had and then some. Not only is Nicole Kidman wonderful so is the whole feel of the film. This film has a creepy look throughout and is an excellent movie. The ending is one i will never forget. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this movie.. kidman really carried it...","review":"unusual movie, but if you like Nicole Kidman at all, you will enjoy it for her performance alone. Interesting story, and a small cast that keeps it moving..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"This is a great film for many reasons, and most of all for the trio of mother and children. Nicole Kidman and the two child actors are perfect and totally believable in their period roles. This has to be Nicole Kidman's best performance ever. The actors playing the servants were excellent too.The writing of the relationship between the three is brilliant too, I havent seen a better potrayal of mother and children in any film.Normally I'm irritated by dark and gloomy interiors in films, but here the atmosphere was just right. The film reminds me of old ghost-story books I read in school (long ago), and also of The Turn of The Screw. The mood is so different from The Sixth Sense that I did not notice any similarity while watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Alejandro's best - but still a classic ghost story","review":"Yes, it won't keep you thinking for days like Open your Eyes did, but it will still make your Sunday afternoon be a fun one. I was happy to spend my seven dollars (including of course my old, old student ID) on this movie. It made me wonder, it frightened me, it kept me going until a very suprising and unexpected ending. Yes: I won't lie to you like many others who always pretend they weren't surprised by the twist of this or that movie. If we were to pause the movie and ask them what is going on, those pretentious little minds would barely ever get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Original Storyline!","review":"Without giving too much of the movie away, this movie was surprisingly original in it's storyline. It took us almost the whole movie to figure out what was really going on. The overall film setting is a little dark, but the acting is very good. I would recommend this film to those who like the supernatural with a lot of suspense thrown in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back, please?","review":"The movie opens with Kidman screaming, and screaming, and screaming. She clutches her heart, woodenly attempts to look terrified (perhaps someone should have handed her a terminatoin notice for some real affect), and off we go watching her chewing the scenery pretending to act. My God, who told this chick she's an actor? That's the first problem. The star of this flick can't act and it only becomes more painful to watch because her costars do quite well. The second problem? Isn't a script suppose to have a plot? (Not as a plot in the ground, as in a story that is developed.)This ditty rambles on in apredictable manner and meanwhile Kidman just gets more shrill. Oh please. Enough. Thank goodness even money couldn't buy her a best actress award. The lighting and photography are nicely done so it has some visual appeal. If you are really in the mood for a badly done movie stick to Ed Wood and leave the acting awards for Inspector Clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gobble, gobble....","review":"This little yawner proves what hype can do for a movie. I could hardly stay awake but managed to for the ending...which was apparent half way through and was almost worth the wait. I think Nicole Kidman actually DID phone this one in. If you like watching her stomping around, opening and closing doors, and yelling at servants and children, rent this bomb. You won't be disappointed. Two discs? Hilarious. The second went back to the vid store a virgin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible movie.","review":"The Others isn't very good. It is about a family during World War II who moved into a new house. It is basically plotless and the little plot it has is extremely stupid. The kids are allergic to sun... How rediculous. Nicole Kidman was okay in this movie but come on... Alergic to sun? Once you finish watching this movie you'll star to notice untied noghts such as why was that father there. That scene with the father did not add to the plot at all. The ending is extremely stupid, and the annoying fake accents of those kids will annoy the heck out of you. It isn't as good as he sixth sense I'll tell you that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary ... how many people rate this film","review":"I suffered through this dull and predictable film last night, and I am amazed at the overwhelming number of positive reviews. So many people seem to have confused a lack of pace and creakingly slow storytelling with \\"atmosphere\\". Pivotal plot points are delivered with granite-slab subtlety, removing any real sense of mystery. Other events like the heroine's husband's brief appearance are nonsense, even within the film's own odd reality, or pure McGuffin like the \\"things buried under the leaves\\". The plot is slight to the point of non-existence and anyone who has read any review that mentions \\"the twist\\" will spend half the time trying to predict it. Admittedly one late scene actually made me jump, but lock me in a dark room in front of anything this dull for long enough and almost any loud noise will shock me awake. Not helped at all by Nicole Kidman who is a very weak lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce Willis was dead the whole time?","review":"The plot of this movie was very interesting (although it seemed I was watching The Sixth Sense again). I was not impressed by Nicole Kidman's acting, although the other actors were convincing.But, the thing that ruined my whole movie experience was a scene in which Nicole Kidman is talking to the new servants (towards the beginning). As she is explaining about the house, the appearance of a microphone can be seen peeking from above. I saw that (according to the audiences' snickerings, it was appearant that they did too), and I thought that maybe it was just one mistake. However, that microphone made a cameo through that whole scene. I hate to sound so critical; however, I feel that this caused me to think poorly upon the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow slow slow","review":"The reviews for this movie were rather favorable, so I was looking forward to a good scary movie. What I got was a slow, boring movie with no payoff at the end. The movie felt like ... \\"The Sixth Sense\\". Nicole Kidman plays an unpleasant, unlikeable mother, and her performance can best be described as \\"adequate\\". Lots of unresolved details that fool you into thinking there is more to the story than meets the eye (why were the children photosensitive? Why did the father show up? Why was he sick for two days? Don't bother to guess--you will never find out by the end of the moive. I can appreciate the attempt to make an old-fashioned ghost story (no gore, etc.), however this was just too boring to pull it off. You may jump a few times, but only because you'll be half-asleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how obvious is this one?","review":"Basically \\"The Others\\" is a big budget, polished \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode without any of the warmth or charm. It's big surprise twist is so transparent that if you haven't got it in the first 15 minutes you will enjoy it, but you obviously don't think while you watch films.Why is the film set in the 40's? Just what is it that happened when Nicole had her previous turn that everyone's whispering about? - Answer these questions and the rest of the film is a boring period piece.Yes it is well made, but that Bruce Willis film used the idea (and disguised it) so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNOOZE!!!","review":"Please don't compare this film with What Lies Beneath which, while it has its faults, is a very stylish and watchable movie. I had no expectations going in (to The Others) and even watched it a second time to see if maybe I'd missed something good, and still nothing. Kidman was wooden, the plot rambling and unbelievable. I was hoping for some suspense -- there was none. Hitchcock would roll over in his grave. This film is pure drivel. Kidman should be embarrassed -- she has the ability (see Dead Calm). I expected nothing and GOT nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Boredom","review":"Do not be fooled by people who are comparing this movie to the Sixth Sense. While the Sixth Sense kept you interested throughout the movie with Bruce Willis' struggle to reach the boy, The Others was filled with a very boring and ordinary story line until the end. Unfortunately, I have to admit that I actually sat through the entire movie, but only to see how they could possibly end a movie that never seemed to really start. In short, it was easily the worst movie I've seen this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Others","review":"This movie was sooooo slow moving that more than half way through I still had no idea what the point was. The last twenty minutes were good and revealing. The acting was professional. The location was interesting. Too much time was spent on the beginning of the film. I would have found the story more interesting if time was taken from the beginning and added to the ending instead. Maybe this was payback from Tom Cruise to Nicole Kidman. I would deffinitely not recomend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME! CHECK OUT SIXTH SENSE INSTEAD!! OR SIGNS!","review":"I don't want to waste my time reviewing this waste of time. IT ABSOLUTELY WAS TERRIBLE! NOT ONLY WAS THE SOUND QUALITY ON THE DVD TERRIBLE, THE PLOTLINE AND ACTING [was not good]!

RENT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING DUMB, STUPID AND BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, boring,big let down!","review":"After seeing the television ads for this movie, I wasnt very interested in seeing it, but after reading reviews on Amazon thought I would give it a chance......I should have gone with my first instinct, this is very slow , boring and for me at least, quite predictable. The climax of the film is just not worth waiting for,I have seen way better made for TV movies than this, I really felt I wasted my money on this one. I think one of the reviews I read compared it to \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and if you beleive this your in for a big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"I can only say, after watching this movie on tape, DON'T BOTHER! Save your money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure which movie the other reviewers were watching","review":"But this movie is boring. It is just like all the other crap Hollywood has been producing these days. They show you a few scary scenes in a preview and set the expectations. The movie was hardly scary or suspenseful, and most of it just dragged on. I would wait for the video, or better yet wait till it shows on regular television....Boring, boring, boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! A thrilling journey to the afterlife.","review":"Nicole Kidman plays as a English mother who has two children that have a rare disease that they are allergic to sunlight and must stay in the dark. The children have been talking to spirits but these ghosts want to take over the house and threaten to kill all of those who live there.A spiritual and interesting thriller with elements of horror and drama mixed into it and a nice twist in the end.

What an ending it was and I won't ruin your chance on falling off to by giving it away. A Must See for thriller fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but not good either","review":"I went to watch The Others even though most of the people who watched it warned me not to. The movie wasn't horribly bad but there was nothing there to make it good either. The setup and the background of this movie was so awfully forced and contrived and even the actors' (including Kidman) reactions were unconvincing. I felt like I was watching a cheesy horror flick (like Scream). The movie had a very bad turn when the husband arrived. His arrival was utterly pointless and went on for a boring 30 mins. Finally the movie got back on track. The ending was not a big enough payoff for the hour and half of creaking floors, slamming doors and horrified gasps. To place \\"Sixth Sense\\" in the same category as \\"The Others\\" is an insult to SS. For better thrillers check out the \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Carrie\\" in which horror and terror lies within everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Poor Man's 6th Sense","review":"this film was fairly easy to predict how things would go after the first half hour.it wasn't long before I felt this film was a 6th sense clone.Nicole Kidman is easily one of the Most-Overrated folks in the Acting Business Ever.She brings no Emotion to me in Her Work.She is a ALright Actress but not worth all the Hype She gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOO!","review":"NO ONE that I know saw this ending coming! Think \\"The Sixth Sense\\" :at the end of the movie when all is revealed (very simply, but somehow we all missed it) and you're slapping your forehead going \\"DOH! I should've seen that!\\". Terror-rific thriller!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting 'til the end","review":"This movie was excellently done. I believe that it was one of the best movies of an overall disappointing summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Others","review":"This movie is one of the best I have seen in a while! I love the twists and it made me jump. Great haunted house movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LEGITIMATELY EERIE GHOST STORY","review":"Nicole Kidman was at the top of her game in this film. It is a crackling good suspense movie, that unwinds its chills in slow twists of plot, and superb dialogue. Amenabar quietly, subtly, and ever so deftly reveals the twisted secrets of a haunted mansion, seemingly perpetually wrapped in fog, and seething with dark psychological underpinnings.THE OTHERS is a trance-like walk into a deviously, evolving nightmare, with a deliciously macabre finishing flourish. Not many ghost stories are comparable to THE SIXTH SENSE, or THE INNOCENTS. This lusciously atmospheric morsel is- in spades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Others","review":"Love this movie! Its a wonderfully suspensful movie, with a classic feel to it. It just proves that gore and guts are not needed to get a jump out of the audience.This company shipped the movie to me, with no problems or delays. Great service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Although I fast forwarded through a good part of this movie Nicole Kidman gave her usual fine and totally histrionic performance. Eventually it seems the sky always falls on this ice princess, and now her face almost makes movies by itself. Amazing!You get the feeling that she is a true artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I Give 6 Stars ??","review":"I have bought more than 100 DVDs online, but this's the first movie makes me write my review. THE OTHERS is a super wonderful movie I have ever seen. Actually, I saw it 4 times in theatre. The perfect story, perfect atmosphere, and the perfect ending. Nicole Kidman acts extremly well in this movie. If you haven't seen the movie, buy the DVD. I already pre-order the \\"A MUST BUY\\" DVD. I GUARANTEE you won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth repeating","review":"At first, the movie kind of dragged. Once you got to know everyone and their own little stories it got interesting. There were alot of unexpected jumps like scares and screams. You know how you felt after you seen \\"The Sixth Sense\\"?,well you will feel the same here. It's something you will want to see again and again to just figure out everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me jump","review":"I love suspense but most of the time I just don't get scared. This is the first movie in a long time that has made me jump. I think the only one that has made me jump more is the 1940's flick The Uninvited.Overall The Others is well acted, although the characters can seem a bit flat at times. The story has some lovely nuances that reminded me of classic black and white movies such as The Uninvited and Rebecca. However, in my mind the best thing about this movie is that it avoids blood and gore and relies on leaving certain details to linger in your imagination before they are fully woven into the film.Perhaps the best thing about this movie...it kept me guessing.I highly reccomend The Others especially to classic film buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Ending","review":"THE OTHERS is every inch as good as SIXTH SENSE which you will be forgiven for thinking that they stole ideas from - but as many have stated, it was the other way around. THE OTHERS was penned long before SIXTH SENSE.Whatever, nothing can quite prepare you for the spectacular ending (which I won't give away). Let's just say that it had an impact on me.Nicole Kidman is excellent as a housewife caring for her two children while her husband is away apparently fighting for the War. When everything starts to unfold, we learn that this is not the case.THE OTHERS is an incredibly sad tale, and Kidman's performance is such that you really do feel sympathy for her character. The frustation, the heartache ....A great film, but once you have seen the ending, there is little point in repeat viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Film","review":"This is a fairly good film about a mother (Nicole Kidman) raising two light-sensitive children on her own during World War 2 and her efforts to protect them from the 'others' (who appear to be ghosts/poltergeists/apparitions) The story is nicely paced, and the twist ending was well-delivered. You get hints of it through the film, but it isn't blatantly obvious or anything, leaving us with a rather nice twisty ending. Overall a good film and worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED this movie!","review":"I found this to be an intelligent scary movie. There was no gore or senseless violence. The plot was great, and there was a lot of suspense through out the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through the Looking Glass...Darkly","review":"Brilliant. Not only well acted and haunting but something entirely original. Most ghost stories follow predictable scripts but not this one. It leaves the viewer guessing about the nature of reality...past, present, future, life, death...what's what and who's who?My congratualations to the director and actors. This is a film worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Thriller Ever!","review":"Amazing! This movie was extremely well done! The suspense is excellent and you are terrified almost the whole movie without seeing any gore, which is a sign of a well made movie and a first-class thriller.Nicole Kidman was dazzling, I defintely think that she is one of the best actresses out there! It's amazing how she go from being a courtesan in 'Moulin Rouge' to a religious mother in 'The Others'. She is extremely convincing in this role! The others actors were great, I was also very impressed with the kids who played her two children in the movie, they were great!The costumes and effects were excellent! The set was perfect, foggy, dark, and mysterious, absolutely perfect for this movie. I won't be surprised if 'The Others' is up for a few Oscars, it sure deserves it! This is a shocking and impressive movie, go see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Classy Thrill Ride","review":"Definately one of Nicole's Best Performances this film is gripping anc chilling. The acting is great and the plot takes you for many twists and turns. This reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock movie and it will definately be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky","review":"This is one of the finest \\"spooky\\" movies I have seen since theoriginal black and white movie the \\"Haunting,\\" from the 1960's.What is so wonderful about this movie, is that it is NOT a slasher or demonic horror movie, but instead, a great portrayal of a ghost story (in the truest sense of the word). NicholeKidman's acting is fantastic, as well as the children, the little boy in the movie is exceptional in his facial expressions!This movie is definitely worth the time and money and I'll most definitely go see it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense and suprise ending","review":"I like SI FY and this was right up my alley!

Nicole Kidman gives a wonderful, steely performance in the lead, the two children are completely effective, and the direction and pace are expert level. An unsettling movie that treats its audience as intelligent, The Others goes beyond expectations to triumph as a masterpiece of terror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Classic","review":"I purchased the Asian DVD not long ago although I had never seen the film in theaters. I had heard enough about it, but didn't want to know too much to ruin it. I was very pleased to find that the movie uses very basic techniques to their tried-and-true results of scaring the pants off you! It seems in these days of hi-tech effects the filmakers have to explode in the face of the audience to get a thrill. Using suspense, excellent acting, and a good script this classic ghost story will truly satisfy. AND, finally a film for all ages that does so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad story, bad ending, no redeeming value","review":"There's nothing pleasant, happy, or redeeming about this movie. There were tons of positive reviews for this movie on Amazon, but why would anyone like a movie about a mom who murders her kids and everyone from beginning to end is miserable? Terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising ending the first time only. Otherwise, boredom.","review":"After a long, tedious viewing experience, a surprise ending was in store, upon viewing for the first time, that made it almost worth watching, once. This is pure rental material only, IF THAT. If you become easily bored, this is not the movie for you. And because the surprise ending is really the only thing going for it, which is not a surprise after the first viewing, this has zero repeat viewing value. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Others Bereft of Themes and Ideas","review":"A slow, pretentious, academic film, The Others is enslaved to a single gimmick-driven plot with no character development and no real theme. In other words, The Others has nothing to say, so you have to watch a group of fine actors go through their perfunctory duties in order that the plot, in all of its self-congratulatory cleverness, is fulfilled. But what a long wait for the movie viewer, who must languish through all the cliches and bathos and paper-thin characters! And for what? There's no thematic pay-off here, no real idea. Finally, this is a very stiff and stage-bound film that is too self-conscious to jump out and connect with the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I love N. Kidman and in my mind she can do no wrong. That is my view and she did an outstanding job in her acting with this movie. The problem was this movie was insulting to anyone with a mind. It lacked everything and I rate it up with the Spice World Movie. Just to be clear I know books are better than movies and I do not expect movies to be real detailed or have strong plots. With a movie you get two hours of fun and with this I felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, lame, and just plain not scary","review":"Oh, man. That was... that was a very bad movie. It's amazing to me that anyone could give this thing a positive review because, quite honestly, there's just nothing good to say about it.The biggest problem is that the \\"shocker\\" ending isn't shocking at all. I saw the \\"twist\\" coming from a mile off.. as would anyone who's seen \\"Sixth Sense\\" or ever heard a ghost story in their life.Second problem... it's dull. We've got Nicole Kidman and her two kids in a dark mansion, being haunted. That's it. Oh, and the housekeeper and a mute. So, there's lots of scenes where someone hears screaming... thinks it's one of the kids... goes running to investigate.. the music gets all \\"ooooh... spooky!\\".. then they enter the room and... and...It's empty.And a door that was closed is now open. Or a door that was open is now closed.Pretty scary stuff, eh?Do yourself a favor and skip this plodding piece of Hollywood trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky Twice at Most!","review":"\\"The Other's\\" came out in 2001 and has been by far a scary movie if you see it two times at the most. Nicole Kidman is a mother of two who lives in a large home in New England. The hous becomes haunted once the \\"home workers\\" come to work with the home. After many haunts through the few days...Nicole Kidman comes across a book...\\"The Book of the Dead\\". It's contents are pictures of those dead and are in the book to help them in the afterlife. Nicole Kidman is suspicious when the mail with the ad for home maitainance had never been delivered but the workers were there...in the room where they stayed, there was a pcture of three dead people. The picture was the three workers.....they explain that Nicole Kidman and their family are.....dead.............find out more with \\"The Others\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I exspected","review":"At first glance of this movie I thought it would be decent, but not scary at all. Most so-called \\"Thrillers\\" or \\"Horrors\\" with big name actors are far from scary. However this movie did give me a couple creeps. It's not really scary, and if your not into intelligent movies with alot of talking than this isn't for you. Although it lacks fast paced sceens for most of the movie, the 3 or 4 sceens that are fast paced are very good and the suspense of the sceens really comes through the screen at you. What really makes the movie is the ending, its the kind of ending that your just like \\"WOW\\". You don't see it coming at all, and it really catches you off guard. I wish I could have rated it 4.5 stars, but since I cant Ill rate it 4 because it lacks those face paced sceens and without them it doesnt deserve the 5. But its a very good movie and I suggest buying the DVD or Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! Great movie!","review":"Wow, this was a totally awesome movie! It was suspensful, yet tasteful. It had a couple of \\"BOO\\" moments, but it makes it better. I recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of 2001!","review":"I was blown away by \\"The Others\\"! It's one of the best made thrillers I've seen in awhile, right up there with \\"The Sixth Sense\\"! The suspense in this film is almost unbearable at times, and the thrills and surprises just keep coming out you. \\"The Others\\" is a first-class thriller; it manages to be terrifying without a lot of blood and gore, which is what many horror movies now resort as a result of a poorly written script.Nicole Kidman was dazzling and extremely convincing in one of her best performances yet. I defintely think that she is one of the best actresses out there! I was very impressed with how she went from being a courtesan in \\"Moulin Rouge\\" to a religious mother in \\"The Others\\". She is truly a very talented actress; one of the best actresses out there in my opinion!The costumes and effects were excellent! The \\"haunted house\\" set was perfect; foggy, dark, and mysterious; perfect for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"Despite the rather dull title, and the fact that it very nearly put me off spending 8 bucks at the movies, I am very glad I did; although I wouldn't personally class it as a \\"thriller\\", there were certainly some tense moments.The movie only really comes together at the end-which I think makes it all the more enjoyable-no predictable plots or cliche lines, and a sharp twist to finish it off.The actors, especially the two English kids are superb, as are the rest of the cast.I was convinced from the scenery, that the film was made in England-wrong, Spain.I really recommend this film, you definitely will not regret buying it. I watched it twice at the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 out of 5, but STILL THE BEST","review":"Yeah I have it 4 stars because it does kind of drag in the beginning..

Had this come before Sixth Sense it would deserve a full 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"This movie is definitely very creepy. It is one of few movies made recently that relies almost entirely on suspense to be scary. That may be a downside to this movie, in that it is almost entirely suspenseful until the very end. The ending was one of the most intense scenes I can remember in a mainstream Hollywood movie. The other bad thing about this type of movie is that it is only good to watch twice, since it is fairly slow. Once to watch it, and then once again to catch the foreshadowing. After that, there really isn't that much else to watch it again to see. I recommend this movie as one of the scariest I've seen lately, and well acted, but it is not worth seeing more than twice. That's why I have to give the DVD four stars...it may not be worth the money to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Others","review":"This was actually a very intriguing movie about a mother of two children trying to take care of her family and estate. This was not easy as the children had a disease which made it so they could not be exposed to sunlight, all her hired help mysteriously disappeared one morning, and the father of the children had went to war and never returned. The movie left you guessing as to what was really happening in the life of this family and frightened for the outcome of the children. The surprise ending left you feeling slightly uneasy and thinking about how life can be. A very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is the kind of movie that you can't guess the ending. The end turns out completely leaving you in front of the TV with your mouth open for next 5 minutes. After that you can't stop thinking about this movie.Excellent movie with a lot of surprises. GREAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary til the end","review":"It is one of the best performances by Nicole Kidman. A movie full of suspense with a surprising end. One does not need exploding chests or ripped off limbs. This movie convinces in the subtle very mysterious way of horror. Very well performed and nice cincematography. I only give five stars to movies that stand out in every way but can highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an old fashioned ghost story","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Current horror films depend so much on effects that good story telling is sacraficed. To begin with, the setting and house evoke a creepy, calmness that stays throughout the film. The pale, yellowish lighting adds shadows which are both scary and beautiful. The images are almost like engravings. Kidman portrays a character that is not particularly sympathetic but is increasingly appealing as the movie plays out. The children are like figures from Charles Dickens in their innocence. The household staff often are witnesses to what appears to be a seriously dysfunctional family, however, even their smiles seem strangely weird. With a great twist at the end the viewer is given that rare treat by current standards-just a good old fashioned horror picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising!","review":"I found this movie to be very well written and thought out! I always love movies where the ending surprises me, and The Others definitely did that.The Others isn't your typical ghost story either. As someone who believes in \\"the spirit realm\\", I can tell that the writers did their homework on the subject matter (but again, that fact didn't come together for me until the end).Great movie despite whether or not you believe in ghosts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie ...","review":"I don't know what people saw in this movie I really don't. There is not much of a plot, the acting is really boring and there is not one real scare in the entire movie. Nicole Kidman looks good as usual but seems to me she did this one just for the paycheck. Skip this movie and rent something really suspenseful like \\"The Legend of Hell House\\". 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I Missing Something?","review":"i went to see this movie with a couple of friends, thinking that it would be a great horrifying thriller that would scare the living hell out of me... or at least keep me up at night.the opening credits started as someone opens up a story book, with pictures of happy little children playing...'oh this is gonnas be great', my friend groaned. for the first 45 minutes, absolutely nothing happened, they introduced the characters, a widow, her two children who cant go outside because of an allergy to sunlight, three housekeepers...the ghosts that play piano rather well...at this point, 6 people had already walked out of the theater.i'll admit, the ending was great, but im not sure if it was good because of the writting or because i knew that i was going to leave soon. nicole kidman has yet again graced the screen with her inability to act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"Nicole Kidman is okay, but she can't save this film ultimately, with it's corny and contrived ending and howlingly bad acting. This is certainly no translation of James' \\"Turn of the Screw\\". A 60's film with Deborah Kerr, \\"The Innocents\\", the real translation, is far better and actually frightening, whereas this one sorta meanders between okay and bad. A far better recent horror movie would be \\"Session 9\\", with David Caruso, probably one of the most terrifying films I've ever seen, and horror is my favorite genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film with a moronic ending...","review":"How does hollywood continue to crank out these films that are so great up to the end, and then let us down big time? Great performances, breathtaking settings, creepy lighting and terrific dialogue that really, really draws you into the storyline. BUT, if you have seen either \\"The 6th Sense\\" or \\" What Lies Beneath?\\" you have seen this ending before. In reflection, this movie only leaves you with more questions which it never answers instead of tying up all the loose end in the finale. Instead see:\\"The 6th Sense\\", \\" What Lies Beneath?\\", \\"Ghost Story\\", \\"Dust Devils\\", \\"The Prince of Darkness\\", \\"Evil Dead 2\\", \\"Dead Dudes in the House\\", Hellraiser (part 1 or 2), \\"Ticks\\" or \\"From Beyond\\" if you really want to turn out the lights and have a real fright!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this thing end????","review":"This movie was bad! Patronizing and agonizingly slow, the ending was anti-climatic. A sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and mostly boring","review":"I knew what the big twist at the end was going to be within the first few minutes of \\"The Others.\\" Honestly, I don't know what anyone sees in this movie. I found it to be a mostly dull movie with only a few (a very few) startling moments. There was nothing unique or thrilling/scary about this movie, so if that's what you're looking for, please skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was a scary movie?","review":"My husband and I had expected a good thriller when we purchased this movie and were surprised when it was as \\"fearless\\" as it was. I will say it had an interesting twist at the end.... one taken right out of \\"The Sixth Sense\\", that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS FILM","review":"I kid you not, this movie is horrible. It is slow developing, predictable, not scary, and just plain stupid. It is hard to classify something as scary when there is nothing scary and it takes the movie 2 hours to get to the only slightly surprising finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have trouble sleeping, watch this one !","review":"Not even the sound effects could keep me awake.I watched this movie with loud dolby digital sound and honoustly I fell asleep.

I completely enjoyed this movie, especially Nicole Kidman's performance (she's always good but she really makes this movie). Among the supporting cast, Fionnula Flanagan's turn as the housekeeper is suitably creepy. I did anticipate the twist at the end of the movie, although I still was surprised by one aspect of it. Overall, in a lackluster movie season, The Others stands out."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a movie!!!!","review":"When I put The Others in my dvd player I was expecting anouther cheesy scary movie. But, to my suprise, I was blown away! This movie has a plot that twists and turns and always leaves you guessing! Scary does not even begin to describe this flick!I was also very pleased with Nicole Kidman. I had never seen her in this kind of role, and I had my doubts, but I was so wrong, she was GREAT! Kidman's character is very disturbing, she is seeing things in her house, that her very strict religious beliefs say cannot be! You will be wondering if they are real or all in her head. Her kids don't help her either, they are seeing things as well, but they are sure thier mother is having serious mental problems.I advise anyone who wants to be scared to see The Others, just make sure you leave the lights on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic ghost story","review":"This film proves you do not need special effects to scare people. As Hitchcock once said it is not the bomb going off that scares people, it's the waiting. I watched it at 3 in the morning on my own and I had to grab my cat for comfort. I'll watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Significant Sound Problems","review":"This is a very well written movie, beautifully performed and brilliantly filmed. So why only two stars? My experience with the DVD is that it has significant sound problems. I have an excellent home entertainment system capable of managing a wide dynamic range. Nonetheless, I found that I couldn't hear much of this film. Nicole Kidman whispers through the whole thing, which would not be a problem if the levels had been set properly. Perhaps for the theater they were. But on the DVD transfer it is extremely difficult to hear her. This will be especially true if you are in an apartment with a neighbor who would rather not hear the whole film through the walls, or if you wish to watch the film after the kids go to bed.This is a wonderful film, but watch it at a time when you can comfortably pump up the volume. Otherwise, you'll just end up annoyed that you can't hear a word Kidman says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rentable at best","review":"This movie is average at best. Kidman does a good job, but the story just doesn't come across very well and she has to carry the whole thing. If you want to rent this go ahead but, I certainly wouldn't spend money to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Ghost Story Ever Told","review":"From a confused ambiance of dreams and realities, Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) develops a tension-filled atmosphere of suspense, as unfolding events remain confined to psychologically frightening spaces; within this macabre and diabolical tale of horror.\\"The Others\\" is the greatest ghost-story ever told and stands as the best in its class. Ghost-story lovers, believe me, you have not seen a ghost story quite like this.\\"The Others\\" is a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Creative Ghost Story!","review":"This is without doubt the most original and creative ghost film ever made. It will keep you guessing up to the very end and has a super \\"surprise\\" ending! An outstanding supernatural thriller!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super twist...","review":"In the tradition of an Ira Levin story, ie Rosemary's Baby, Stepford Wives, this movie delivers some serious twists and turns. It had the hairs on my arms standing up for minutes at a time. Not too many jump-out cheeseball scenes here either, The Others is more of a psychological thriller. I found myself thinking about the plot and the ending twist after the movie and saying to myself, \\"Daaaaaaamn.\\" I'd recommend this one to someone who can stay focused and be patient enough to get the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See Movie","review":"This movie was awesome. I love it - even after having seen it quite a few times. You won't be able to understand this until after you've seen it, but, once you've seen it entirely, the movie isn't really scary (this will make sense once you've watched it). The whole movie had an erie sense about it being that it was set in the countryside in post war time in a big castle type property with many many doorways in it. Nicole Kidman has two children in the movie who can't be exposed to the light and this leads to doors being locked and curtains always drawn. The caretakers in and of themselves are a bit freaky, but the main focus are the noises that are heard throughout the house coming from 'The Others'. You really have to see this. I can't say too much more without giving anything away, but it will scare you silly and everyone does an excellent job acting in this. I love it and could see it quite a few times. It's great and gripping and will have you on the edge of your seat for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"an EERIE TALE WHERE NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS.","review":"(REVIEW BASED ON THE FEATURE, DISC 1 OF 2) AFTER SEEING THIS FILM IN THE THEATER, I KNEW I WANTED IT FOR MY DVD COLLECTION. NICOLE KIDMAN PLAYED HER ROLE VERY WELL.. NOT GIVING ANY HINTS AS TO WHAT WE ARE IN FOR. THE FLAWLESS SURPORTING CAST ADD TO THE CHILLS AND SURPRISES. I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANY MOVIE LOVER. IT IS AMONGST THE BEST MOVIES OF THE PAST YEAR. THERE ISN'T ALOT I CAN SAY WITHOUT SPOILING IT FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T SEEN IT. BUT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE SAID, IT DOES HAVE A REWARDING TWIST OF AN ENDING THAT YOU WON'T EXPECT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick Take On a Classic Genre","review":"I'm not going to repeat the praise of other 4/5 star reviews, although everything they say definitely stands. I'd just like to say that 'The Others' proves that the genre of the 'haunted house movie' can be replicated with real panache in the 21st century. The slow, suspenseful build up, sometime shocks, twists and turns follow the conventions of the genre very stylishly. Anyone who felt this film 'plodding' probably doesn't appreciate the slow build up of suspense required to be effectve with this kind of story. Go and see it, and the best advice I can give, is don't bother trying to guess the twists in the tale, just allow yourself to sit back and be entertained. Another piece of advice is: don't read any of the negative reviews here before you see the movie, because from what i've read on these pages, many of those who didn't enjoy it seem determined to selfishly reveal vital plot points to people without considering that this totally ruins a movie for most of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare and unique ghost story masterpiece","review":"when I went to see The Others in theaters, I had serious doubts that it would live up to the suspense of The Sixth Sense. I soon found myself to be very wrong. the others is full of suprises, emotion, romance, and, of course, horror. But whether or not you think the movie is good really depends on your willing to consider the idea that ghosts exist and that there is a supernatural world. If you do decide to see this movie, don't let anyone tell you about it and spoil it. Once you watch it the first time, it will never be the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Okay, I admit that I do not go to see a lot of movies in a given year, but this movie is easily the best one I have seen this year. The way I decide how good a movie is, is by how much I keep talking about it with my wife and by how much I keep thinking about it and realizing more about the movie. This was an excellent movie that kept my mind going for a while, even my dreams later that night. This is a slow moving, that builds up to a surprise ending and it deals with the super-natural, so comparisons to &#65533;The Sixth Sense&#65533; are valid. &#65533;The Others&#65533; is a wonderful, clean movie. Get out of the heat and go to your nearest theater and see this movie. Hopefully this new director (new to us in the U.S.) Will make many more movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Entertainment","review":"My friends and I rushed to this movie the first day it came out. Talk about disappoinment. The movie dragged on for about an hour and there was only 2 scenes that was interesting (but I fell asleep on one of the 2 scenes and missed it, but I was told it wasn't much). Save your money and wait for the DVD. The scenes cut out of the movie might be more interesting than the scenes left in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Here's a movie that looked scary because of its trailers, but sucked major Ass! I remember one trailer saying that \\"The Others has an ending you won't believe,\\" The actual quote should have been, \\"The Others has an ending you won't believe . . . They'd use again.\\" That's right Nicole Kidman and co. are the Ghosts, a totally unexpected plot twist, in 1998, before the sixth sense dominated the box office. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over, please!","review":"Scary? No. Suspenceful? No. Thrilling? No. Worth watching? No. Well, what was it then? It was better than counting sheep! Good nite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Too predictable. A ridiculously poor effort in misdirection. Silly. Slow. Pointless. Tired.

It just didn't have it. Not much scare, not much atmosphere, not much suspense, just ended up being very bland. I had had high hopes for it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Watched part of it. Have no interest in watching the rest of it. Turned it off and went to bed. This isn't even close to being in the same class as The Sixth Sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing \\"thriller\\"","review":"I was expecting a really scary, thrilling flick and got a half-baked fright. The only \\"scary\\" part was the \\"I am your daughter\\" and even that I laughed at. The whole film was a spin-off of the wildly frightening, \\"Sixth Sense.\\" The movie tried a twisted ending, but it was just too easy to predict. I don't like this movie at all and don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage! Pure garbage!","review":"I should think that Tom Cruise who is credited with being an executive producer and Nicole Kidman who starred in this film would be embarrassed for anyone to see it, but they probably have no shame. This is a dark, dreary, and slow-moving movie filled with hard-to-understand dialog and not much of a story line anyway. Save your money and put your time to better use. It simply boggles my mind that so many reviewers gave it more than one star. If I could have, I'd have put it into the minus column, because I'm angry at myself for watching it all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I am sorry, I love Nicole Kidman, but god, this movie bit. The person in front of us kept nodding off. Me and my friend couldn't stop laughing during most of the movie. Nicole looked oh so threating with a shotgun. I was tempted, but didn't, to shout out \\"Hail to the king, baby!\\" Hmmm...what eles...the movie dragged on until the last 5 minutes. It's not as scary as they portray it in the commercials. Some parts, the end and the Nicole vs. The door part, were a bit predicatable. There really wasn't much to the whole plot of the movie. I'm giving it 2 stars for the interesting twist at the end. Best way to enjoy this movie? Go to see it at night, when nobody else is, and do your own Mystery Science Theater. Sorry, but come on...ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, badly done","review":"This is a psychological thriller. Scary but no gore- how I prefer it. Problem being? Nicole Kidman's terrible from beginning to end. The movie is set back before electricity existed and men were away at war, so the dialogue and the children are pretty boring and minimal. Everything is focused around the dictator-like character Nicole tries to play. Yawn. The best parts of this movie are what you saw in the trailer for it! It drags on until the plot twist which reminded me of another certain movie that it worked a LOT better for. Rent this movie if you like these types of movie's but really, don't expect much or you'll be very disappointed. And irritated about the wasted time you can never get back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interest at it's peak","review":"I wanted to see this film without knowing exactly what it was about but purely on suspicion and a hunch. And as always I was definetly right. \\"The Others\\" althogh it is out of the ordinary captures you right from the beginning and takes you on a suspicious ride all the way through asking questions like Who is he? and you do think he's real? Most importantly it makes you wonder of the after life and if there are people that believe in this philosophy. Thiis film wins my vote not because it makes you feel warm and wholesome but because it was well written well played and it displays and it displays elements of a truth that we are all questioning. Very entertaining and Nicole Kindman is brilliant as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn of the Screw type film","review":"Overall a decent film although as one reviewer put it, it shouldn't take you too long to figure out what the twist at the end is. Years back I read a short ghost story from the Edwardian/late Victorian era which is obviously the source of this film, otherwise you could say this film has an almost Henry James Turn of the Screw type atmosphere. The acting is pretty good although the sound and visual effects are pretty much standard for this genre. Altogether a well balanced film, Kidman and Mann both deliver very well - the ending has a twist as said before but for me it seemed more of an anticlimax and quite predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUSPENSEFUL!","review":"The first time I saw the others, I watched it in surround sound in the dark. It was suspenseful but, not scary. Plus it has creepy eerie music in the back round for pretty much the whole film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing !!!","review":"I am not a huge fan of horror movies, mainly because they rely more on blood and gore than a story line. This is now my favorite movie. I can usually predict the outcome of a movie or story but this movie just sucked me right in. The acting and ambience put you in the middle of the story so much so that objectivity escaped me. Nicole Kidman was at her finest. I recommend this to be a movie that you own - not rent or borrow - you will want to see it again, then you'll want to invite friends over to watch it with you so you can enjoy their reaction. It is Sixth Sense and more. It is a story with amazing acting to make you sit on the edge of your seat. Everyone involved in this production deserved accolades."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling thriller","review":"And what a change that is. The Others is one of those sit back and let yourself be quietly swept away to ... well, you'll find out. It builds slowly and quietly and while not much seems to happen at first, you realize that you are hooked. Kidman and Flanagan are excellent in this film. Lighting, sound, music -EERIE. A return to the good, old-fashioned horror movies where you use your head and your imagination to frighten you, not gory scenes of bloodshed. Some have compared this to The Sixth Sense; they are wrong. This is a beautiful piece of filmaking, The Six Sense is a shrink-wrapped mass produced puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"An o.k performance","review":"The others wasn't that scary, but it managed to leave you hanging. In the begining Everything is confusing, but that all ends when the real plot comes in. The old lady in the dress is what freaked me out the most aside from the dead people coming after the mother and children. Nicole Kidman did a excellent job in this movie, and I love her hair blond."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for me","review":"Well, I would disagree with some of the reviews that this was an altogether \\"predictable\\" movie. I think this movie was a very worthy effort and quite better than most scary movies they make these days. I like movies that are actually scary, and that's what this movie is (unlike the useless \\"Scream\\" or \\"I know what you did\\" type genre horror flicks). Yeah, there are similarities to \\"The Sixth Sense\\" within the movie, and these perhaps don't make this movie as refreshing as it could have been. Still, that being said, I would rent this video again and watch it because I feel as though it was entertaining and the horror aspect of it was believable and worked. The dreary movie effects and the cast of this movie were successful in creating an uneasy feeling for the viewer, which is what horror movies are all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the classic Hitchcok tradition, THRLY CHILLING!!!","review":"This film is a love letter to the 1940's horror/fantasy/mystery films.

Unfortunately, this otherwise 5-star CD is seriously (some would say fatally) marred by the inclusion of two tracks, \\"The Farmer\\" and \\"Those Marching O'Neills\\". The former is a song that appeals to childish \\"just discovering dirty innuendo\\" tastes, and the latter is a cacaphonous scrambling of the former. One hopes that the Tinkers' next album won't have such trash on it. In the meantime, burn a CD copy without these two tracks, and then enjoy truly great and innovative performances. Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance....but fatally flawed by smut......","review":"Why on earth the Tinkers, who are otherwise terrific performers, chose to include an infantile vocal track (the kind considered risque at the elementary school level) defies the imagination....and then to repeat it in garbled form as the final track!

What an insult. Furthermore, I thought the lecturer was a total zone out bore who did nothing more than read the too-abbreviated outline. Don't waste your money on this book. Just go to the free test on the MPRE website, and use the Emmanuel flashcards - which are way more comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Band Swing at its best","review":"If you like Swing you will like Renee Baldwin.

The author suddenly transitions from prose to mathematics on a number of occasions and often leaves it to the reader to construct understanding. Scientists often fail to take account of their audience and are, in effect, trained by example in both written and verbal communication to make little effort to construct clear explanations. As an effort to communicate clearly with non-scientists, this book is quite a bit less than successful although it contains material of substantial interest. Not recommended for the general reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really USE your word wall!","review":"This book is a great resource! It includes a wealth of ideas for using the word wall in games, center activities, and includes reproducibles.

So they finally reimbursed me the amount for the zappers but NOT for the shipping. So basically I got ripped off and had to pay $9.95 for this entire wonderful experience.

My last one was nowhere close to the quality of this one. The racket head has some rubber-like flexibility, In order to prevent wear on the swatter from swinging hard and suddenly stopping . This thing puts off 2300 volts, higher than most of the other ones I have seen and used. Unlike my last swatter it doesn't hold a residual charge where you can accidently shock yourself when not using it. I have killed over 100 flies with this on the same 2 AA batteries until my swatter was stolen from me. I am not exaggerating I am currently in Afghanistan and this Forward Operating Base is infested of flies. However, another soldier wanted my swatter enough to steal it. So today I am ordering a new one knowing that this swatter is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Serpari is a good book of poetry. The fiction was pretty rad also.

The test was challenging, but I think I passed at least 2 or the 3. This book was great for the test. The only thing that it didn't cover were the essays.

I've eaten it in the middle of the night when a nebulizer treatment wasn't enough. Truly a lifesaver!!!I'm only giving it 4 stars though because their shipping is kind of pricey.

Sandy is a Southern Conservative girl living in San Francisco in the 60s. Tony Roberts is a liberal and writes for a radical newspaper. They end up living together in the same apartment building and falling in love. Not very charming and not very funny. Good thing Neil Simon made it better with The Goodbye Girl. I like the theme song though, sang by Davy Jones. It seems the song has outlived the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good toilet bowl brush","review":"Hard to find product. I bought three so they would last a while, and I was only paying for the shipping once. I like not having to buy a new brush with the handle all the time. Replacing the head instead makes more sense, and it is much sturdier than the twisted wire brushes that bend under strenuous cleaning. And of course, It is Good Grips so that is always reliable quality. Wish you could find these in stores like Bed Bath and Beyond or Wal-Mart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little pricey","review":"I thought I was getting two for this price. But the option of just buying the head vs. a complete brush is very unique. Bed Bath & Beyond use to sell them in the store.

They also delved into Goth and psychedelic music early on. They broke up and re-formed as a hair metal band in the mid-1980s. Jack Grisham went on to do other things. It's good to hear them again with some of the original energy of their early records. Like The Buzzcocks and Wire, TSOL has gone back to the source of whatever inspired them in the first place. (...) A few songs are better than anything done by those punk bands that have been coping TSOL for years. Jack Grisham is also running for governor of California, which might get more attention than this album. But it is good to see TSOL return to form, because there are very few original punk bands left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"All the positive reviews are true. It's captivating and beautifully written, what there is of it. But the story of the three children's search for their birthparents is hastily glued on to the front of the book. As many reviewers mentioned, the story isn't about them at all. It's about the birthparents who they will presumably never learn about. Why do that without telling us anything about the lives those children ended up having, especially since the older ones remember their difficult beginning? The ending seemed abrupt and disappointing, as it left me with many questions about those children and how this beginning affected their lives. It seemed like half a book, and the other half promised to be even more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really true","review":"As a student of Korean history and culture and as the mother of a Korean adoptee I found this book to be very disturbing. From the stereotype of the father as an alcoholic, gambling, wife-beating, adulterer who had no interest in his daughters to the first wife who just submits to her fate and just lies down and dies when her husband wants to divorce her...I found the story line unreal and contrived.Go ahead and enjoy this as fantasy but don't think you've learned anything about Korea or reasons children are relinquished for adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed reading this book","review":"Really enjoyed this book.

It's better if taken with food."},{"rating":"1","title":"No luck with this printer","review":"I had nothing but problems with this printer.

Black and white text is near laser quality. Of course, you have to have good paper. I printed a few photographs using glossy photo paper and their photo ink and was pleased with the results. The photo ink image was less grainy and had truer color than the same image printed with the regular black and color inks. The one thing you have to be sure of is to use the control panel setup and indicate what sort of image you're printing (b&w, natural color, and vivid color - or someting like that). Photo image color may be unrealistic if you choose the wrong one. Also, this printer can be slow as a dog. Fortunately, speed isn't an issue for me and I am very pleased with my purchase.

And both make lasting impressions.The images range from simple line drawing to watercolors executed while a victim of Executive Order 9066 in which all West Coast Japanese Americans were rounded up and placed in interment camps. It is amazing what he was able to accomplish in the face of circumstances beyond his control. Obata's work is excellent.\\"Topaz Moon\\", \\"Obata's Yosemite\\" and \\"Nature Art With Chiura Obata\\" are the only three books currently in print about the remarkable artist and human being that was Chiura Obata.

The puns were heavy handed, the heroine an idiot.. and I don't think the author passed high school science.

The patterns were blah, the fabric choices she used were beyond bland. All the patterns do have the \\"country look\\" which I like, but there was no pizazz to anyting. I was disgusted within the first few pages. This is the first review I've done on a book (and I buy a lot of quilting books) but I just had to write this one. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rag Quilt book","review":"Each rag quilt project is very clearly laid out and many of the quilts I will work on completing because I like the designs. I work more than full time and have wanted an introduction to quilting and I believe this is method is a good entry point for me and this book is very detailed and will allow me to learn this craft at home when i have a few minutes. Can't wait to start it. Each project is a small quilt (24 inches by 24 inches) but in the back of the book it shows how to add the small quilts and turn them into a full size for your bed quilt. Good definitions and introduction to tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 months of shaggy quilts!!!","review":"Here's another book of shaggy quilts. One for every month of the year. I guess I'm going to be rather busy. These are fun to do and comfy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A year of rag quilts","review":"I have been acquiring books on quilting, crafts, etc., for a number of years. I purchased 2 books on rag quilts at the same time and I think this one has a lot of good ideas that I will use for future projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Compliation","review":"I enjoy compilation albums. IT gives a chance to preview bands you may not get a chance to hear otherwise. This is one of the better compilation albums that I have heard. The second disc is much better then the first as the first contains a lot of tracks you can hear on the radio. I'd give the first disc 3 stars and the second 5.Trivium, Children of Bodom , The Agony Scene and Deicide are some of the many highlights here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great headbanging collection","review":"Despite the editing in some of the songs which really blows. Vol 2 is much better with some of the best bands in hard rock and heavy metal, and I gotta say with kick ass songs from Slipknot, Machine Head, Deicide, Children Of Bodom, Superjoint Ritual, Shadows Fall, Dimmu Borgir, Cradle Of Filth, and great newcomers in God Forbid, Unearth, Trivium, Himsa, God Forbid, and Martyr AD, this collection is back with a vengence. Forget all that Now That's What I Call Music garbage, Headbanger's Ball is the only way to go. Rock On"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and Very Readable","review":"As an official scorer for a university baseball team, I was pleased to run across Andres Wirkmaa's book, Baseball Scorekeeping. I was hoping to find a text that would serve as a guide to resolving those \\"knotty problems\\" that come up every once in a while that present real challenges to any official scorekeeper. Wirkmaa's handy little book accomplishes that, and more. It takes the reader through Rule 10 of the Official Rules of Baseball, step by step, with plenty of examples. Wirkmaa mixes a decidedly scholarly tone -- he is an attorney by trade -- with a sense of humor, all in a very approachable and engaging style. I would have liked to see a few examples of scoring notation to supplement each rule, but since many scorekeepers have their own symbols and tricks, this may have been difficult to do without confusing novice readers. The book is well written, clearly organized, and valuable to anyone who is involved in scorekeeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"oops, bad move.","review":"I've now used the griddle twice. My left knob is loose and the temperatures between the two sides are inconsistent. Also, the gap created in the fold makes it difficult to pour pancakes, you can't pour on top and if you pour close, it may drip down into the cracks. I regret the purchase and wish I would have bought a good, big standard griddle and just kept it above my cabinets. Instead, I bought this griddle that is still bulky on my shelf, doesn't work that great, and isn't good quality. Maybe for tailgating or small apartments you can outweigh the performance issues with the storage benefits. -jl"}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},x={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(N,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-214d40af"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/26.md","filePath":"guide/26.md"}'),R={name:"guide/26.md"},j=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
