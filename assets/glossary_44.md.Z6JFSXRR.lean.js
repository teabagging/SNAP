Very Good product for kids!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It goes with him all of the time","review":"Given to my great grandson for having good grades, he jumped for joy. Everyone wants to use it he says. May just get another one for Xmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a hit","review":"This was a Christmas gift and it was among the first few opened and played with. It's easy to control and seems pretty durable (it's been run into walls and dropped already). It drives over small obstacles (feet, socks, etc.) without a problem. We haven't tested it's durability driving through puddles or anything but it ran into the dogs water bowl and got splashed and it's still ok. The battery life leaves something to be desired so make sure it always gets turned off after use. The little one forgot to turn it off the other day so it sat idle for almost a full day (which might account for our short battery life). But it is definitely a hit... she plays with it every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly impossible to drive, radio spotty","review":"I would suggest you avoid this product. First, it is nearly impossible for a child to drive because of the counter-intuitive control. The left stick controls the left tires and the right stick the right tires. To move forward, you have to press both sticks up. To turn right, you need to pull the right stick BACKWARDS or press the left one FORWARDS or both. It's kind of like the way a tank drives. This setup is sufficiently complicated that both I and my son weren't having any fun playing with this. Straight driving is fine, but turns become completely silly wipeouts with no sense of actual control. Not fun. Second, the car seems to lose the signal randomly even with fresh batteries. It stutters as a result. This does not seem to depend on the range, it just happens right out of the box. So I have a concern about quality also. It otherwise appears to be durable and has a creative design, so it's too bad that it has such an awkward control system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for parents too","review":"This is a nice little remote control car for younger kids. If your getting more than 1 make sure you check Kid Galaxy website and get ones of different frequency or they cannot be used together. We bought 2 and one stopped working within a week of Christmas. Emailed Kid Galaxy and they sent me a new one, no hassle. They are both working well now. We sue rechargable batteries and they do fine. Have held up well to indoor play so far!

He loved it but then there we problems. After the first time use it started to be glitchy (work sometimes then not others, or only work for moments at a time). So we returned it and had another one sent to us. The second one did the same. We returned that one too and got our money back. The only thing good about all this is amazon.com has a great return system, it was easy and free to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this from my local pool shop because it can go in the water as well as on land, and I thought my 3-year-old would like it. I only bought it because it was 50% off, which should have been my first clue it would be a piece of junk that nobody wants. Second, it only goes a few feet before losing the radio signal from the transmitter...horrible. Third, the remote control buttons are the stupid right-only/left-only type, so it is almost impossible to make it go straight, and my 3 years old definitely can't figure that out. Fourth, it goes too slow in the water. Fifth, it's VERY noisy. And, finally, it's not water tight! After only a few minutes in the pool the battery compartment was flooded. So I returned it. Be warned, it's horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA times 2","review":"Bought this for my son's fifth birthday. He was over the moon, we got it out and put batteries in it, and it was completely and totally dead. Devastation. Returned it for another one, since he still really wanted it. So excited when it arrived, but alas also dead. At this point I took the sad five-year-old and the $20 to TRU and let him choose his own present. Super lame all around. Buy from a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing!","review":"I was very disappointed with this toy, and so was my 5-year-old son. He received it for his birthday. We live in a rural area that gets weekly irrigation. It floats in the ditch, but the antenna won't stay upright and fell in the water causing maneuverability problems. The car will not go in gravel, loose dirt, wet grass or grass that isn't freshly mowed. Basically, the only place we could drive it was on cement. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little car","review":"This car has been driven down the stairs, through the dirt and across the pool -- it's still going strong.

Problem is, they operate on the same frequency, so the cars can't be controlled individually in the same location (i.e. one car controls the other, and vice versa) so they can't play with them together. Also, it would be great if these would power down automatically to save the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Purchased this for my 6 year old son and he enjoyed it while it worked. Unfortunately the on/off switch broke in one day.I also purchased the Stingray and the movement is far slower than the shark. I don't know if it was designed that way or a defect. Very disappointed in make and durability and will not buy these series again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy it while it lasts...until it breaks","review":"My son received this Christmas 2007. It has gotten use on and off, mostly off. So, it has not been heavily used. Just recently (Oct. 2008) the car wouldn't turn on anymore. Replaced the batteries but that did not solve the problem. I wound up taking the housing off the car and discovered there is a small plastic stem that goes from the on/off switch on the car into some kind of electric transistor gizmo. The stem itself had broken off, and I found it inside of the car when I opened it. It really isn't repairable, unless I could find a whole new switch piece (fat chance on finding that). At this price level, I think something like this should last longer than it did, considering it only got light-to-moderate usage. It was a pretty fun toy, but durability wasn't up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"My son had such high hopes for this toy--a remote control car that can go on water, too. It did do that and was simple to operate. But, it lasted about 2 months. The on/off switch is junk. Water and sand get deep inside the car. I don't know what caused it's demise but I sure wish it would have lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Battery Life and Conflicting Frequecy Control","review":"Purchased the Land Shark and Cobra for my kids for Christmas. As they were out of school and driving me nuts, I let them open this present early. In one day I have gone through 12-AA batteries (car takes three each). Also, both cars run on the same frequency 49 Mhz. So one controller works both toys causing frustration between the kids. Kids love the toy but each car should be controlled independently and battery life should be improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shark Fan","review":"I got a Morphibian for Christmas. When I accidentally got the remote wet in the tub it stopped working, so be careful! It's my favorite because of the well-shaped, unique remote and the lights on the car. My mom likes how sturdy and cool-looking it is, and how it can drive over rough terrain. I can use it in the wet grass and stuff, and it cleans up great. The batteries last a pretty long time. I really recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"had a faulty receiver or transmitter","review":"Its probably an ok toy but this one refused to move , or just in micro spurts.had to return for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Unfortunately, my car never worked.

Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment because after installing brand new batteries the thing did nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"Was a disappointed, so was the kid I bought it for.

Unfortunately, it is not durable. My five year old got it for Christmas and loved it, but within three months of moderate use (didn't use all that frequently - maybe two or three times a week), it wouldn't work. Really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Improved range","review":"Basically the main problem I have with this is the RC range which is about 10-20ft. So what is the point if RC if the range is so bad. I would avoid this product unless you want to follow it around closely to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more clearance","review":"We got two different varieties of this same toy for our 5-year old twins for Christmas. They were pretty excited and went to test them out before the wrapping paper ever hit the floor. They had fun inside on the wood floor, where the cars ran very well.However, once we got bundled and went outside to test the amphibious qualities of the cars we all soon realized that, despite being amphibious, they performed very poorly on uneven ground - same for the snow and the lake shore. Basically these cars have about 1/8 inch of clearance and get stuck on anything they drive over. Although they are marketed as amphibious, it only means that they are watertight; they CANNOT handle the slightest bit of topography. After the boys tried getting them to run on snow, soil and rocks a few times they gave up and started sledding.The boys still use them, but only in the house. If you want to get a functional outdoor R/C vehicle then this is NOT the car you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud!!","review":"My son who is 7 played with this ONCE!! We put it in the pool & it barely moved. It was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit with the grandson","review":"I bought this for my 5 year old grandson. He plays with it often--probably every day. He doesn't play with it for long at a time but seems to really enjoy it. We haven't had it go through the water but it does well on the hardwood floors and he easily got the hang of how to work it. He also got a more expensive remote control car for Christmas but plays with this one more often-maybe because it is smaller and has an easier time going into smaller spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Durable","review":"My 4-year-old son likes to play 'Crash-em-up-derby' where I control the Shark and he rams into it with his firetruck. This toy has taken a serious beating and still works like we just took it out of the box - over a year ago. Recently we had a pool party and one of his friends left the car AND the remote in the pool. The remote was toast. So I took it apart and let it dry. I put it back together and it still works like we just took it out of the box. I'm not a remote control toy expert, but for the money, I'd say it performs rather well. Highly recommended for durability and hours of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I didn't let the negative reviews keep me from purchasing this!!","review":"I bought this for my friend's son, who just turned 4. And, he absolutely loved it! I did have to teach him not to pick up the car by the antennae because I told him if he did it would break. So I think it will last a lot longer now! He even drove it off the stairs and well, it survived no problem. For the price, I think this little remote control car is a steal! I don't think his mom will let him test the waterproof aspect of this toy, so I won't be able to comment on that, but she's been sending me pictures of him toting around the control and that car a few feet in front of him. I love it, I'm glad I could make a four year old's day with this neat toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it worked, which wasn't long.","review":"My nephew absolutely loved this RC car until it completely stopped working. After a day or two it started sputtering until it eventually stopped responding altogether. Thinking maybe the batteries had died, I replaced them, but still no luck. Other reviews had told the same story, so I returned it and was sent a replacement. The new car is working well, but who knows how long this will last.Amazon's customer service was top notch, so this is most definitely only a review of the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable","review":"The kids love these. I got them for Christmas and they were easy riding, got good distance, and once they got the hang of the controls around the house and outside into the mud puddles it went!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it, battery change is a pain.","review":"For the money this is a fun and durable toy. The steering mechanism isn't completely intuitive and turning is very abrupt and not smooth but its fun for everyone. The toy is supposedly able to withstand water submersion, not that we have tried that or intend to. But, because of that, the battery department is double sealed and requires the removal of two very small phillip's head screws...EVERY TIME YOU NEED TO REPLACE/RECHARGE THEM. Which, can be often if your child plays with this toy everyday. A better design would have been to design the toy with a permanent rechargeable battery that could be docked overnight so that you would not have to open it up every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works...out of the water at least","review":"I bought it last christmas. It still works. I have not tried it in a water yet and don't think I plan to. Since it's 2 controller going same direction for each side of the wheel, it seems bit easier to control for younger kids. At the least it'll do a donut. Still works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent truck, keep away from smaller children.","review":"Feels good and solid when you open the package. The controls and vehicle don't have that \\"cheap\\" plastic feel, but it is a toy. The battery compartment is fairly hard to get in to, but I attribute that to the water tight feature.When this truck is on land it is quicker than expected for a vehicle designed for both water and land. In water it is harder to control and much slower but it does work. The truck did fill with water quickly when being splashed in the pool or is pulled under by smaller children. The antenna is the weak point and my 3yo picked the truck up by the antenna and it has not worked since.Overall it is a good toy for older children who can understand how to control it on both land and in water, and who know better than to submerge the truck and controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun little toy for the week it worked","review":"Got this for my 4 year old son for christmas and he liked it for the week it worked. After a week it the controller went to heck.I didnt want to waste a ton of cash for his first r.c. but I was retaught the lesson you get what you pay for...we got a piece of junk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for kids of all ages! Perfect for birthdays","review":"I originally purchased this for my son's 3rd birthday. I am not sure who has had more fun with this, him or I.We have taken the car in the swimming pool and it survived. One word of warning, the remote control did not survive a complete dunking. I ended up buying another one after that experiment.Since then I have gotten a number of these for birthday presents. The price/fun factor is perfect.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kid loved it!","review":"My nephew loved it! You can't beat seeing the smile on a kid's face! The controls were great for his little hands and he loves sharks. While it doesn't have the educational value of a good book, it does help with learning manual dexterity. It probably won't last forever, but it's a toy. Face it people, little boys are rough and things break. If you're looking for a toy that will be passed down through the generations, then expect to pay A LOT more than $15 bucks. Even if it only lasts 3 months as an RC car, I'm sure he'll still push it around in the dirt and let his action figures ride on it. Unlike some children, he has an imagination and still loves playing with the toys I give him even after they stop running off of battery power. When it's finally time to send it to toy heaven, I'll teach him how to remove the batteries so we can recycle the plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sammy Davis, Jr. Singing at his Best - DISAPPOINTED!","review":"First of all, THE FORMAT ON THIS DVD IS NOT IN \\"COLOR\\" AS STATED - but rather all in \\"BLACK & WHITE\\"!!!

Listen to Hammerhead and Prelude, you'll see what I mean! Not surprisingly, this CD still holds up. This is the best line up in my opinion the Pat Travers Band ever had. Pat Thrall is amazing as is the always tasteful and funky Mars Cowling. Tommy Aldridge, of whom I have always been a great admirer of since he was with Black Oak Arkansas, completely lays waste to any other drummer of that era. Technique and groove rule on this album!

So be prepared to have the spray going all over the place which will eventually damage the sheet rock. If you have tile all the way up, you should be fine. I also find have to turn up the water temperature higher than before to get the same warmth, probably since there's less water flowing and being mixed with air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Great showehead.

There are three different settings - high, medium, and low - in case the pressure is too much. The pressure has worked so well that I shower on the medium setting because it makes my skin red from the pressure. Other reviews have stated that the Oxygenics showerhead creates a loud shower environment, but this is not the case. It is a small, simple-looking showerhead that makes a HUGE difference in the quality of your showers. It doesn't take forever to get shampoo out of my hair anymore and my skin feels invigorated.

I bought this because another product (the X-Stream model) by this same company was closer to the spray and shower that I wanted, but for whatever reason, kept breaking. There is a similar model that you can get for a little cheaper without the flow valve knob on it, and I wish that the spray cone was a bit narrower, otherwise appears to be a decent product. I do like the idea &/or the ability to move the head around easily on a wide angle of the ball joint. It's OK, and I hate the idea and chore of changing out something I've already done, but then again, I think if I found a spray that I liked better (for a better price?), I would change it out again."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange showerhead","review":"If you are right in front of the shower head it is very strong and feels great.

The pressure is amazing for only 1.5 GPM - It feels like you're being blasted with many gallons of scouring water...Blows away my old showerhead (which said it pushed 2.5 GPM). Further, since the water is kind of atomized (is that the right word?) with air when it comes out, it evaporates really fast, making for a nice steamy shower.Final Verdict - This product has the highest ROI of anything I've purchased in the last year or so. $20 for something that is going to make me happy every single day of the year?

I took it off and made sure it was installed properly and free of debris. Honestly, I really hate this product, it is a completely useless piece of junk. I bought a different shower head at Home Depot and changed it myself.This shower head doesn't offer good pressure at all. The pressure isn't even decent and the water isn't jetted out in streams, but rather an oxygenated mist being squeezed out around the head's edges. I have had to add 5-10 minutes to my normally 10 minute shower because the of this wretched product. Also the adjustable pressure lever is horrid.

With a full-time fiddler plying her seductive melodies, sardonic and witty lyrics, and some of Skyclad's catchiest songwriting, this album is one of the top ten metal releases of 1999.

Occasionally, the writing lack vitality, but the author is not a professional writer, he is a veteran i-banker and this is probably as about as good writing as you are going to get out of a banker. His insider perspective is very useful and he tells it as it is without resorting to jargon.My biggest concern is that this book takes too negative a view of investment banks. It seems to assume that investment bankers must play an altruistic role and look out for everyone's interest except their own. This is unrealistic, no other company does this.

The power described by the reviewers of this product convinced me to purchase it even though several people said it did not hold a charge for very long. I did not think that would be an issue since he uses the handheld for very short periods of time. Even so, the battery died after a few weeks. We ordered another battery with no discussion from the company: they replaced it for free. However, within several months, the battery has again died. This is not acceptable for the price, for the low amount of use we have subjected the product to and for the brand name reliability, which reputation has been completely undone for us in this instance. We purchased a Shark in order to have a handheld available in another area of the house and it works reliably, powerfully and charges completely over and over again. What else can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery sucks but the vacuum does too","review":"So I might have a different model than others. The dyson product page says it will last 6 minutes. I get longer than that usually but maybe the battery life ramps down as it ages. The thing is, this is the only handheld vacuum on the market, at the time of purchase, that actually had any power. Most have little power or need to be plugged in. However, it would be nice to have the option of plugging this in. It incredibly useful for cleaning out your car. In your house, well, clean 1-2 rooms and you'll have to wait for a recharge to do the rest. It NEVER loses suction, even when full. I have not had a single problem with this other than the short battery. Oh and if you want to clean a flight of stairs that have carpet, this is useful, but it will only work 3/4 of the way. If you have pets, one flight of stairs cannot be done in one charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money!","review":"Love the suction power!However, the attachment tool is not that great.Plus the price is not attractive at all!Short-lived battery!Will not recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dyson","review":"DYSON DC 6 HANDHELDGave it as a gift to my mother-in-law for her stairs &/or furniture.

They had me take it all apart, wash and clean everything, put it back together and call back. Then they told me they still couldn't help me. Of course, the one item I can't find my receipt for is this - it was a gift. It's not like any one else makes a vacuum remotely like this. I love my Dyson upright but will never try another cordless.

I find it difficult to reconcile spending this kind of money for 5 minutes of usage and then to wait 3 hours to use it again. I called Target to see if I can return it and they said yes with original packaging and sales receipt. I'm very relieved and I also called Dyson to let them know how unhappy I was with this product. Just wanted them to have another voice to add to the pile of complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better products for a lot less money","review":"This vacuum has been nothing but problems for me. The battery doesn't last longer than 10-12 minutes of cleaning. After a few months the machine wouldn't work at all. I called customer service, and she said it's a common battery problem and sent me a free replacement because it was still under warranty. About 6 months later, the same thing began to happen, but now the machine was out of warranty. Battery replacements are very expensive, more than the cost of several brand new competing handheld vacuums.The cleaning power is not very impressive, and considering the short battery life, it is not worth the money.

BUUUUTTTT, it's hard to pick it all up when the freakin' battery lasts only 5 minutes. I thought maybe mine was defective until I read other reviews that they experienced the same problem.

This Dyson is just like that. Believe me, you can't do much cleaning in only five minutes. To make matters worse, the heavy battery makes this model too clumsy to manuver easily. If you really want to have a vacuum handy for a small spill, buy youself a less expensive Dust Buster and have done with it. There are many hand held models on Amazon to choose from for only $20-$50.If this model had a cord, I'd buy it in an instant. Dyson makes great quality upright vacuum cleaners which last and last. Unfortunately, all this model has is a battery.Dear Dyson Engineers:Are you listening to your customers? How hard can it be to add a cord to this thing?

It worked great for literally -3 minutes, then died. I first thought there must be a problem with it malfunctioning, but then it worked again after I put it on the recharger -for another 2 minutes, before dying again. I don't care how good or bad the suction is - if it's not going to work for more than a couple minutes, it's pretty useless! I also had to take it apart to clean the filters after using it 3 times for 2 minutes at a time, which was a hassle. I would not recommend this product at all until it is completely re-worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Suction!","review":"We love this handheld vac so much! We use it all the time and have had it over one year now and it has not lost suction. I found that with the KONE and other dust buster type vacs, the machines just push the mess around - like the vacs blow the items, do not suck them up. It's worth the price and if you get it at Bed Bath & Beyond you save $30 with the 20% off coupon!!! That's what we did :) My fiance loves this machine so much, he no longer uses the real vac, but walks around with this little handheld.

If you are doing major cleaning like your whole room or a full carpeted staircase take out the old plug in as that is not what this is for. it can easily do a whole car (less than 6 minutes) the power is great and it has a lithium battery so it is better for the environment and has no memory effect on the battery meaning it will last a lot longer (years) for this type of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"Don't buy.

It barely picks up anything.And, I have found that if you are not using the vacuum, and just holding it with the nozzle pointing downward, pieces of whatever you just vacuumed up will fall out of the nozzle.Finally, the battery charge did not seem to last very long, even after staying in the charger when not in use.Overall, a very unimpressive product from Dyson.Stick to a good old Black & Decker dustbuter. It will do a much better job at less than half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought it based on the name Dyson - big mistake","review":"This is no better than any other portable vacuum that we have owned, and believe me we have been through several.

You aren't going to pick up anything that isn't right below the nozzle. I was able to clean the tile stairway without a problem, though. I don't know how effective it would be if it were a heavy carpet - suction just doesn't seem strong enough for that. What really brings this product down is the horrible battery life. I had just finished the last stair and it died. A full charge only lasted about 6 minutes. And, when I sent an email to Dyson questioning if this was expected behavior or what could I do to improve the battery life, no response at all. So, between high price for the quality, 'OK' suction, and rotten battery life and customer service, 2 stars is all it gets.

I rang Dyson to complain and was told that the expected operating time was 5 minutes for a 3 hour charge !

How irritating is it to have the machine stop in the middle of a job? My old Black and Decker was so far superior that I'd rather look for a used one at this point. It also does not do a better job at cleaning, suction, or anything else, and the charger takes up a lot of space on the counter. This verges on a rip-off. They do have good marketing, though.

After a full charge, it works for 40 seconds to a minute and after that it just gives up. I can press the button again and it last another 10 seconds or so. So it runs in very short little spurts. When you couple that with its weight its somewhat useless. Suction isn comparable to non-dyson handhelds we owned over the years. The manual has lots of symbols that is in small print. You need some imagination to understand all the symbols in there. I bought it due to my good experience with a dyson upright. I owned the upright for over 4 years and it still going strong. I 'am disappointed with the dc16. It is getting to the point where I will simply trash it. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This is an incredibly useless product. It never worked for me and eventually would only operate for short bursts of a few seconds at a time. Over time Dyson replaced the 'battery charger' which did not help, they then replaced the battery which also did not help. Finally when the conclusion from customer service was that I needed a new 'body' the product was out of warranty and I was told that I would have to buy that from them. Since this cost more than a new Hoover handheld I politely declined. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I will not buy any further Dyson products after this"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't loose suction? oh it sucks alright","review":"We've had this vacuum less than a year now and the battery charge lasts about 1 minute.

This is an over priced and virtually useless handheld unit. The battery life is too short for any real job and without an AC adapter you're limited to cleaning area area about the size of a door mat.

It would turn off after just a couple of seconds, but if I released the button and pushed it again, it would start working again.

By the time my life was back to normal, it had been over a year and Dyson refused to do anything about the battery. I paid $260 for this and it is NOT worth it. To replace it, I got the cordless swivel sweeper and it works great.

This was the first and last Dyson I will every own. It is a piece of junk. Battery life from the beginning was no more than 6 minutes. Barely used it because of the lack of battery time and within one year it stopped working all together. Basically, after less than 20 uses and under two hours of total --the battery gave out. On top of that the suction power is nothing to brag about. I am much happier with a $30 handheld that lasts longer and has the same suction power. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe they are still selling this thing","review":"The battery life stories are actually generous -- this is a complete ripoff in terms of usefulness.

The company, who makes great vacuums otherwise, could not give these things away."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 minute battery life","review":"This vacuum is a ridiculous waste of money. The battery lasted 4-5 minutes, fully charged, when we first bought it. I called customer service and have never been treated so rudely by a company representative in my life. When I finally was able to speak to a manager, she sent a new battery, but the battery life was still 4-5 minutes. Now that we've had it for a couple of years (though we use it very rarely because it's not worth the effort to go get it to vacuum a 3 ft square of carpet), the battery life is down to about 3 minutes. I can't believe they charge $150 for a vacuum that is so much less useful than our $30, 8-year-old Dust Buster, but I also can't believe I paid it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with my purchase","review":"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the Root 6. Battery life is around 5 minutes. That is a well established fact. I have pulled out my Root 6 numerous times and the battery is more than sufficient for situations where one should use a handheld. Anyone who purchases a handheld and expects to vacuum their stairs should take their Dyson and whack it upside their own head. Who does that? I use it for small messes, my SUV, an occasional big spider that I don't want to smash, etc. It works great! Good suction, easy to empty canister, finger trigger works perfectly, I can't complain. The only time I run out of battery is when I run around the house looking for more stuff to clean because I like using this so much. If you can live with 5 minutes of battery, buy it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"phooey","review":"I am relieved to see others have had the same problems with battery life, but now mine has quit powering the unit all together. I bought it in March to keep a new car clean, and it worked okay if I worked fast. Now it shows that it's charged, but will not turn on at all. I was considering buying a Dyson floor model, but due to this fiasco I have doubts; it's a big investment and my experience so far is that it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looks but NOT practical","review":"When fully charged, lasts for 6 minutes only.

Long story short after 5 phone calls I still didnt get my money back so I'm going to the BBB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like they say!","review":"This machine has great suction and you can feel how well it is made when you use it. The battery life is about 6 minutes, which is what the box says it should be. But you get 100% suction for those six minutes, unlike most cordless vacuums I have used that start losing power immediately. If you need the machine for more than six minutes, you may be using it for something better suited for a corded vacuum. And, you never need to worry about ruining the battery by charging it too soon...it completely shuts off when the battery dies: time to recharge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent HANDHELD","review":"This Dyson handheld is powerful and effective in picking up dirt, animal hair, dry spills, etc. It is somewhat awkwardly shaped, but no comparable handheld is tiny. The shape is much more ergonomically friendly than other handheld models I tried. I already own a Dyson upright, and was not sure I needed a handheld, however it is very easy to pick up, use and drop back into the charger, making small cleanup jobs much easier.Much has been made about battery life on this model. This is NOT a full size vacuum; it is battery operated. Expect that it will not clean your whole house on one charge. However, since it is trigger operated, it does not have to be on continuously. I found the battery life enough to vacuum my car completely, probably the largest job I would expect to have to do with a hand-held. Based on convenience, strong and effective suction, and adequate battery life for appropriate jobs, I give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting to the problem of the Root","review":"While others have noted that this vacuum works well (not superbly) for the 5 minutes the battery lasts, how many of your cleaning jobs are finished in 5 minutes? I would assume that many people envision using this for cleaning cars. You can vacuum one car on one charge if you rush. But you will wait hours to recharge before cleaning a second car. Even the relatively simple job of cleaning a sofa and a couple of chairs will use up most if not all of the battery charge.If you really have only 2 or 3 really small jobs on any given day (a minute or two in duration) then perhaps it will suit your needs. The price for those few minutes, however, seems unreasonably high.The short battery life is a major flaw for a product at this price. Dyson really ought to take this off the market and back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longevity","review":"What this product needs is a power source (electric cord) rather than the battery it runs from.

Nowhere does it ever say that - or that is inteded for ONLY quick pick-ups. Also, you have to hold the on botton to make it work. Hard on the hand. Come on Mr. Dyson. You hood-winked us on this one. The regular vacuum is hard to do steps by using the extension. It tips over - I thought this was the answer for all the jobs the big one can't do.

It actually sucks VERY well. The Darth Vader ray gun look will ensure the macho men in your family will use it and not be embarrassed. Since I got mine (and my home office is on the third floor) at least the stairs are always dust free. To be honest, I mostly use it to suck up the \\"stink bugs\\" which infest East Coast houses fall through spring. That is good because these charge just long enough to vacuum a flight of stairs or suck up a half-dozen unwitting stink bugs.Mine stopped holding a charge after about a year or so, and a replacement battery is something like 80 bucks. I'm not usually the kind of guy who spends two hundred bucks on a hand-vac. I am definitely not the kind of guy who does so two years in a row."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"Nice idea but terrible execution.

Normally, I would not spend $149 on a handheld but given my experience with the upright, I did. Battery life is so poor that I thought there had to be a defect in it.

And the suction is not \\"powerful\\" compared to non-cordless handhelds; their advertising is misleading, it should say \\"2x as powerful as other *cordless* vacuums\\". We bought this item to vacuum one small 11 step carpeted stairway.

So I wrote to customer service at Dyson alerting them that the product was clearly defective. Their response? They forwarded my e-mail to engineering. That's right, after paying a premium price for a premium product, the company's response was to alert the folks who created an inferior product that mine didn't work. Stay away from this particular model, but more importantly, stay away from Dyson. Poor quality from product to customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's wrong with the battery?","review":"I see reviews bashing the product battery. This is a handheld vacuum, it's not designed to vacuum your whole house. I have found that this is the absolute best handheld I have used and our household has gone through many. This is the strongest, quietest & most durable that I have used yet. Oh yea, and the most expensive. You get what you pay for! As for the battery, I have yet to do a clean up job that the battery didn't last for the entire job. Battery life is conserved due to a simple trigger design to turn the product on and off. Simply squeeze the trigger to turn it on and release to turn it off. This gets five stars simply because we have gone through at least 10 different model handhelds and this beats all of them hands down. Worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your battery will give out in a few months and a new one costs $75","review":"I drank the Kool-Aid.

I would never, ever buy another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Piece of Crap","review":"Based on our satisfaction with our Dyson upright we bought this handheld unit a year ago. 12 months later after very little use, the battery - which sucks to begin with (6 minute run time)now only runs for 60 seconds if we are lucky. Product is a complete rip off and a stain on Dyson's reputation. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing something like this and charging $150 for it is the ultimate insult. You are essentially making a $150 donation to Dyson for a useless paperweight. Would not buy another one at any price. It has no electric option so it is dead weight when the battery stops and it will stop before you can even think about getting anything done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Lose Suction--Doesn't Have It in the First Place","review":"We bought a Dyson upright years ago and are still very pleased with its performance. About a year ago, we bought the Dyson handheld for quick clean-ups. I was aware that most handheld vacs have notoriously short battery lives, but I wasn't expecting to use it for more than a few minutes at a time anyway. Unfortunately, the suction on this handheld is so powerless that it takes longer than a full battery-charge to clean up all but the tiniest of messes. It's a shame James Dyson traded on his reputation for quality and let such a shoddy product out onto the market. I just think things should work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"way overpriced","review":"This vacuum performs ok but is heavy and only lasts a few minutes before it has to be recharged. Most of my vacuuming jobs take more than a few minutes. For $150 this vacuum should be perfect and instead it's merely average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Battery Life","review":"I too experience poor battery life with the product. The Vacuum is a nice handheld unit but I can't even make it up a flight of stairs without having to recharge. Anyone know if there is an extended battery on the market for the Dyson DC16?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bummer for a Dyson lover","review":"I couldn't wait to get the Dyson Root 6 - I've had my Dyson DC 07 for 4 years and I LOVE it, so I figured the mini-version would be fantastic. I have 3 Dustbusters (one on each floor) and I was looking forward to the Dyson version, which I was convinced would be top notch.I'm so sorry to be wrong.First off, having to press the button continuously to make it work is a pain. And speaking of pain, the Root is so heavy and unbalanced - all the weight is in the back which puts a lot of strain on your wrist. I haven't noticed any difference in suction to a Dustbuster, but then again, I don't suck up bowling balls. A Dustbuster picks up lint and cat litter just as well.Save your money - this Dyson ain't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not lose suction, but loses power almost instantly!","review":"When I first heard that Dyson was going to make a hand unit, I was very excited, but excitement has turned into bitter disappointment as this product has failed to deliver on the most basic requirement: FUNCTION!It simply has terrible battery life, in fact its worse than my old Black & Decker products from five years ago. I think it lasts about FIVE MINUTES, even if that. In this age of iPods with 24 hour batteries and mobile phones that last over a week, you would think Dyson would have at least develop a battery that could last an average house cleaning of say one hour.Shame Dyson, shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"This seller is NOT an authorized Dyson seller. The warranty won't be honored by Dyson.","review":"I bought this item September of 2009. It has a 2 year warranty. In the last month the rechargeable battery does not keep a charge beyond 2 minutes. When I contacted Dyson they advised me that this seller bought this item from them in 2007 or 2008 and is NOT an \\"authorized\\" re seller. Therefore the 2 year warranty was null and void. I emailed the seller 4 days ago and have received no response. BEWARE OF THIS SELLER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO Dyson DC 16 Batteries won't recharge after only 10 days.","review":"I purchased TWO Dyson DC 16 vacuums 10 days ago. BOTH of them have a faulty battery. Neither battery will recharge. The green charging light comes on for about 5 seconds then turns off leaving a dead battery. It's shocking that thess vacuums are still for sale as its obvious there is a huge problem with the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyson DC 16","review":"The Dyson DC 16 does everything that it claims to do so I am pleased as it serves its purpose for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery life","review":"I am very disappointed by this handheld vacuum. You're lucky if you can get through vacuumming your stairs before the battery dies. I contacted Dyson and asked about the batttery life a woman responded that the battery should last you about 5-6 minutes. Are we kidding!! I would not recommend this until they can fix this problem. Thank god the upright doesn't work off a battery.Also what I didn't like about this vacuum is that you have to hold the power button down while you're using it!! After about a minute, your hand is killing you. But luckily, since the vacuum cuts off about three minutes into your cleaning process, your hand will only hurt while using it for a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super-Cool","review":"From the best song of \\"...art\\" comes the best single since !+(the song formally known as).

The syrupy orchestral arrangements here take his simple, beautiful music and turn it into something that is not IZ. I am just speaking for myself but I could not get through this CD. It made me feel sad which is something his music never does.PS: This wonderful promo video has nothing to do with the music on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a train wreck.","review":"I just finished listening to the complete CD and did not notice it had ended. Over produced is one term that comes to mind. Orchestrated in bizarre parts throughout. The reviewer who called it \\"The Little Mermaid\\" type of music was correct. It just doesn't sound right. The simplicity of Iz and a ukulele on a white sandy beach was tied to the Disneyland Monorail and Goofy was the pilot. A disaster on the scale of Ishtar. Sometimes, shoes are not required.Iz is beautiful, but nothing new here. Don't waste your money. The two stars are for Iz, otherwise zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I love Iz's music - if you do too - skip this CD. The orchestral arrangements are formulaic, weak and hokey. I was hoping there would be some innovative takes on the music - but it left a lot to be desired.If you like Yanni, John Tesh, or Muzak - by all means get this one.Otherwise - stick to the original cuts of these songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy! Do not buy!","review":"The amazing thing is that Iz survives the cheezy obviously-computer-generated orchestrations dubbed incongruously onto his music. It adds nothing, yet is unable to destroy the soul of the music. That is almost a reason to buy the CD, just to witness this, but then the producer would get money, which he should not get. Like the first time I heard the White Album as elevator muzak, this is a truely distressing CD. And yet, unlike John, Paul, George, and Ringo, Israel Kamakawiwo\`ole survives the humiliating debasement of his music. With all of your might, do not buy this CD. Instead get Facing Future if you are new to his music.Facing FutureKurt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is pure Muzak and is Brother Iz's classic songs re-released terribly as bad elevator music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Point, Barrel Scrapings","review":"I am kind of a total fan of Iz, I have pictures of him, t shirts, bone hook necklaces, and I have every CD, plus all the Sons of N, so I know the songs by heart..... and that is what is missing with all this smooth orchestra varnish. Heart. I think the reason so many of us are so deeply connected with his music is that it showed his heart and spirit, even in the silly songs. So I bought this, and listened to it once, but I just can't stand it. It's like they dipped it in plastic. It's like twisting the truth. I can see why people would like it if they had never heard the others, because you can still hear his voice over all the orchestra traffic, but I hope that you 5 star reviewers try listening to the originals.Sigh. I wish that there were more of his recordings, but I guess this shows that they have scraped the bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously...","review":"What did I do to deserve this in my recommendations?

The orchestra add-on was way overdone in my opinion... if you're into \\"The Little Mermaid\\" sound, then this is probably for you, but if you're looking for more of IZ's sweet voice and beautiful, clean sounds of ukulele, don't bother buying this CD. You'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy-But works","review":"When I received the item, it was packaged in a regular manilla envelope. Needless to say, it was slightly bent when it was received. It is very flimsy as I was afraid to straighten it out for fear that it may break.

It was Okay to me.. but I am just wondering why Grady's sent me only ONE ITEM and charged me for TWO!? And, why they sent out to their customers via the Post Office something soft and easy to bend like those Al-hood-filters without any hardcover to protect it?Very disappointed with Grady's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged upon Receipt","review":"The item arrived bent because it was packed poorly, sitting at the bottom of a box with many other items on top of it. It's lightweight metal, so it doesn't bend back into place without noticeable bend marks.Since it's installed, it's not worth the hassle of returning. It's just disappointing that Amazon fulfilled my order so poorly, even with several existing customer feedback remarks about this item being damaged from bad packaging.I, myself, read the feedback before purchasing and decided to take the chance.

Six tracks from 1946 with Stan Kenton's\\"Kentones\\" lead off, followed by by some 1957 tunes with the Les Brown and Jerry Gray orchestras. The final five numbers are from a session June did with Shelly Manne and His Men in 1965. Christy's improvement in tone and confidence are obvious between the 1946 and 1957 sets, and it's obvious during the last 10 songs on this CD why she was a dominant vocalist in jazz circles untilher retirement. Christy hits \\"I'm Thrilled\\" and \\"Something Cool\\" are here, along with some songs not regarded as her tunes like \\"Get Me to the Church on Time\\" and \\"An Occasional Man.\\" The variety -- and the evolution of the singer -- are interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This particular Kindle version is *TERRIBLE* -- atrocious, unreadable formatting","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PARTICULAR KINDLE VERSION: It is just a freely available, public domain PDF that someone uploaded to the Kindle service, and the text that results from the conversion process is nearly unreadable.

Also known as the \\"Roman Catechism,\\" it was promulgated under the Council of Trent and written by leading Catholic theologians of the day.The only reason I've deducted one star is that the Kindle formatting has a fairly significant problem. The table of contents takes up a lot more space than it should, and is hard to navigate, because it includes many lines of \\"dot leaders\\" carried over from the print edition.

And yoga has been around forever (I'm pretty sure cavemen did yoga).I appreciate Ruskan's idea and his ability to articulate it, but I'm also a bit wary of his dogmatic adherance to one form of therapy, especially when he starts recommending against antidepressants because they \\"block off emotions for clearing\\". He begins to sound less like an accepting eastern meditator on emptiness and more like a puritanical westerner who sees pain as the only passage to happiness.

Too many times the professor asked us to please disregard this word or that sentence, and she often expressed frustration with the book, which makes me wonder why she asked us to use it in the first place.The bottom line is there are plenty of good books out there that do a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"The book was in great shape when I bought it.

And the air bubbles common to such sheets were fairly easy to work out.The finger styluses are a pleasure to use; I do wish there were a way to attach the styluses to the carrying case when not in use, to prevent loss. An inventive buyer could use the enclosed Velcro sticker -- intended to hold the PDA to the case -- on the styluses instead.My only concerns involve the pricing of these PDA accessories:Since most PDAs are sold with carrying cases, I think that enclosing one in the starter kit is unnecessary. It further jacks up the price of the already overpriced cleaning pads and styluses.Overall, a very good product with big built-in profit margins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rabbit Housse Ever","review":"My fiance had this house for his rabbit. I specifically hunted this house down for my 2 year old rabbit. She had been living in a build a bear box, until I finally upgraded her house to this house. I love the quality of the house, the nails are small and not a danger for my rabbit, the wood is natural and safe for her to chew on, and she can enter the house through the window or door. I never thought I could get her to give up the Build-A-Bear Box, but it was trashed 3 days after she received this. I put a blanket in it and on top of it. she loves to sleep on the top of it. She frequently marks it with her chin to say \\"she loves it\\"! This is one of the best purchases for rabbits!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my bunnies love it!","review":"This is great for my bunnies, and they love it. The bigger compartment fits them both, but it is a bit of a tight squeeze. The only reason I didnt give this 5 stars (4.5), is because the cut-out hole is too small for them to fit through, but they love to chew it. My buns love to run through things and look through holes, so Id say make the hole bigger so medium size rabbits (5-6 lbs) can fit through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use as intended","review":"I bought this product because the top was larger than most of the competitor's houses (which tend to slope in and have a small top).

Triple H again puts himself over at a pay per view and has a 2 star match with Shawn Michaels in a match that never shouldve been given over 30 minutes! Triple H shouldn't have even been wrestling, as his knee was banged up and he has trouble doing any moves at all. Triple H has yet to let any of the younger stars go over him. The rest of the card is a run of the mill house show type event. The only exception is Kurt Angle FINALLY being given a run as the WWE champion with a win over the Big Show. Kurt was so misused in 2002 though that the win does little for his career. This event is not worth going out the way to purchase or for that matter, even to rent.

There's a bit ofa conceptual problem with the thought of introducinga \\"speck of infinite mass\\" as the basis of theinversion drive. If the mass were infinite, a\\"speck\\" or \\"big hunk\\" would be the same.The technobabble is a bit on the weak side, butthe spiritual aspects of the story really shine.The concept of the extragalactic drive throws abig wrench into the Star Trek continuity's works.Of course, this story was written before NextGeneration came on the scene, so that's forgivable.Yet, there is a problem in that this mission hadto have taken place during the \\"first five years\\"(Kirk is a Captain, not an Admiral, and thebook was written before he was busted). So,it's difficult to wedge this one into the continuity.That doesn't mean that it's a bad story.

The story captures the feel of the original series far better than most novels, and could easily be seen as a potential episode in the series.On the negative side, I've always found stories that involve non-linear time and attempts to imply that cause needn't predate effect a little too \\"zen\\" for my taste. As, in fact, was most of the philosophy hinted at in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had written this book, and could claim these ideas.","review":"While Ms.Duane is creative and lends believability to fantasy in her work, this book offers a fertile bed for dreams to grow in.

Extra-galactic travel would be possible, for instance. One third of the way through the book is a Klingon ambush that I wish would have been more developed, but was nevertheless very exciting.Midway through, however, the story begins to rely heavily on fantasy sequences that are happening in the minds of the crew. A little bit of this is okay, but by the end, the story is dominated by it. That was very disappointing, and didn't have much of a science-fiction feel to it. For that reason I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wounded Story","review":"For those of us who enjoy a page-turner with the action running thick and fast thru complex plot twists, this book is NOT for you. The book is bogged down in detail and trivia which seems to take precedent over the predictable story line. I found myself speed-reading in order to skip the pages of detail and background that mostly do not add to the plot. However after saying all this if you are a reader who thrives on detail, then if with a predictable plot, you will probably find this book a pleasant read as the detail, rather than the plot, is quite complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book with fantastic section of color plates in the back","review":"Very nice book from the 70's which has the added bonus of 84 color plate illustrations in the back of famous art pieces in the Louvre .

My favorites are Crooked Booty, Follow The Light, On&On&On, 6 Minutes, Excalibur and Rollin'. The production on this album is some of the best that I have heard all year.

The reviews seemed to show that it was challenging enough, but simple enough for beginners. When I got it, I was pretty disappointed. The first workout was not at all challenging. I'm not an incredibly fit person and had not used a workout video in several months due to pregnancy, but jeez, I didn't even crack a sweat. It also looked like it was filmed in a bargain basement.

The next section is with the other female on Biggest Loser, and you have a challenging workout with her that gets the sweat rolling. The moves are easy to follow and get results. The final segment is with Bob and it's the most difficult section. He taps into his yoga and pilates moves in this segment and the core gets a great workout from the moves he has you do. You get a great overall total body workout and one that makes you sweat. It's varied with having 3 instructors so you get a variety to fight boredom.

She can push anyone, regardless of your fitness level, and if you stick with it you WILL see results. I also own her 30 day shred DVD. It's a great muscle building program!I enjoyed the biggest loser power sculpting workout due to the change of trainers between levels. They keep it upbeat so it doesn't get boring. If the workout becomes to easy just up the amount of weights your lifting. There is no reason you can keep up with this DVD forever-just adding more weight when you need to. I switch btwn 10 lb weights 5 for the weaker muscles groups or extended reps. Keep doing this and you will transform your body!

I did this workout for the first time yesterday, so I've only tried Level 1 so far. I felt like I was in class with Jillian! She moves through the exercises quickly, so your heart rate stays up. The exercises are simple, so its easy to maintain proper form. She does a very good job of showing the moves. I loved it! I really felt like I had a workout comparable to what I get in my gym class.By the way, I've had a bilateral mastectomy with TRAM reconstruction. What that means is that I'm missing about 40% of my tranverse abdominal muscle (the one that runs vertically from the pelvis to under the ribs).

Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy these workouts at all. They kept me moving, yes, but they were too simple for me. I'm not a beginner, but I am by no means advanced. I thought I would like that the workout used former contestants, but I don't like it. They didn't stay together and the trainers didn't always do the whole workout so I felt like I was doing things wrong by watching them. The kickboxing segment that was supposed to be Level 3 was about as intense as walking. I see what that trainer isn't on the show anymore, she's just not very good. I would reccommend this video if you are new to exercising, but I would do something like Jillian's 30 Day Shred first so you actually learn about good form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure yet!","review":"I turned on this DVD this morning for the first time (after I finished working out to another of Jillian's DVD's). For starters, the \\"background\\" music is too loud. Secondly, the trainers, especially Jillian, show the correct way to do the exercise maybe one time, and then you get to watch the class participants the rest of the time, and several of them are not doing the exercise correctly and/or have bad form. I'm new to exercise, so I need more proper instruction than this. I'm not giving up on this DVD yet, I'll actually try the workouts before I decide whether or not to keep it. I've been doing Jillian's \\"The Complete Workout for Beginners\\" for the last 6 weeks, and it's a good workout, but it's time for me to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Sculpt","review":"Very intermediate workout if you already are in shape.

I workout 5-6 nights per week, and even though I am in pretty good shape these Biggest Loser DVDs kick my butt! I love the power sculpt DVD because it really flies by, 3 different segments with each trainer really helps, plus you really feel it in your muscles the next day. I also love working out with \\"real people\\" on the videos-mistakes and all. The one complaint I have is Kim-her voice drives me INSANE and I now realize why she is no longer on the tv show. Her segment's workouts are pretty good, but unfortunately I am so disctracted by her voice that I am just waiting for it to be over..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great DVD","review":"I bought this DVD a few months ago. I must say that I was a bit skeptical when a bought it, but it really does work. I fee more energized, and I feel stronger (both physically and mentally).The DVD is great because it has three separate workouts for each level of skill and as a person becomes stronger they can advance to more challenging workouts. The first day I did the tape I felt no different after completing the workout than I had before working out. I thought this is not working. I DID FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE WORKOUT THE NEXT DAY!!If you are looking for a workout that is quick and gives you results than this is the workout for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Fluff","review":"You think because this is from some reality show it's going to be fluff? No way. The beginner workout is tough but doable (weeks 1-2). The week 3-4 workout is difficult at best. The week 5-6 workout forget it. You're dead. Everything's done from plank and push-up position.But, it's a good pain. I've seen serious results just after a few weeks in terms of my overall strength, especially my core.My only complaint is that some of the routines seem rushed and they don't do enough reps in some of the routines. Some of them you want it to end and end now but others they just whip through it. I think the lunges are done too quickly and you have to be careful of your knees when you are just starting because the stability isn't there yet. Man, these guys love their lunges though.The price-to-pain ratio on this DVD is perfect though. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to get started with dumbbells weights and then continue to be challenged as they progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Tough enough!","review":"Look, I'm no super athlete- not at all- but I do workout & I want Fast results. I use Tae bo, Fighting fit, & Jillian Micheals 30 day shred regularly. After completing the 30 day shred (which was awesome- tough, and got great results! especially when you two in a row!) I was swayed into getting this Power Sculpt and Cardio max just for some variety- This was a BIG dissapointment after the Jillian Micheal's 30 day shred. This just does not cut it. The warm up is a joke- I went through all six customizable workouts at once and did not feel any benefit except for small portion of the last two workouts.Ok- Maybe- if you are brand new to this- this is the dvd for you- but if you are coming off of any other form of fitness training- advance to something harder and better- like Tony Horton's 10 minute series or the P90X"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Not Tough Enough","review":"I love Turbo Jam (Chalene Johnson) and Jeanette Jenkins' workout videos because they are so fun AND effective. I bought this video because it had such good ratings. Did the workout once and will never do it again.

She makes a lot of mistakes in her instructions. I don't know why they didn't stop recording and start over! After doing the workout a few times, it's just too annoying to do the segment with her.The other segments are good and I like that the DVDs are set up that you can choose which portions of the DVD you want to do. But after leaving out the Jillian part, it's only a 20 minute workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment...","review":"I bought this because I am a big fan of the Biggest Loser. But this exercise dvd was a big disappointment to say the least. The only way I got anything out of it was to ONLY watch Bob, Jillian, and Kim on how to do the exercises. The contestants didn't know what they were doing and it made it really hard to follow. Big waste of money!!!

Whenever I can't make it to the gym due to be pressed for time, I do one of the routines on this DVD and even the 10 minute ones still kicks my butt!My only caution is for beginners (and I saw someone else mention this) watch the trainer for form- a lot of the attendees in the class are hurrying to get the reps done and their form is off and you can hurt yourself.Superficial complaint: I could do without the blonde trainer being cutesy and wasting time making eyes at the camera chirping \\"Don't you dare put that weight down! Don't you dare!\\". I wasn't thinking about the burn or putting the weight down until you started bringing it up so much.

The set also includes songs recorded earlier & later than my favorites, serving as bookends of enjoyment. The book focuses on Belafonte's personal life up to and including the making of \\"Island in the Sun.\\" The only flaws I could find was that the book contains no lyrics and little about the music itself or the artists that helped Belafonte sound so great.

I do not believe that this book gives glory to God, but rather focuses too much on the power of the devil to destroy lives when we open ourselves up to his power. True? Yes.

For some reason I could not read this book at night, feeling frightened, much like a child when waking up in the middle of the night in a dark bedroom - afraid that something harmful might be out there. I had to leave the book outside the bedroom. Also, my wife could not bear the presence of the book - she never read it. She would glance at the cover and ask me to put it away somewhere.

He tends to use allot of metophors which is not a bad thing, just not my style of reading.I also found that the book tends to be a bit laid back on the whole subject.

None of the stories can be varified at all, and Martin has made a name for himself in literary and Church circles for spreading lies and calumny. The reality of exorcism is not in question, but Martin is not the man from whom to get the story. I reccomend instead the excellent book on the subject by Gabriel Amorth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense lesson in Excorcism and possession","review":"Right from the start you're thrown into scenes of irratic behavior from the five subjects then it brings you back to the beginning of how the posession had all started. The writer is gives a very in depth explanation as to the several hypothesis of how possession occurs and how it affects the subjects. I would recommend this book even though at times it seemed a like it was dragging out a subject in particle but overall was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil Made Me Do It!","review":"When I'm not busy writing about vampires (Reflections of a Vampire), I sometimes dabble with devils. And so, I came across Martin's \\"Hostage.\\" Tap into true terror involving the real life interplay between human and diabolical forces. This well written book terrified me so much that I had to think twice about turning off my bedroom light. Malachi offers us five cases of possession complete with vivid details about the on-coming event, the case particulars, and chilling insights as to why the individuals were snared by demons. He also was kind enough to provide the Exocist's Ritual. Just in case! So there you are: a spine-tingling depiction of the desease along with its cure. As the old song goes: who could ask for anything more? If you delight at being frightened out of your wits, read this book now. And DO keep the lights on! I highly recommend Malachi Martin's Hostage to the Devil."},{"rating":"2","title":"my thoughts","review":"i read this book after first reading M. Scott Peck's GLIMPSES OF THE DEVIL. Peck's book referred to this author as his mentor. Peck's book was a better read. this book was written by someone who was very much a writer. when i read it, i thought that the author spent more time than Peck in \\"shaping\\" the story. i do not doubt the details of the story at all but when you read it it almost reads like fiction, compared to Pecks' book. a very interesting book, to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"this was not factually researched like his other book on the papacy...it was more like superstitious drivel preying on the gullabiiity of readers. seemed to be superstitious hype in the guise of religion"},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!!!!","review":"This book is dangerous. By opening it up, you are inviting a world of evil into your life. I am a non-denominational christian who was raised catholic, so i've seen both sides of the coin regarding excorcism and spiritual warfare. Not only is this book one-sided in favor of oldschool catholocism, but it focuses on evil in such a way that compells and captivates the reader, glorifying Satan in a not-so-obvious way. Remember, Satan is the father of lies, and many might think reading a book about excorcism written by a jesuit priest is harmless and safe, when in fact it is not. After the introduction and story of Father Michael in China, i felt driven to prayer, and then promptly returned the book to the store i purchased it from earlier that same day. I should have just burned it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"are these really possessions?","review":"This reading was recommended to me as awesome and shocking. Well, it doeshave a shocking lead-in...but the following demonic show-downs are reallyvery boring and way too intellectual. The author is very obviously a highmuckety-muck in the Catholic Kingdom...but the chosen excorcisms are verymuch politically correct chosen segways...the possessed christ-like padre...the sexually confused neurotic...these read like want-to-be-savedconfused people. Saving grace...the basic handbook to exorcisms--that isa scream. FACT...exorcisms are on the rise in Europe, especailly Poland.But it seems to me this samcks of psycho-drama rather than real git downspiritual warfare. If it does some confused souls some good...okay. Justdon't confuse it with real demonic fervor....McK"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dash of Oral Roberts and P.T. Barnum","review":"What this book does is convince weak-minded Catholics and impressionable altar boys to keep patronizing the Church and donating money to support the whole facade. Nothing like a good ol' boogeyman masquerading as a priest to thump on his Bible and warn us of the evils in this world that will engulf us if we don't hand blank checks to our local Church! Malachi Martin spewed his rhetoric like Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, and other great con men who know how to keep their money coffers full. Martin's ingenious spin was to use \\"demonic possession\\" an untapped racket that lost popularity after \\"The Exorcist\\" phase. Buy this book for scaring Boy Scouts sitting around the campfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"too flowery for my taste","review":"The matter of evil is something we learned from the (SND) as childern. The Sisters of Notre Dame really knew how to scare the devil out of you. I only read Malachi Martins book during my lunch hour (well lighted). But it still gave me nightmares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, puts things in perspective","review":"If you ever thought you might be possessed...or know someone who is, it's a must have. If you ever thought you were a really mean person or were told so by others.. keep reading!! I think kids in the 6th-10th grades should be required to read this material. Just in case! It's really not as frieghtning as the people on here will have you believe. If you have a clean soul you have nothing to fear or worry over. If you don't, then maybe you should read it even more. There is nothing wrong with trying to identify what you are lacking in spirituality.. and that you are lacking doesn't mean you are finishished for good. I think that is what this book is trying to say. All the subjects in this book wanted help..and that is why they were saved. You can be saved from anything you want to be rid of that holds you back because you have free will..and that's the over-all theme. A good book and easy to read if you have at least a 9th grade education level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real-life cases from the '60s and '70s","review":"Martin, an experienced exorcist, presents five full true-life accounts of demonic possession from the 1960s and 1970s. The book is made more interesting by the fact that each case has a different exorcist with his own personality, history, and flaws. (Martin's personal career as an exorcist was primarily in the 1940s and 1950s. He is apparently more of a consultant on such matters now.)Interestingly, a Web site claims to quote from a Martin interview that, in his opinion, \\"Cases of possession and obsession have increased about 750% since the early 1970's.\\" It is therefore doubly unfortunate that so many skeptical bishops have effectively forbidden the use of exorcism in their jurisdictions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This one creeped me out for a long time. Martin is a great story teller. Although based on actual cases, this book rivals the best fictional horror stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, but....","review":"Malachi Martin is a terrific writer, *BUT*1) Have any of these stories been independently verified (either the witnesses involved or the priests)?2) How much did Malachi interject of his own *creative* material?If the voices, cold rooms, and shaking furniture *actually* happened then we really have something going on here, but if these occurrences were interjected to make the stories exciting, then I'd say there is a problem.Any comments?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostage to the Devil is a page turner","review":"Malachi Martin provides five stories of documented exorcisms in the United States. The appeal here is the reality and reasonability of each story, and the fear of the reality of evil. Evil exists and Martin helps us see it up close as manifested in a few cases of exorcism. The five last chapters provide a nice overview, and Martin's views in addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I judge this on?","review":"When you enter a church and the presence of God fills you, it is the Holy Spirit. Every time I read this book, I had the opposite feeling, almost an emptying of my spirit. The person who lent the book to me had similar experiences. Therefore, I can not say it was a pleasant read. It is important to understand the devil's power that remains after the victory on the cross, but a thorough read through the book of Acts would give you the same thing. The priests committing the exorcisms in this book seem to have the same problems as the Sons of Sceva did in the book of Acts; saying the name of Jesus without the authority of Jesus. While this book may prove to some who believe in nothing that there is something, I can not recommend it because of the weight it put on my soul. If you want to understand the authority we have as Christians, I recommend \\"Fresh Power\\" by Jim Cymbala."},{"rating":"1","title":"I suspect that Father Thomas Euteneuer's \\"Exorcism and the Church Militant\\" would be a superior recommendation.","review":"Over the past few years, I'd read snippets from this work. When I finally got around to tackling the book, I found myself putting it away after several hundred pages. Various sections struck me as entirely too lurid. While I have not yet read it, I suspect that Father Thomas Euteneuer's \\"Exorcism and the Church Militant\\" (which does not yet appear to be available through Amazon) would be a far superior recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctrinal Fear Mongering","review":"I read a few chapters of this book years ago. I thought it was going to be a fascinating read, but essentially what the stories recount is people who become possessed because they did not accept strict Catholic teachings - this includes a priest. I realized the author was trying to scare the reader into accepting strict Catholic teaching out of fear that he or she might be possessed if he or she does not. When I say \\"strict Catholic teaching\\" I'm talking about on a very arcane level not basic doctrine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostage To The Devil","review":"Malichi Martin has written a fantastic book. Well researched and extremely interesting. Not a fun book to read because of the subject matter, but very intense and you will have a hard time putting it down. You'll never look at demonic possession or exorcisms the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exorcism is a REAL event.","review":"A well written, well researched explanation of the Catholic rite of exorcism as well as being a compelling story. Martin reviews five recent (70's) exorcisms in the U.S. and explains the different degrees of possession. I found myself developing a certain empathy for the possessed and praying for the exorcism to be successful.The book is a compelling read and will capture your attention from the opening pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is Charlie Chan's Secret?","review":"This film starts out with that familiar 30s mystery sounding music. Then we immediately cut into a diving scene where they used underwater type music. Here Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) is on a boat searching for the missing body of Allen Colby. Allen is the long missing heir to the family fortune and was on his way back to clean it when he met with an accident. Or was it an accident?Even though the Ouija board said that Allen was dead, we make one last attempt to contact him through a séance. Will Allen show? If so can he point out his killer?Only Charlie Chan with his unique perspective can make heads or tails of what the secret is all about. Even Charlie has to learn throughout the movie and we learn with him.This is one of Warner Oland's best. We get a lesson in radio, and quinine that evidently was used at one time for colds.So let's sit back and enjoy a spooky spirit house, a handful of spooky people, and a shot in the dark.Charlie Chan: Castle in the Desert [VHS]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative pizza, gorgeous presentation, delicious!!","review":"This cookbook has an extensive collection of creative pizzas...all beautifully presented in color photos.

It's fasinating to read about the battle for Berlin from the perspective of a commanding general of the Red Army. It is written by Marshal Vasili Chuikov. One of the armies surrounding Berlin was under his command. He was also the commander of the Soviet forces that defended Stalingrad & broke the back of the Nazi armies in Russia. I was impressed by his candor in this book. Usually we hear of how Great Stalin was. Not here. There are quite a few maps in the book that show the progression of the battles. I especially enjoyed reading into the attitudes & status of the Soviet armies swarming all over Germany from the East. Very fasinating book. I am now looking for another book he wrote about the battle for Stalingrad. Have not found it yet.

They said if you modify them, they are useable. To modify, First, from the bottom side of the feeder lid, re-drill each port hole outward at a 45 degree angle. Next, cut or grind the nipple from the underside. If you don't have a grinder, simply used a razor blade to cut down through the nipple at a 45 degree angle.

This theme is tried and true but I thought the reason wasn't strong enough for Megan to stay. But the most unbelievable character to me is the eight-year old girl. She doesn't sound like her age, no matter how precocious she might be. Even gifted children don't have that cadence in their speech. She sounds too much like a adult, especially when she was throwing around legal terms. Another thing I found hard to believe is that Megan didn't find out that Jake did not steal the horses.

It isn't as sturdy as the freestanding bags at my gym, however. If I did all my working out at home, I would probably wear it out pretty quickly. There is adequate padding and the padded punching area is adjustable and tall. At the gym, two people can work at a single bag at once but that isn't possible on this bag since the padded area is pretty narrow. You can fill the base with water or sand and we decided on sand which works well.

Both are well recorded, extremely well performed and dauntingly (and I do mean dauntingly) slow, especially to those used to listening to the tempos set by the likes of Otto Max and J.E. Gardiner. However, where Klemperer beautifully sustains the intensity of the performance and keeps an iron grip on the piece's architecture, Somary very quickly looses his way. Very little drama is generated, despite the best efforts of the soloists, and overall the performance meanders along. The result is, unfortunately, a rather dull and uninvolving Passion. If period performance is not your cup of tea, your best bet is either Klemperer's Passion or Ritcher's first (1950s) version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Grant \\"Count on me\\"","review":"Julie Grant is an amazing singer, and this CD proves it.

However, in my view, he depicts an inaccurate portrait, using anecdotes purporting to reveal something of the true behavior and spirit of GIs. His caricatures include facts interwoven with factoids, falsefacts, and fiction -- enabling only those with relevant experience to discern what is what. In my view, the book is not representative. It appears to be an unfortunate product of the imagination of one who apparently does not understand the Soldiers he depicts; neither their actions nor their motivations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read.

While Tim O'Brien is a very gifted writer, I feel the attention paid to this work, especially in the many school systems, is tremendously overblown. The book does not really teach anything about a real war experience to the younger generation, nor to anyone who hasn't experienced battlefield conditions.War novels with some basis in fact are very appropriate, but those with totally fictitious events don't meet my expectations. Every book about war need not be filled with battle documentation, but the tales told here are in my words \\"a bit off the wall.\\"Dave Simmons - Author\\"Our Turn to Serve - An Army Veteran's Memoir of the Vietnam War\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The human side of war","review":"'The Things They Carried' is the 2007 selection for the Eden Prairie Reads initiative. I was a little hesitant at first, unsure of how well I'd enjoy a collection of Vietnam War stories. The book is less about gunfire and battles won or lost, and more of a peek inside the head of the men involved - doubt, terror, obsession, camaraderie, death, survival instinct, the psychological turmoil of going home, and ultimately, for some, closure.Although considered a work of fiction, one gets the feeling that all of the stories have some basis in reality. In fact, several times the author refers to himself as being present in the stories. As a reader, I felt some frustrating in not being able to determine what was true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Read","review":"I absolutely enjoyed reading every page of this book.

Most of these stories are related to friends ofO'Brien and his platoon he was in, and some other stories contain romance and drama.

It's actually a collection of loosely connected essays, and the revelation that the author makes at the culminating chapter is very intriguing. This book could very well be the first of a new literary genre. Tim O'Brien's is a very provocative raconteur and tell his stories with so much passion and elegance. I highly recommend this book to anyone.

The students always love it! It is like war poetry. O'Brien challenges the way that we think about truth and stories. My students (especially the boys) always love it! I, personally, dislike the reader on this audio version. He gives voices to characters that changes the way that (I believe) O'Brien meant for them to come off. I told my students this before we started the novel this last year, but they all seemed to like the reader. Maybe my perception of the characters are too static!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"Everyone should read The Things They Carried. Young and old alike. Peaceniks, warriors, and taxpayers. One man's story with universal appeal. He let's you see what you cannot on the news. How did I get here and now what?

I understand that this book involves flashbacks, but it had no organization to it and made it very hard to read and understand. Also, it doesn't carry a common theme and had no hint of author's purpose, so therefore in my opinion The Things They Carry was a waste of time and a huge disappointment. I don't understand how someone could sit down and write such a vulgar novel with no meaning behind it. Plus, it wasn;t for entertainment or informational value what so ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Things They Carried Review","review":"This is a book I would recommend to all my friends.

You will not find butterflies and flowers along the shores of the overflowing Song Tra Bong. You will find an overwhelming stench of excrement and deep, sucking mud that pulls a soldier to his death.There is not much delight to be found in the pages of Tim O'Brien's \\"work of fiction\\" based on the Vietnam War, but there is much insight to be gained. He eschews pure chronological narrative in favor of short blasts of horrifying and mesmerizing prose.Many wounds. Much death. The callous veneer a soldier in combat surrounded by senseless killing must adopt. A dead body is to be marveled at, used as a prop, ignored, gathered up, joked about, kicked, revered.There is no single way a soldier will react to his fate -- the fate that put him in harm's way, to kill or be killed. There is no collective conscious. And that concept is captured brilliantly. War is hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but erratic at times...","review":"Tim O'Brien is a masterful purveyor of mystery; his words mingle together forming something which is not the sum of its parts but rather a tasty new concoction. His use of repetition and blurring of fact and fiction draws the discerning reader in and leaves him/her wanting more. \\"On the Rainy River\\" is quite simply a beautiful story and should be a prerequisite for all high school english courses. The writing, however, is not as tight as one could hope for; it loops about in strange ways and occasionally undermines the purpose which the author was striving to convey. Altogether, it's a commendable piece of work and well worth reading by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful read!","review":"Tim gives an excellant portrayal of PTSD in action.

As a reader, I felt enlightened about life, death, war, memory and humanity. I was reminded of the extreme power of literature and reading. This is one of the best war novels I've ever read. The writing is both poignant and heavy at times and the result is a dizzying and powerful glimpse of the Vietnam war. My uncle was killed in this conflict and this novel made me understand his experience even more. I thank Tim O'Brien for telling his story because my family has not opened up much about the subject. In this way, Mr. O'Brien allows us to know more about the war when many veterans and their families choose not to discuss it.

Still, sometimes the fiction just didn't work for me; most notably, when one of the soldier's girlfriends came and turned from cheerleader type to bush-soldier extraordinarie. I understand the methaphor/aim of this, but it seemed over the top. For a pitch-perfect wonderful, fact/memoir of Vietnam, I think IN PHAROH'S ARMY is a masterpiece.

Usually if i did not like a book it wouldn't make any feelings at all, yet when i got mad it made me think why. I realized i was mad because the story was so well written.

It is bad fiction. Transparent in its true goal of discrediting the Vietnam Veterns who served honorably and selflessly in the Vietnam War, this book obviously is only yet another attempt to attack the sons and daughters in our military. The author calls himself a liberal near the middle of the book. I already knew that. Anyone who was ever in the military can immediately see how the 'stories' he makes up could not happen in the United States Army. I was in Vietnam for 18 months, in the Infantry. The activities portrayed in this book only happened in liberals' imaginations. To allow readers to assume these are 'biographies' or 'reports' or 'memories', rather than pure fiction is dishonest, and probably the only way to actually induce anyone to buy this political rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"the things they carried","review":"To be honest i didnt like this book very much .It was hard to hold my attention.The book had no real plot it just kinda wandered around from different stories of the things that were goin on by the first person narator tim o brien.there was one story that just told of numerous things that were in his back pack.There were stories where he lost several loved ones.Overall this was just a storie of a man in the viet nam war and many things that he did and happened to him .the book was very inconsistent ,and in that aspect i give this book a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book!!!","review":"I found the first few chapters explaining the details about the war and the soliders were the only interesting chapters.

You never know what is true in this book and what isn't! He will also dwell on one ocurrence forever and repeat the same information over and over!

The narrative is gripping. O'Brien allows us to see vividly through several soldier's eyes, experiencing a wide range of emotions in the process. The book teaches, has brilliant plot twists (it is fiction), reminds us how beautiful it is to live in the moment, and if nothing else, it makes the reader supremely grateful not to be in Viet Nam.It is a book I will read again (and maybe again afterwards)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things","review":"This is an amazing book, finished it in two days.

I found myself skipping through entire paragraphs because I had read them before in previous stories, and I was irritated by the constant, exhuasted refrain, \\"I'm forty-three years old, and a writer now...\\"O'Brien is very clear on the point that, with a true war story, morality and truth are not necessary. I appreciate this, and I give him credit for the fact that his book echoes his own definition of the Vietnam War itself - vague, ambivalent, undefined, and without clarity or consistency. This, I feel he does fairly effectively, but for the fact that he repeatedly reminds the reader that that is his purpose. However, the inconsistency of the book, and the seemingly haphazard arrangement of the stories, made it difficult to follow at times, and overall it felt very sloppily written and constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"'The Things They Carried' is a very captivating book.

The narrator is a combat vet, of the Vietnam War. The novel includes scenes from before, during, and after the Vietnam War. The entire life of the book covers a thirty year period of O'Briens life and the life of his fellow army buddies.Since it was a war story it had to have some disturbing, violent and graphic scene. But it also had some happy, sad and heart warming scenes in it as well. The character names were Leiutenant Cross, who was very guilty for all the men he had killed and the men he let down by letting them get killed.

Also I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a better understanding as to what a soldier goes through during and after the war.By the conclusion of this book, I'm convinced that you will have a better respect for the soldiers at war in Iraq.

All these characters seemed to get a long for the most part sure there were always some mishaps and yelling. this story is very symbolic and does go into detail about things but its pretty boring after awhile. I could almost guess on everything that Tim touched on because it was very predictable, it got old. There were also good moments in the book though. I love all the action scenes where there is war going on.

If you liked the movie \\"Platoon\\" you will enjoy this book because it contains the same powerful war scenes and mental images that the movie does. Once you start reading it will be hard for you to put this book down. The book allows you to get into the minds of the soldiers and it gives you the feeling of what it's like to be there and what war is like. Fiction or reality, it doesn't matter, as you read you will understand more about what the Vietnam war was all about and what the young U.S. soldiers went through. \\"The Things They Carried\\" will move you and force you to have a greater respect for our Vietnam Vets. This war is a big part of our countries history and \\"The Things They Carried\\" by Tim O'Brien is a tribute to all the brave men who lost their lives over seas.

This time around, Viet Nam was only the stage where fears, insecurities, angst, dreams, relationships and regrets familiar to everyone were played out.

This story is not for the casual reader. Serious stuff goes down in the story, and some of the story made me very uncomfortable as it should have.

Still, the book is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book","review":"This book is a war fiction book, the story was told in a first person perspective, and most of stories in this book are short collections of different missions and stories. Tim O'Brien a combat veteran of Vietnam war, the way he told the stories made me felt like i was there, i could see the horrific scene of firefights, it made me felt bad for the soldiers that was there. some soldiers doesn't even know why they were there, and i could feel what emotional stress they were going through in the hot and humid jungles. I recomemd this book to any one who loves history because you could really learn whats going on during that war, what's like to be a soldier during that time period. i had to read this book for English class, and im glad i did because, it changed my view on the Vietnam war.SOLID BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book about War for People that Hate War Books","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It was assigned for one of my college courses, and I dreaded reading it. I have never liked war books or war movies. I was taken by suprise when I could not put the book down. It goes into the very heart of the characters- it is very raw, deep, and thought-provoking. It is written in a very post-modern way--- so it reads different than most novels.

And thank you for your service to our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't Put it Down","review":"If you like emotional war novels this is a great pick. I read this book twice and I have to say it was wonderful. Great imagery and sentiment. O'Brien really pulls you into the scenes and makes you feel what he felt. I have to say also that most of his wording and \\"sense making\\" is very down to earth and easy to understand... kinda how most of us would make sense or feel about certain things."},{"rating":"1","title":"My thoughts on \\"The Things They Carried\\"","review":"After reading the book \\"The Things They Carried\\" I wasn't at all impressed or entertained by it. I say that because it wasn't something I was interested in. The book was about the Vietnam War and the facts about it. It talked very vivid about the scene and setting of the war. It had some what of too much detail to the story. Well not to many people survived the war, and if they did when ever they got home they usually committed suicide because they kept having flash backs of what they experienced. One soilder named Kiawo died in the war after getting stuck and drowning in a puddle of mud! During the war the soldiers were allowed to carried a variety of things. For example, they carried pictures, guns, locks of hair, fingers, bibles, and letters. In conclusion, I don't recommend this book to anyone, unless you are really intrested in war books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The things the carried","review":"I thought that the book The things they carred was worth 2 stars because it was written well, and got the point across that I believe the author intended. I didn't however enjoy the topic of the book. Since there was not always something that would make you want to keep reading the book, the book would become boring. I didn't enjoy reading the bad things that happened in the war. I do know it is important though to know what has gone on in our history, and they author informed me of that. I believe even though the book was based on a war story, it would have been a lot easier to follow if they did not have so many main characters. I like it when I can read a book and get attached to the characters so that I want to know what happens to them. This book did not allow you to get attached to all of the characters since there was so many. I did though get to know a few characters and when I read about their stories, the book became interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Things They Carried Summary","review":"In this story, Tom O' Brien describes the things the men carried with them when they went off to war in Vietnam. Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, carried love letters from his crush, Martha. He was in love with her but Martha didnt feel the same way for him. A machine gunner, Henry Dobbins, carries his girlfreinds pantyhose around his neck. Ted Lavendar carries marijuana and tranquilizers to calm himself when needed. Later He got shot and died and while they were waiting for the helicopter to arrive to take his body away, the other soldiers smoked his marijuana and made jokes about how he was probably numb when he got shot form all the tranquilizers. Not only are the men carring physical things, but also their emotional burdens. Most men were in their late teens and early tewnties. and had never been taught any kind of training, so at the end they were relieved to still be alive. The men in the story learn that it is better to be loved, than to lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Things They Carried","review":"The book I read was called The Things They Carried. The book had very detailed description on the Vietnam War. It told of the weapons the soilders carried. Some of the weapons they carried were malaria tablets,mine detectors,and dope that was for them to smoke. They also carried lice and ringworm and many other diseases. It also told how two soilders were killed one's name was Ted Lavendar and it also tells how there lietenant Jimmy Cross continues to blame himself to this day for his death. The story also tells that the soilders carried sentimental objects such as panty hose,pictures and letters. One major conflict in the story is when the soilders get stuck in a small town and there lives are in great danger. When they finally get out of the towm one soilder is dead and a couple other a wounded. In my opinion this book was not very interesting. And it was a waste of time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found the book \\"contrived\\" and possessed of a whiny charac","review":"Does anyone ever write negative reviews. As a veteran of almost four years in Viet-Nam, I was very disappointed by the book in its attempts to say, in effect, \\"Look how sensitive I am; Oh, I am such a sensitive caring person.\\" I found the fictional adventures totally without merit and I am glad I didn't pay any money for this book. If you want to read a fictional book about real, adult meaningful \\"truths\\" concerning Viet-Nam, then read Nicholas Proffitt's \\"Gardens of Stone\\". If you want fiction, at least he delivers the real thing instead of some vapid, made up mish-mash like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SuMmEr ReAdInG","review":"This book was very interesting as well as very confusing. The book consisted of many war, death, and love stories. Although the book jumps from one story to the other. It's not really a regular novel with a rising action, climax, and resolution. The book doesn't carry a common theme throughout the book. This in turn makes it very hard to understand and follow. I would have to give this book at most two stars because it gave a vivid picture of what O'Brien thought the soldiers were or should be doing in times of war. But also at times I thought it was a little too graphic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good vietnam read","review":"This was assigned by my school for summer reading, and it is quite a story; OK, a series of short stories. Tim O'Brien gives the expression of a war where what you think is not what happened. For example, in \\"The Man I Killed\\", O'Brien describes a corpse and the life of the man it used to be. \\"Ambush\\" describes O'Brien killing the man, and the remorse he felt. Then, in \\"Good Form\\", we learn that O'Brien did not truly kill the man; infact, the man did not exist. O'Brien explains that \\"Story Truth\\" and \\"Real Truth\\" are different things. The story isn't technically true, but it is more true then some real stories.Woah."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but not for me","review":"This is pretty much the kind of book that I don't like. That is a politically focussed story with an axe to grind. It wears its heart on its sleave. The text is provoking and tight, gritty and sincere. For me, its lacking in subtlety and perspective. Yes it tells the story of the soldiers like it was, but its too intense and too obvious. The in your face style of writing is painful at times. I think the reviews written here about this book are excellent, and I can see this book has made a big impact on people around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The Things They Carried is an excellent story about the Vietnam War and the hardships experienced by the soldiers that fought in it.

Afterwards, he started writing books about his experience. One of these books is a work of fiction called The Things They Carried. It's about a platoon's journey through the war. The stories in the book are ones that touch the heart, open the eyes, and make you wonder, \\"Are these really fiction?\\" The definition of fiction is something inveted by the imagination. But how could O'Brien imagine something so vivdly, so realistic, without it having no truth to it? These stories are what I call diet fiction. It is a true story with a twist of fiction. They are things even people like me who haven't fought in the war could relate to, and I loved them. I give a big high five to Tim O'Brien for his book, The Things They Carried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysteriously Intruiged","review":"Mysterious! I don't know much about the Vietnam War, but this book gave a clearer sense of what happened, and what it felt like to be in the war. I liked this book because I could never tell if he was telling the truth. It seemed like fiction and then again like non-fiction. I've never read a book like this before. The fact that he used the numbers and made everything seems so real was engaging. It forms an image in your mind and it stays put. The ways the characters are portrayed are a very weighty part to this story. He gives a clear sense of what kind of people they are and most importantly it sets a plot for the story. Not just a boring here's what happened in the war, a real one with real people in it that make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter the minds of men","review":"Mr. O'Brien's work was an eye-opener for me. I'm not a guy, and certainly not a soldier. I've never been to Viet Nam. Yet, I enjoyed reading this book on so many levels, not because I liked the subject matter--in places it was beyond gross-- but because it gave me such an insight into the minds of men. This is hopefully the closest I will get to experiencing a war, and I'm grateful to Mr. O'Brien for taking me into it as closely as he did. I will never look at soldiers--or average guys, for that matter--the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carry it with you","review":"This is the story of what makes up men at war--their heart and soul as well as body parts and bullet holes. Recommended by professor Lary Bloom, NY Times columnist and Vietnam veteran, my expectations were set very high and Tim O'Brian delivered. Having missed the Vietnam War by half a generation while it raged on during my childhood, this is the story that gave me the feel of what was really happening while I was trying to grow up. Even if you're not looking for a war book, you're looking for a great book, pick this one up and carry it with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Account of the Men Who Fought In Vietnam","review":"If at all interested in the Vietnam war or the lives of the men who fought in the war, I strongly recommend that you read this book. The book moves along quickly and O'Brien's unique talent keeps you on the edge of your seat - with tissues. This is an amazing book that brings you into the lives of a platoon in Vietnam, an experience that is hard to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of language --a dream, a nightmare, a reality","review":"I picked up this novel on a whim because the title caught my eye-- I never knew I would pick up a masterpiece of the English language. Once I started reading, I was mesmerized by O'Brien's unbelievable skill and language. The stories all possess a dreamy quality that blends the truth and fiction--ambiguity. His imagery is unsurpassed, I haven't read any other authors that reflect his same writing style..revolutionary. Each story is a nightmarish gem, this book evoked every possible emotion from me while I read. O'Brien makes Vietnam's madness and confusion come alive. Sometimes I felt as if O'Brien was actually talking to me, over coffee or something. Each story is etched so clearly in my mind. I know that everytime I reread this novel, the Alpha Company will become more than fictional charactars...but anecdotes of every kind of person in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"i didnt understand the book","review":"I give The Things They Carried one star. Because I didnt understand the book. The book jumped from theme to theme and made it diffcult for a high school level student to understand.

After about 30 pages I had to Force myself to continue just to get through it.

Ron Kovic wrote a better book, Born on the Fourth of July."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Falsehoods/Myths","review":"This book is fiction, yet I see comments from readers stating that the book helped them understand the war. You cannot read this book and believe that you have a better understanding of the war and the soldiers that fought there. This fiction adds to the falsehoods/myths already written about the war, and unfortunately, some people believe it as fact. I read about 100 pages and toss it in the trash. It's disgusting that some continue to spread falsehoods about the Vietnam War.If you must read it, enjoy the FICTION, but never take what you read in this book as FACT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My thoughts and feelings of The Things They Carried","review":"Elaine AudainI thought that the book was not good it should have not been published. I say this because the book didn't have a good introduction, it started off about one of the soldiers and his problem. Like when he recieved letters from a Lady named Martha and he blamed hisself every time one of his men died. He felt that he was giving MArtha to much attention and he didn't even know whether she loved him or not. I felt that it should have started off about the whole group then went into individualality. The book was a little inappropiate and left out a little bit of details. I think that the book had a lot of ptofanity. That's basically it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Absolute worst thing I've ever read. Poor writing, cheese-y, inaccurate...from a self-absorbed author.

Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"They carried much more than their weapons","review":"This little known author is a fine story teller. The story moves smoothly nad pruposefully never loosing track of his intended topic: namely, his time in Viet Nam. It is a clear, down to earth tale of serious, dangerous and humorous experiencees he and hs comrades lived and died.A very good read. Enlightening even this many years after Viet Nam, but worthy of relating in some ways to the experiences our current service men must be having in Aphganistan and Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prose or Poetry","review":"When I read 'The Things They Carried', it seemed almost like reading a poem like 'Paradise Lost'.

I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the things they carried, and maybe didnt carry","review":"This book was written by Tim O'brien about the Vietnam war. This books talks of the physical and mental hardships that the soldires were forced to carry. The writer, by telling of the hardships, connects the life of the soldier to the life of the reader. Many say that this book is a \\"good book\\" or \\"excently written\\", i say that it is a damn good book and very well written. This book deserves a award for the use of emotional conections with grotesque realities. The big catching point in this book is knowing that the author is speaking from personal expierence. Overall this book is excellent and everyone and their mother should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the best to rate this but...","review":"I haven't read the book yet but the people I know who have read it say it's really good. I take a personal interest in the military genre so I'm pretty sure that when I do read the book I'm going to really like it. In a review my class and I did it was like getting to see the other side of the Vietnam war; the \\"aftermath\\". A lot of people think the war is over when you come back home but in this book it proves that there is even more emotional baggage to carry after something so traumatizing like war. I remember hearing something like one of the characters in the book shot himself in the foot so he could be on leave. That's like a conflict and resolution in itself; the guy really wants to get out and he shoots himself so he's taken out. I just hope that when I read the book it's everything good I'm expecting and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Stories Can Save Us\\"","review":"\\"But this too is true; stories can save us.\\" And that's exactly what Tim O'Brien's words do--they work to save us. If ever an author reached out to its reader and took hold of him/her by the very gut, slowly, painfully, wonderfully dragging it up and out into the air for a good fresh breath, Tim O'Brien does just that. This is more than a collection of war stories--this is a collection of human stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guy needs a LOT of therapy!","review":"I've read plenty of Vietnam books, but this one is beyond description.

They where at war with the vietnamese. The book is very descriptive when it comes to the death of people and how the were killed in the war. The soldiers carryed lots of Physical objects, which include pitures of family, letters and special items they also carryed matches, morphine for medical reason, m-16 for protection, M&Ms for there sweet tooth. They really dont carry most of that stuff out to the battled field. The setting is Vietnam in the jungle"},{"rating":"1","title":"They carried Boring Stories?","review":"They're just not compelling. O'Brien is not a great writer at all. He repeats lines over and over, gives us the punch line and then repeats it at the end of a story, then next story repeats a line because he must think the solid repetition moves us to deeper emotion. His pro-war stance, the idea that war makes men is severely outdated. Vietnam may be his obsession but the goal of literature is not to write for therapy but to write for clarity and experience. He is unable to all of these. It comes off like the party bore who won't stop talking about a single subject, crying to make sure you feel the emotion along the way. Many better books on Vietnam exist out there. That this was a Pulitzer finalist is a true insult to many better writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST EVER","review":"I was there.

Having a best friend and watchin them die the next day. He explain the evil of war but also the good of war. His stories never made just one exact point but many points. He showed the reader many views of other people in the war. Some people would tell how they felt in the war. The aurthor just told the truth but not the whole truth. You can't tell a good story with out fixing the story up. These stories were like a truth for us all. How a real human being is and feels. It brings back to the old days when life was more innocent. This was a truely sad but nice book. Some of the stories had a unique message of its own.

I don't have to know exactly which way is up, or whether something is exactly black, but I do want to know what \\"did\\" happen or what \\"coulda\\" happened. When \\"unreality\\" is sometimes more \\"real\\" than \\"reality\\", I know I am in the realm of the writer, a fiction writer, a realm in which I am not altogether comfortable.

There are serval characters in this book, which makes it interesting. The book explains to the reader what are carrying and how much each item is. Well one of the things in this book is that it is a bunch of stort stories in one. For example Jimmy Cross who is the lieutneant is in love with a girl named Martha. They would write letters back and forth while he was gone and everytime she would end her letters they would always say with love. Jimmy knew that she didn't love him but he really want her to. Martha didn't want Jimmy in the war so in all the letters she wrote she said nothing about it. She hate it. I never really cared for war books, but Im happy that I had the chance to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"If you think this is one of those boring war books you've probably read (or tried reading) before, you're wrong. This one captures your attention from the very first chapter and won't let go until you finished the whole book.

The unromanticized approached to war, yet the humanity in all the death, proves to be a viewpoint that many authors strive for, but very few are successful in obtaining. I have found the book to look at all areas of pshychological and exestential developments astutely and keenly. O'brien's ability to phrase a situation, pinpoint one episode within that event, and examine smaller elements within that event to be his best talent. War is not glamourized, nor is it idolized. It is examined as the catalyst of man's never ending thought process regarding a major part of his life. He doesn't preach, nor does he tell. The narrator's psyche becomes our guide, and we're left hoping that he will survive despite his thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great litte peace!","review":"This book is a very good portrayal of the Nam war. At times many events might not seem factual but supposedly they are. The book also relates to how to write a good book. By doing so, Timmy lets all types of people relate to the characters in the novel. You don't have to like war book to enjoy reading it.Above all, he touches your senses. The readers transitions through many emotions such as humor, guilt, fear, and seclusion. The part were the soldiers blew up the puppy was especially funny. I know that it may sound horrible, but Timmy wrote it in such a way to make it very humorous. Timmy's recollection of his dead 9 year old girlfriend brings out emotion. You can't be human if you can't relate to his feelings toward his first love. In all, Timmy wrote an excellent novel but not a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy shipping.","review":"Very good war stories.

Not only was it a war story (war stories do not hold my interest) but it was a poorly organized war story. The short story format with O'Briens interruptions about the falsness of the stories led to a broken train of thought. I understood the themes he was trying to get across but I was dissapointed with the way he choose to accomplish it. He dramatized war to the point where all I could think about was the fighting and not the character development. I did however appreciate his efforts to bring the feelings of war closer to us. The deaths of Linda and the water buffalo definately served their purpose in bringing O'Brien's feelings on the war to a level I could understand. If this book would have had a setting other than the Vietnam war then I would have apprecited it much more. I'm just tired of bieng in school and always being told to read war stories, both fact and fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent and graphic","review":"Superbly written, raw and disgustingly graphic.

Tim O' Brien writes about his continuous loss of friends throughout his entire life. The novel takes a different view of war then I was used to, because it tells the details about the soldiers. The soldiers carried many other things than just equipment, they carried guilt, their reputations, and the desire to be at home. Finally, I beleive the book is worth reading if you are interested in the being the scenes of war. The novel depicts war and parallels this with real life. Tim O' Brien relates war to real life which allows the reader to identify with the situations the characters are in. The novel causes the reader to look at death and the effects death has on a person. The reader realizes the loss of a soldier also means the loss of a family member or a friend for someone else. In the end the characters realize, \\"Death Sucks.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"The Thing they Carried is a great summer reading book for the high school level. What i liked the most about this book was all of the various emotions that took place, at one time the soldiers may be having fun other times there would be grief. This really brought out how war is really like. This helps because some people do not know what war can really be like because most will not be in a war so i think it is good that others know what our soldiers go through during a war.

They seemed to carry things to the battlefield, but when they came back from the battlefield, I believe they left many things behind, including the lives of the soldiers that fought the Vietnam War, and for the people that weren't slaughtered, their sanityThe book teaches me a lesson, war is a spiral of death. Many people on both sides lose their lives. Hearing of your family member's death over a country that wishes to change the lifestyle of their land is really not worth fighting for as this book presents.Hopefully after \\"The Things They Carried\\", your soul will be relieved of much anger and tenseness of today's current wars.

The author really is \\" write on\\" in his description of the soldiers and what their job and conditions were. Much of this detail has never been shared with the American public as the soldiers could not express their feelings when they returned to the US.

First, there are no page numbers on my Kindle version, which makes it hard to tell students what page to turn to. Second, my Kindle version of The Things appears to be slightly different than the version in the paperbooks my students bought through the college bookstore. Sometimes it's a word or two, and sometimes, alarmingly, it's a whole passage that's either worded differently, or missing, or added. What gives?

This CD, which runs less than 35 minutes, features O'Connell in three separate outings, 1953, 1961 and 1963. The best tracks are from her more recent recordings, where her unique vocal stylings shine. Her phrasing is sublime in Taking a Chance on Love and The Sweetest Sounds. But frustrating enough is that 7 of the 16 tracks clock in at less than 2 minutes as these recordings are taken of her radio performances. The sound quality is not first-rate either. The longest selection at 3:09 is O'Connell's hit, When The Sun Comes Out.

The value for money is horrible, the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- Alfred Hitchcock would not be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"How bad can it get--ask the folks who put this magazine out every month and charge gullible subscribers $39.95 to read this stuff.It seems they are relying on their old reputation to try to sell subscriptions--but this magazine is a pale shadow of its old self. Today AH Magazine, has the same old mystery stories in each issue with tired out old plots. I will definitely to try to cancel my subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame.","review":"Not worth the time or money at all. The plot is very pointless with nothing interesting or exciting. The story is about a spoiled brat who gets everything from her absentee dad and dating-holic mother. She is the type of girl who doesn't believe in long term relationships and likes older \\"men\\". Until, of course, she meets Tad and falls in love with him.Terrible! don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was horrible","review":"I guess it's ok since the book at least has a story but omg, it was SOOOO bland. it's like drinking soup but realizing it's just a bowl of plain water with maybe a tad of salt. i didn't finish the book because i was bored out of my mind. i tried SO hard to stay awake and focus on this horrible book, but it didn't last... omg... it's just so horrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last on Tongue","review":"Bought this on the rcommendation of a pharmacist for a sore on my tongue. It does numb the spot, but doesn't last anywhere near what other reviewers are claiming. I get about 10-15 minutes of relief at most, then it just disolves away. Maybe works better on a canker sore, but not on a tongue sore. I guess if you could completely avoid touching your tongue against anything inside your mouth it might last longer, but that;s pretty much impossible, so I can't recommend it at all for this use."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb tempi","review":"To my opinion, the key to the ultimate listening experience is the right tempi. Bach should dance, but not in St Matthews Passion. How on earth can you dance at \\"Kommt, ihr Toechter helf mir klagen\\" (opening choir) or \\" Wir setzen uns mit Traenen nieder\\" (closing choir). In most modern performances you hear Bach at Ferrari like tempi, to make it dance. Performances of 40 years ago are really the opposite: they are so slow that you only hear tears but no Bach.Bach Metthews should relate to a gentle walk. You should feel the movements but it should be calm.I live in The Netherlands, the country where the St Matthews Passion is very much part of the national musical culture (most of us listen to St Matthews every year at the Sunday or the Friday before Eastern). I really hope that next year the tempi will be back where they should be: at the tempi of this Vanguard Classic Recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable and cheaply built","review":"For all the praise given by other reviewers, I would expect an excellent product overall. However I find that my pair of SR225 headphones squish my ears against the hard speaker grill. The pads are not deep enough. In addition to that the wires on the headphones came torn up out of the box. That's not what I expect when paying $200 for headphones.The headphones sound OK, but since they hurt when I put them on my ears I don't use them as much as I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Really good sound, different than any others I've tried, you'll be adjusting your gear, careful of the long cord - tripping hazard you know"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grados!","review":"Great grados.

GREAT!When you first get it it will be uncomfortable, but then once you break it in it's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound. Terribly uncomfortable!!!","review":"I found the Grado SR 225i's far too uncomfortable to wear. I'm sure for normal ears they feel ok, but one of my ears was burned badly and the sratchy interior of the Grado ear cup rubs against the deformed cartiledge. If only the foam part covered the entire interior and not just the circumference. The sound however was top notch! I just wish I could enjoy the quality for any amount of time.I returned them and got the Sennheiser HD 25-1's instead. I've tried those before and they felt nice on my ears.Also, for such expensive headphones, you'd think they'd take more care and finesse with the packaging. It was exceptionally flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound but...","review":"I really enjoyed these, though I can't seem to adapt well to supra-aural phones - I guess I like the perception of isolation that you get with circumaural.These compared very favorably to the pair of Senn HD650s I was also trying out. I particularly liked the bass, which was very present but not overly punchy (I am not a basehead). The sound is overall pretty dry, but very detailed.In the end, I returned them due to the feeling of sandpaper foam on my ears. I don't understand why Grado keeps the same abrasive foam pads given the amount of criticism they get. Is it tradition to dermabrade your pinnae?Am happy with the Senns - I couldn't go beyond an hour of listening on the Grados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing but not very comfortable","review":"It deserves to be the sweetest spot in grados line.

I only buy over the ear models and listen primarily to rock and podcasts. I love these headphones, they sound awesome.These are my first Grado's and I would not hesitate to buy another pair, whether they cost more or less. (I assume from reading Grado's reviews that all of their models are excellent). These headphones could be more comfortable but I can't complain too much. I wear glasses and after extended use they can feel just a bit tight. Also the foam pads Grado uses are durable but not exactly luxurious but you get used to them.I give them 5 stars for their excellent sound and quality build. They are very durable and sturdy.Bravo Grado! I'll enjoy the SR225i's for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound quality but uncomfortable to wear","review":"The sound quality is good and I bought them in a store after trying on several different brands. They sounded the best, but when I got them home and began to use them at 1-2 hour sittings I realized how the ear cans felt uncomfortable. They are rough and scratchy on the ears - takes a lot of the pleasure out of the listening experience. I'm going to have to get some other brand because I don't enjoy wearing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome...when they work","review":"I really like these headphones....when they function. I bought these to use as monitors at the church. After about a month one side died...then the other about a month after that. I got them repaired under warranty. A couple of months after the warranty was up, one side died again. Now both sides are out a second time and no warranty. For such expensive headphone I expected better quality. Very, very disappointed. I would not purchase from Grado again or point anyone else toward them. Perhaps I just got a bad set, but they've been really bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corroded Grado?!","review":"I received my Grado 225i new last week, bought from Amazon.com.When I look at the holed metal shield (in front of the speaker) through the nylon mesh, there is something like a dead cockroach on it, after examining it carefully, this trace would be a trace of corrosion. I use daylight to look at it more carefully and I see similar - but lighter traces on both sides left and right, they cover around 40% of the metal's surface.I wonder if my sweat would corrode the metal shield just after a few hours of use?! (although this is almost impossible because it's cold now and I'm not a sweaty type!).I call Grado to ask if this is a manufacturing defect. The lady on the phone said that it's normal, Grado is good for sound and does not care about the look !I don't think that a $219 headphone should have this problem and considered \\"normal\\".Grado's owner, examine your can with daylight, at around 45 degree angle to see if yours also has corrosion traces like mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too much hype , cheap looking !!","review":"I bought this product by looking at the amazing review but looks like reviews are written by employees of grado !! Its amazing how minds can be manipulated and here in USA its a big time business.. This product looks so cheap and all of my friends started laughing at me when I say its 200$. This could easily be the cheapest looking headphone with 200 $. Comfort is probably the worst part along with build quality , cheap plastic sucks !! BUt to be fair sound quality is good even though i don't think its something very very special. I bought this from amazon and within 2 days , my left side can falls off. At first I thought its being designed for removable but I didn't see that for my right side ear cup..I thought of returning it but I am in no mood to go through hassles as I am too lazy .. Hopefully I will try to fix it through glue or something but other owners please write proper unbiased reviews and don't mislead prospective buyers like me.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fennel Tea in the Evening","review":"I was watching Doctor Oz's show one afternoon and he recommended drinking fennel tea in the evening as it resets you.

I have been using it for about 3 months now and I believe I have had a 20 to 30 percent increase in nights I didn't toss and turn all night. The tea is very tasty and easy to make.

I feel that the statements this shark makes may be misleading when interacting with this toy [parents, take heed and consider!]: Shark toy claims to \\"make no sound,\\" yet tells me this in an audible voice. Rather misleading. Shark toy also claims that its head shape aids in swimming, hearing and sight but upon throwing into the bathtub, shark toy did not swim, hit the faucet and didn't listen to me when I told it to \\"be careful, you will hit the faucet.\\" Also, toy has some durability issues -- becomes very soggy when wet, may produce mildew.

These scissors would barely cut through thin plastic, and wouldn't even cut thin cardboard. Using regular scissors is much easier. It made me sad, cause I was so excited to get them.

They don't work well at all on the plastic clamshells - the blades are a bit too short so it takes a lot of working from different angles before finding one that lets them grab an edge, and then they just don't have the power to cut through the thicker areas. To add insult to injury, they don't hold a charge for very long and they can't be used at all while charging, so half the time I have to put the item aside and wait for these scissors to charge - or just give up and go get the box cutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I charged the item for 14hrs and it worked, but when I went back to it it would not work and would not charge.

The charge ran down very quickly and now they won't hold a charge at all and are less than a couple months old.

Don't recommend these at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but...","review":"When I first got this, it was great. It would eat through most cardboard, plastic packaging, you name it. Then, and I don't know how it happened, the battery got extremely weak. It barely holds a charge and needs frequent recharging.

We cut several pieces of paper, even opened a plastic package. The scissors cut very well. We recharged the scissors overnight. Again, the scissors would not work. We even tried removing the head (without success), so we decided to again return them. As I was putting them in the box for return, they again worked. There must be an intermittent problem of some sort with these scissors. We did not want to take a chance that they would again fail so we returned them anyway.

When it worked, it worked ok, it cut through most blister packs, which is what I bought it for, however, after owning it about a year, and using it a handful of times, it no longer holds a charge and is now a paperweight.

NO ISSUES what so ever, it cut thru the heavy bands around the packages and all the cardboard boxes I had to dispose of, without a hitch. As previously mentioned I went crazy cutting everything in sight. Even my 4 yr old daughter was cutting stuff up ( with my supervision of course ). As soon as my wife got home, and I ( I mean my daughter ), showed her how to use it, she went to town also. I would recommend this fun and effective tool to anyone old enought to walk.

A pair of old fashion sissors would work too but they are cumberson to cut the vinyl with.I can reach up and cut the outcoming vinyl right off the cutter while it is cutting the next sign. I don't need to stop as I would with a pair if sissors. I have cut thousands of pieces of vinyl with the one pair and have never had to replace the blades or sharpen them. The other set I use to cut heat shrink plastic sheet to wrap the outgoing signs in. The roll of film is hanging from the ceiling over the wrapping table.

Like a professional speed control switch,rather than off / on?They can zip right through a magazine, like 'Time'. Cutting it in half in a second or two.The only real problem I have with the design, which is nice, (maybe mine is flawed), is that the lock button on top,doesn't spring back to locked automatically, leaving the device dangerous if 'little hands' are around.The reason I don't give it 5 stars. Safety is important!Don't leave these near children, or where they can get to them!I can imagine these could cause a nasty cut.EDIT:These were great for a couple months.Now, It may be my fault (as a man, it usually is), but, they're completely dull,and I find my self searching for my manual scissors.I must get new blades, or toss the thing....That's all.P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for everyday things","review":"These scissors are great for everyday use, like cutting paper, card board, packaging, etc. (normal scissor use, it doesn't cut through steel or anything of the sort).

It does a decent job if you're cutting straight and if the plastic isn't thick. However, if you're trying to cut into a tight corner of the package or if there's any \\"meat\\" to the plastic, it just grinds to a halt. I have taken out my Cutco scissors more times that I should have needed since purchasing these.I haven't used it for cardboard, but based on my experience with plastic, I doubt it would do much for corrugated board.

These cut through everything I've tested them on, such as plastic product containers, cardboard, towels, fabric (multi-layers). They take a little getting used to because they are so fast, but they are so much fun to use. The 'buzzing' noise and vibrations weren't bad. They have an on/off switch as well as a trigger for actual cutting. I did notice you need to remember to turn the switch off or they will use up the charge. I use these more for the straight or less intricate cuts. These were a huge hit with a project I'm working on involving 40 yards of material to cut. They were so fast, what would have taken me days to cut was done in just a couple of hours. The spread of the scissors is not very wide, so you need to be realistic in what you are trying to cut through. Great for anyone suffering from arthritis in your hands. Hope this helps with anyone deciding on whether to get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"This is my second set of the B&D cordless power scissors and I absolutely love them! I haven't found anything (not metal of course) that they won't cut with the greatest of ease. I use them mainly for fabrics and they are super quick, easy to handle, and zip around outlines without a problem. I highly recommend them. The ONLY complaint I have is that the battery isn't replaceable. I got a couple of years out of the first pair but when they quit holding a charge I found out I had to buy a new pair rather than a new battery.

I had hoped that it would deal with - - something like \\"the evolutionary value of testosterone which today may be causing serious \\"four-wheel-drive\\" problems and now - in our more peaceful times - must somehow be defused or refocused or something??...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Being an adult","review":"The crux of this piece, as well as that of the frequently[in reviews] mentioned Iron John, reflects the need to pass off what is in reality a personal lack of maturity as a social ill. If people spent as much time reflecting on their own behavior and taking responsibility for their own decisions as they spent reading this book then perhaps some of the true problems facing society could be addressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misandry disguised as intelligence","review":"This book is one long wagging finger at men. Women are these mysterious Goddesses that we must live up to, and men are dumb childish cretins who need to grow up. The book slanders any type of sex that isn't some mystical dreamsoul worship of a women's totality. Our nature to get things done; through reason or violence, is really just the crying of inner little boy wanting his mother. The book represents the sum total of misandry paraded as insightful psychology. Women are enlightened being in touch with the universe and men are mindless dogs who need to be raised up into the all mother. Women being more enlightened is a fallacy kept sacred in this bookMen and women can become greater, but books like this one completely miss the point, merely extend radical feminist talking points.Ironic side note: The Amazon spell checker recognizes the word Misogyny( hate for women) but not the word Misandry( hate for men)- it underlines it as misspelled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gar-bajj","review":"I got this book as a gift from my sister, so I read it out of deference to her. But let me tell you it was a mighty painful process, and not from what you think. It wasn't from the painful realities I was hit with but the blathering, wimpy, self-loathing that guy exudes. When you stop whining and worrying and apologizing and agonizing about women, then you've arrived my son.....no need to waste your money on this book, better to spend it on a John Ford/John Wayne movie.

Only one thing could turn his sun bronzed visage pale and that was a marriage-minded female. Tough Ben was heir to the vast Australian holdings of Penrod station, he had no intention of saddling himself with a wife...until he met his match in the most alluring and contrary creature he'd ever beheld. With hair like moonbeams and eyes like aquamarines, Tia was only as big as a child, yet her lush curves proclaimed her all woman. With manners as dainty as those of any fine lady, she could charm his highborn friends, yet her salty language would make a Cockney blush. And instead of being pursued, Ben found himself being refused by the one woman who had captured his heart for all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in the 3 book series...","review":"This is book # 3 in the 3 book Australian series. Although I wasn't too fond of the other 2 books this book was more to my liking. I liked Ben & Tia & their adventure. Although I liked this book I don't think I'd recommend this series. I've read many Connie Mason books & usually love them all but this series just didn't do it for me. If you've read the other 2 then certainly go ahead & read this book because in my opinion it was the best of them all but still not one I can say that I loved. Find another Connie Mason book & you'll probably be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to get work done, don't pick up this book","review":"After reading this book, I realized this is book 3 in a series regarding the Penrod men and Robin Fletcher. Before reading this one, read the first two, I should have done that. It really doesn't matter I guess but it would have been nice to know about Dare and Robin in their youthful years before getting to know Ben. I thought the women are amazing. Very strong-willed when they are given the chance. Tia especially is a strong and round character who is considerate and thoughtful, whereas Ben is arrogant and takes what he wants. Together it is a clash of wills, with Tia no doubt coming out as the winner. This book was so good. There was Tia's secret that forced me to keep on reading, I took it to work and instead of working just read the whole day. Couldn't put it down. Now I'm reading Bold Land, Bold Love with Dare and Casey;it is equally enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"First prize a copycat!","review":"This is the resulting book of a contest by the National Library of Poetry in 1993.

There is not a lot to look for. That dosen't mean it's bad music though. This groups goal is to make fun garage rock and they do a good job. It's music broken down to the essentials of guitar and drums. The topics range from sex to well, more sex. I like that Margaret Doll Rod sings. I like that we have a female vocalist in this dirty rock and roll band. If you're looking for good Detroit rock, this is a great place to start. Also, I think this is one of their better albums (they have four). Not to mention that Danny Doll Rod used to play guitar for The Gories, so if you're a huge Gories fan, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Shaver For The Price","review":"This must be the ultimate shaver for someone who is looking for something inexpensive and still gets the job done very well.

My beard is very light, so I've always gotten by with low-end electric razors. My previous unit, the Braun 3612, served me for several years, but the shaving foil wore out. Since the Maxisonic was less expensive than a new foil for the Braun, I figured I would give it a shot. It wasn't the best move. The Maxisonic does not shave as close as the Braun, and if you've ever used the 3612, you will know that it is difficult to get a close shave with it. I think the Maxisonic also has a weaker motor.I gave it an extra star for the low cost and the included extra shaving foil. It's also good that the Maxisonic can be used when plugged in. I considered the newest low-end Braun (Series 1), and I rejected it because it doesn't support corded use.

Many of the teddy bear's dream are geared toward traditional male occupations. The book is basically comprised of a few different occupations that the bear would like to have.

The contributions are fun to read if only to compare the opening gamut of a renowned author with their most recent work. Each tale provides an introduction that brings further focus on the writer. The collection is well done with delightful selections from a virtual who's who of the genre, but the quality varies though none are horrible.

Instead, I read about tidbits on William Roemer, the author, and not enough conversation or anecdotes on Accardo to form some sort of image about the man. No wonder Accardo hardly did any jail time--he was a hard man to get a handle on then as now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving law enforcement a black eye","review":"Incredible. Here we have a retired FBI agent writing about a thug who he claims is the best godfather ever. He writes so admiringly about Tony Accardo that I really believe he wanted to give Joe Batters a foot massage, back rub and ticker-tape parade. I had to put the book down before I puked. True, the writer covers a lot of ground in his homage to this killer-thug and parasite, but it's all wasted by his glorification of a criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a new angle Roemer!!!!","review":"How many more books is William Roemer going to pump out and claim each as the most dangerous mobster that he single-handedly battled.

I could forgive his overstating Accardo's importance to Chicago organized crime (Its a well known fact among most real crime historians that Accardo spent most of his time as the Waiters front boss) because all biographers tend to do that. But when he states things like Joe Profaci and Joe Columbo being bosses on the commission and showing up at a 1961 wedding when Columbo was an eventual herir to Profaci's family can't be forgiven. Things like that make you wonder if the author knew anything at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Information is There, I Guess . . .","review":"As a Chicagoland native and budding fan of \\"Outfit\\" stories, I was anxious to learn all I could about \\"Joe Batters\\". This book does deliver information I didn't already have, but don't let the page count fool you. Roemer pads this book with all kinds of extraneous stuff, and wanders in his narrative. He has no idea how to organize information, and this book seems to be no more than a rough draft. Roemer claims to be impartial, but opinion drips from every sentence. He can never let the evidence speak for itself. He always has to comment on it. If you're expecting nothing more than one man's war stories of his time in the FBI, then this book will not disappoint, but this is not the omnibus of Accardo information that I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROEMER HITS A HOME RUN","review":"This has got to be one of the greatest LCN books ever.

Tony Accardo is the most powerful boss ever. Dont listen to the bad reviews. Roemer did a great job researching this one and writting it. Its very well written. The fact is that if Roemer didnt write this book or his others then nobody would know nothing about the Outfit. Buy this book. If you are a true organized crime fan then you will like this book.

I could barely decipher what the Ward Bros. were saying through most of the film. I kept having to rewind and turn the volume up to understand more than half of the dialouge of the entire film. The Ward Bros. were constantly mumbling with a big wad of chew in their mouths. I really should have rented this first, but I bought it for the filmmakers reputations.

It's shaken up my metabolism and I've managed to lose even more weight while doing them, coupled with a healthful diet of course. You will NOT be sorry! Althought 1,2,3,4 requires weights, you can use your own -- you don't have to buy the Walk Away weights. I had some 3 pound dumb bells which I used. Just choose 2 or 3 pound weights. You won't be alternating them, so just choose 2 or 3 pounds -- whatever works for you.Also - these are great tapes if you have knees problems. Even at my young age, I have a trick knee from a previous injury. I would love to do those high intensity FIRM work outs, however, I suspect the stress on my joints would be too much. You don't have to worry about that with any of Leslie's videos. Low impact, high calorie burning!

I ordered Leslies 4 mile video. I think it's great. The miles go by so fast, and you feel great afterwards. Here's a tip: the music on all of the videos isn't that great, and can get annoying after you've watched them 100 times. Put on a great techno, or high beat elecronica c.d., and turn down the volume on you t.v. It makes for a great workout. The 4 mile doesn't use any weights like the others do, but you can add weights to her arm exercises on your own to add a little \\"umph\\" to the workout. For anyone who has asthma (as I do) or has a hard time with arobics, this is a GREAT place to start. It's addictive, and if you can make yourself do it everyday for 2 weeks, it becomes a habit after that. I highly recommend these videos.

It IS an intense workout, about 59 minutes, and is much faster paced than her previous workouts. But, as one reviewer said, you'll never have to count calories again! I HIGHLY recommend this video!

I always wear a heart-rate monitor during my workouts and, when I used this video, I was always way below my aerobic zone, even when I used weights and did exaggerated movements.

This one doesn't have that, but it's still a very good workout. Besides, nothing stops you from using your handweights anyway if you want to.

Like a lot of people, I tolerate it and force myself to do it. Leslie's three and four mile as well as Slim in 6 are the only exercise tapes that I have been able to do and see/feel results. They are the only exercise programs that I have found helpful and I have tried many, many different programs. I enthusiastically recommend this to anyone who wants to get fit. The mile timer at the bottom of the screen helps you when you feel like you are going to keel over. You feel a good sore and a great sense of accomplishment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistent as always","review":"This workout pushes it up a notch from the shorter workouts, but is basically the same moves. I always enjoy her DVDs, and this one is no exception. It is 60 solid minutes of cardio."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY THIS!!!","review":"I now have 11 of Leslie Sansone's videos and I love every one of them. She often states that her workouts are not for sissies and that is very true but REALLY anyone can do them. You just set your own pace.I started working out with Leslie's videos on April 1st, 2008. I weighed 240 lbs. It is now February 24th, 2009 and I am happy...no thrilled to tell you that I have walked away 83 lbs!!! I went from 2X to size 12. My goal is to lose 100 lbs and I know I will get there. When I started out I could barely get to the end of the 3 mile video. I'm up to 5 miles now and I love it! I'm hooked! What a great thing to be addicted to...excerize!!! Now here's the best part....I'm 62..I'll be 63 in just a few days and the young girls who work out with me can't keep up!!! Please do yourself a huge favor and get started walking away the pounds today. Or just do it to be healthier. Either way, you come out a winner!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely boring!","review":"I consider myself being in a good shape, not great, just good. I do not work out on a regular basis, and I am 35 years old. I couldn't finish this workout, I did only 3 miles: it was just extremely boring! You just literally walk 4 miles raising arms and doing some slight variations of walking movement from time to time. Even completely unfit people could have a bit more variety and complexity of movements."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is WOW","review":"This DVD is very fast paced and a great workout. I love it. It's a lot of fun to do, and as always Leslie keeps you motivated and lets you know if you're just starting out that you do not have to do all the moves just keep the pace. She has some great variations in this DVD. I have some of her other DVD's and I like them too, but this one is my favorite. It's a great winter work out when the weather keeps you from waling outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Lover's beware!!!","review":"We were reviewing this dvd, prior to actually doing the routine. It was rather ordinary, with music that was annoying and the usual routine aerobics, mixed with intervals of walking. What wasn't expected was the comment made by Sansone about doing kicks. She said she thought of kicking a cat,everytime she did a kick and laughed. I have never heard anything like this on any exercise tape, it was shocking and disturbing.Will not be buying any of these tapes, based on what this instructor said. Promoting animal cruelty on a exercise dvd, what next???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I was really disappointed when she said every time I kick I pretend I'm kicking a cat...HAHAHAHAHA.

So, I never got to use it as I gave up on having any more shipped to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Exercise","review":"This is my favorite of all my exercise tapes/dvds. The music in this one is really good. I catch myself humming \\"walk, power walk\\" off & on during the day. I have a new role model - Alton is 72 years old. I want to move that good when I'm his age. That's the motivation for me getting up at 6:00 every morning and taking this awesome walk with Leslie & these happy, healthy folks. I'll be putting this dvd into a few Christmas stockings this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER CHALLENGE WALK","review":"I just purchased this tape and I have to say I absolutely love it. It is one of those tapes that you can either do one mile or up to the entire four. I have several of Leslie's walking tapes and I feel this is a wonderful workout to add to her collection.

This 4mile walk definantely is intense and I was sore for a few days. If you are looking for something \\"more\\" here it is. However I did not like the fact that she didn't use weights in this video and the setting was very impersonal and intimidating. The set was a steel gray and all the people were in very good shape which made it seem like this video wasn't for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get This!!!!!","review":"I love...love...love this workout. Its a great, upbeat, motivating workout and its really a challenge. I started off with Leslie's 2 mile work outs..I have a brisk walk dvd and then another that uses the weights. In all honesty, all her workouts are worth the money. Leslie does love to chat through the workout but it makes the time fly by. When I first heard of Leslie and her workouts, I did not even entertain the thought of a walking video..I love to sweat and just assumed that I would not get that kind of result. Boy was I wrong...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall BUT...","review":"I give this 4 stars because I concur with most of the reviews on here--this is a fun, upbeat aerobic workout that is not difficult and gets your heart pumping. BUT it bothers me that there are no track points on this DVD so you have to go straight through and cannot 'jump' to the end if you want to stop at 2 or 3 miles. It is not customizable--I would find it much more user-friendly if it was. It would be such a simple thing to make it better in this way. Also, the steps are somewhat repetitive throughout. But I like Leslie very much. She is my favorite workout 'partner' and now the only type of workout DVD I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"What a workout!!!! I've lost so many inches and pounds (dieting of course also) Leslie is awesome, I cant wait to order more of her DVD's, the 4 mile walk goes so fast you dont even realize its over lol, although the last mile is slower (thank GOD!) lol but its a great DVD I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far One of The Best","review":"I am continuing on my quest to build my Leslie Sansone video library and this is one of the best.

Super challenge? Yes! So walkers get your copy today and start walking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"I love this video. It's one of my favorites!

I love Leslie's positive and encouraging attitude!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great walk DVD","review":"Love Leslie Sansone. She makes great walk exercise DVDs. It's a 4 mile Super challenge walk that's great for beginners to advance. I recommend this DVD for people who have knee problems.

I do this dvd 2 times a day. Once in the morning and than once in the late afternoon. Looking forward to the results. Never have a problem with the steps of in home walking and the pace is great.

They were ancient in most instances or way too easy. Now, always check with your doctor but this it would seem that any of Leslie's tapes would be doable while pregnant or of course, not pregnant. I felt like this was actually a little too fast paced for when you get bigger but I modified and was still ok. Not pregnant and following all the steps, this would be a great workout. Again, I can't stress enough to check with your doctor about any exercise while pregnant but mine ok'd exercise and said walking was just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Mile Walk-Leslie Sansone","review":"I enjoy the Walk Away the Pounds workouts.

You should try it. Do not be afraid of the four-mile workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Easy Choreography","review":"OK, to be honest, I find Leslie's QVC and infomercial appearances ANNOYING...so I didn't expect to like her workout. I had read such good things about it in Prevention, and was looking for an indoor solution for days when it is too cold to get outside and walk. I'm a total clutz--so I need easy choreography. I'm also not the fittest person in the world. Actually, Leslie's DVD was the first exercise tape (other than yoga) that I've ever bought that I've been able to complete the first time... with arms! Given that, it's probably targeted towards beginners/advanced beginners. Still, a great workout...lots of fun. The mile meter updates really help keep you motivated. I found it easy to say... yeah, I can do another mile. If you're just startiing out, you can always start with one or two miles...and keep adding. Great tape. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast workout","review":"I got this because I have several other DVDs by Leslie. I love her high energy, and this one doesn't disappoint.

I started walking with Leslie about two years during a twin pregnancy (I was prohibited from running due to problems with the pregnancy). I fell in love with Leslie's dvds and continued to use them after the pregnancy was over to lose weight. They really work! After losing 50 lbs and coming to a standstill, I needed to rev it up and break the plateau I'd reached...well, this dvd did it!! I'm not losing as many pounds now, but the inches on my waistline and hips are melting away! My 18 month old twins even enjoy trying to walk with me!!! (they think it is funny to see mommy walking in one spot) So not only is this a great workout, but you can even work out when the kiddies won't take a nap with this one...that's pretty hard to beat!

I gained 10 lbs in two months since working at an office and it's starting to get cold outside.I won't allow myself any excuses for not exercising and now that I have this DVD, it's hard to turn away from it.Great for anyone who has never worked out before. Not intimidating or complicated.Great for anyone who is active and wants to mix things up.I love it because it gets me moving and it helps to start my day off right. I alternate between this and yoga and I feel very healthy. I've always been active-i.e. running, yoga, pilates and I will be honest and say that I'm not sweating buckets (although, I am glistening;). I'm not a big believer in \\"no pain, no gain\\", so this is perfect.Only complaints--steps can be repetitive (what you'd expect from a walk workout) and her voice--rather do without (*mute). All in all, I highly suggest this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout!","review":"I think this DVD is a good workout, however, I was slightly disappointed to find that it does not use any weights in the 4 miles. I have the 1, 2, and 3 mile DVD and all 3 of these do use the weights. This is a one hour workout and 4 miles but because of the lack of weights, it seemed somewhat easier than the 3 mile DVD that I already had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie's best!","review":"I've worked out with Leslie since the original WATPs. This is her best workout in my opinion. Her cueing is almost perfect, the music is great and she doesn't forget to switch moves as much as she does in other workouts.I use this on and off, but when I did do the super challenge four days a week together with 20 minutes ofCrunch - Pick Your Spot PilatesI lost 2kg in a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dance songs","review":"I really like this CD. There are some really good dance songs, some I didn't really care for, but all the songs I bought the CD for were great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical but accessible","review":"The previous \\"version\\" of this book -- The Physics and Technology of Tennis -- is a daunting read for all but a few. In Technical Tennis, the authors cover many of the most important technical aspects relating to the interactions among racquets, strings, balls, and court surfaces, but the information is MUCH more accessible (and portable). The writing style is smoother, too, than Physics, so one could actually read through this entire volume in an evening. This book represents a great effort to render a complex subject in such a way that the concepts and principles are within the grasp of the interested lay-person, without being condescending or patronizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great low-tech intro","review":"Despite the title, there are no equations and the technical details are all descriptive, but there's lots of useful information. A great first book to read on technical aspects of tennis. If the title suggests you will find hard numbers and research-level information here, you might be disappointed. Otherwise it's really a great book with lots of practical physics- and engineering-basedgood advice on everything from racquets and balls to shots and serves, delivered at an almost non-technical level: think physics for poets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should know what's in this book","review":"For many years I was unable to decide what racket, strings, spins, on and on.

Prior to my purchase I read some reviews and noticed that a number of people took issue with the loudness of the vacuum when it is in use. I figured they were being overly sensitive, so I put in my order without much concern.Fast forward to when I received the product and tried it out. After charging the battery and firing the vacuum up I was shocked at how loud and piercing the shrill noise is. I already have hearing damage as it is and I feel that if I were to use this vacuum without shooting earmuffs I would further damage my hearing. It really is unbelievable how high-pitched of a shriek this product has.That being said, the vacuum does an excellent job of cleaning and has great suction power. I just wish it didn't give me a raging headache every time I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I bought this thinking it would have much more suction than an ordinary household dustbuster.

I would give it 4 stars if it didn't emit an awful ear-piercing, hearing-endangering shriek. There is no reason a tool should be this loud. The noise is not related to its function, but is just bad design. Hearing protection should be worn at all times when using. The need to find your hearing protection seriously detracts from the convenience (which is great otherwise)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly noisy","review":"The noise is very high pitched and practically made my family's ears bleed.

It's a cordless wet/dry shop vac. It may be a bit bulkier than a Dust Buster, but it's 10 times the vacuum cleaner. The hose, which accepts 1 1/4\\" attachments, is the highlight of the product. I had no idea how useful it would be. Plus, if you already have DeWalt 18V batteries, you can have spares on hand for extended vacuuming jobs.

Bottom line good if you have extra battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little vac","review":"I've had the basic car vacs in the past and wanted something of a bit higher quality, as well as portable. I also wanted something with a high quality air filter.This vacuum fits the bill. It's more expensive than one of the cheapo car vacs but it's certainly appears of better quality.Note that it isn't as powerful as a normal vacuum cleaner and won't clean as well as a full vacuum cleaner, simply due the fact that they can only fit so much into a little vac like this. Also I do wish there was an attachment for the end of the rubber hose to get into crevices.But for a portable vac, this thing is great. It's fine for little light-duty stuff and picking up various bits of junk. The fact that it also works with liquid is really nice.I use it for my car, but obviously you can use it anywhere you need a quick clean-up.As far as noise complaints, I don't see what the big deal is.

It does hold a lot more before requiring emptying and has a much finer pore filter so it stops more fine dust.One thing not noted in the other reviews I have read on it concerns the criticism noted of the suction nozzle being fixed to the body. The hose diameter is such that when the nozzle end is pulled out of the nozzle, 1.25\\" diameter standard shop vacuum accessories can be attached to the hose end. Thus it can be used with standard 1.25\\" nozzles including wand, flared nozzle and brush accessories and extensions for floor cleaning. This capability adds considerably to the unit's versatility.It is loud compared to other battery powered vacuums but that is my primary criticism so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the other dewalt vac","review":"I have purchased many dewalt tools.

But no, despite all the noise (which really does require hearing protection), the suction ability on this vacuum is quite disappointing and it gets rapidly worse as the filter collects dust. It's just about adequate for cleaning up kitty litter around the pan, but even a $29.00 cordless vac can do that. Even the shape of the hose is wrong for getting into tight areas.The only positive thing I have to say about this vacuum is that it looks very impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the price, it's just perfect.","review":"First, I spend quite a while comparing this ... 12 clensing tissues and how much I love my pocket pc.

I tried lots of remedies but nothing helped. I ended up purchasing another one because I really like the features and what it is supposed to do. It really is great when it works. The second one had the TEAC name and I thought maybe the bugs had been worked out. I've always liked TEAC equipment but this one was worse.

If you research this on the net, you will discover there is an electronic issue which causes the unit to loose communication with the PC.

My best luck has been to get about 33% of the disks to print correctly. The other 66% had missing segments of black ink/resin--which looks bad.

My first cellphone was an LG (when they were still called Lucky Goldstar) half-flip. Every LG phone I have owed has been nearly problem free.the mint chocolate, or chocolate in general, is a new design which will definitely take some getting used to, but is well worth it. The touch screen auto-locks when the slider is closed, unless you tap the same side button twice in rapid succession, which helps prevent it from making calls on its own. if you want more security than that, you can still enable \\"phone locked\\" mode which is available on every other phone. it has an awesome little camera and the sound quality is impressive.if you have used an ipod in the last few years, you will quickly adapt to the LG chocolate interface. If you like the possible musica capability, this phone is definitely for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your frustration","review":"This phone is not worth the hype. It has major flaws, such as freezing up; making calls on its own; key pad is way too small; your face will touch the screen during calls and will cause you to lose your call; if you talk on the phone more than 3 or 4 times per day (on an average call) your battery will have to be recharged; nevertheless, you have to recharge the phone everyday anyway (this phone has very poor battery life). Problems will occur more frequently after your 15 day trail period has expired and Verizon will only replace your phone with another chocolate phone. If you are fed up with the chocolate phone they will only replace your phone with a phone of their choice - even if you offer to pay the difference for the phone of your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible phone","review":"I have had this phone for a year now and it sucks. the touch screen no longer works, it calls ramdom #'s and then hangs up al the time.

I gave it to my 8 month old to play with at least its getting used now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Phone","review":"Yes, it looks cool, but other than that it's a terrible phone. The touchpad is difficult to use, the numbers are pretty small, the battery dies rapidly. In a word, awful. Even disregarding the fact that the sales woman assured me the phone could play itunes (which it can't and I should have known that) it's still a crappy phone. It makes calls on its own. I'm not sure about hitting the side key twice in rapid sucession, after just testing it, all I have to do is hit the key once and it's able to dial on its own. Additionall, the phone does not recognize when keystrokes are being used as part of the connection. Meaning, when I try to check my voicemail, the phone acts like I'm doing other things when I type in my password. That's an issue I've never had with another phone. It's really difficult to use call waiting. Find another phone to buy. I should have gotten a razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful phone","review":"I have a perfect track record with cell phones, never losing or breaking one, so I bought this phone with the two year agreement at a Verizon wireless store in November without purchasing the extra insurance. It had a software error within two months, even though I kept it pristine. The warranty covered the phone, so it was replaced for free. Within another four months the phone was unusable again. I was told that it had water damage and that it was no longer covered by the warranty. I have never dropped a phone in water. Ever. The salesman told me \\"These phones are delicate. The humidity from the shower can cause water damage.\\" That's ridiculous. Don't buy this phone.

The negligible sound quality improvement doesn't make up for the fact that your bare ears are rubbing against the exposed insides of the headphone earpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatly improved my SR80i headphones","review":"The old SR80 headphones used to come with the L-Cush pads. When I recently got my SR80i headphones, I initially thought the S-Cush pads on them might be better. Not! They press too hard on my external ear, specifically on the \\"tragus,\\" the bit of cartilage that sticks out in front of the ear canal. For some reason, I find that to be simply unbearable. The L-Cush pads solve that problem: they distribute pressure to the outside of the ear (the helix and lobule). I think the sound is improved also, since the drivers are a bit farther away. I did a variation of the \\"Shack Mod\\" [...]. I didn't bother to punch holes in the added foam. Result: drastically increased comfort. Now they just get a bit itchy on the top of my ear (the helix), but that's vastly preferable to the burning sensation/pain I used to get from them pushing on the tragus. YMMV, but so far so good for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit, feel, and finish for the Grado SR-60i","review":"I NEVER do reviews. I think this may actually be my first one....Lets get to it...As I am reviewing this as an added bonus to the Grado SR-60i's. Upfront the headphones are great for an on ear headphone. THe sound stage is great, and the low impedance requiring no extra amplification is a great bonus to the Grado line of headphones. The SR-60i come standard with your typical full foam ear pads that honestly are somewhat comfortable. My main purpose for looking for these ear pads is the dissipation of heat. My ears where getting extremely warm after prolonged use with the standard ear pads.The L-Cush ear pads WILL cool off your ears a ton better. After all isn't the point of \\"audiophile\\" quality headphones to wear them because we love listing to music? For supreme comfort and a broader range of sound you will not be disappointed. Thanks Grado... Now make these standard on ALL your cans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty rough...","review":"I bought these as a replacement for my Grado Sr60s. These are pretty rough. Im sure that over time they will get better, but at the moment these are pretty hideous.

Im not sure if these are genuine Grado replacements or a third party product, but they are very uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way more comfortable that the stock SR-60 pads","review":"If you have SR-60/SR-60i cans, this upgrade is a no brainer. These things are so much more comfortable than the pads the SR-60 comes with, it's amazing.I think the sound quality is also improved. Worth every penny of the $20 they cost if you wear headphones a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"How grado gets it's money year after year","review":"I went to the shelf where my head phones sit awaiting my use, after a long absence, and picked up my SR80 'phones. Found remnants of the pads all over the floor, my hands, my hair, and my ears. VERY disappointing. Yet more disapointing than that, was the fact that after buying headphones for $99, I have to buy new pads ($20!) frequently, to continue using them. Not all that comfy, they ought to at least last a while longer, for that discomfort. Not all that well made, in that the surface is rather distracting while wearing them. But it keeps them sounding like the original Grados, after all. There is no substitute, for these, unhappily."},{"rating":"1","title":"not comfortable","review":"Not very comfortable unless you're a young child with very small ears.

Even worse, is that you have to shell out 15$+ shipping to replace them every so often. They aren't even that comfortable for most people, when pressed up against the ear, because they don't conform to the natural shape and hold heat in.Expect to see downgraded reviews from the 2006-2007 reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope these are more comfortable on higher end models.","review":"I snatched these cushions up hoping for a wonderful boost in ergonomics that the majority of other reviewers have experienced, however the original SR60 Grado cushions were far more soft and homey for my ears.As others have recommended, I had some positive results bending the headphone band backward to reduce pressure on my ears. This technique takes some experimentation before getting a perfect balance between the pressure of the headphones on your ears and center of your head, but was certainly more of an improvement than this $20 upgrade. I hope I have better luck with these cushions when I invest in a higher end model. Happy hunting!-Chase"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think they are...","review":"If you're planning on putting these on your SR-60/80i for a boost in performance, you're going to be sorely (pun intended) disappointed. I bought these to use with the SR-60i... bad idea.Right now, I have the set of SR-225i that I upgraded to sitting in front of me (which include the genuine Grado L-Cush pads), and also a set of these L-Cush pads side by side. The cushions that were included with the 225i are made of much softer foam than these, which have an inner ring of harder foam that touches your ears and is quite inflexible, creating a pinching sensation within a half an hour of use.I'd take the comfy pads included with the SR60/80i over these any day for comfort alone; or, buy the SR-125i that includes the real cushions -- which are indeed quite nice and provide great soundstage and audio quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"More comfort, better sound","review":"I bought these for my SR80i's, and it was probably the best $20 I've ever spent. These are much more comfortable than the stock \\"comfies,\\" which always hurt my ears and got too warm after 20 or 30 minutes. These L-cush pads (known by Grado lovers as \\"bowls\\") help move the driver farther away from the ear, which I found more comfortable, but by doing so they also improve the soundstage significantly. I never thought I'd use the words \\"Grado\\" and \\"Soundstage\\" in the same sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"uncomfortable","review":"I don't like these at all. While they do create a nice sound signature with some Grados, I can't wear them for very long before they really start bothering my ears. They aren't supra-aural, and they aren't circum-aural either. The sort of fit on the outsides, over the tops of the edges of your ears. So ear size and shape is extremely important in terms of whether these will work for you or not. I much prefer the comfies (S-cushions) for both comfort, and sound signature for most Grados. (I.e., I believe that most Grados are too bright, and the comfies are just the thing to tame the pushed mids/highs.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"These improved the sound of my SR80i's","review":"These improved the sound and comfort over the original ear cushions. I would love to try the G-Cushions but for foam cushions $45.00 is too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the original for SR125","review":"These are identical to the original doughnuts on the SR125, as far as I can tell. They put the driver at the right distance from your ears for optimal performance, and provided a bit of dampening for the pronounced highs on the SR125. But they are just as uncomfortable as the original. I wear glasses which makes the situation worse. But I'd still recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite Improvement over S-Pads","review":"So I thought I could ignore the pressure on my ears from the S pads but I after two months I could no longer take it. I read from other reviews that these pads get flaky after a few years so Ive decided to wrap them elegantly with some socks to protect the foam. I do not like how expensive they are but they are very comfortable and provide a brighter sound, and cleaner sound stage too. I wear glasses and if I really want to enjoy my earphones I take them off and bask in glorious Grado sound for a long time, otherwise I find the slight pressure from the foam pads bearable for maybe two hours before they start to bug me. 4/5 stars because of high-ish price, the fact that they wear out after 2-3 years, and minor glasses-related comfort problems which would be pretty hard to take into account for earphone pad designers."},{"rating":"2","title":"costly but worth it","review":"I long quit listening with my SR-60s because of the pad discomfort. Now they are so old the pads were turning brown anyway, so I looked into replacements. With a little bending up of the head-piece, these L-CUSH's fit great, and I can listen to excellent sound without being tortured by the way they feel on my head. The price seemed a little excessive, but after all this time it is like getting a new pair of Grado's for $25. Really not a bad deal, and I couldn't find any other way to rescue these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"These hurt more than the original.","review":"First off let me say I think the original pads that come with Sr60's feel fine. A little sore after 4 or 5 hours of use. The L-CUSH just don't feel right. I actually miss the padding over the entire speaker. Now my ears feel like they are molded into a tube if that makes sense.

As the mother of six beloved children, I simply cannot imagine how another mother could choose her own convenience over the life of her child. How does one negate the value of life based on age? And how is this thought process different than that of Hitler who negated the value of life based on race?The \\"right to choose\\" is one that should be treasured by all, yet why do we use this term for the right to kill?

He presents the C programming language in a humorous yet forward-moving style. if you are a serious person and have no sense of humor, you might want something else, but this book really does make learning C fun. I learned on this book, then bought C for Dummies Volume II.

The Quintet in G Minor K.516 is Mozart's most pessimistic and intense work, and the Griller Quartet brings out these qualities while remaining true to Mozartian idiom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Previously had a Braun electric toothbrush which lasted for over 5 years which I was pleased with but in the end would not hold a charge. But this one is such an improvement. Cleans much more effectively you can feel your teeth are cleaner. Nicer non-slip grip and easy to tell when your 2 minutes are up by the motor pulsing instead of a light which blinked on my older unit. My wife would rarely use the older unit as she was not overly impressed, she uses this new one everytime. She also loves the Ortho tip. My 2 boys are also using this brush (11 & 13yrs) as they really like it and can notice the difference from using a manual brush. They never used the old Braun brush and did not need any encouragement to start using the Excel so that is a great plus. One has dentures and no problems. Highly recommend, dont bother with the non 3D Excel models, get the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I love the Braun Oral B 3D Excel. I've used it for about a month now and love the way it cleans. The holder is nice as well. I'm able to clear off my sink now that the holder is attached to the wall. Very nice!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Classic Humour","review":"'Mon Oncle' is Jacque Tati's third film and continues the adventures of the accident-prone hero, M. Hulot. It again observes peoples' peccadilloes, but also satirizes the foibles of the modern mechanical world. Again, the humour is quiet and subdued, and the film is a fitting sequel to 'M. Hulot's Holiday'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Outing for M. Hulot","review":"Jacques Tati continues his \\"M. Hulot\\" trilogy with this pleasant gem. Sight gags abound, though M. Hulot is actually not in nearly as much of this film as he was in \\"M. Hulot's Holiday\\". The story revolves mostly around a family and their new \\"modern\\" home, which reminds me of watching those old \\"Kitchen of the Future\\" programs. Many of the technological advances seem questionable at best, and some seem outright stupid. The film pokes fun at those who worry about \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\", culminating in a VERY humorous dinner party scene. It should be noted that the M. Hulot films are not so much a feature-length narrative as a collection of sketches, sometimes connected very loosely. But this is a beautiful film and worth the time to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tati: at your birthday's party!","review":"My uncle was for the cinema what \\"A brave new world\\" for literature but told with an ever smiling face. Once more Jacques Tati returns with his acidic and pleasant confrontation between the common man and the increasingly depersonalized and mechanized society, always in a hurry without the demanded time to enjoy the minor simplicities and overlooked things the live gives is.That's why this film awarded with all the honors the coveted Prize of Best Foreign Film in 1958."},{"rating":"2","title":"childhood memory still makes me laugh","review":"I saw this movie when I was a small child and have carried the memory of one or two scenes from it ever since. I wasn't even sure what the name of it was until I saw a glimpse of a promo for it on one of the cable channels some years ago.I knew this was the right movie when I read the review by the viewer from the Netherlands describing the smashing of the coffee bowl in the kitchen. The memory of that bouncing pitcher and then the accidental smashing of the next thing picked up is the one thing I remembered most clearly after over 40 years. It still makes me laugh to think of it.I look forward to seeing this funny movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a mixed bag","review":"I felt Mon Oncle had its moments - but there were times when I struggled to get any meaning (and I generally like so-called slow films e.g. Wang Kai-War's In the mood for love). Much preferred M. Hulot's Holiday. Helps if you like dogs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buyers beware","review":"I really recommend that people watch this film before buying it. Although most of the reviews here are extremely positive, many people who have seen this film--including just about everyone I know--find this film excrutiatingly unfunny. There is a lot of inventiveness, but I watched the whole film without laughing once, and I have found that to be a common experience from talking to other people. Personally, I would take my money and spend it on the Marx Brothers or Fawlty Towers or The Office or Tatie Danielle or one of the other wonderful Criterion offerings. At the very least, I hope you will make sure you find this film funny before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"possibly the most boring film I have seen...","review":"Unfortunately, I was made to watch this film in a French class I took. While I could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate, it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character's face. It was honestly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters' faces."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very funny movie, if by \\"funny\\" you mean \\"boring\\".","review":"This is not a bad movie, but it is a painfully boring one. I read nothing but good reviews for Mon Oncle, expecting a good, fun movie. But it was just really long and boring. If you've never seen it, and are interested in seeing it, rent it first. You're not missing anything if you skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is NOT FUNNY at all!!","review":"This film is, without any doubt, THE WORST FILM I EVER SAW.

I have a lot of patience, but who has the time to sit and read a book that goes on and on about nothing? How can those women be so cold-hearted? That's probably why Miss havisham got burned in the first place. I bet her heart was cooled off after that. Frankly, this was one of the first books I had ever read by Charles Dickens, i must say that this will be the last. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is as bad as it gets.Instead of taking a sleeping pill,just read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This picture has been blown up so much, it is grainy and sandy looking.

I've watched it a couple of times with great enjoyment, and I'm only moderately interested in those topics. I guess you'd have to find it (or stumble across it, like I did) in a public or academic library. It doesn't seem to be commercially available anymore. Probably, there's not a huge market these days for videos of long interviews with nerdy old balding white guys in dark suits with skinny ties and white shirts... even if the guys are smart and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool song","review":"Way cool song.

The written exercises can be a bit tedious at times in my opinion, but they're not too bad. Definitely buy used though, as the new price is way too much for being as old as it is and as short as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally awful","review":"Other than the cinematography, it is total ... Historical inaccuracies, zero entertainment value, pretentious. I'm Chinese and I hate the movie. In fact I do not know of any Chinese who likes it. For those who named this an epic, PUURLEEEESE... go and watch \\"The Three Kingdoms\\" Even the recently made \\"Yongzheng Dynasty\\" qualifies more as an epic than this film that serves only to pander to the needs & tastes of the Western audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing for Westerners","review":"The ups and downs of a fuedal Chinese king, it isn't King Lear, and it's sort of predictable with a dash of Kung Fu, Grasshopper. There's plenty of extras in 2nd Century battle gear though not much battle as in Kubicks's Spartacus. The motives of the main characters are assumed for Eastern audiences, but Westerners may be scratching their heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood...","review":"I bought this movie because I really liked Shanghai Triad (which also starred Gong Li). Unfortunately, I was disappointed - Emperor and Assassin is really more like a Shakespearean play than a movie.By that I mean that the plot, staging, and dialogue are all very contrived. It's more like watching a very long play than a movie. You see the characters, and you can understand what's going on and why they're doing what they're doing, but the kind of emotional involvement with the characters that you get with a movie never happened for me. The characters all just seemed very one-dimensional..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful movie...","review":"This was really a beautiful movie. The locations, costumes, people, settings, visuals -- all just stunning. The acting is good, the story solid, the music is good and fitting. The biggest annoyance is the funky yellow of the subtitles.This is a movie about power, love, war, regret, betrayal and hate. I'm not quite sure why it's rated R though -- no sex, no language, and while there's a bit of violence, theres very little blood.This is just a very powerful movie very worth watching -- and the ending is not what you'd expect. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I just got the DVD from amazon.com, and I can't believe how awsome it is. Better still, it comes with a Spanish track, which makes it even more wonderful to watch for those of us who speak the language. It rivals ANY large scale movie made in Hollywood. It's beauty is infinite. MY only regret is that it doesn't come with an English and a French track. The Spanish dubbing is magnificient. I'm sure if there were more foreign movies dubbed in Eglish, people would get used to the dubbing (like they are everywhere else in the world), and films like The Emperor and the Assassin would get the audience they disserve. If you think Gladiator is great, this movie is MUCH greater.Thanks amazon.com for allowing me to have this DVD in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor and The Assassin","review":"Save your money.

It includes songs with lyrics by well known poets such as Haim Nahman Bialikand 16th century Rabbi Shabazi. The lyrics and instruments give it somewhat of a biblical revival feel which characterizes the Zionist \\"Old-New\\" land ideal. These songs are all well known in Israel, sung in campfires, parties, weddings, holidays. I find the performances and the arrangement flawless.

I didn't think the acting was that attrocious (I've seen worse), or the story that stupid (I've seen worse), though it never really amounted to anything I cared much about either. I really think this film, though it doesn't deserve huge praise, got overbashed just because it was the time when it was proper to dis poor Ben and Jennifer.Can't say I recommmend anyone watch it, but if you do, I don't think you'll come away thinking it's as bad as all the publicity would lead you to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movies that spells,Gigli.","review":"Comic Book guy from The Simpsons would have a short 3 word sentence that will really go for this:WORST.MOVIE.EVER!!!!LOL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes it was bad...","review":"but DAREDEVIL was worse!!

This movie is proof that the rating systems should be totally revamped so that there is a real warning associated with a rating. The title of this review, Rain Man meets Pulp Fiction, is a charitable characterization, but this movie does have a little in common with the others in terms of the persons involved, their implausible behavior, and the fact that the viewer cannot find any character he likes in the whole movie.

It's an original masterpiece starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, two of the hottest young actors right now. I was moved by their dialogue and the script is a witty and nuanced piece of classic writing. The chemistry they displayed on the screen make them the new Spencer Tracy and Katherine Heartburn. The only other film that can even begin to touch \\"Gigli\\" in terms of greatness is \\"Titanic.\\" In fact, it's so moving, that I cried midway because I was so overwhelmed with emotion.

My sister and I bought this as a joke gift for our mom's birthday. Thank God I didn't waste my money seeing it in theaters. It was so bad, I was amazed!

My favorite scene is when Ben Affleck is looking in the mirror talking about how he is a bull and how J.Lo (who does an audacious job playing a lesbian hitman - or is it hitwoman?) is a cow. \\"Bull- grrr- Cow!\\" It was amazing. Also it says the f-word on average between 1 and 1 and a half times a minute. Oh yes, this, along with Fear Dot Com, is one of the worst movies ever created.

It's not an award winner but the critics obviously had another agenda when they trashed this movie.I finally saw it on cable, then bought the DVD and watched it with friends who also liked it. The gratuituous use of the f*word gets annoying but there is drama, comedy and some sexual tension. Most scenes with the \\"retard\\" are hilarious. \\"God bless you\\" and \\"Turkey time\\" bring to mind totally different images since watching Gigli.

Amazing Cameos!!!!","review":"Well not the greatest thing to have hit the screens in recent years. Ben Afleck was as mediocre as ever. Jennifer Lopez was competent I suppose. Justin Bartha was pretty good in the role of the challenged kidnap victim. BUT, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR TWO OUTRAGEOUS CAMEO PERFORMANCES FROM CHRISTOPHER WALKEN AND AL PACINO. In fact I would go so far as to say, skip through the movie to these scenes, where the two veteran actors totally dominate the movie in what is probably less than 10 minutes of screen time. You will rarely see such quality performances. Walken with a subtle yet tension filled monologue tinged with madness, and Pacino with volcanic power that sends shivers up the spine. These two show more acting power in the arch of an eyebrow or narrowing of a pupil, than most pretty actors could ever aspire two. I was floored by Walken and Pacino. Oscar performances without a doubt. All others paled in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is still available on DVD!!!!","review":"Holy...!!!

She is a legend and still beautiful woman. Aside from the fabulous Ms Kazan, is that gloriously sexy scene between Afleck and Lopez where they are debating over the female vs male body. Now THAT scene alone was worth the entire movie admission for me! For the record everything Lopez' character said in that scene is 100% correct! The movie could not win any awards for great acting, but, take it for what it's worth and you'll have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for not being boring.","review":"Only one thing saves Gigli from being the worst movie I have ever seen, and that is that it isn't boring, in the way that watching a drunk sing isn't boring. It's sad, morbid and only slightly funny.The plot--wait, what plot? J.Lo and Ben Affleck cussing, watching people die, J.Lo's established lesbian character suddenly changing to straight(at LEAST they could make her bi, so it would be sort of believable), a death scene, a few terrible \\"funny\\" scenes...what plot?But hey, it isn't boring, and Ben Affleck is cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was J'lo and ben thinking?!?!","review":"How did these two get convinced to do this movie. Alot of people say Bad Boys 2 was the worst movie of 2003 but I beg to differ. This movie has a horrible plot, the characters are not believeable at all. I mean Ricki (j'lo) claims she's a lesbian and says she is a tough girl but her character doesn't prove any of these statements to be true. Gigli (Affleck) doesn't make us believe that he is a hard core gangster. Why do they take a mentally challenged kid hostage? Why were they asked to chop off his thumb? Did Gigli boss believe that he is so pathetic that he can't watch over this kid? Just look a another reviewer wrote, why were they hiding him if he was constantly riding in a convertable with the top down? The writers try to make us laugh in some scenes but the scenes that kind of make you smirk are the scences that were not intended to be funny.

Put together enough pointess, random details, and you get Gigli, amovie that's less incompetent than bewildering. So forget the hype -- this movie would stink even without its big-ticket stars, which isn't to say that either is entirely blameless. The dialogue from writer-director Martin Brest is clunky, the film has serious tonal inconsistencies and at over two hours, it drags on way longer than it should. Really silly is the kindest way to describe this hopelessly misconceived exercise in celebrity self-worship... it has a special badness all its own. I highly recommend not seeing this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinema From the Depths","review":"Writer-director Martin Brest hits an all-time low with \\"Gigli\\" (2003), an excruciating \\"romantic-comedy\\" that somehow made it to theaters.

Ben Affleck is nothing short of astonishing with his sloppy, painfully unfunny performance. Proceed at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie, bad actors","review":"Even after the two main characters stay together at the end, the movie left me with a sense of depression and dissatisfaction. What did Al Pachino and Christopher Walken think in playing even the smallest parts in this \\"movie\\"? Such gifted actors do not belong in a film like this. Untalented Ben Affleck who fails to show any kind of emotion on his face and cheap looking JLo who doesn't have any more talent than him make this movie even less appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget stars.

Let's just say it would probably be more entertaining and enjoyable to sit through a double feature of the Care Bears Movie and the Teddy Ruxpin Movie (1999) than this heap. Why? Acting, plot, chemistry.. shout out of anyone spots these, they do a great job hiding. The only nominal performances go to Walken and Pacino, aptly chagrined at the display of their talents like guys who mistakenly wear tuxedos to a monster truck rally. I've seen this film compared to 'Glitter' and 'Crossroads' and that's pretty accurate; it's an awkward derivative ego piece ironically showcasing all the wrong aspects of its purported stars. Joanie and Chachi had more chemistry, and probably will have had longer staying power. Here's hoping Hollywood's next reigning couple shows up sooner rather than later."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Chemistry","review":"What was Jennifer Lopez thinking of. It was absolutely bad enough that she is engaged to Ben Affleck, but unfortunately it seems just like a publicity stunt to see how much they are in love. Even the movie seemed as if it was a bigger joke, and it is a big joke. I really didn't like Gigli. There was absolutely no chemistry the couple had in the film.The film was really just awful, and I'm glad I didn't pay anything to see it. To be honest with you, I think it is just a shame that Jennifer Lopez oxerexposed herself too much within her movie career. She had better try for a better movie role next time. I think they should've given the role to Halle Berry and her husband, Eric Benet instead. Don't bother seeing this flick. You'll really regret spending the ten spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No even the Mother of All Bombs (MOAB) is a bigger bomb","review":"I thank this movie, because i sat through it so that has to take some time away from my eternal punishment for 2 reasons, the first i saw it as a pity movie so they wouldn't feel bad. and secondly because after seeing this movie I truly believe that hell consists of this movie on reruns. For that lady that wrote the review saying that we didn't \\"get it\\" because it was to much for us: maybe we didn't get it because it was to little for us. Some things just leave you speechless as does this movie. I belive it contains the worst movie line in history, \\"Why don't you make like a turkey and gobble gobble.\\" Why does a turkey have to suffer the indignation of having it's species affiliated with this movie.

I rented it because I heard the hype was so bad and i wanted to see how bad it was. But it wasn't so bad at all. I have seen many films (eg. The Pledge, Snatch, Phonebooth) that were less entertaining. I liked it, okay? It is not that awful.

I'm not a big fan of lopez and affleck is a lousy actor but I have never seen this side of him in a movie - the goofy can't-help-feeling-sorry-for-him kind of guy. He made me roll with his I'm the man attitude. He actually made me want to die laffing in so many scenes seriously. But Al Pacino made the movie! Wow - give me an orgasm! He blows me totally away. I replayed his part like 3 times. He is magnificent as usual I love him! All in all, I enjoyed this movie but I wouldn't recommend the bennifer duo team up again.

Unfortunately, this movie garnered such hype, attention, and icky \\"Bennifer\\" vibes that it was doomed. It's still a bad movie but I've seen worse.

The acting was completely miserable and Ben and Jennifer stumble thru this film ( I tremble to even call it a \\"Film\\") with not one likeable attribute! I wish they were killed in the middle of the film, at least it would have subtracted another worthless hour of this mess. Al pacino does his usual over-the-top performance and it's the first time I wish he died in this film too. PLEASE do not watch this movie!!

Basically, the money paid to Lopez and Affleck should have been donated to a worthwhile charitable institution instead and the cast (yes, that's including Al Pacino and Christopher Walken) should have their thumbs cut off by a plastic knife. Whoever planned this piece of trash thought Lopez and Affleck, both semi-interesting individuals, are an interesting couple. Lopez is incredibly unsexy and hopelessly unconvincing as a well-read, intellectual, lesbian (\\"you know what I mean?\\"); Affleck is just incredibly boring.

Oh why did I ever trick myself into going into the movie theaters and paying $20.00 for tickets and seeing a piece of crap?

If I could have given it zero stars, I would have. All of the dialogue was rambling, thats all it was. So repetative and pointless. I hafta admit though, the guy who played the mentally retarded kid did a good job. Aside from him, this movie had a horrible plot that was barely existent, horrible dialogue, and it was so full of little holes and bits of stuff that just made no sense.

It makes the connection very tight with minimal untwisted wire. It also reduces errors by being able to see which wires are where. The problem with this connector is the position of the clip that keeps the connector in the socket. The position of the clip is such that when the wires are crimped (using a regular crimp tool), it causes the clip to be pressed against the connector thereby rendering it usesless. The resultng connector is fine, but will not stay put in the socket. If using the Platnum Tools crimp tool is a must then it should be clearly stated so.

The same degree of complexity exists in Pan but its often obscured, like hidden paths in the forestland in which its based. And the narrator isn't reliable; he will lie to you as he delivers the tale; to find your way through you need to be receptive to any information. This makes the novel fascinating.Hamsun is often reviewed through the lens of his old-aged follies, or as some kind of literary punk rocker, but try not to lose sight of the fact that he was always an outragiously talented artist. This is the writer often cited as the father of C20th literature. And this is one of his tender moments.

It is. The watch has lots of great features for tracking vertical feet skied, checking the altitude and things like that. Unfortunately the plastic piece around the face of the watch near the band peels off the face of the watch. This was after about a year of wearing it when skiing and biking as well as daily use. While this doesn't make it unusable, you just don't expect a relatively high end watch to fall apart.Despite the nice menu of features and otherwise quality construction, if you want a watch that has great features, looks nice and does not come apart you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this watch!","review":"I ordered and received this watch in May 2007 and by November 2007 the plastic band attachment point on the watch (where the little pin fits) broke completely off. If this had been a break in the band itself it would be repairable but a watch repair person said there is no way to repair this. Of course, because this was past the 30 day return policy for Amazon, I now have a fairly expensive piece of junk. I will never buy a Highgear product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction quality","review":"I had this watch for a little over 1 year before the band broke where the pins connect the band to the watch face. This area of the watch is made of a hard rubber. The problem with that is this: if you catch the watch face on something like a door frame (like I did)...or anything else...the strap doesn't just pop off the face...the pins actually ripped through the rubber. So even a new band doesn't help because there is no way to secure it to the face - it just keeps popping off. For a $150+ watch, I would expect much better. The functions of the watch were great, it just didn't last long at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber trimming falls apart in 2.5 years.","review":"The watch has been good to me as I travelled to countries and gone skiing. I am able to see my altimeter and compass as a guide to know how high and where I was.A few months after I go this watch as a gift, I found the same watch (but used) on sale at the REI Used Gear sale. The reason why the previous owner returned it was because the side rubber trimming of the watch was peeling off. After 2.5 years using the watch, mine is experiencing the same problem. Needless to say, I was not shocked that it happened because of what I saw at the REI Used Gear sale.For a watch over $150, I would expect a better quality than that, especially when it's suppose to be an outdoor watch implying that it should be durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap Construction","review":"My first multifunction watch. Bit complicated to set up and adjust but enjoyed using it. but this was all negated when the band broke away from the watch body. Now, a broken band or connector pin is easily to fix but in this case the pin recess on the watch cracked and the corner of the watch body fell away. I was horrified to see it was made of plastic, and not even reinforced with metal. Tried to glue it, and took it to two different watchmakers - couldn't be fixed. Cheap crap materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky!!!","review":"My wife bought me an Alterra for Christmas last year. For the most part I was happy with it.

I purchased it for the compass, altimeter, and thermometer.

I had to pay $8.00 for return since they have a policy of not paying for return postage with their RMA. The replacement was worse. It sounded like the gears were grinding. It was also tested on another machine with the same results. Again, I have to pay for return and they will not refund my money (company policy) but offered credit toward their other products.

Of course, as the book progresses, these change, as does her parents and younger brother. But this book is far more than just a literary equivalent of a TV movie of the week.

It reveals how Black Kettle stood in stark contrast to Chivington, Sherman, Sheridan, Custer and others, who enthusiastically effected our government's policy of destroying the culture of the Plains Indians and killing, with little or no excuse, innocent tribal menbers. Make no mistake, there were elements within the tribes who were no better. However, one cannot read this well-written account without coming away with a sense of revulsion toward those members of the white power structure and our military who made so little effort to understand a people who were different and to treat them with the respect they deserved.

It offers a fascinating account of the anger and frustration felt by American military personnel who resent the constraints placed on them by the nation's political leaders.

As a SEAL Team veteran of the river wars of Viet Nam myself, I can say with full confidence that the book paints the picture with exceptional detail. The twisting and turning story is compelling and accurately and portrays the unforgiving horrors and valiant heroics of combat. \\"Quester,\\" however, goes the distance and provides a badly needed retrospective about the men who fought and died with dedication and courage, while individually and collectively committing themselves to assist the people of the Republic of Viet Nam.

Awesome Band ! - Must have","review":"If you enjoyed \\"Eternal Nightcap\\" (one of the best albums Ive heard in recent years) then you'll love \\"Love this City\\". Although its not as easy to listen to the first time as Eternal Nightcap this album grows on you... and I think it is just as good, Standout songs include: \\"Thank you for loving me at my worst\\", a funny number that has no meaning called \\"chunky chunky Air Guitar\\" in the same vein of \\"I make Hamburger\\"(see the album \\"Undeniably the Whitlams\\"), \\"Blow up the Pokies\\" \\"love this City\\" \\"Unreliable\\" these are my favs at the moment but there all great so they'l change with my moods... The Whitlams are one of Australias best bands, All there albums should be purchased.... \\"Introducing the Whitlams\\" \\"Undeniably The Whitlams\\" \\"Eternal Nightcap\\" and \\"love this City\\"-- Get Em"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Freedman does it yet again","review":"Haunting, moving and breathtaking are suitable words to describe this CD, the latest from a band which is difficult to compare with any other.When I first listened to this, I was astounded. Tim Freedman's voice is soothing and his piano playing is perfect. Each song has a story to tell, some sad, some happy, and the lyrics are like poetry.Tracks like Make the World Safe, You Gotta Love this City, God Drinks at the Sando, Blow up the Pokies and 400 Miles from Darwin are haunting, soulful songs that will bring out plenty of emotions. But not all of the songs are somber.Thankyou is an upbeat, catchy tune, as Time and Unreliable.Chunky Chunky Air Guitar sets itself out from the rest of the album, being a bass heavy stomping track that is perfect to play at full volume.But the best song has to be Made Me Hard, actually a cover, but done so well that you wont care.In short, this album is 14 gems that you wont forget, and will want to hear over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can make this album safe for you....","review":"This really is a great album. It took me only three times before I started to totally love it. Great songs like..I can make the world safe for you and Thankyou for loving me at my worst plus more. Its worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Time!","review":"The Whitlams have successfully conquered the unenviable task of following up Eternal Nightcap with this multi-layered album brimming with a winning combination of mellow jazz, exquisite orchestral arrangements and endearingly earnest lyrics. Freedman's voice is soothing with the musicality of a classically-trained pianist, and the album boasts guest artists to the calibre of Bernie Hayes, Marcia Hines and those larrikin lads from Machine Gun Fellation. All in all, 'Love This City' is a fabulous all-rounder which has been on constant rotation in my CD player for the last five months! BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, A Little Inaccessible","review":"This really is a good album but there is nothing which catches the audience on the first listen. While Eternal Nightcap is deservedly considered as a great album no one track here really compares - on the first listen. However, to be fair to the album after it is listened to for a short while this album transcends the quality of the individual tracks. While Thank You and Pretty as You appear to be the initial highlights all the other tracks are really of the same quality. Buy This Album - it is worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"Were we listening to the same CD! Chunky Chunky air guitar? This man's voice is so tuneless and whiny! The lyrics are embarrassingly stupid and each and every note grates on my nerves and threatens my very soul! I hate this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever","review":"This book is obviously about 90% fabricated. I only have a casual relationship with the subject matter and even I can tell the entire Geraldine/Ronnie being married in 1974 thing is made up. The author succeeds in proving nothing. This book belongs on the fiction shelf, next to Anson's original Amityville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"Someone is offering a copy of the paperback version of this book for $300 + dollars? Um, you can buy it on the authors website in hardcover for less than $30. If anyone is stupid enough to pay that much money for a paperback book, please reply to this review; I have some magic beans I'll gladly sell you for $10k, shipping and handling included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy...","review":"I bought this book a while back and am very disappointed in it. The author claims to have evidence and documents to back up his outlandish claims, but doesn't include ANY of this evidence or documentation in the book...as if we were suppose to just \\"take his word on it\\". It's an interesting book of fiction..that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, So","review":"Well It is a very good book and I really enjoyed it but the book is not 100% true. For that I mark off one star. But still If you like Amityville, and are interested in the DeFeo Family Its a good book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact....or....FACT?","review":"Finally! A book that reveals the TRUTH about the tragic series of events in 1974. After all the hype, glorification, and FICTION over the past years this book tells you the truth about Amityville and the events that took place. The incidients that occured as well as the investigation itself, coupled with the writing style of Ric Osuna is haunting enough without the need for supernatural forces or demons helping it along. There is no hype, there is no glorification, there is no \\"shock\\" value. There is only fact, honesty, and integrity withing the pages of this book. I applaud Ric Osuna for his efforts and I highly recommend this book to ALL, and that says alot coming from the owner of a HORROR based company! Buy it. Read it. Believe it. This is reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worse Amityville Book Ever","review":"This book is the worse piece of self serving trash that I have ever read, or purchased. It offers no evidence, only opinions. Even worse the author actually seems to be defending the actions of Ronald Defeo, Jr!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one sided.","review":"This book was from the point a view of someone who was on drugs and clearly not someone that is trust worthy. Since he is the only survivor of the family how are we to really know what is true. As soon as I got to the \\" corruption of the police department\\" I had to stop reading it. Cuz I felt how can u believe someone who killed his parents with no remorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure and Utter Nonsense","review":"This book was a total disappointment and contributes virtually nothing to the debate over what happened in amityville. I expected at least a minimal level of scholarship. Instead, we get pure speculation. There is no critical analysis of Butch's version of the murders, which the author, to his discredit, accepts without hesitation. Osuna's reliance on Defeo's \\"wife\\" is equally preposterous. She claims to be virtually everywhere and know everyone involved in the story; you would expect that the author would find someone who could corroborate at least portions of her story. Again, some critical thinking on the author's part would be helpful. And the writing is simply awful. Didn't anyone proofread the thing? I completely wasted my money on this dog. I don't even want to give the book one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"I have always had a keen interest in the Defeo story, and this book really gives a lot of insight into what happened. I truly believe that it was thoroughly researched and answers many questions about that fateful night. Yes there are still some mysteries such as the seventh body that was found in the basement but I believe that the Amityville P.D. tampered with evidence. The photo which is shown in the book, looks just like Dawn Defeo. The Lutz family truly did take advantage of the tragedy to concoct that ridiculous story about the demons and goblins that haunt that house. Don't get me wrong, I do believe in spirits and demons but the Lutz story was truly a hoax and their lawyer even admitted to it! Such a shame that the Amityville house will always carry the stigma of that story and no one who owns it will ever truly be free from gawkers. If you want to know about the Defeo story and what really happened, this is the book to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I could only read half of it before I got disgusted. There are many grammer mistakes and uncredible witnesses. The bashing of the Lutz family in the book is unexcuseable. This book would have been better written by a 7th grader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely pitiful","review":"Many reviews will just glow with how Ric Osuna presents such a great new angle on the case. What he presents is something even harder to swallow than demons. The spelling and grammar mistakes are inexcusable and should be enough to discredit him without me having to go any further. It shows his unbelievable lack of intelligence.But putting that aside, his lack of intelligence is even better illustrated by his complete lack of logic. His claims are backed up by no evidence and heavily rely on assumptions. He expects the reader to trust him and for that to be enough.But most of all, this man has no idea what demonic spirits are capable of or what a demonic attack is like. He should have researched that a little before he tried to discredit the story of one. For anyone who wants to better understand this, read \\"The Demonologist\\" by Gerald Brittle. That will give you a better idea of why all of this \\"evidence\\" against the case is irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author has based his entire premise on a lady who is clearly a fraud. This \\"lady\\" is a criminal and obviously a very lonely, desperate person. She is the sort who seeks out relations with incarcerated convicts (murderers) and hordes dogs and cats in her welfare obtained apartment to the point of animal abuse. The other person who contributed to this book is Butch Defeo himself. A man who has admitted to killing his entire family in cold blood. At least in one of the many, many versions of his ever changing story. Despite, the dubious sources, the person really at fault for this terrible book is the author, who bases his revisionalist history of a terrible crime on statements from two pathological liars. Unfortunately, those who could refute this new unbelievable account of the murders are all dead. A fact, well understood by the author, I'm sure.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncredicle (not incredible) author","review":"The author of this book is very uncredible- he flipped back and forth on the issue of whether the house was haunted and even at one time proclaimed on his website that he had proof that it was. [...] Now where I believe the entire story was a hoax, I cannot accept this man's work as fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books on this subject","review":"Mr. Osuna states a lot of things as fact in this book, yet provides little or no proof for anything he says. I feel there are better choices if you want to know about the tragic murder of the DeFeo family. In addition, the author spent a number of years stating that he had absolute proof that the Amityville house WAS haunted. Only after a falling out with George Lutz did he start saying it was a hoax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cut it.","review":"While it proved to be a quite interesting read, the book lacks any substantial proof of the author's claims. You are basically expected to take the footnotes and research the information yourself to form an opinion of the book's validity. What the author obviously fails to realize, is that many who wanted to buy this book had no \\"in depth\\" knowledge of the events surrounding that fateful November night and were looking for proven answers in this book (That it's previews claimed existed herein). I for one was sadly disappointed by the lack of any substantiated proof, but I must admit, the story the author told was quite interesting, even if unfounded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book full of rubbish","review":"If you are into the whole 'Amityville' thing then you will probably like this book, but be warned, it is full of half truths, lies and ridiculous conspiracy theories involving a pretend ex wife of Ronnies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Conspiracy Continues","review":"I really thought when i had stumbed onto the authors website that finally someone was going to find the truth in this \\"going on 30 yr old case\\".

This entire book is based on the story of a woman who \\"claims\\" she was married to Defeo when the murders took place and that mob members destroyed all records of the marriage to protect her identity, OMG, is she related to the Lutz's???

Long & Wrong is an outstanding track: picture a lonely East Coast storyteller recounting a particularly dark and dusty tale from a long ago journey through the desolate back roads of Nevada, where code rules, not law. Stumble Monk, a real bouncer, nods to a great Jazz master and features some of Valega's best percussion patterns. Consilience is a memorable debut.

Also, as a minister myself, (protestant & Presbyterian...so pray for me, my Catholic friends!) I appreciated the accurate use of theology and Scripture found throughout the story, an element missing in many popular \\"self-help\\" books. Overall a great book about the insanity (and cure) found in our \\"growth\\" oriented modern society. I couldn't help visualizing how this will appear as a screen play.

What turned out to be a quest for self-help turned out to be a book that panned all the self-help gurus. Bravo to the authors!

Suffice it to say that this one -- written with collaborator John Tierney-- has the same crisp writing, the same kinds of unusual story lines and plot twists, the same kinds of colorful characters that made Mr. Buckley's other novels wonderful examples of worthwhile light reading.In this story, a failed investment banker becomes a monk and in the incarnation of Brother Ty, he somehow becomes a catalyst in the ethically flawed rebirth of the monastery's wine. The story is a satire that takes aim at self-help books, but as someone raised Catholic (and practically living in the shadow of the Vatican), a former financial journalist, and a wine lover ... well, a story line that among other things takes aim at the Holy See, Wall Street, and Napa Valley hit close to home in too many ways for me not to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure fun and good reading...","review":"The title of the book really dosnt do justice to the incredible humor youll find inside.

Never before had I read such a horrifying depiction of sick bestiality. But something told me to read on.

It is about a family's love and loyalty, the devotion of mothers to their children, the rekindling of a childhood romance, and a young woman's struggle for professional respect.\\"Thirst\\" is also about Key West and Deschamps brings Key West's sights and sounds and lifestyle to the page with vivid authenticity. She makes us care about her heroine, Dominique, and one hopes she will bring Dominique back again in a future novel.Dania Deschamps knows how to create an atmosphere of suspense and to populate that atmosphere with colorful characters.

I realize that this season was a little different than past seasons, but its because House and Cuddy were dating and they had to show House's \\"softer side\\". You know the writers had this coming for us, they had to creatively show House as himself, as well as someone who actually cares about something or someone. I feel for the storyline of season 7, they did an awesome job. House is still an ass, the relationship kept the storyline interesting, and the patient cases were still interesting mysteries. The only thing I would suggest about this show is give House more clinic duty! That part always cracks me up. I don't believe this season has gone downhill at all, especially when you see the season finale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Destruction","review":"A case can be made that over the arc of the show we have been watching a self destructive character completing his goal. In the early seasons, however, House and his writers still maintained a sort of backward humanity you couldn't help but enjoy and admire.If their point was that a person can not be entirely self absorbed and long survive, they've made that point. But, in doing so, they have also taken away any sense of entertainment left in the series.While we began with a Sherlock Holmes sort of brilliance in solving medical mysteries, we have been left with almost no mysteries to solve, and the show has become concerned with the various sex lives of its characters. It has lost its penetrating moral dilemmas and become a portrait of a ruined man. Like the performance artist in the finale, it is self absorbed and almost entirely devoid of actual art."},{"rating":"2","title":"House forever","review":"I can totally relate to the zynical Dr. House - who is living in pain.

In the first six seasons, everything clicks together because the character's actions are driven by their personalities. Even the most outlandish of stunts seem plausible because no character ever strays from their core values. However, in season 7, House is showing its seams. The universe of House completely unravels in the second half of the season as House's character is reduced to the basest, most ridiculous plot ploys. Fans suffered every week as they watched their favorite characters, especially House, reduced to shallow, hypocritical parodies of themselves.If House can survive for a half-way decent ending (since any chance of redemption was thoroughly murdered, let's say, like a car driving through a dining room) the writers are going to have to do something drastic - ie, returning to the shows roots and not being so [insert expletive here].Now that would be a real shocker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am sad to say this is the worst season of House.

Most readers are adept and understand trial procedures so I did a lot of skimming. He really had a good plot going on, but somehow it was just overdone and stretched the imagination beyond my limits. I was just surprised when looking up this book to find he has written others. Somehow I didn't think that would happen, but I may give him another try, after I read your reviews of his later books.

Have ordered the matching salt mill 3 times. The first 2 times it was delivered incomplete, Amazon wisely removed it from the site. Now newley available I re- ordered it hoping the problem was rectified...WRONG. It may seem petty but the thing should have a cover for the bottom so that when you are finished using it and set it on a counter it shouldn't leak salt on the counter's surface. The peppermill has a bottom cover but out of three salt mills none of them have the bottom cover. Salt is highly corrosive and commom sense says that a cover is neccessary. Where is it?

This book looked like it would give useful information, but didn't. There may be a few good ideas buried within, but they are hidden by academic prose and ideas that are just not implementable in the real world. Anyone who claims they have implemented a business specifications or business rules approach based on this book is glossing over the major surgery that would be needed to accomplish such a feat.Not only is the book dull and filled with indecipherable passages and a lot of fluff, the notation is weak. I recommend getting Tony Morgan's BUSINESS RULES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, which clearly explains what this book fails to, and uses the more standard UML as the notation language.If you still insist on getting this book, at least you've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good God, this rules!","review":"Dark, speedy hardcore with throat-shredding vox mixed liberally with doomy Neurosis influences?

A joke? either way I don't get it) to the rambling, depressing, Connie Willis-meets-cyberpunk conclusion, \\"Mind Catcher\\" is a work in search of a point.It is an odd take on the mad scientist/doctor genre, I'll give it that, but the premise at the heart of the book--a PET-type scanner that can suck your soul out through your eyes (seriously!)--is ludicrous to be beyond the possibilty of suspension of disbelief.This really epitomises a bad techno-horror-thriller.

Unfortunately, John Darnton hasn't done this. The writing is hardly inspiring, and the plot wanders needlessly. This plodding pot-boiler may be accurate in its presentation of brain physiology. I can't say, since I'm not a physician. But I am a photographer, and the section in which one of the protagonists shoots photos on 4x5 roll film raises doubt regarding the technical knowledge of the author and his editors. The point here is that, as far as I know, 4x5 roll film is not available, at least to the casual photographer. When faced with such bloopers, I always wonder why authors feel they should blunder around in areas where they are obviously uninformed, and why editors don't double check this sort of thng."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This book started out with a great premise. The first few pages had me hooked - or so I thought. About 50 pages in I started getting bored. Soon I was skimming multiple pages at a time. The author obviously did extensive research for this novel and, sadly, decided to put every bit of it into the story. I found the constant intricate medical talk distracting. The amount of information was unnecessary and took me out of the story. Also, the characters had a tendency to go through two or three pages of introspection - over and over - to the point where the story lost its zing.This book could easily have been 100 pages shorter without losing anything. In fact, a shorter version would have gained intensity (for me, anyway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not About Real Science or Medicine","review":"This book is a paranormal thriller decorated with interesting ideas from recent research. But the book doesn't address any real issues raised by those ideas. The style of the book is that events unfold, and one is told what to believe and feel about them by what the sympathetic characters believe and feel, even when this makes no sense in terms of the events themselves, as happens most jarringly with the central hinge event, where everyone goes berserk over a pacemaker turning on.Ironically, the point the book makes best is that doctors should be honest with their clients, and not gloss over the difficult parts. I liked how the melodramatic, but all-too-plausible villians were put through some changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book.","review":"I didn't enjoy this book.

This neurosurgeon has a \\"God Complex\\", imagine that in a neurosurgeon, and he also has a co- conspirator who is both mad scientist and computer genuis/geek who is conducting experiments on how the mind travels outside the body into another existence.

I am left with the impression that the author is trying to impress us with his knowledge of Shakespeare, his cleverness over Hamlet,his understanding of psychoanalysis, his admiration for Freud/hatred of Jung and his research of old New York. Only the last of these works at all. It's what kept me motivated to finish the book though I do confess to skipping paragraphs about 60% into it. The plot, which is summed up extremely well by a number of the Amazon reviewers has great potential - initially you get really sucked in - but then in the end feel robbed.

So, it seems, he decided to write a novel to act as a vehicle for his knowledge. This is no basis for any novel writer, least of all a thriller writer.

In an effort to make it challenging the author puts in several plot twists at the end that had me going back to the beginning of the book. However, I still enjoy mysteries like this one mostly because you learn a little about the early history of psychoanalysis and the history of New York. The author inserts several real life events, including one that seems very unlikely but did actually happen, and ties them together in a plausible way. It's not a great mystery but it is very good historical fiction.

The result is an overbearing work of pretension. The interwoven pieces of \\"The schoolboy's interpretation of Hamlet\\" only intensify the cringe.

It started out strong, but I began to lose interest as the plot and the characterization became more convoluted. The plot itself gets lost in the exposition about Freud, Jung, etc. Jung is portrayed in a very negative light that doesn't make a lot of sense. Little details about Freud seem like vanities of the author who wrote a thesis about him (the scene about his enuresis really put me off and did nothing to advance the story!). Details are supposed to make the characters more interesting, not less. By mid-book, I had completely lost interest.

Only made-up charts that will never show up like this in real life (especially the volumes he draws are ridiculously far from real-life situations). Plus, he uses bar charts, which I hate. I think candlestick charts are much better and easier to read, but that's my personal opinion.Other than that, this book was a big deception. There are much much better technical analysis books out there, and this one simply doesn't stand up. I think the guy thought he could make some quick bucks considering he's a TV anchor or something.

They are easily replaceable on the car, using a hammer for removal and a flipped lug nut with a handful of lubricated washers to pull the new ones in.

Of course you can barely read it except in broad daylight. When a camera could read and it did work and then it didn't, I believe that is called failure. Nothing will format it now including the camera. So this review is for those who care about their pics. Luckily I had just moved a recent batch off before it crapped out. I had always been a fan of Kingston, but it just goes to show. I bought three of these, now I am wary of the other two.

I have had issues with it being read by card readers. I tried to update my reader drivers but had a hard time finding any updates for the reader. I beleive that this is due to it being the new SDHC format? Sooo I just connect my camera through its mini usb which im guessing maybe slower than the card going into a reader alone. Other than that the card performs well and i couldnt imagine needing a much bigger card as I use it for a 10 megapixel camera and it can hold about 800 images which should be enough for even the longest vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"i like it a lot. no problems at all. 4 star because it could be faster, but its really a pleasure to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality","review":"This item was openned when it came to me.

At 12.2 mp I get about 1418 high-quality jpegs, and with RAW+jpeg, about 390. All in all I'm very pleased with this purchase.

It was the best deal I could find for a class 6 card at around $24. My Canon SD 870 IS records images to it rather quickly, usually faster than I can take them. The spacious 4GB capacity lets me shoot and shoot without worrying about changing memory cards. Just make sure that the devices you want to use this with support the SDHC standard.

It explores philosophical ideas implicit in the Declaration of Independence, explaining their origin in the works of Locke, Burlamaqui, Hutcheson, Pufendorf, and Aquinas, as well as their significance for Jefferson and Adams. The book would be useful to students of philosophy interested to learn more about the ideas of the American Revolution, and also to the general reader interested in where phrases like \\"self-evident\\" and \\"unalienable rights\\" come from. The emphasis here is not on fine-grained historical detail but on philosophically important themes, which White expounds with clarity, acumen, and wisdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hammer to the Square Peg","review":"The author devotes his attention to the philosophies underpinning the Declaration of Independence. As a scholar of philosophy, Morton does an interesting job of delving into the philosophical origins of words and ideas to parse the text to arrive at their meanings. But this is his problem: he avoids many currents, such as republicanism and the fears and historical motivations behind radical Whig philosophy. Whether by design or ignorance, the book falls into a turgid philosophical exegesis. The conclusion of the book offers a hint to the author's intent when addressing the proper bounds and aims of government. It appears that the square peg would go through the round hole by sheer force of willful ignorance. Ah, socialism!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dinners at my house","review":"At the beginning of the school year, I promised myself that I would cook up some new, and delcious recipes for the kids and my husband.

I find that \\"Family Suppers\\" is an easy book to follow the recipes in. I have most of the ingredients in the pantry or fridge already. Not too much hassle at all!

His wife senses something is wrong with the house, but can't put her finger on it. Her husband dismisses these feelings of hers.

What a difference a little relatable perspective can make in your walk with God and in your fight against the challenges of purity in today's society.

With God you can do anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Even A Hint Of Lust shall be in our lives","review":"So whats this book about you want to ask, lust, simple as that, but the book goes deeper than that. It shows us every little hint of lust. So now your thinking this must be a guy's book, NO!, Girls lust too, but maybe you just don't know it. This book opens up a new door of getting rid of lust without throwing bible verses at you and saying that \\"it's bad\\". They show to get through it. It does have a section with some bible verses for you to remember in your times of struggle. It shows that a lot people deal with the same issues that people struggle with like masturbation, pornography, and lusting with your eyes with lots more but shows you no matter how hard they are going to bed, with Jesus it is possible, and then Jesus loves you and forgives. I recommend this book to all of you. For alot of this is on tons of peoples hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an odd book...","review":"The author claims that sex is ok but lust is the problem, basically saying that sex is tolerated by god as a mechanical function for procreation, but if you enjoy it then he gets mad.

God gets mad and turns into a rage filled monster when people enjoy sex or affection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lust not Sex is the problem","review":"Satan will use the same weakness over and over until we sober up and make every effort to please God with all our being...this was an easy read especially for someone who doesn't like to read as myself with the exception of hobby how to's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Joshua Harris, you'll love this.","review":"For any who are fans of Joshua's earlier two books, they will not find themselves disappointed with his third. Taking a different perspective, Joshua takes what would normally constitute a chapter in his earlier works and makes an entire book on the subject - and he carries it well. In true Joshua Harris style, it is complete with helpful anectodes, strategies, and guidelines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much common sense - some quirky notions","review":"I have to admit that I agreed with much of what Joshua has written in this book. I would recommend it to young poeple in my church youth group. However, as with all issues that are dealt with in books WE need to do the hard work of seeing if these things be so in the Bible. As one reviewer has complained I also would like to see some more indepth exegesis, but then many young poeple might not read it. After reading it I was a little confused as to the place of God's grace and the work of the Holy Spirit and our effort. Joshua needed to spend a little more time on that issue as I have found that a lack of clear teaching on this issue (sanctification) is what leads to the emotional problems that some of the reviewers have mentioned. I would recommend young poeple to read \\"The Enemy Within\\" by Kris Lungard to get another angle on the whole issue of indwelling sin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible approach to dealing with lust","review":"I started read Not Even a Hint yesterday, and ended up reading the entire book yesterday. It's only a two or three hour read, but provides some incredibly useful insights into dealing with the lust that we al feel as people. Being a male, I knew that this book would have a lot of insights that would speak directly to my struggles with lust, but what surprised me were his advice for females that he gives as well. The mere fact that lust wasn't just a male problem was new to me, primarily because I haven't talked to any females about it. The entire premise of this book is simply amazing. It offers insights on a subject that is certainly universal among men, and at least wide-spread among women. It's a must read for anyone who has ever struggled with lust of any form in their lives. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing read","review":"This book has changed my life. It has taught me to live purely using an approach I hadn't considered before; attacking sexual impurity by avoiding the things that trigger the impurity.I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking sexual purity, but especially to guys. Harris knows his stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precious little useful information","review":"I very rarely write reviews, but felt compelled to review this book. This book is basically useless. You will learn precious little to improve your tennis game.

I got a lot more out of Cross & Lindsey's Tecnical Tennis, from the same publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little something of nothing","review":"Should have been called, \\"Some biomechanical considerations in tennis technique\\". Even this suggests a bit more than this book actually has. No models, no physics (all existent models are incomplete and they are not worth mentioning, according to the author). One looking for forces, moments, conservation of energy, etc. would be totally disappointed. But then, so would be a six grader's tennis coach who skipped physics in high school, because there is nothing in this book he wouldn't know already.I regard it as pretty much useless, I don't even get what type of reader is the author targeting with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title was interesting, but the reading was disappointing.","review":"A lot of research was reviewed, and there is a good reference list. In my view, the tennis strokes have some basic guidelines that almost every professional tennis player follows. And those basic guidelines can be mechanically analyzed, with physical explanations. But you won't find this in this book, the analysis lacks depth.In the serve chapter you can read: \\"Coaches and players would love simple and easy answers to the questions of what is the best sequence and what is the most important joint motion in a flat serve. Unfortunately, the complexity of the body and individual differences make this very unlikely.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to Look Elsewhere","review":"I must say that I can follow any given technical manual but this book just does not motivate me to do so. The book is rather dull and requires work to follow, and I din not feel that it would be worthwhile to find out what was awaiting at the end of each chapter. It is rather thin, and tries to cover the topic of tennis mechanics, but in my opinion does a poor job.I am a solid 4.5 player and this book did not help me to fill in any missing holes required to move on to the next level. This book might be helpful to a 3.0 to 3.5 player who still need to see another perspective on understanding the mechanics of a tennis swing. There are much easier ways to achieve this, however. Lastly, the illustrations seemed distorted and this was really annoying to me. I would have rather seen a live model demonstrating these points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I may be old fashioned, but I like a book that has character development, and a plot. This book had mildly amusing anecdotes about a boy and his dog, but they were just strung together with no plot or theme.

The time-shifting narrative is difficult enough for a grown-up to follow, much less the 5th graders who were assigned this book. The stories were sweet, but as a book, the whole thing lacked any plot tension. It read more like a series of anecdotes than a story. I kept waiting for the plot to start.

It's great but who needs it? For a band that had a lack of greatest hits packages until 1990 the Moodies sure have made up for lost time. From 1990 to date the Moody Blues have had MANY greatest hits albums and, with a few exceptions, they all have the same songs. We've all heard \\"I know you're out there somewhere\\" or \\"Wildest Dreams\\" so there's little point in owning them again in another package. So, I suppose you'd like to know, why would a Moodies fan buy this CD? Well they have included several songs from the pre-Days of Future Past era and they kind of collect all of them together from different sources. If you want to hear the formation of this great band, and you don't have the album \\"Prelude\\" then buy this one.

I dont even think this album is going to make it to my collection; might become a coaster. Track 3 and 7 are the only real decent attempts at songs, the rest consists of random baffled beats with Blueprint talking over the top of it (yeah Im serious).

I had been waiting for him to come out with a true solo album, and I am not at all disappointed. The only thing I could ask for would be for more tracks. While he doesn't use the most complex beats or raps, the flow of the album is just amazing. He seems to be in perfect harmony with the beats and rhymes at all times. \\"Inner-City Native Son\\" is my favorite song on the album.

She can create such a marvellous chemistry between the H&H that half a page of a steamy scene makes you hot and bothered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Bragg story . . .","review":"This is an exciting and erotic story. I think Shoz Savage will continue to be my all-time favorite hero for some time to come.I've read several books in the Bragg series and, although I usually don't care for \\"westerns\\", I love this family.Put this one on your reading list--you'll either love Shoz or you'll hate him, but you can't be indifferent about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"definite sizzler","review":"now here's a fantasy to make a woman's wildest dreams come true & believe me mine are wild. would love to see more native stories from this author. how about contemporary. it's cold & snowy up here but this one'll keep you warm throught the long dark night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Hot To Put Down!","review":"This was the first Brenda Joyce book that I ever read and I LOVED IT!!

It started out with a good and fast pace, but then it turned into a lot of filler. I'll be honest, I expected so much more from this superb writer, but that's ok, I'm still a big fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was really good","review":"As a longtime fan of Brenda Joyce. I found this to be a great addition to her collection. Definitely worth reading. I loved the heroine and the hero here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny but very short","review":"This book is less than one hundred pages, in large print, with an odd page size. In other words, it's more a pamphlet than a book. For the price, I found the brevity very disappointing.However, the concent was extremely funny, and did teach me at least one rather delightful phrase I had never heard before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time","review":"Pubescent boys will find the book humorous. This old coot, however, finds it contrived and something of an insult to the fine art of profane conversation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest book I've read in years.","review":"This is the funniest book I've read in years. This year I'm giving copies to all my friends with open minds (and to a few narrow-minded people who need to lighten up).I picked up some great expressions I'd never heard before and scored 100% on the final exam at the end of the book, which is a classic in itself.The dialogues are hilarious, just the thing for aspiring actors to use as practice exercises.I'd love to see the author on \\"Politically Incorrect.\\" He'd fit right in.Maybe they'll make a movie of the book. After all, they made a movie about \\"Pi.\\" If they ever did make the movie, Bill Murray would be perfect as Sterling Johnson.I don't know how many times I've picked this book up and read passages aloud to friends. They are always delighted, although some pretend to be shocked.It's a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasional flashes of wit; otherwise, nothing new here","review":"I thought this was going to be a GREAT book, based on the title, but it's actually pretty lame. Probably real exciting reading for an eighth grader who is just starting out a good bad-word repertoire: trained professionals will need to look elsewhere for new and creative expletives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it for what it's worth","review":"The book is a good chuckle for a couple 30 minutes rides on the exercize bike.It's written in a very serious an authoritative tone. It writes about what the esteemed panel recommends for alternatives to sh*t and f*ck. It talks about the grammer of swearing. Seriously.Will it really teach anyone to swear? No - you should know this by now.Is it really aimed at teaching someone swearing jargon? No on that front too.Is it good humor for someone who asks their friends to pull their finger? Absolutely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so f*cking funny","review":"I must have a funny bone missing or something. This trite little book was a big yawn from start to finish. The only thing I can say in its favour is that, living and working in France as I do, it will be a little easier to explain some of the peculiarities of the English language to the natives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste A Cent On This Book!!!!!","review":"I thought that this book was going to be INCREDIBLE based on its title, as someone already stated. Now, I am a freshman in High School, and I hated this book!! I actually bought it! Can you believe that?! The Worst mistake ive EVER made! Dont get this book! no matter what!! Get something else if you're looking for humor. It doesnt even teach swear words properly. It teaches ordinary things everyone knows like *#$%, $@#$, and %*&#. This book is awful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good protection for a good price","review":"I am a stunt man and I use this product when taking falls from hits in fight choreography. It dose the job and keeps my back safe.

So if you are looking for a good back protector for a good price then this is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Blues Rock A+ Percussion/Keys","review":"Pretty cool Blues/Rock with Funk mixed in. All songs rock while maintaining a blues/cool/funky melody to them. Similar to the bluesy rock/funk of Deep Purple's \\"Come Taste the band\\" this late 70's release makes me laugh at what was popular at the time. It's also an example of why these guys still make rock music today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrring","review":"I certainly wasnt thrilled with album. This is a departure from the hard rock edge Deep Purple fans would appreciate. Lords talent isnt really apparent here...Ashtons vocals are flat (perhaps in good interesting-type-of-way)..Paice's percussion isnt really much to remember.Im listening to it now. Its dull. 70s rock diehards might enjoy it to kill time...or Deep Purple collectors might simply need to have it.Simply dull BritRock album from 1977, by some uninspired monsters of rock...reminds me of other mediocre releases by BBA (Jeff Beck, Tim Bogert, Carmine Appice) or BLT (Jack Bruce, ,L? ,Robin Trower). All these musicians had much better studio releases outside these 'powertrios'. When comparing BLT/Truce, BBA (Beck, Bogert, Appice) and PAL (Malice in Wonderland)...BLT is the most dissapointing, with PAL earning one star because it is so dull, and BBAs self titled being not all that bad with some good playing.I suggest listen before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with drippy teapot","review":"We drink a lot of tea and it seems most if not all of our teapots drip sometimes.

It is by far the best educational and entertaining video we own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment for toddlers","review":"My son (2.5) really enjoys these videos. They are bright and colorful, have interesting segments with a nice musical soundtrack, and best of all are understandable to a two year old. When my son watches other tapes, even quality shows like Barney or Arthur, I can tell that some concepts are over his head (things like learning responsiblity, dealing with divorce, etc.). This sometimes leaves him confused rather than entertained and relaxed. This problem does not happen with Maisy. These tapes are challenging enough to hold his interest time and time again, but simple enough for him to understand so that he really has fun with them and feels good about being able to follow the story. I highly recommend the entire series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mamie\\" is great!","review":"Our daughter Camille was just 18 months old when she became interested the video's cover. We were staying at a friend's house this summer, and his three-year-old had a copy. Camille immediately loved it. Since July, we have become the owners of four Maisy videos, a Maisy doll, and six Maisy books. \\"Mamie\\" is the name Camille, who can't quite say 'Maisy' yet, has given to her. She's learned several words, colors and objects, and loves to sing along to the upbeat songs! Although the omniscient white, male narrator who speaks for the characters (who speak in oddly muffled, childlike tones)bugs me a bit, Camille couldn't care less. A great pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maisy Crazy","review":"This was our first Maisy. I purchased it early on, and my child did not show interest until about 18 mos. Now, we're Maisy crazy.

Product I recieved looks ok, have not used it yet but it does look rather cheaply made, the pack will probably not stand up to packing it full for more than a day. It is not what was described. It is one Compartment (no sep. compartment for sleeping bag only a zipper at the bottom for access to the main compartment) pockets for drink will not hold average nalgene, no rain cover as advertised.

It's only 2 metal rods that does not give the person using this back pack enough uppper support, so the back sags when it's on. The material and stiching is poor. I used this for a 2 day hike, all the stitching started to rip apart at the seams. The plastic pieces holding the straps that are curcial to the person who wears the backpack snapped. I had to jerry rig the backpack just to make it through the second day of hiking. I can't believe that some made for the wilderness can be suck a piece of junk. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep growing, Mike","review":"Front-man Viola is light years ahead of most other pop-60s influenced melodists. Not only are his vocals strong and appealing, his tunes are airy and unforced. This latest record has an unprententious down home feel. But Viola's introversion here, while warm and surely endearing to his family and friends, is specific without being universal. All the sweat that went into this latest album and yet you can tell why this album hasn't quite taken off. Most of the lyrics reach in without reaching out. He refers to himself in the third person several times (my name is also Mike and I'm not still not interested). Nevertheless, it's worth buying and you have to think they're just an album away from the big one. I'm rooting for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, delectable charms.","review":"This is the very first Candy Butchers album I've ever listened to, and for the first few listens I thought it was slight, white, and plain.Then the charm of the lyrics, about romantic wins and losses and masturbation and addiction and detox and mental and physical anguish and Kiss Alive 2 and Bennie & the Jets, poured sweetly through the infectious pop music, based in 70s pop piano style I in no way jones for.But it works, here. This album actually changes my mood, my feelings, gives me hope about being a screw up, makes me love my friends more, makes me want to play it over and over again.People constantly use the \\"Angry Young Man\\" school comparisons, a subgenre I adore but avoid of late due to the pretensions of its originators, but this album is in a class all by itself. It's not angry, it's reaching for grace and acceptance, but there had to be a whole lot of pain experienced to make music this lifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viola-sweet as candy","review":"As a 60 yr. old male music lover. I love finding new music as there is soooo much out there now that I just don't like. I love melodies and esp. harmonizing. After listening to some samples I ordered it. It is currently in my car in the cd player. Why dosen't this get airplay? This guy is such a good songwriter. Very catchy tunes and fun to sing to. There really isn't a bad song in the bunch. They don't sound repetitive. Tracks one and two played and I was in heaven. Another really good song with some wonderful harmonies is \\"SUPERKID\\". Let's just say this cd is \\"SUPER\\"!

Now, one would assume that you'd get brighter light but shorter battery life with the xenon and vice-versa. Not the case. The center/xenon bulb is much weaker than the LEDs. Makes no sense. So, realistically you have the choice of quite bright bluish LEDs or a not so bright, more yellow xenon bulb. Unless I just got a bum flashlight, I'd recommend say up a little bit and getting something like the Streamlight Twin-Task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition","review":"We bought this toy when my son was about a year old.

It doesn't do much at all, and the sounds it makes are too easily triggered, and annoying. I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for kids, bad for parents","review":"My little boy (2 1/2) loved this toy when he first got it two months ago. My biggest complaint with the toy is that it has such obnoxious sound effects that go off with the slightest little movement. (Really, I think that sometimes it might go off just by looking at it the wrong way!) I probably wouldn't keep it around if my boy didn't like it so much. I suppose most toys are noisy, and most don't bother me, but this one does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"This CD is excellent for lovers of many music types. Its got elements of funk, ska, and 311-ish rap. Some songs sound a little like sublime, some like other things. The band's story is also incredible too. They came back after losing a key member a few years ago. If you get the CD listen to Hoffering and read the insert and you'll know what I'm talking about. You can't go wrong with this album. My personal favorites are Pussycat Club and Hoffering, but I really like the whole CD. trust me, get it. I hope they get big so they'll make another CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great by Francis!","review":"In \\"Whip Hand\\" Francis returns with a character first introduced in \\"Odds Against\\" Sid Halley.

There are about five selections - maybe 20 minutes altogether. Two are 'God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen' from the same concert.

It has three different positions and is VERY easy to change around. I think the designer is brilliant! My 7-month old is going back and forth between the lay down and sit-and-play positions right now. I have no doubt that he will love the toy in it's third stage-- stand up and play. The only thing I would change has already been mentioned: the volume is very loud. There are two volume choices: loud and very loud. No big deal, though, I just muffled the speaker with tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing!","review":"I decided to put this toy on my baby registry because of the great reviews, average review has given this toy five stars. There's a reason why, it truly is a great purchase. This was one of the few toys my son enjoyed when he was just 5 weeks old, he is now 5 months old and is still mesmerized by the lights and music. He loves to rattle and kick the toys which helps develop his senses and gives him a good workout! This toy keeps him busy for about a good half hour sometimes more or less. I do recommend using a baby pillow or a soft matt."},{"rating":"1","title":"The exception","review":"I bought this toy for my baby after reading all the great reviews and I guess we are the exception.

Aside from that, I found the music pretty annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Toy EVER!!!!","review":"My daughter absolutely loves this toy. We also use this toy w/ a bouncer.

Now that my daughter is walking, she'll play with the toy in its upright position, then walk away to play with something else and trip over its legs. Since we have wood floors, she's had many falls, the most recent of which caused her to have a fat lip for a week. The toy now sits legless on the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"My six month old daughter loves this toy. She very quickly mastered the art of kick-starting the music.She loves everything about it. But there is one thing I don't really care for, which made me give it four stars instead of five. It's pretty lightweight, so when my daughter starts kicking at it and grabbing the toys, the thing slides all over the place, even when it's on the carpet. I find I have to keep adjusting it for her.But considering it was only $20, it was certainly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I bought this toy for my son when he was just a little bundle of joy. It was a great entertainment, and I even noticed he had a favorite song.

(and my daughter even loves it at age 4)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Versitile - Even for Tummy Time!","review":"At five months old, this is one of my son's very favorite toys and it has been for about the last two months. Every time he gets bored, we find a new way to play with it.Besides the obvious ways to use this toy, we have also:- arranged the keyboard perpendicular to the floor so that he can use it in his bouncy seat- taken off the legs entirely so that he can sit in our lap and play with it (he likes to sit, but can't on his own yet)- taken off the legs and used it on the floor for tummy time (his current favorite)There are also three musical levels (infant, sitter, and toddler) and two musical types for six different settings. We mix them up for variety. Some of them are more annoying than others, but none are two bad considering how much enjoyment he gets out of this toy.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for 0-12 months","review":"The Classical Chorus Gym has been a favorite of our son since he was born. It extended his tummy times as he tried to look up at the stars, helped him strengthen his legs as he kicked at the sun, moon and stars, and now helps him with his coordination as he sits and spins the ball inside the sun. This toy never fails to put a smile on his face. Once he is pulling up, I'm sure he will enjoy playing music on the piano, as well. It has been the best toy we've had since about his second month. Because of his interest in the dangling sun, moon and stars, he never seemed to enjoy it in the lowered position. But he does sit at it in its upright position and reaches up to push the piano keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"No major complaints - Great Toy","review":"My son is about 4 months and he loves it. Loves banging on the keys. He plays with it so much sometimes he falls asleep under it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grow-with-me toy","review":"My son loves this toy. It was purchased from my baby registry and I am glad I requested it. It took him about 6 weeks until he was interested in this, but babies don't do much until then anyway. He loved to lay under and watch the toys hanging down, then he learned to reach for them. When he learned to sit up he loved to sit and pound at the keys. Now that he's 8 months and crawling all over the place and pulling himself up he makes his way back to this toy all day long. It keeps him busy. He loves to pound on it and he gets all excited at the music. My only complaint is that it moves when he pushes on it, which isn't a problem now, but was when he was first learning to pull himself up. But overall, this is a great simple toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your baby will love it!","review":"This Classical Chorus Gym is a great product at every stage. My son loves it! It plays 10 different classical or nursery melodies while the stars light up. You can even set the music to play continuously for up to 10 minutes. When he gets bored with it, I put it agaist the wall so that he can practice his kicking. The keyboard also adjusts to 3 positions. It is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful first piano for any little one. My daughter received this as a gift when she was 6 months old. She's now 14 months and still plays with it everyday. She went from using this toy as an infant, to sitting up with it, and now she's standing and playing. I love this toy because my daughter can play it as a piano or she can push the keys to hear a familiar tune. An overall great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a little loud","review":"We received this gift for my 4 month old daughter for Christmas. She seems to enjoy watching the stars light up as the music plays. I can let her lie on the floor for about ten minutes and the toy will entertain her. The only complaint that I have is the fact that even on the lowest level, the music is so loud. My husband and I think that is why she only tolerates the toy for so long. We have placed tape over the speakers to help muffle the sound. I really do like this toy, but I think Fisher Price should have provided this toy with a sound dial so that the parent could monitor the sound level. All in all a great toy but a little to loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Loves It","review":"My baby is only 13 weeks and loves this toy. He is fascinated by the lights and music. It will actually run for 10 minutes, which is longer then a lot of other toys on the market. It is easy to change from one position to the next.Right now I put him in his bouncy chair and the toy in position two and slide it over his legs so he can look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"My daughter loved this toy. This toy was my daughter's favorite toy between the ages of 3-6 months (now she loves the Jumparoo). At first she just laid under it and stared at the lights and listened to the music until she was able to reach and grab. This replaced her Gymini which she never really cared for. She loves to kick the keys with her feet as well. She gets so excited when she plays with it that she kicks it away from her. The only negative I can say is that I wish it had rubber feet so it wouldn't scoot away on the floor when she gets excited. I end up putting the legs in my shoes on the floor so it stays put."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy to grow with your baby!","review":"I am very impressed with this toy and the way that it holds my son's attention. He loves to kick the shapes and hear the music play. The lights and sounds are very stimulating, yet not irritating like some toys can be. The gym easily converts for older children to grow with their ability. I would definitely recommend this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy so far","review":"Our daughter is 2 months old, and she has had this toy for a couple of weeks now. I can already see her developing! In the beginning she was hitting the hanging toys by default, since she was waving her arms from the excitement induced by the music. Now it seems that even if she accidently hits one of the rattles, for example, she actually keeps her hand on it to continue hearing it rattle. I am curious to see how she enjoys it when she grows. Great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I give it to everyone","review":"I love this piano because it plays really pretty music and my son has loved it since he was a baby.

It is a great, great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful toy!!","review":"I did not have this toy at first but after watching a friend's baby playing with it, I went out and bought one for my 5 mnth. old.

He would cry until we put him uder the singing stars. He would watch in amazement. He is now 6 months old and sitting and we converted it to Stage 2 and he loves it in a whole new way! It is a super durable toy with a nice variety in music. It is simple for him to use and entertaining. It's a great price for all teh use you will get out of this item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing - every baby should have one","review":"This is just \\"the toy.\\" I received this as a shower gift but when my baby was born, he was scared witless of it. After about 5 months, he fell in love with it and used it daily.

He likes to play with both the keys and the hanging toys, but we usually turn off the sound when he plays with the hanging toys because they tend to make a little too much noise. Probably my biggest complaint about this gym is that it slides when he plays with it. There needs to be a gripping surface on the bottom of the legs so it doesn't slide away from him whether he plays with his hands or feet. It's a fun toy that he likes but there are definitely a few changes that would improve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter and I both like it!","review":"She loves to pull up on it and play her star piano!

A friend has it and I saw how much her daughter likes it so we gave it a try to and it was the best thing we've ever bought. My friend's daughter just started crawling and is slowly trying to walk and even works with that, she'll pull herself up on the toy and try to play with it as a piano. For my 4-month-old she'll lay there, touch it and kick the keys to make it play music and to make the lights come on. the melodies are cute and not annoying, it has a volume control with low being loud enough but not too loud. Great toy from birth until they toddler age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"We've used this toy since my son was born - he is now 10 months old. The classical chorus gym gets daily use. When our son was a newborn we'd lay next to him and play the music as we sang or hummed along.

This is by far the best baby toy we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a symphony","review":"This is a great toy I purchased it for my two month old and my two year old loves to play with it also.

Maybe long fingernails would help?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great label maker","review":"Its our second Brother label maker and we really like it. I can't compare it to other brands but the PT-80 is reliable and versatile. Its a big label maker so if you need something really compact, it may not be the choice for you. It feels solid but not terribly heavy. It prints in multiple sizes and has a large number of symbols. The only annoying thing is that its a bit awkward to access very uncommon symbols but I rarely use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Light Label Use","review":"This works great. However, there are 2 things I don't like about it. 1) too much waste of label before and after printing and these cartridges are not cheap. 2) it always tells me the battery needs to be replaced even with new batteries in it. I just keep using it until it actually dies then replace the batteries.This is great for light labeling. Buy something better for heavy use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prints nice labels, battery life is abysmal","review":"While this prints truly nice, sharp labels I would not recommend it because it needs fresh batteries every few labels. At first I thought that it was the batteries, but I've repeatedly tried fresh, new batteries and get a few labels out and it shuts off, needing new batteries.If I do manage to get through the labels that I need at one time, I know that I'll have to replace them before using it the next time.

When I got the PT-80, I found there was no where to plug in the adapter. So, I returned it and ordered the PT-1280 instead. Unfortunately, the PT-1280 didn't have great user comments, so I hope it's okay (haven't gotten it yet), but at least it will work with the adapter I bought.

I remember reading a review where the person complained that it's very hard to peel the backing off of the labels - well, the P-touch has a slot on the top of the unit that you can use to get the backing to peel off a little.

I thought I could combat this flaw with rechargeable batteries, but in the end it didn't work out. You end up getting stuck with a dead device while you wait for 6 hours for your batteries to recharge (Rechargeable batteries still loose their charge when they are not being used). I'm not saying you can't manage your battery usage and make this device work for you, but I will say that I don't have the time to worry if the batteries in my labeler are up to the task.Eventually I had an engineering buddy solder a power cord to the device so I wouldn't have to worry about the batteries anymore. Yes it's a hack, but it was cheaper than buying another labeler. If you're already looking to buy a $20/30 dollar labeler, I'd recommend getting one with an optional power cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but does have one quirk.","review":"The Good1) Execellent product, the labels stick on to almost anything and they will stay on and legible for years.

Just Turn Off and On again and the message goes away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This item prints out nice lettering, tape is not that sticky.

It goes through batteries like no other product I've ever owned. It's as if they did it on purpose! The fact that it doesn't even have an option for a dc input makes it even worse. I've already spent more on batteries for this thing than I have on the item itself. Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"drains batteries","review":"I hate this label maker.

I thought date-stamping some food would be a good idea, but I just grab a pen now.I couldn't get it to print, at first, and read the manual completely trying to figure out the problem. It turns out the back of the printer has to in place before it will print. Clever, but it would have been nice to include that in the trouble-shooting section!I had to read the manual to figure out how to get it to feed labels--it just shouldn't be that difficult to use.I've used it to print maybe a dozen labels in 3 weeks and the batteries are already shot! That just seems ridiculous to me.In reality, it seems this printer will be a lot more expensive to use than I ever expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy at any price","review":"While the P-Touch has a number of nice, handy features, reliability and durability aren't among them. Mine initially worked quite well for very light home office duty, but after a few months it dropped dead. I made certain to switch the power off regularly and remove the batteries when it was not in use. [...]. This item is made in China, so I guess I should have considered the poor quality of goods made there when I purchased this. Suffice to say if the manufacturer doesn't stand behind their own product then this is NOT a brand you should be buying. There are other brands that make label makers and I would STRONGLY suggest looking at their products first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Junk","review":"This is the most annoying piece of junk I have bought in ages. The instructions tell you to feed the tape before use. What they don't say is you have to type up a label before the feed button will work. I took the first one back because I thought it was defective. Once I figured this out on the second one I printed some labels. The big problem is peeling the backing off the labels. There is a peeler slot on the thing but pictures in the instructions are so small and bad they are useless, and following the text instructions doesn't work. Peeling off the backing by hand requires the patience of a saint and the dexterity of a fly tying fly fisherman. Its OK if you just want to label your stereo, but if you need to label a few hundred files this thing is a joke. You will have to spend hours coaxing the backing off the label tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Label it All!!!!","review":"Label it all.....These things are so affordable and easy to operate that it blows my mind thinking we didnt always use them around the house.

It is easy to use and does a good job making the labels I want to make with the right customization. However, it is a battery vampire. I have had it for five years now and no matter how recently I've bought the batteries, it blasts right through them. This most recent time I had bought fresh batteries from the store (4 AAA) and put them in, and before I finished typing the name of the first label, the battery indicator started flashing that it was time to replace the batteries. There is no A/C option, so there's no way to mitigate the damage this little wonder will do to your supply of AAA's.

One thing I also love is the dictionary covers a lot of tangentially related teams that can frequently come up in an insurance context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money; filled with non-insurance-related terms","review":"A better name for this product would be the Long-Winded Financial Terms Dictionary. Its pages are filled with non-insurance-related definitions for accounting, legal, and other financial-service terms. Worse yet, several key insurance-related terms that have come into existence in, say, the past century are not included. The only thing I have ever used this book for is to cite the author's claim that U.S. citizens spend more money on insurance than any other type of expenditure - but that occurs in the preface. The terms themselves are unhelpful and incomplete, and the book's pages are stuffed with filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Blackberry?","review":"This is NOT Blackberry tea. There is no Blackberry in the ingredients. It does not taste like blackberry. There used to be blackberry in the ingredients, and it used to taste like blackberry, but no longer. Lipton changed something, but a call to them resulted in being called back by a VERY rude and curt \\"specialist\\" who stated Lipton is a reputable company. Really? Then why did their Blackberry tea used to list blackberry flavor (and taste like it), but the current tea has cherry and blueberry concentrate (and smells/tastes like cherry), and no blackberry listed in the ingredients. No difference in package graphics or UPC, just the listed ingredients. I have an \\"old\\" box, and now 12 boxes of this new blackberry tea that I won't be consuming.If you want cherry/blueberry flavored tea, go for it. If you want blackberry, look elsewhere.Rates zero stars if that were possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product - just what I wanted, but.....","review":"Lipton's Blackberry tea has been discontinued. My wife uses this flavor in her ice tea mix, so I went looking for some. Good Ole Amazon had a source for it.My only complaint is the merchant had it priced about double the normal retail price. But, I ordered it anyway. I complained about the price and was offered a return & full refund.

There was a slight aroma of berry, not necessarily blackberry, and NO flavor of any berry. The actual tea was very weak and bland. I like blackberry flavor that has that wonderful luscious jammy blackberry flavor. This tea has none of that, merely a light scent of generic berry. I would not recommend this tea to anyone who wants a rich flavorful blackberry tea or any tea for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!!, A great story on Audio CD","review":"Star Wars Tales of the Jedi is finally out on audio CD it tells the story of the jedi knights 4000 years before Star Wars Episode 4. Star Wars Tales of the Jedi & Star Wars Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith are a must read. These stories are heavily referred to when playing Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic & Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords. This is a great story to listen to and sounds even better on audio CD, I'm glad the publisher released it to audio CD this no doubt is a timeless classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much testosterone in your lightsaber. . .","review":"Anyone who is familiar with what a Jedi knight is supposed to stand for will grasp early on that whoever wrote 'Tales of the Jedi' has read more Conan novels than Zen philosophy. Constant threats such as 'back off or I'll cut you in half with my lightsaber' would seem more appropriate in the pages of any sword and sorcery pulp novel, but in the Star Wars universe, being spouted by a Jedi (even a novice) is so ridiculous as to make the listening unbearable. The only redeeming quality this cassette has to offer is the voice of the old Jedi master, who some may recognize as the Well Manicured Man from X-Files, who puts in a splendid performance despite atrocious dialogue. Don't bother with this one. Read Zahn's books over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this item for a number of reasons. It's one of the poorest Star Wars genre stories I've listened to. Readings typically add a lot to the stories in my opinion, but this one made a poor story even worse.

Wandering the galaxy while trying to hide from his past, Ulic ends up becoming the teacher for Vima Sunrider, Nomi's daughter. While blind to the Force, Ulic trains Vima as best he can while Nomi and others track him down. In the end, Ulic must prove that he has the heart of a Jedi and teach others not to live in the past or to hate. The artwork is well done in this comic. I like how Ulic looks, especially. While it is very short, it gives Ulic fans reason to be happy as we see that he has overcome his past troubles.

The first half I managed to do without getting totally lost, but as I approached the other half, the author worked out equations without even bothering to explain how she reached the answer. Especially the geometry part, which is super frustrating.Why call it Algebra for dummies when it's clearly NOT for beginners.

Sadly, that's precisely what this book does. In one breath the author is insulting your intelligence: \\"Operations in algebra are nothing like operations in hospitals\\". (Oh really?) In the next, she is using technical terms without first explaining them, placing some steps out of order, and entirely skipping other steps. To make matters worse, the explanations she does provide are often so convoluted that they raise more questions than they answer.If you've been frustrated in your attempts to learn algebra and are looking for someone to explain things in a no-nonsense, understandable, step-by-step manner, this is NOT the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the dummies","review":"Very helpful, wish I bought this book sooner!

In my opinion this book is poorly laid out, it uses examples that would require you to know equations that aren't even explained until later chapters. Additionally very large numbers are used in many of the examples and practice questions. Why on earth if you are teaching the basics would you use such large numbers?

I bought a new filter and used EPA-certified free chlorine test strips (the kind used in commercial kitchens to meet health department codes) to test the amount of chlorine this filter removed. There was no difference between untreated tap water and supposed filtered water from this unit. Water from my Brita pitcher filter by comparison tested negative for chlorine. After doing more research online, I've found that many shower filters are ineffective despite claims, mainly because of water temperature and pressure that doesn't allow the water to slowly filter through the chamber like a water pitcher filter does. I'm still looking for a better filter(will check out Vitamin C shower filters next), but this product is really just an expensive and sharp looking shower head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lifespan","review":"The filter filled up in less than a month, slowing water pressure to a trickle.

I had to use a knife to make a cutout in the proper place, which inelegantly solved that problem. Another problem occurs, however, with how the glove on the \\"flipper\\" is attached to the body of the case: with a very strong elastic which prevents the flipper from closing firmly--it doesn't take much of a jar for the flipper to extend, all on its own.This case may be adequate for the A460, but it is not appropriate for the S105."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Tool Also","review":"I was not aware a special tool was made for these ends, that has a cutting device when crimping - cut the extended wires off at one time, I push the wire through then cut off access wires then must pull back the wire back a little into the RJ45, then CRIMP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless without the special tool","review":"Not clamshell, not at all.

I'm sure the EZRJ45 tool designed specifically for these is quicker and easier, but my technique (as some others have mentioned) is to cut the wires close to the end and then move the connector outward until the wires are no longer proud of the end. Crimping it using a standard tool makes it nice and tidy.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand them . . .","review":"Have never been able to make so much as one Cat 6 cable with these things. Can never get the wires to go through their designated holes without bunching up and I have tried seemingly everything. Instead, I have wound up using them to make Cat 5 cables and they work quite well for doing that. Have to give it one star, because even though I found a use for them it was not the purpose for which they were initially purchased.I have had great success with the Cat 6 connectors that include the little black plastic insert that is placed into the Cat 6 connector. That solution works well for making Cat 6 cables and, in my personal opinion, I would recommend readers pursue that solution instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works without the trimming crimp tool","review":"Recommended. And they work fine *without* the EZ RJ45 crimp tool. Just trim the loose wires right up against the end with a utility knife. Then the connector will slide all the way into the slot. Or you can pull the wires back a bit before crimping. Either way works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it - one star is too high a rating","review":"All I can say is learn the right way to do this. I've been using these things for too long and I'm tired of them. My hands hurt, my eyes hurt and my patience has worn thin. I used to make cables in 30 seconds or less using regular Cat5/Cat6 heads and now I'm spending way too much time.The idea is simple, but the flexibility of the wires makes this a tough sell for me. Feeding one by one is difficult when the wires are so flexible.To make sure you have enough lead for the \\"one-by-one\\" method, you need to cut at least three inches deep or more just to feed it properly. THEN, after you've fed the line correctly, any resistance on the slot and the wire bends and you've got to pull it out, straighten it out again, and then feed it again.In short, it's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Bonded-Pair Cat6 cable","review":"Great Idea, but trying to feed untwisted bonded-pair cat6 wires [Beldin 7851A] through the connector I find doesn't quite work as advertised.

I can weather WFB's verbosity, but there has to be some meat...to go along with the large wine cellar he packs aboard.

Sometimes looking alot more like a theatrical release than a TV movie, THE LIGHTNING INCIDENT is one not to be missed.

Manitas plays to the sound of his own drummer and his playing, though not flamenco, is still exciting to hear as he offers his own interpretations of the great Andalusian art form. Jose Reyes and son Manero display their talents as singers on this recording, and the final track, \\"Twist Flamenco\\", is a driving, fiery rumba that borrows its lyrics from a popular calypso tune of many years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite disappointing","review":"If you think that because this is: 1) reduced from $50 and 2) made by Seiko, that it is going to me a well made classy item then you may be disappointed. It looks OK but as soon as you handle it it feels quite cheap & flimsy. Plastic can be engineered well but this hasn't been. On mine the front flap does not stay closed.To look on the plus side this is the lightest & thinnest travel clock I could find so if that is important for you then this could be for you.However for me I was hoping the extra cost was going to give a better made clock - and it didn't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seiko Travel Alarm","review":"I bought this neat looking little clock for my husband who simply wanted a way to look at the time at night, when he awoke. I read the description of the small clocks on here and owing to the Seiko brand name, I chose this one. In the Amazon online description of the clock, it was described as having \\"Lumibrite Arabic hour markers\\" and I took that to mean that my husband could glance at the clock face in the dark of night and the clock hands would be visible enough for him to be able to quickly see the time... Not so. We darkened the room and couldn't see the hands. We tried leaving the clock in the dark for several hours to see if it needed \\"time to adjust\\". Still no visible hands. We gave up on trying and have decided to use it as simply a travel alarm. I might also add that for $38, I thought I was buying a substantial little clock. While this might be true of the clock mechanism, the clock case is very light and had the feel of a much less costly travel alarm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This One","review":"I was so excited to get this alarm.

Nothing good ever comes from alcohol, and that message is not being made by such a toy. I used to enjoy the Simpson's but I would NEVER allow my child to watch it, partly because of the Bar scenes and poor examples elsewhere in its humor. Kids are not capable of viewing that humor and NOT seeing it as a role model for what to do in life, and we ALL (whether we have kids or not) need to take responsbility in this realiziation.Now, a play action toy comes out and some think it is OK because it wasn't really MEANT for children, yet there is an age 5 and up clearance on it. We need to tell our children to avoid alcohol and all associated with frequenting the bar scene, not market kids and TRAIN them to act out the worst of our society.

I wrote my own article comparing Linux to Windows and finally decided it was time to get some more history of GNU/Linux and how it came to be. This book fit the bill. It goes into great detail on Stallman, who created the GNU General Public License and the GNU Operating System which started it all, and why he did so. It does a great job of following Stallman's life and the development of the GPL and other accomplishments of Stallman. It also does a great job of introducing Linus Torvalds and how he contributed the Linux kernel which was the missing piece to the GNU Operating System by Stallman, to form what we use today, GNU/Linux or more commonly called just Linux.

We're warned in the very beginning that the speaker might, at times, be a bit imperfect: repetetive, full of himself, prone to get lost in details. But the first chapter shows him, despite these short-comings, to be fascinating. Nonetheless, in the chapters that follow, he turns out to be every bit as insufferable as we'd been told in that first page.Each chapter is filled with mind-numbing details of construction projects, only relieved, at times, with brief passages that are more interesting.

The musical numbers themselves I found forgettable, and it's unfortunate that they decided to release this project instead of a CD of the show's musical numbers (a la \\"Simpsons in the Key of Springfield\\").

As much as i love flamencos' great guitarists [Paco de Lucia, Sabicas, Serranito, Ramon Montoya, Nino Ricardo, Diego Del Gastor, Tomatito, etc...] master-full technique & compas- not one of them burn with the strength of emotion found on this CD.

Heard it in B&N one night, and had the songs stuck in my head all week, which finally caused me to go back to the store to buy it.I haven't taken it out of my cd player since I brought it home, and I doubt you'll be able to either. If you like Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos, and the like? You'll adore Casey Stratton. His voice is haunting and so beautiful... Just give this CD a listen, and I can guarantee you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Me","review":"I first heard Casey's music a year and half before I was able to get my hands on an album. A YEAR AND A HALF before I was able to hear his voice (and incredible lyrics) again. But, miracle of all miracles, when I came out of this period of withdrawal I was also able to hear him play live. I've heard many incredible performances (from Willie Nelson to the Buzzcocks) and never have I been more impressed. His music is at once intimate and unbelievable, close to home and out of this world.I can honestly say that I know Standing at the Edge forward and backwards (and admit to singing along to it loudly and often off key)and am still just as impressed as the first time I heard it, perhaps more. He is a true artist and craftsman and his album is some of the most original and meaningful music I've heard in a long time.Pick up this album, I promise you won't regret it and I know I can't forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There aren't enough words to say!","review":"Casey Stratton's album \\"Standing At the Edge\\" is definitely a must have. His voice is amazing, and he also writes his own songs and plays the piano, violin, cello, and guitar. In an industry full of so called \\"artists\\" that have to lip sing and couldn't write their own lyrics if they tried, Casey Stratton shows true talent that is hard to find. His lyrics are so deep and expressive. He has had outstanding reviews in Billboard, USA Today, and various newspapers from all around the country. I think its hilarious that someone would say his album is not a good one and that all his songs sound the same. Obviously that person, Jason, has never listened to the album. I'd like to see him try to make an album, since he seems to have no idea what the word TALENT means. Casey Stratton's album is fabulous so go out and buy one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow in michigan!!","review":"i just saw casey in concert, and he is amazing. honestly from first appearance i didn't know what i was getting myself into, but as soon as he started singing he blew me away. i immediately bought the cd, and i can't stop listening to it. each song brings a new, and different emotion to the surface. if you buy one cd, this is definetly the one i would reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"\\"Standing at the Edge\\" is an amazing debut CD from Casey Stratton.

Nothing new here...","review":"I keep seeing all these user reviews saying that Casey's music is so different and refreshing, etc, etc. The truth is, there are plenty of Tori Amoses and Sarah McLachlans running around doing this exact thing...the ONE unique thing here is that these sounds are coming out of a man. Say that he has awesome range and I point you to the Buckleys who had the largest known range belonging to a male voice. The thing about them is they still sounded MALE when singing in the upper ranges. Casey does not...he sounds out-and-out feminine and that's nothing but creepy to me. If you like Tori and Sarah, you'll probably like this, but really, there's nothing original here."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 different songs or 1 really long boring 60 minute song","review":"This is NOT the best cd of this year.

After spotting Casey's appearance on the CBS Early Show (by a total fluke, I might add), I became instantly intoxicated with his music. After buying the CD, I can fervently say that my thoughts on music will never be the same. Casey's songs and music are uplifting, heartbreaking, soaring, sweeping...I could go on and on. Whatever the case, this album will make you *feel*. I can't remember ever being so inspired to just live life. I'm not sure why, but that's how this CD affected me. It's breathtaking and magnificent...buy this CD and play it for your friends, your family, your lover. They will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting Edge","review":"Casey is among the most gifted songwriters that have ever graced the radiowaves. His voice is revolutionary and the palpable emotion behind every song takes on a life of it's own. The songs are incredible. It is so refreshing to see someone with TRUE, REAL talent release an album on a major record label. Standing at the Edge is a beautiful metaphor for his emotional edginess on the album (reflecting the start of a new life) and for the fact that he IS the edge...cutting edge music that will transform the music industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another too-soft brush","review":"Waaaaay too soft.

But to our suprise we were pregnant again. I didn't want to buy another piece of furniture for our kitchen, so I purchased the Hippo. We LOVE it! It's easy to breakdown. Doesn't take up any space. Plus we can take it to restaurants. So our third child won't have to sit in the germ filled ones provided by the restaurant. I highly recommend this chair. Our little boy is actually a part of dinner and not stuck in the corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for smaller kitchens and those with islands","review":"This is an ideal space-saving solution for small kitchens. We bought this for our 7-month old and he loves being in the center of the action. Our only complaint is that the extension arms aren't adjustable -- so our island countertop ledge isn't super deep and therefore there is a few inch gap between the countertop edge and where the chair/seat starts. I got around this by buying the Kiddopotamus rubber place mat with catcher lip that hangs down and catches most of what he drops. Other than that, it's really easy to clean, seems comfortable and is really easy to install, take along to family's houses, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product","review":"We loved this product from the start, until it started to fail. The mechanism that allows you to remove the chair from the table kept getting tighter and tighter on one side. Eventually, it would not budge and the chair had to be sawed off our table. I contacted the manufacturer, Chicco, and they gladly shipped me another chair. Sadly, 4-5 months later, the new chair they sent us did the same thing. Now I have another chair stuck on my table.It is very disappointing because we love the product otherwise. It is great having our daughter sit at the table with us. I also love the low back on the chair because it makes a great hair-styling chair. The back is too high on the high chair and I have difficulty getting at my daughter's hair to put it in pigtails and trim her bangs.Like I said, it is too bad because the concept is great, but the design is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you fold this chair up??","review":"My Husband and I got this chair as a gift for our baby shower. It is a really neat chair, but we can't figure out how to fold it up. Anyone have any ideas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"Looked at many highchairs and many just take up too much room. We love this chair! Very easy to assemble. Easy to put away with minimal space required when you have a small kitchen area. Easy to wash once you get the hang of it. The hippos with the grip on the bottom are not just useful but really cute. The chair keeps your child very close to you as well as the table. Have not use it for restaurants (we use a floppy seat). So we have nothing but good things to say about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS CHAIR!!","review":"I researched these types of chairs before I bought this one. I was a little hesitant because most of the reviews state it is hard to 'take along' anywhere because it isn't convenient to fold up. After purchasing this myself, I have found that once you learn how to take it apart, it fits nicely in the carry bag it came with and is really pretty convenient. I do agree, however, (the reason for four stars instead of five) that it doesn't work at a lot of places due to the fact that it must be used with a four-legged table. I have found that even some four-legged tables are a little unstable with it.All-in-all, I am very happy with it and my daughter really seems to enjoy sitting right there with us at the table. She is 14 months and I just purchased it for her first birthday. I wish I would have researched it long before because she would have liked it much sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infection Control","review":"Great for eating out!!!

He is 6 months old and he LOVES sitting in this chair. It is more sturdy than the regular highchair we have and I will probably never use it again.

But since she's able to move around much more, we've graduated her to a highchair to contrain her from reaching for other things. CAREFUL - is your child is jumpy and active like mine, you may want to consider a high chair because Catherine reached for everything and shook the table alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hippo Hookon","review":"This is cleverly designed infant seat that attaches to the table and does not require a chair. It is simple to set up, and easy to fold and store in its own bag for carrying. When it's attached to a table, it is sturdy and allow the sitting infant to be close enought to be fed from the table.It requires a sturdy table (rounded or square)and that the child be able to sit easily and meet the weght requirements.

I am sorry that this has happened and my daughter was in tears over it.

The only addition I can make is about the quality of the recording. Each disc sounds very clear and detailed, with a natural-sounding hall ambience that never interferes with the sound of the piano. This set offers sound quality similar to a full-priced set from one of the major labels. Also, Klara Wurtz's technique does not compromise the music. She captures the spirit of each piece. The music is light, agreeable, and very satisfying to listen to. I haven't enjoyed a boxed set this much since since I purchased the Beaux Arts Trio's collection of Beethoven Piano Trios!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sensitive interpretations","review":"The low price of these recordings is not in keeping with the talent of performer.

Nice to see Carrella throw some barbs at religion (sarcasm by me) McBain writes books that can be speed read or skimmed. Actually, one positive: EM does try to get some \\"thinking\\" into some of the characters. By the way a black would never buy dope from a white guy in a white guy's neigborhood--neutral ground at the minimum. Glad a certain person died at the end: gave the book a tinge of grit.

Granted, had the movie been better, I might not have paid as much attention to the music. Still, every song on this CD works so well.

For newcomers, this is a dangerous text and my recommendation is not to read it; for the scholars, this is nothing else than a mere \\"bibliophile\\" item. And the price!

Many of Peter Tremayne's books were in with the ones she purchased. Several months later I began reading them. They were good.I enjoy the mysteries. I love Tremayne's viewpoint on the Irish Catholic Church. His characters are broad, but nonetheless enjoyable.However I found Act of Mercy to be the best title so far. It moves quickly and engages the reader better than the previous books. This is not great literature, but it's pretty darn cool to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ship-Lover's Mystery","review":"I highly recommend this book to lovers of ships and Celtic history. The writing style is a significant improvement from Tremayne's Shroud for the Archbishop - those who were disappointed with the quality of the writing and characterization in that book may now want to give the series another try. Although the author's biases still come through at times, they are more often hinted than shouted (which was a problem for Shroud), and the characters are considerably fuller and richer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister Fidelma at Her Best","review":"Peter Tremayne is the fiction pseudonym of a well-known authority on the ancient Celts, who has utilised his knowledge of the Brehon law system and 7th-Century Irish society to create a new concept in detective fiction.The Sister Fidelma novels are taking on almost cult proportions and are becoming ever more popular with each offering from the author, whose obvious knowledge of the times and subjects he writes about shines out like a beacon on the shore.It is the autumn of the year AD666 and Sister Fidelma has set out on a pilgrimage, her main task and thoughts are to reflect on her commitment to the religious life. Her work has to a degree isolated her from the life that a normal Christian Sister would live within the church.However on the first night aboard ship a pilgrim is washed overboard, but was it an accident or a deliberate act of murder.

Often I was simply struck by the depth of his variant translations and readings of individual Psalms.

Other than that though, it did a very good job of showing what it might have been like to be there, having those things happen to you and your friends. Also, it bothered me that that in this book they took way too many liberties with the character of \\"me\\". They made \\"me\\" a complete wimp who cares for nothing but Himself.

The last poem in the series certainly sets it all up though the reader will find many others throughout that will capture the imagination.

I found myself becoming irritated every time Lisle stopped to reassure the reader that, in fact, she quite likes children. It was almost as if she was constantly apologizing for not having any of her own, and rather than \\"challenging the stigma of childlessness,\\" these apologies seemed almost to reinforce that stigma. I think it would have been a better (more meaningful, more significant) book if she had come to her decision not to have kids out of a position of conscious childfreedom, rather than ambivalent childlessness.While people who are childless, or who are contemplating not having children might find this book useful, I would not recommend it for those who know they are childfree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well researched; in great depth and feeling; EXCELLENT","review":"I chose to not have children at age 18 - and I've never regretted it.

She has my eternal respect and gratitude for putting in print what I've been trying for years to explain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get through","review":"Although the historical parts of this book are great, these moments are few and far between. It seemed to me that this entire work was solely the author's attempt to justify why she did not have children.

There is so much pressure in society to have children that only a few really independent women are really capable of saying \\"no, I think I will pass\\" and not looking back. Many make the decision just as she did, by not really making the decision or by waiting to try so late in life that the chances are low.Because of the extremely academic style employed by Lisle, this book will not appeal to all. Still, it is thought provoking and really points out all the reasons why it is almost impossible to choose to be childless without regrets. Understanding the source and reasons for all of the pressure does help, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"I agree with a lot of the other reviews here; this book is more geared towards the childless than the childfree.

My friends were very impressed with them. These cards are awesome, but DO NOT BUY THEM ONLINE when you can very easily go to Books-a-million and buy them for $3 cheaper than if you ordered online and paid for shipping. It's your choice. $8 online, or $5 in store. I know $3 isn't going to break the bank, but it's the principle of the matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mistake!","review":"I was traveling on business and wanted some playing cards. I prefer Kem all plastic at home and saw these. They were sold alongside Bicycle's plastic coated cards.I didn't realize these were intended to be a toy. There was no way to see the cards as they were sealed. I found out soon enough when I opened them to play. I am used to slick cards so that's not the issue. The problem is that they are very hard to read. I suppose some people and children would be fascinated with the concept of see-through cards but it's a real hindrance to playing. For children's games it might be interesting; for the rest of us these aren't worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do much better","review":"The spray nozzle on this product seems to be its main problem.

While I would have liked to have seen more interviews with some of the Browns greats of the 80's and early 90', it was fun to relive some of those memories of Municipal Stadium. To see highlights of championship teams from the 40's and 50's reminds me of why my family passed down Browns fandom.

It starts off great and had me hooked but but then about 1/3 through it seemed to rush into getting the two together and the forgivness abound in this book just seemed to happen to fast. Just when you start thinking 'okay now there will be soul to this story it leaves you short'. Cute book but not one I will put on my read again list, not even on my have to go back and reread those certain parts that tug at your heart list.

Just Wow! Not your typical romance. This story really packs an emotional punch. It starts with such high hopes - then plunges you into sadness, than fills you with hope, than knocks you out again. A really terrific read that you will not put down. At the center of the story is Trust and how important a part it plays in the lives of the characters. The fun part was watching both characters grow and reach fulfillment by opening themselves to trust in each other and themselves. I won't be loaning this book out - I'll be reading this again. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO difficult to get through!","review":"I had high hopes for this book, as it received 5 stars from the other reviews. Even more so, the beginning was exciting and pulled me right in. However, by the time I was 1/3 of the way through the story, I was struggling to stay attached to the story. There is so much potential in this story, but it did the one thing that, as an avid reader, drove me insane: it didn't show me the story, it only told me the story. There were multiple opportunities for story development; instead, the author chose to race through with quick summaries and convoluted conversations to move the story faster than it needed to go. Definitely not one of her better works. I'd love to see a follow-up or remake of the story, and see it done well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home run for Stokowski","review":"When I was young, this recording of Brahms symphony 3 was one reason I took an interest in classical music. It was the standard for other recordings. It has great sound separation, and if Stokowski tinkered with the score, it just adds sparkle to a marvelous score. That was decades ago, and I have perhaps 5 recordings of #3 in my library, and this is the favorite. As for Steinburg, his rendition is passable but nothing to write home about. Bruno Walter, Leonard Bernstein, Szell, Ormandy all seem better to me. But I'd love this disc if it was Stokowski and Joe Nobody and the Jerkwater Philharmonic doing the second selection. The complaints of other reviewers leave me astonished. Are they listening to the right disc? This is a Romantic composer interpreted by a Romantic conductor with a penchant for recording quality, and the result is marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 X Better Than Restaurant Cooked!","review":"I bought this book 20 years ago, and many Chinese cookbooks later, am here to advise you that this is the best Chinese cookbook ever!

It has been ages since I've watched a movie I didn't want to end - this is one of them! Probably not to everyone's taste but, I took a chance and just bought it never having seen it before and I'm glad I did - found something meaningful for a change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Indie","review":"Interesting big city tale with the great looking Mandy Moore, and Billy Crudup as a typically messed up writer. A rich writer, which they don't tell you, but you have to deduct by his posessions. The storyline is sometimes a little hard to follow as to why he or she did what, but it is sometimes fun and also sometimes sad, and sometimes stupid. Not really believeable, but what is funny is how Mandy in real life married a guy 2 years later, who in someways, is like Billys character type. I guess the power of love links strange mates at times. Good acting by all in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your average romantic comedy","review":"This romance has a hero who is edgier than most and not very likable on the surface.

One positive thing, it has one of the best handbag interiors I have ever seen.

It would be easy for the obvious: reading this book is so pleasurable it makes one feel guilty (as in \\"Oh god I don't deserve to be so happy!!\\"). It would be even easier for what is not so obvious: reading the book engenders in one an intense desire to try and re-create the sublime beauty of Seth's verse.

Moreover, thepresentation of basic physics concepts as they apply inbiology --- e.g. osmosis --- was so dumbed down and muddled asto actually be incomprehensible to me.

Material could also be a little more durable so strong winds do not cause tears. Overall extremely pleased. Wish the price was a little lower as I would order a new one each year.

A decision made by Englishmen during the last few centuries to take what they wanted from whatever mystical tradition existed and use it. The big problem is that they never asked the people who used the traditions. This led to a very large number of mistakes and mistranslation. Rather than write a book and try to reconcile these problems, the author ignored them. In doing so he wrote an amusing book that has a relevance limited to the works of the Golden Dawn. I'm disappointed that Hermetic Kabbalists don't recognize the mistakes made by the GD in the beginning. This is why Jewish Kabbalists look down at the modern Hermetic tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hermetic Kabbalah","review":"A funny book in more ways than one. Another attempt of English \\"Kabbalist\\" to understand what is veiled from them. Futile attempts all.

It plays two songs, beeps, and makes a \\"voom voom\\" sound.One thing I like about this bus is that it moves only by kid-power, not a motor or wind up, so it can't go too fast and bump into things. It tends to engage the kids in more quiet play, rather than some of the motorized toys that zoom around the house. Also the noises that it makes are not too loud.This toy has paid for itself in terms of the amount of use it gets. If I could only afford one Little People toy, I'd choose the Farm, but the bus is reasonably priced and the kids love it, so if you can afford it, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fisher Price Toy","review":"I got my nephew this bus for Christmas when he was 18 months.

The concept of pale Eve meeting dark Lilith in the Garden of Eden on the eve of shabbat and discovering her \\"womanhood\\" transported me.Reading Naamah was like chatting with and listening to the wise women who helped me through the rough times in my life.The Daughters of Tzelafchad reminded me that we each have to claim our share of worldy goods but we must be wise about how we do it.It had never occured to me to see Queen Vashti as another victim. The story opened my eyes to looking at things in a new way.If Jill Hammer wrote the book as a teaching tool it worked with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"Sisters At Sinai: New Tales Of Biblical WomenAll the midrashim written in this book are just lovely, amazing, extraordinary.

It is a collection of pieces from the troupe's first four albums. As such, it allows the reader to finally fully penetrate the oft-times impenetrable texts of the group's records. The pieces included are \\"Waiting For the Electrician or Someone Like Him\\" and \\"How Can You Be In Two Places At Once When You're Not Anywhere At All?\\" from the albums of the same name, and the titles \\"Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers\\" and \\"I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus\\" in their entirety. The plays are accompanied by a plethora of photos, a foreword from each member, and a chronology of the group's career to that point. Good luck finding a copy but, if you do, grab it! It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite the Solution I Was Expecting","review":"I love the FT, and despite having listened over & over to the recordings scripted in this book, there were elements I could never make out -- stuff buried under multiple layers of sound (e.g. Ralph Spoilsport), or words here & there I just couldn't make out. At last, I found and bought this fabled and sought-after book, thinking it would explicate all -- but no. Some of the dialogue simply isn't here.I don't regret buying it; it did indeed make clear what I'd misheard, and it's great how it ties stories from the first four albums together into a single surreal odyssey. But it wasn't all I'd hoped for, hence the deducted star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks: left, right, front and back!","review":"I was excited to try these because I liked the idea of getting my son something that let him put his legs together. I am tired of seeing him so bowlegged due to the diapers. And since I like the other Huggies styles, I was very enthused. Until I went through 5 diapers, everyone of which leaked. Leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a BM came out the legs, I gave up. I tried everything possible to make these work, but they leak. Maybe in the smaller sizes, but size 5 on a 22 month old definitely did NOT work. Also, my son is in 50% percentile for height and weight, so skinny legs were not the problem.No more Natural Fit/HugFlex for us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huggies disappoints again","review":"After many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller-size diapers, I decided to give Huggies another try because I have a very active toddler, and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable. Unfortunately, this comfort comes at the expense of utility. My daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack, when I saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back. Just like the smaller sizes, this version does not hold anything in!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huggies Supreme Diapers","review":"I like Huggies Supreme because it works best of all the diaper brands I've tried: protection, comfort--the \\"giga-elastic\\" helps keep the tabs from unfastening.

Since the Pampers were so expensive, and they sell Huggies at Costco, I decided to try a small bag of Huggies to see if they worked. As I was holding my daughter and nursing her, she peed straight out of the side of the diaper, all over me. I thought, Oh, I just didn't close it well. Nope, she did it again the same day.I recently got sick of spending so much on Pampers Cruisers and thought, hey, Huggies now has this \\"Natural Fit\\" diaper, maybe they're improved. Sigh. My poor daughter peed right through it at the playground, leaving a huge puddle in the middle of the play structure, which I then had to frantically try to clean up before the other toddlers crawled through it.Maybe it's just my daughter, but these things aren't all that absorbent I'm thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre history of a religious movement","review":"There is nothing really bad with this history - my complaint is simply that I really hadn't learned much of anything after reading it through.

I can't recommend any better resources on the social gospel, but can simply suggest reading biographies of major figures or more specific books (\\"The Social Gospel In Black and White\\".)

I'm a fan of 80's club music and danced (...)in (...) bars in Florida, Chicago, Milwaukee, New York City, Boston and my home town of Providence, and I really wanted to love this collection, but I'm really disappointed.

Most of the changes in the 4th edition are the color maps and updated info on the Cabo area. While the maps are nice, there are better sources for Baja maps.Now back to the review of the book itself. I love this book, I have the 2nd and 3rd editions also, and they have been used extensively for Baja travel. While the road conditions and prices obviously will change they are good guidelines of what to expect. I think this book is most suited to travelers that are driving and offers great info on side trips off the beaten path. The road conditions regarding if 4wd is required is helpful, even if things could have changed since publication. Also great info for boaters especially concerning boat ramps, and fuel availability.I found the hotel ratings to be pretty accurate about the conditions and facilities.

There are other bugs as well; I cannot run my train in snow for example, I get a window asking me if I want to send this error to Microsoft. Then the program shuts down.

It was certainly big enough for me with lots pf room head to toe and side to side. Initially putting on the last end piece was tough as others found.It seemed a little shaky when I started to lie on it. It would move a little top to bottom, but once I was laying down it seemed solid.The 1st two times I used it their were no problems. When I lied down the 3rd time one side seemed higher then the other, but I thought I was imagining it.It was on the fourth use that one end just sank low and collasped. I'm bummed, I wanted this cot to work out. I never abused it at all and was pretty gentle getting on and off it.I guess I'm back looking for something else to sleep on. Even if Nebo replaced it, I wouldn't trust it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for so many ages!","review":"We bought this as an alternative to having my Mom sleep on the couch. She was diagnosed with Parkinson's about 5 years ago, and we were hoping to give her a comfortable place to sleep, that would be easy to get in and out of as well. She said it was easier to get in and out of than her bed, and at least as comfortable. We laid a sleeping bag down on it, and she slept on top of that, since the cot dips very slightly into the middle. She got a great night's sleep - after we pulled 3 of our kids off of it and sent them to their own beds! They were all enjoying it together! My Mom was also able to take it apart with very little difficulty. A big plus!

I had bought it based upon Amazon recommendations, although my 2 1/2 year old son never watched \\"Fireman Sam\\" prior to this video. So, I wasn't aware of the accents or content. I was skeptical at first, but he loves it and it's a nice change from Barney and Elmo.My only complaints are that they show junk food alot on this video, so I am constantly getting requests for \\"ice cream\\" and other stuff during and after the video. I also was a little disturbed by the potential drowning scene, even though it turns out okay in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fireman Sam Is The Hero Next Door :-)","review":"Our family really likes all of the Fireman Sam videos. We bought them primarily for our 3 year old son but I've got to admit, I watch them with him because they are so well done.The characters are great and once you know them you will be looking for more episodes. Fireman Sam, Norman Price, Mandy, Bella and Tom are my favorites but the whole cast is great. \\"I'm going in\\", \\"Norman Price, you little hooligan/cheat/et all\\", \\"Great fires of London\\", \\"Flaming qualas\\" are some of the signature lines. You will be greatly enjoying these episodes if you give them a chance.They are based in Wales so for Americans you will have to learn a few words which also adds to appeal.

He can see more than just the underside of Pooh and his buddies, which is more than I can say for many of the mobiles out there. With this mobile, he can see a variety of colors and faces. In the center is a bee with a baby safe mirror so that my son can see his own reflection. It is a wind-up, which is a bit annoying. My biggest complaint is with assembly. After I FINALLY got the mobile and all its components out of the very extensive packaging, I found that that the ONLY way it will fit together is when you put the big, round, screw-on anchor in on the crib side instead of on the outside of the crib. We even took it apart and tried to get it to work the other way, but it doesn't. So my son's bumper sticks out quite a bit because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crooked, gets stuck, song lasts 20 seconds","review":"I bought this adorable mobile in hopes that my 3 month old would enjoy watching it move about and listen to the music. The crank is so loud, and the music lasts around 20-30 seconds. You have to stand next to the mobile and the crib and escort Pooh around the arm of the mobile - it's horribly designed. Pooh's too big to make it past the arm so the mobile goes 3/4 turn and gets stuck. If you want to stand at your crib and keep turning a mobile; you'll already be close to re-wind the music as well. BUT if you want to be able to start a mobile and LEAVE the room, don't buy this one.

The information on where you should stop consists of about 5 sentences; not enough to help you decide if you want to stop or to assist you once you are there. We were in Ireland for 10 days; during that time, we found this guide useful for about 5 minutes, when we were trying to find Cliffs of Moher. Not a very good investment. For beautiful pictures at no cost, search the internet instead.The two guide books I would recommend are Lonely Planet and the Blue Guide. (...)

I studied the book before leaving the US, deciding that several of the tours suited my needs. What a disappointment, however, upon getting to Ireland and trying to actually use the book. Directions from the book itself were not very helpful, we got lost several times, only finding our way back using a regular road map. The book mentions Routes that have no signs posted anywhere, so it was hard to know if you were going the right way. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that there was not nearly enough information about each suggested \\"stop\\" on the tours - hard to decide whether it was worth it or not to make the 10-mile detour to check things out. I could have also used some kind of description about the road conditions, such as if it was a mountain road, straight, or with many curves - those things definitely affected driving times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Necessary","review":"I found this book not very helpful. It has more or less unrelated circle tours, but this is not how most people would tour Ireland. Most of the information is readily available in other ways, such as Frommer's Ireland 2006, which is much more comprehensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but unacceptable performance","review":"Bought two of these. One channel failed after a few month of use, but that is not the main problem. A power supply like this is supposed to be used both in voltage mode and current limit mode. It shuts down if it is in current limit mode for more than seconds. That makes it hard to use to power LED strings for example. It is also single turn pots (the product description is just wrong here) so with 3/4 of a turn is 30 (or 60) volts, it is impossible to get say 5V. It will jump between 4.5 and 5.5 barely touching the dial.The manual is useless, and it is undefined how it behaves when it needs to sink, not only source current.Maybe these limitations is unimportant to some users, but then you could just buy a regular power supply, not a lab supply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Power supply","review":"High value, works fine.

Short on facts and long on psychoanalysis, the book is nearly painful to read- especially the post assassination world of Ruth Paine which takes up the final few chapters. In the end this woman, who lived a simple Quaker lifestyle, was uninteresting. The afternoon of the assassination police removed \\"file cabinets full\\" of letters and collected data... what was in there, who did it belong to? Why the author never asked the question is beyond me- and so is this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitewash continued","review":"While the author sheds some light on what has been circulating on the internet for the last two years, namely the Boston Brahmin connection to the murder of JFK, he treats it as more \\"conspiracy buff\\" stuff. Yes the people who took in the Oswalds prior to the assassination were connected to United Fruit, Cabots, Forbes, Dulles etc. But it doesn't mean anything, according to the author. Just keep believing in a gang of lone nuts, magic bullets, that kill JFK, MLK, RFK, John Lennon and anyone who threatens the status quo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"I really enjoyed this look at an often forgotten aspect of the Kennedy assassination. I particularly enjoyed the look at the end of the that concerns the Kennedy conspiracy buffs. He is right on the money here.

In the time it took to read this book, I experienced the gamut of emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, shock, disbelief, horror) and spilled plenty of tears!The book also shed some light on the true \\"spirit\\" of these Catholic Church-run homes and on the NYS Foster Care system of the 1940's & 1950's. While the abuses chronicled in \\"They Cage...\\" would never be tolerated today, it is disheartening to know that such practices DID exist.Reading this book made me appreciate my own children all the mor.

From page one it drew me in and took a hold of me in this young mans life and his family's ordeals. I never have felt more grateful for my own upbringing since having lived through Jennings eyes. He only had his \\"doggy\\" and that was his only escape from the cruel world around him. After I was done reading the book I was so offended by orphanages and the way the treated children I wanted to find out where he was at, who were the nuns who hurt him, I was angry and really wanted revenge for him. I think we all need to open our eyes to the system and help these children out and make sure this abuse does not happen these children belong to all of us and do not deserve this, they all deserve a better place with some family.

At times it is sad, but most of the time you feel happy for Jennings. He is optimistic about his outcome. Along the way he meets many friends, the best one a stuffed animal.This should give you the reader enough to want to purchase this book. This is a book that definetely should be added to everyones book shelf who has been a victim of abuse, whether emotional or physical.

What starts as a feel-good story about family soon spirals into a white-knuckled roller coaster ride straight to the hell of one's soul, ripping and twisting open the chest like opening a cheap wine cooler, and sucking at the teat of deplorable and miserous history.Mr. Burch paints for us a dreadful picture of abuse, molestation, and violation during his experiences at \\"The Farm\\", and with it, comes to terms, eventually befriending the mysterious \\"Ruby Clark\\", and coming to grips with his own feelings. The bravery that this individual has, while grappling with the omnipresent opression at the hands of \\"The Sitters\\" and finding comfort in wearing Ruby Clark's tattered overalls brings a tear to this sailor's eye.

We purchased this item because it had wheels on the bottom of it and thought it would be convenient and easy to carry on and off the plane. Number 1: Do not try to roll it down the airline aisles. The aisles are not wide enough for your carseat! We had to carry the carseat anyway. So much for the wheels. The wheels came in handy rolling it through the airport only. Number 2: By the end of our trip (we had only used this item twice) there were large tears on the bottom of it from being rolled through two airports. The only reason why I feel it was a good buy was because it got us thru one trip. If you plan to buy this for one trip only then I would recommend it (but not strongly) If you plan to use this item trip after trip, then look for another way to tote your carseat."},{"rating":"2","title":"recvd in time as ordered","review":"I needed this the day before I went on a trip and I recvd this just in time as I ordered it.

The officer who installed the seat said that after-market products like this are absolutely not recommended -- the only thing that passes muster with the public safety folks is a piece of rug pad, which also helps the base grip the seat in addition to providing some protection of the upholstery. Doesn't look great, but it's better than thinking you've installed your seat correctly when it's actually not entirely safe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit our seats, zippers broke on 3rd use","review":"We own two of these and they have never been easy to use.

We do have large carseats - they are both Britax Marathons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea - way too flimsy","review":"By the time we had wheeled our Britax Roundabout from the parking lot to the check in desk at the airport the fabric at the bottom of the bag already had two holes in it!The flaw in the design is that there are only two wheels. The mistake we made was that we thought we had it angled so that only the wheels were on the ground when in fact we had to too vertical and the fabric was rubbing on the ground too. This resulted in two holes in a very short amount of time. If you make sure that only the wheels and nothing else are touching the ground then you might still have an intact bag at the end of your flight. but the material is way too flimsy and the slightest mistake on your part will result in holes. We have duct taped our holes and are still using the bag, but are kind of dissapointed.If the material was much stronger then this would be a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"We used this car seat carrier on our vacation - it was big enough for our britax marathon and I could easily drag it behind me on its wheels while pushing our stroller. I also put some carry on luggage in with the car seat so we had less bags to lug around. You can put the seat with the bag on the airplane seat and just unzip and push the sides of the bag down so you don't have to struggle putting the car seat in and out of the bag. At the end of the flight we just unbuckled the seat, pulled up sides and zipped it up and were ready to go. It was a hassle getting the seat down the aisle of the plane because it was too big to roll, so try to get a seat up front if you can. My only complaint is that one of the back pack strap plastic rings cracked after our 2nd use, but since we only use the wheels and not the back pack part it doesn't matter and for the price, this bag is certainly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frequent Flier","review":"We fly twice a month on average - no joke! - and take our Britax Roundabout in this bag everytime. It has survived over 6 months of heavy toting - including a 10 day trip through Europe - and after all that the only thing wrong is that the cloth around the wheels has started to wear away about the last month or so. We don't store anything but the carseat in the pack and an occasional blanket or stuffed animal, though it has sufficient room to do so. I have continued to use it with the holes forming but plan on patching them to continue use. I was hesitant after reading the negative reviews but needed something quickly. I highly recommend the tote to anyone who travels. With proper use as a backpack or wheeling it, it will withstand heavy usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheels are great, one major flaw","review":"I have used this bag a few times and it works well in some ways. My Britax Roundabout fits spaciously (as long as it is positioned backwards), and the wheels on the bottom are genius. One major flaw is that the clips that attach the backpack straps to the bag are positioned so they dig into your shoulders when you wear the seat on your back. It is extremely painful, so I have not been able to continue using it as a backpack. I'm now looking for some terry cloth arm bands people wear on their wrists for tennis, and I'm going to try to use those to cover the clips. If I could, I would return this bag for something more comfortable. In the meantime, we attach it to a rolling suitcase and pull it on its wheels, which works sufficiently well, although it is a bit awkward and tippy. I have not (yet) had the fabric tearing problem that the majority of other reviewers complain about. Maybe I just got lucky with gentle airline handlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breeze","review":"We traveled to BWI from Portland, OR during the Christmas Holiday and I watched so many parents traveling with their car seats strapped to their backs like turtles. I saw other parents with their car seats piled on those carts you can rent for $2...Well I just breezed by all of those people with my baby in my stroller and the car seat being pulled in the other hand, and I cannot express the ease of my travel. I could only shake my head at those frustrated, tired, seaty parents who did not take the time to explore this inexpensive tool for making traveling with your tot so much easier! Go buy it! Quick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, if you only need it once.","review":"I travel on my own quite a bit with my baby. This car seat carrier was a life saver on my last trip. The wheels were a huge help. But after only one trip, the bottom material tore. There's got to be a better way than buying a new one per trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold up well","review":"I think this product is a very good idea, however, it didn't hold up very well at all. After one round-trip flight it's useless. There are several large holes and the zipper doesn't work anymore. It didn't roll well either, the bag kept scraping the ground (where some of the holes came from) unless I held it at an awkward angle.I also had a hard time getting my daughter's carseat in it in the first place. The Evenflo Triumph was too big and our other seat, the Cosco AlphaOmega, fit, but not without some work.It might work well for getting the seat through the airport for use on the plane, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for checking your carseat as baggage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart the very first time I used it!","review":"**Update from my earlier review (below)**After contacting customer service, they sent me a new bag at no charge, no questions asked. I don't know if I will use it or sell it, but I do feel that that was an impressive response from the company and would therefore increase my star rating if I could.___Original review:This bag is a great concept, but the quality is very poor. Similar to other reviewers, I used this as a wheeled bag for only one trip and had two very large holes on the bottom when I reached my destination. However, it most likely would have still been usable had the zippers not fallen off when I was taking the car seat out!Save yourself some money and find something else. What I wound up doing in desperation that worked really well was taking a shoulder strap from my carry-on bag and looping it through the car seat so that I could carry it like a purse over my shoulder."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't fit our car seat","review":"Just for other customers to know, it does not fit our Evenflo Triumph DLX Convertible car seat. But the product itself looked fine, and has a side pocket to put the straps in, for airplane travel.

Don't waste your money, use a garbage bag instead. If I could rate zero stars I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product; a life saver for travel","review":"This is a great product for big trips or small. Traveling alone with a toddler by plane is not easy with luggage, a stroller and a car seat. This product makes it easier. You have the option to roll it along behind you or carry it on your back freeing up your hands to push a stroller. It may take a little practice to get the car seat in at first but once you've done it it's easier every time. It also holds up to airport luggage handling coming out with a few scrapes but intact and ready to roll along. I also love that it does double duty as a sun shade for the car seat keeping it cool for your little one. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money!!!!!","review":"I used this bag flying from Orlando to Dallas via Atlanta. I did not check the car seat, I only used the bag to pull the car seat from the car to the airport and through the terminal. By the time I got to Atlanta it already had 4 holes. I read the earlier reviews which were mixed and thought I would try it. I had the same cover on my baby registry and needless to say I removed it from the registry as soon as I got back from my trip! It is a great idea, but the fabric is just not tough enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!!!!","review":"I purchased this item thinking it would suit my needs for a family vacation, I was wrong. I had a direct flight and carried the car seat to be stored on board. After my flight I noticed the bottom of the bag was completely torn. One of the straps snapped apart as I was carring it on my shoulders. The seat kept slipping inside the bag while I was rolling it. By the time we got home the bag looked like it had been through war. The material is cheap and apparently it does not suit all car seats. It was a complete waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but poor quality","review":"This Safefit bag received 2 holes on its bottom during its first flight and 1 more on its return trip. I'm not very impressed with the quality of the material. A checked car seat at the gate never received as much damage as this bag did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product - does not fit and does not roll","review":"Despite claims that this product would fit most car seats we found out at the airport that it did not fit our Evenflo car seat. It was a struggle to fit the seat in the bag, and even then we could not zip the bag closed all the way.Once the seat was mostly in we tried to roll it but the wheels are so small and the handle so lame that the seat kept flipping.We got so frustrated with it that we threw away the bag at the airport security checkpoint and strapped our carseat on top of our rolling suitcase instead, using a $0.49 bungee cord I had the foresight of bringing along just in case.I would give this product zero star if I could for false advertising and poor design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"This product came in handy for my husband and I when we took our 13 month old on her first airplane ride. I was quite nervous about how we were going to accomodate everything we needed. This product was great. We had the baby in the stroller and this car seat protector we wheeled behind us. We saw lots of parents carrying car seats while trying to navigate a stroller and other bags. One parent commented on our car seat protector on wheels, saying , \\"Wow, what a great idea!\\" I highly recommend this to anyone traveling with small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great! (ONCE)","review":"We bought this bag to use with our Britax Marathon carseat, and it worked great the first time. We loved the wheels, since our seat is quite heavy. It really is a great concept. However, it is a terrible product! The second time we used it, we noticed that the seat slid around in the bag a lot, causing it to tip off the wheels and drag on the ground. At the end of our trip, not only did this dragging cause the bag to rip on the way to our car, but it ripped our car seat! The bag's fabric is pretty flimsy, so for our third trip with this bag, I reinforced the whole bottom of the bag with heavy duty iron on patches. Thankfully, this got us through that vacation and at least to our car. When I unzipped the bag to remove the seat, the zipper pull came right off! I would recommend spending money on a bag that you carry, especially if you really like your carseat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really came in handy!","review":"I don't know how I would have made it through the airport with 2 kids, a stroller and my carseat without the cover n' carry.

My only complaint is that after 1 use through the airport, it already has a small hole near one of the wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sturdy or Durable at All!","review":"After spending over $30 for this item, we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across. A seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong. Would not purchase again or recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover 'n Carry Falls Apart","review":"After one trip (4 flights)with this cover it had several small holes and one zipper fell off. It was only used to carry on the car seat, so it was never checked as baggage, therefore, not overly handled. Very disappointing and on the final flight I didn't even use it because of the zipper. Save your $30 and buy a regular luggage carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Poor Quality","review":"We were really looking forward to using this on our first trip with our baby. It worked great at the beginning of the trip, wheeled wonderfully through the airport and down the aisle of the plane but after just one use, started to rip all along the bottom, which in turn damaged our brand new car seat. What this bag needs is a heavy duty plastic guard on the bottom so that it won't tear if it rubs the ground. I am only giving this item 2 stars because I think it is poor quality for the price, which is quite steep considering it barely made it through a single use! I would be willing to pay $50 for a better quality bag. If redesigned with a rubber guard, I would give this item 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat Protector Did Not Protect....It Damaged Our Car Seat !!","review":"This is a great concept for families who frequently travel, but in the few short weeks we have owned the protector, we have had TERRIBLE experience with it...We have used the protector for only TWO roundtrips. By the end of the first trip, the canvas had torn at the bottom where the wheels are (a metal bar is now partially exposed). During the second trip, the canvas had worn a hole and our carseat (an Evenflo Triumph 5 which was purchased on the same day as the protector) became damaged where the hole is. In addition to the hole, one of the zipper pulls ripped off. It also has not been easy to put the car seat in the protector. What should be self-explanatory really is not in this case (instructions would have been helpful).We purchased the protector to protect our car seat investment; however, it has backfired on us and now we are left with a defective product and a damaged car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Try Another Product","review":"The Safefit cover couldn't even handle one trip!

The main feature that appealed to me were the wheels, so that I could pull the car seat through the airport.Unfortunately, during the first leg of my trip, the zipper broke. The teeth of the zipper appeared to be broken where they rubbed against the ground either while rolling or by the conveyor belt at the airlines. Then, when I picked the bag up after my return flight, I found that there were holes torn in the sides of the bag. I was shocked that the fabric seemed to tear easily, as the car seat inside it was not large or sharp-cornered. I was extremely disappointed with the performance of this product. I had been hoping to get years of use out of it. Instead, it is trash after it's first use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and construction","review":"We had this bag, the zippers broke after just two uses and the edge drags on the ground when wheeled, which made the fabric rip."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 for 1","review":"I purchased this product for my first plane trip. Previouse reviewers complained about getting holes on the bottom from the cover dragging while using it as a pull behind. That is true.I don't travel a lot, so I figures a few holes wouldn't matter. What I like is that the carrier can be used in between trips to keep the seat cool on hot summer days. There are days I avoid going out because I don't want my little one to 'cook' in his black car seat. I am looking forward to using the reflective cover this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped after one trip","review":"Like several other reviewers, our cover ripped after one trip. It's easy to see why, if you use the wheels and handle (exactly as they're designed to be used!), the bottom of the case drags on the ground. There is no reinforcement along the bottom, and the thin canvas (think windbreaker) ripped.Though I do have to say that I contacted the company and they promised to send a new one right out, without requiring me to return the ripped one. That was great, though I'm hesitant to plan to use it again. Maybe this can just be a disposable cover, one-use only?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap broke immediately","review":"One of the straps broke immediately as we tested the item with the car seat in it. We took it on our trip anyway since we didn't have time to return it. Other than the strap issue, it performed well -- this thing is really useful. (We took the suggestion and duct-taped the bottom, so we didn't have any failures in the fabric.) If so many other purchasers hadn't complained about quality, I would say our situation was a fluke. Anyway, if you decide to purchase this item, definitely get it a few weeks before your trip and try it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after just one plane ride","review":"OK traveling to the US form Europe I thought this would be a great item. After just wheeling it through the airport the bottom developed a hole. The second leg of the trip a zipper broke. The next leg and the other zipper broke leaving it useless. For the return trip I put 4 hefty cinch sacks over the seat and that worked better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bite-sized Iain Banks","review":"Odds are if you're considering this collection of short stories, you're already a fan of Banks.

Well, only one of the three babies was able to use the toy, and only minimally at that. Although these are not the smallest-sized Lego's, they are still a bit difficult for toddlers to manipulate and push onto the table. We spent many an hour chasing after Legos that would \\"zing\\" across the room after an unsuccessful attempt at pushing them onto the table. They all love \\"Mega-Block\\" sized Lego toys, but I would wait until about age 2 to use this table with your little ones. Just a note--I think that they are now recommending this be used for ages 2 and up. If you purchase this table, I would also recommend purchasing the bucket of Duplo blocks, as the pockets on either side of the table hold them easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great lego accessory","review":"My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday and it has been a big hit! She loves to build on it. I like that the legos clean up into the storage area on the sides. An extra box of legos slides right under for easy storage too. It has brought many hours of enjoyment to us in the past few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips over","review":"This toy looks great, but was a terrible buy!!! We cannot keep the legs on it. It is very light weight and flips over VERY easily. My 11 month old loves it, but I don't want him to get hurt from it falling on him, The manufacturers age says 2-5 years, but it is way too short for anyone over two. Try the imaginarium table instead. It looks more sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen's mom's review","review":"I bought this for my son to play with when we moved into our new house. He loved playing with it. The only problem is from the time we took it out of the box, we couldn't make the legs stand up. They will not connect to the table. Several people have tried to get it to work and have not been able to. He has to play with it on the floor without the legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor work man ship","review":"The Lego Table 3125 one leg fits fine on the table. The other leg does not. When our grandson plays with it and wants to move the table, the leg falls off and so do all of the lego blocks. I am v ery unhappy with this purchase.

Jean Jeffus"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stater set","review":"I got this for my 2 year old and he loves it. I also got him a small bucket of pieces to complement. This are very safe for him and for my 6 month old daughter. The table is wonderful is an excellent place to build much better than the carpet. The table can store a good amount of pieces on the legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My 2.5 year old loves this table. He plays at it everyday, playing with his legos. The only downside is that he can't really sit or stand... the perfect height is by kneeling, which can be hard on the knees (but he doesn't seem to be bothered)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment","review":"We received this table as a gift for our son's first birthday and it has been such a big hit! It is compatible with the Quattros and the Duplos and is also perfect height for pulling up to stand - something he needed to practice. Now he is 14 months old and loves to get his Legos to stick to it. He and his daddy spend a lot of time building (and knocking down) works of art on this table. I completely recommend it! Also, he's climbed up on it a couple of times and it's done fine - it's stable and sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with sound editing","review":"The sound editing is very unprofessional on this CD. The background music and sound effects often drown out the voices of those being interviewed. How could this be overlooked before release? The UFO clips are repeated too often and I was disapointed with the meager amount of content.All this adds up to spoiling the credibility of the subject and Mr. Aykroyd's message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aykroyd views on UFOs","review":"Dan Aykroyd proves himself to be a very well informed person with regard to UFOs and the alien abduction phenomenon. It is good to know that credible and intelligent individuals such as Dan are telling us their beliefs on this matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment for UFO Nuts!","review":"Done like a raw-footage interview with Dan Akroyd, this documentary is good entertainment for people who love this stuff! It takes some old footage of UFOs and analyzes them and also shows some newer stuff that I've never seen before. David Sereda asks the questions and Dan Akroyd answers them. Even though it was very interesting to get an hour of what Aykroyd really knows about the UFO phenomenon, I couldn't help but think that it should have been David Sereda answering the questions. Overall, this movie does a good job of \\"connecting the dots\\", a phrase used by UFO researcher Paola Harris, to describe what this second-science community is trying to do in order to solve the UFO phenomenon riddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Fell Asleep","review":"Besides watching Dan smoke cigarettes, there's not a whole lot new here. No real evidence, just conjecture and \\"ooga booga.\\" I fell asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"no credibility","review":"Neither Dan Akroyd nor David Sereda have any scientific training or background.

'Laid back' is the tone this video would like to convey, but interviewer UFO researcher, David Sereda, and subject, Dan Aykroyd, are so casual, they may as well be discussing who won the Mets game. It's difficult to discuss such fantastic subjects without striking a nerve somewhere, but this documentary manages just that, seeming more intent on showing just how normal, (and dull), a paranormal believer can be. We like Aykroyd using his celebrity status to bring the UFO phenomena to the talking tables, (it sure is more sincere than weight-loss programs, and orphaned African children), but his rather unconvincing account of a 'men in black' encounter, and his lung polluting, chain smoking cigarettes inhaled into his very overweight rotund figure, while discussing how the U.S. Government is destroying the world's natural environment, verges on SNL satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intriguing!","review":"What I like the most about this DVD is the \\"NASA Space Junk\\" footage which shows a procession of pulsating objects that can't be blown off. I am genuinely intrigued...Loved Dan's personal UFO anecdotes. Very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who you gonna call, Dan Aykroyd! Why do UFO's drive with their lights on?","review":"My favorite Ghost Buster and Saturday Night Live Alum is Dan Aykroyd. I was hoping this DVD would answer the age old question. \\"If UFOs are advanced technology from another world, why do they drive around with their lights on if they are trying to stay hidden?\\" You'd think if their technology is so advanced they'd have an off switch for their lights in the cockpits. I saw part of this on the Sci-Fi channel a few years ago so I thought I'd buy the DVD. Dan Aykroyd is great. It's kind of like a SNL script. With a little bit of work this could have made a hillarious documentary. If you're a UFO buff you need to add this to your collection. I've heard David Sereda on Coast to Coast and he's very good, he's a former Lockhead egghead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplugged A Definite Smash Hit","review":"I was quite impressed with the high quality caliber of this production. The sounds, camera work, the great UFO footages. UFO reality was enhanced by the testimony of astronaut Gordon Cooper who saw with his own eyes a fleet of flying saucers in formation closeup while in his military Jet and Cooper tells of his cameramen at Edwards AFB filming a flying saucer landing on the dry lake bed with its landing gear extended. Cooper says he saw this saucer on the film before it was shipped out to the pentagon. The reality of men in black was strengthen by Dan Aykroyd's chilling account of his own run in with the MIBs, a scary account I never heard about Aykroyd before. And the addition of new NASA shuttle footage it all sums up to a high recommendation to everybody that something strange is going on and it all needs to be investigated. This DVD is definitely five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"night light that truly lights an area - not just a blob","review":"I love night lights to navigate my home safely at night since they save so much electricity/heat generation. I have tried many night lights, but many are just glowing blobs that do not truly light up anything. This one does really light up an area so you can actually see where you are going. I also like the directional quality so you can focus it. Plus, it does not burn out like conventional night light bulbs, so you save a lot of money ovver time with this one. It seems to last forever. Unfortunately, this brand, Leviton, is not carried many places, so it is hard to find. Home Depot and Lowe's do NOT CARRY IT, and only carry one brand per store. That brand is useless for finding one's way. This one works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping...","review":"This novel was gripping; I especially enjoyed the Mississippi setting as I now live here. :) I don't like CIA/espionage stuff, so this Iles piece was right up my alley. At least the author can write about almost ANYTHING, and that shows his true talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iles first disappointing novel","review":"As a huge fan of all of Iles prior novels, I was hugely disappointed with his latest effort. Given his prior work, I can only hope that this is not an indication of what is too come. Hopefully, the attention from Hollywood has not put an end to an immensely entertaining author."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!! WORTH GETTING LESS SLEEP OVER!","review":"This book was a very fast paced read! It was exciting and had new twists throughout so it never left you bored. I have 2 small children and don't get to read much except late at night. I stayed up until around 4 am reading 2 nights in a row. I just had a hard time putting this one down. Although, it has supernatural events in it, it wasn't so far fetched that you were annoyed if you don't like that sort of thing. I usually don't read those type books, but this was WONDERFUL!!! It involves a man much like a lot of those out there today we can relate to. He works hard, has a good life with a wife and child. But one day and old flame walks back into his life.... Iles has a great writing style and has the stories to go right along with it! You won't be disappointed in this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I am a huge fan of Mr. Iles, but this book was a big disappointment. I am afraid he is going the way of \\"selling out\\" to make production deadlines. I bought the book because the reserve list at the library was LONG and I knew I could pass it on to others. After my husband and I read the book, I donated it to the local library because I could not recommend it to anyone. I am from Mississippi and have been proud to read and own ALL of the other books he has written. This was such a disappointment. Come on Greg, get back to the good stuff! Don't become the next Danielle Steele, cranking them out to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to be published. I have read and thoroughly enjoyed everything written by Greg Isles. If I wanted to read graphic sexual content I would purchase the latest \\"Penthouse\\" Magazine (I am broad minded). Get back on track Greg Isles and forget the filth - we don't need it!!!I would rather have spent the [$$$]on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I've read other books by Greg Iles and looked forward to this one. I got it in CD form, so I missed the warning that the author had in the book letting the reader know to open their minds. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to get better; all the while trying to figure out what was going on. I love mysteries and thrillers, but I truly dislike it when the solution is supernatural. I love the twists and turns of a good mystery; always wondering what is next. When I realized that the \\"solution\\" or \\"resolution\\" was about possession of another person's soul, I stopped listening to the book. What a waste of my time when I could have been reading/listening to another book. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"This is the third Greg Iles novel I've \\"read\\" via audiobook. The first two were interesting and believable. \\"Sleep,\\" however, was so bad that I'm reluctant to try another. The whole storyline seemed to be an excuse to describe various forms of sexual activity. Greg managed to make sex seem boring and mechanical. It led me to wonder if he knows what it's really about. In any event, the plot is completely unbelievable. I stuck with the story up through disc number 9, hoping that there would be some sign that there would be a logical resolution to the ridiculous story. There wasn't. I gave up at that point. On a positive note, I figure that if this tripe can sell, maybe I could make a good living writing. I'm quite capable of turning out garbage, but I'd have to work hard to come up with something this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't read this one FIRST of Iles' work","review":"I \\"discovered\\" Greg Iles last summer with his captivating and most creative \\"24 Hours\\" and could hardly wait to read more of his work. Soon found \\"The Quiet Game\\" and was captivated by it as well. When I found that \\"Sleep No More\\" was also set in Natchez, I eagerly pounced on it. I was pleased with the set-up and the rather wierd and offbeat plot line; was initially titillated and then only slightly put off by some of the lurid sexual content; and was actually anticipating a slam-bang of a finish. Wow, what a super disappointment! It looked to me like Greg realized that he had only 20 pages left and had to wrap things up and had little or no imagination left. Sometimes I find myself giving a book a \\"standing ovation\\" when I finish it - - - darn it, I wanted to throw this one over the backyard fence after finishing it. I won't give up on Greg Iles though. I am glad that this wasn't my FIRST novel by him - - otherwise I would likely read him no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad romance novel or psycho sexual garbage - You choose","review":"I would give this less than one star if that was possible. Greg Illes has written many entertaining books, but this one is unbelievably bad! The characters are not likable and the story line is too far fetched for anything, but science fiction. What a disappointment! Considering that I purchased this as a mystery I think I am owed a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Well....","review":"I started out enjoying this book, much like any other Greg Isles book. The plot line is interesting and keeps the book in your hands. But the ending became a bit too exhausting and a bit too fantasy.A good book, but my advice would be, don't let this be your first Greg Isles book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for this Greg Iles fan","review":"Because I didn't recall that any of Iles' other novels were about the supernatural, I kept expecting this mystery to have a real-life explanation. I wasn't sure what genre the book belonged to -- straight thriller or fantasy -- so I kept hanging on throughout this sluggish, repetitive novel to its disappointing end to find out. I felt no sympathy or empathy for any of the cardboard characters, and really didn't care what happened to them. There wasn't even much of the wonderful Natchez atmosphere I've always enjoyed in his other books. I hope Iles soon gets back to the kind of writing I've come to expect from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me uncomfortable","review":"I didn't like this book at all. First off, its more like science fiction than a mystery/thriller. Second, I did not like the way the author projected views on abortion. It made me uncomfortable to read the book. I do not wish to explore controversial topics while reading for pleasure. Additionally, the sexual stories made me uncomfortable. To sum it up, I did not empathize with any of the characters and it made it difficult to care what actually happened to them. This books was just too far-fetched in every respect to be interesting or enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway finished and I can't take any more!","review":"It's going in the charity box, and the fact that I wasted a few hours of my life on this boring, predictable, novel pains me more than the wasted eight dollars. I was impressed with his descriptions of Natchez, where I've lived, but that's about it.This was my first Greg Iles book, and will probably be my last. Spit on me once, shame on you . . . etc., and there are too many good books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A former Greg Iles fan","review":"I could hardly wait to get started with another book by Greg Iles as the past ones had been so enjoyable, but was I mistaken.

I'ld love another \\"Quiet Game.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Boring, Improved in the Middle, Ended Bad.","review":"I did not like this book at all. It took me 2 weeks to get through the first 70 boring pages. This book goes nowhere fast. Once it did get going there was some real potential. I zipped through the rest of the book. I was shocked this booked ended so silly. What a waste of time. This book was bizarre but not good. I would have given it more stars but the beginning was so slow and the end was such a let down that I did not have the heart to lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure garbage","review":"I am one of those people who always finish a book when I start it. I had been looking forward to this one because I have ewnjoyed the author's previous books, particularly the early ones. I have rarely come accross such a piece of nonsense and am heartily sorry that this book might because the author has had many prior successes. What a sell-out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep No More Will Keep You Awake Far Into the Night!","review":"Sleep No More by Greg Isles is a soulful chiller of a thriller.When John Waters, a happily married family man, is approached by a beautiful intriguing stranger who whispers one mysterious word--soon--his life takes an unexpected turn. Suddenly everything he knows as truth and reality spirals out of control as someone from his past reappears. But it is the way that she reappears that will shock you. And it is what she does next that will chill you even further.This novel is rather difficult to review without giving away the plot or the key mystery, but it is sure to give you goosebumps and you won't look at those around you the same way ever again. It is a mix of horror and suspense, a bit of fantastical and a ton of thriller, and overall, it's one novel you won't want to miss. Greg Isles keeps the tension taut until the bitter end. Kudos!~ Cheryl Kaye TardifAuthor of Divine Intervention"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum - Don't Bother","review":"As a Greg Iles fan I'm doubly disappointed with this trite novel. It concerns basically unlikable two-dimensional people, it takes forever to get going, and when it does - it's dull! This sort of yarn has been told many times and this version seems tired. He's stuck with a few loose ends at the end of the tale, and wraps them up a couple of paragraphs which make no sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable and Unbelievably Bad","review":"I never know what to expect from a Greg Isles novel. There have been a few wonderful experiences, some mediocre ones and this absolute shocker. I'm particularly bitter with Greg for involving Penn Cage in this one. Here was a character with credibility from previous novels, given a role that held out the expectation that sanity would eventually prevail; and what did he do, went along for the ride.If it takes 500 pages to make the point that holding the candle for an earlier \\"love\\" gets in the road of a mature relationship, perhaps Greg should take up poetry and try to achieve it in one page. As for the explanation as to why his DNA didn't match .... please!!!!Before I read another Greg Isles book, I'll make my wife read it first and only if she can assure me there is an element of credibility to the story will I invest my time in it.I'm going to need a double dose of George Pelacanos to get this out of my system, or maybe I'll watch the fifth series of The Wire."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLEEP NO MORE","review":"THIS IS FIFTH BOOK I'VE READ BY GREG ILES.

I kept waiting for the story to make sense and it just wouldn't. I finally skipped tape three to listen to tape four to see if it got better but it got worse. As I listened to the ending, I kept waiting for Mallory to enter the kitten and scratch his wife's eyes out. I am hopeful, however, that Greg Iles wrote this claptrap because he was under great pressure from his editors to produce, because he wanted to see how gullible people readers can be. Perhaps, he was ill and this was written by a ghost-writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books!","review":"I read this book in under a week simply because I couldn't put it down. It keeps you guessing the whole way. It was twisted and wild!! I didn't want to finish it because it was so good. It was different than anything else I've ever read. Definitely read this book :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm surprised that I liked it!","review":"I am not a reader of science fiction, nor am I a reader of \\"paranormal\\" type stuff. I'm just a straight Michael Connelly, Nelson DeMille type of guy. I read 24 Hours, The Quiet Game and Dead Sleep and listened to Sleep No More in unabridged audio. I was shocked that I actually enjoyed it...that I felt empathetic to the protagonist and didn't think that the premise was a complete turn-off. Don't let this book fool you. If you like a mystery with good strong characters, moral dilemmas, a little lawyer stuff and are not turned off by strong sexual scenes, you'll like this, despite the \\"out of body\\" stuff. As a person that would never read a book not grounded in reality, I surprisingly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Iles","review":"Go ahead and read other Iles. This is by far the one that tells it all. If you have lost a lover/been a lover/you're probably going to relate. Who wouldn't want their dead in the ground lover to reincarnate...and I read plenty of paranormal. But Greg takes it to the moon and beyond. Brilliant insight. In fact I copied his quote from \\"The Bladerunner\\" as a possible headstone piece on my just late husband's grave....sad no? No he was very young and he was a bright flame. The question is, where does Greg get all this insight? I bought every one of his books thereafter. Try the audio. Dick Hill who does his audio is amazing. The southern accent is seething..ooh very real. You will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read","review":"Disappointing. That sums it up. Story seems to be a psycho-sexual knock off of \\"Fallen\\" and doesn't even come close to engaging the reader. First few chapters are sluggish, and the storyline just doesn't come off being anything other than the author's fantasies being peddled as fiction. Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I buy the wrong book?","review":"First, I want to say how much I LOVE Greg Iles. I have read many of his books (The Quiet Game, 24 Hours, Mortal Fear & Dead Sleep). He is an AMAZING writer, very good at suspense. This book confused me. I found that I couldn't concentrate. I was trying to figure out if it was all a hoax (the main plot--the \\"dead\\" ex-girlfriend) or if I should just roll with the punches. I was very surprised as to how much sexual content this book contained - no, I am not a prude.I just finished this book today, and if I had to sum up my comments in a word - that word would be disappointed. While reading the book I came up with numerous endings (in my head) none of which happened. I think this book could have definately ended better. And I think I prefer a good old fashioned Murder Mystery. I just didn't get what he was trying to accomplish with this book. I will continue to buy his books, hoping to get a clue:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Iles!","review":"Greg Iles has been one of my favorite authors. However, this one totally disappointed me. I hated the fact that the protagonist was so wrapped up in his prior \\"love life\\" that he couldn't recognize the worth of his present marriage. I do not wish to give too much away, but his whole story-line was ridiculous. Unless I am reading science fiction, I hate for anauthor to go beyond the realm of reality. Sorry. Iles prefaced his book with a thank you and an apology. He stated that he appreciated the fact that his readers let him delve into unchartered waters...that he could experiment with new topics. Greg, this just didn't make it for me. It was a tiresome, long-lasting read. I'm glad I'm done. It became a chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jarring departure","review":"I found this to be a jarring departure from Iles' books where Penn Cage is the main character. I thought I had signed on for another interesting mystery, not a supernatural book. It was like an adult \\"Twilight.\\" Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too strange for me...","review":"I've read many of Greg Iles' books and have enjoyed all of them until I got to this one. I wasn't expecting a supernatural book and it was almost painful to get through because of the ridiculousness of the plot. I am definitely going to read reviews on his books before starting another one. If you like science fiction then this is a good book for you but when you are expecting a suspenseful thriller like I was, you will probably be disappointed. I kept hoping that the story would turn around and there would be a logical explanation for everything but sadly, it never came. I would skip this book and try one of his other ones which are much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, Boring","review":"I purchased this book used for a buck, and I'm glad I didn't pay more for it. I bought it because I liked Spandau Phoenix by the same author, and it seemed to have good reviews. I'm an avid reader but this book is one of the few that I just didn't like. I guessed the plot within the first couple of chapters, and then the whole thing was just waiting for a lot of over-done sex scenes to occur and the main character's life to fall apart. No surprise there. The plot idea is dumb overall.I actually spent the last 1/4 of the book just skimming the paragraphs as it wasn't worth my time to read.Poor read--don't waste your time. There's plenty of better books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of the author, and was happy to discover one of his works I had missed. The plot is odd, to say the least. I thought I had accidentally picked up a book by an cheap imitator of Mr. Iles....but no. It looks like Mr. Iles was testing the Stephen King waters with this one. Sorry, sir....stick to what you know.I kept plowing along, however....waiting for the novel to finish with a great twist that would bring it back to earth and sense. Alas, it was not to be. I threw it in the trash where it belongs. I am still irritated that I gave it so much time.The main character in the novel is a spirit that jumps from body to body at the moment of sexual ecstasy. Let us hope that the plotline of this book does not jump from novel to novel at the point of terminal boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I've read several other Iles' books and liked them OK. This one stunk. Period. Not a fan of supernatural stories and kept hoping that the story would return to something believable, but it never did; in fact, it got more and more farfetched. Absolutely awful book.

I am almost finished with this book, having about 100 pages to go and I don't know if I'm going to finish it. It started out with a good premise but has turned into an uninteresting bit of pap. Mr. Iles should leave this genre up to Mr. King and stick to what he knows best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was in this book. After reading the other books written by Greg Iles and combing different stores awaiting its arrival, this book was not at all what I expected. To say the least, it was a disappointment. The plot was wholly unbelievable and completely unrealistic, even for a fiction novel. Perhaps the thing I found most unpleasant was the fact that the characters were doing the horizontal hokey pokey on every other page. This story was so bad that I didn't even bother to finish it, which is a first for me. For these reasons, I give \\"Sleep No More\\" one star, though I am not even sure it deserves that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-Fi or Fantasy","review":"It was a bit interesting, but only as escapism.

Not to be recommended except to someone who has absolutely nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"I am big Iles fan and I really enjoyed some of his other books, especially Blood Memory and the Quiet Game, but the premise of this one is so absurd that it makes any tension in the book fail, and although I cared about the characters, I failed to find any of them believable because of this whole soul switching business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book!","review":"\\"Sleep No More\\" was in good condition, though it was clear that it was a used volume. It proved satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not enjoy this book very much. It starts out somewhat interesting, but never really takes off. There seems to be a lot of building up to something big which never happens. The idea of the story isn't bad, and the characters and settings are interesting, but the events which take place are very anticlimatic. Even the sexiest parts leave you a little \\"unsatisfied.\\" I kept hoping with each chapter that it would explode and have a powerful ending. Unfortunately, it was a very weak ending - kind of like a dud firecracker on the 4th of July!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment!","review":"I have always adored Greg Iles as a writer and have read all of his books. Of course, I was excited by a new book from him but that excitement did not last long. The book was beautifully written and edited as usual (editing is always high on my list!) but that is the end of the good things I can say about it. To use the term \\"far-fetched\\" is, well, far-fetched. The plot to me is so implausible that I can not even say, \\"Well, OK, I can see where he is coming from.\\" I can't and, although, half way through, I thought he was going to pull himself out of the miasma, he didn't. I kept reading because I just KNEW he was going to redeem himself but he didn't. Greg, you can do much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Greg Iles' Best Book","review":"I absolutely love Greg Iles' books. I've read all of his books except for two, and this one is NOT one I would recommend for a first time reader. The premise made me nervous from the get-go because I had the sense it would not be a 'sturdy' plot and would have silly loopholes as well as a non-gratifying ending. I guess he took a walk on the wild side, but I hope he stays away from this type of thing in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Genre Than Earlier Works","review":"\\"Sleep No More\\" was disappointing and dissatisfying when compared to \\"Mortal Fear\\", \\"Black Cross\\", \\"Spandau Phoenix\\" and \\"The Quiet Game\\". The cover endorsement by Stephen King should have been enough indication, but I didn't take heed. I have no objection to the premise of the book, and didn't find \\"Sleep No More\\" disturbing or even mildly unsettling. Worse, I found the plot tedious and the characters not the intelligent residents of Mr. Iles' previous writings cited above. I could put \\"Sleep No More\\" down and wait days to read more, and that was very disappointing because I stayed up until 2:00 a.m. reading his earlier books. Don't expect the same style, concise story-telling, crisp plot and language, or characters of Greg Iles' earlier stories. If you like basic horror/fantasy, you might enjoy \\"Sleep No More.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get. I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end. It was. Don't waste your time. This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The supernatural was a turn-off","review":"I am a Greg Isles fan. I've read 5 of his other books and loved them. I was unprepared for the supernatural/science fiction element to this book. Good characters. I really like his writing style but the premise of this book was just too far-fetched and quite raunchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was disappointed by the ending of this book. I kept hoping that this would not end as a 'supernatural' or 'otherworldly' type story. I have enjoyed all of the G. Iles books that I have read, including this one until I realized the direction that this book was taking. It actually is an addictive and exciting story, yet not the way I wished for it to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible","review":"Iles is good writer, he can put a sentence together and doesn't seem to abuse personal pronouns. However this novel has a most implausible plot. A dead women and a supernatural phenomenon triggered by orgasm. I kept thinking as I read that a plot outcome that made sense or was logical in the real world would eventually emerge but disappointingly this was not to be. In addition, the childish morality play near the end was pathetic - to paraphrase 'Sybil must die to save our marriage because our marriage is sacred'. Sybil being an innocent in the bizarre plot. There were lots of sex scenes but they lacked eroticism and were boring after multiple repetitions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing for Iles","review":"I'm a real fan of Greg Iles, but this book was a big disappointment. If you like nonstop sex crossed with The Body Snatchers, you just might enjoy this book. But I found it very trite. OK, I admit I finished it, just to find out what happens to Malory, but it was painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, not up to usual par","review":"While this was a good, gripping read, the story was not up to Iles' usual standards.That knocks it down a star, but the quality of the writing, not the plausability of the story, provide huge enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Pretenses","review":"I feel that somebody owes me [$$]. I purchased this book in the Mystery section of the book store. If I had wanted science fiction I would have gone to that section. I have been a fan of Greg Iles and was thrilled to find SLEEP NO MORE on the shelf. The book starts off great with the protaganist, John Waters, coaching his little girl's soccer team. It has a very authentic feel - as does the description of his marriage, his partnership, and his business. However, very soon there are identities transferring in and out of other bodies - even genders! One of the satisfactions of reading a good mystery is trying to predict what will happen, who did it, why did they do it and will they get away with it. In this book, since logic is absent, there is no satisfaction. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep No More","review":"As I was reading it I gave it a 5 star reveiw. I could not put it down. The ending I felt, robbed me, it was the biggest anti climax I have every had. I think the author thought of the plot but couldn'y explain it away without resorting to fanatasy/science fiction. I wanted to read a thriller, that was plausable, this just wasn't for me. Unless you are in to fantasy/science fiction and all things that can not be explained forget this book. I was desperate to get to the end where I thought all would become clear. This did not happen. When I got to the end of the book I slammed the book shut and swore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep No More","review":"First, let me admit that I read more literature than best sellers. But a year ago, I discovered that Greg Iles told great stories -- not great literature but fun-to-read pageturners. With his latest novel, however, he lost me! Sleep No More is supernatural nonsense with a focus on sex lives of a bunch of poorly developed and stupid characters. Hard as I tried, I couldn't suspend belief and kept betting on an ending that counted on conspiracy -- not the ability of a totally unlikeable dead character to enter the souls of the living! Absurd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beach Read","review":"The plot was excellent; although it was a stretch to sell the idea that the soul could pass to another body during a climax, but then it's fiction. I would have given this book 5 stars but I thought the ending was anti-climatic. I don't know how the author could have ended it without his wife dying, but I had a hard time accepting that Mallory would still continue to be there. Could it be that the author wants to continue the story at a later date???? I smell another book. I found the story very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cabinet Latches","review":"Latches were very affordable, however, some have broken after installation, or become damaged closing doors. Others seem to fail when door is opened, while others work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"These type of latches used to be the only thing you could buy. We thought that since they were cheaper, we would give them a shot. So we installed them on the cabinet below the sink where we kept all our cleaning supplies, as do many other people. Everytime we went for the Dawn or dishwashing detergent, we would forget they are on there and it would get jerked out of our hand because we didn't unlatch it. They are aggrevating, but once you are used to them okay for the adult. However, my little son can still get the cabinet door open just enough and then get his little hand in there and still bring out detergent, bleach and other items that will fit through the opening. We used the magnet latches on everything else. A little more pricey, but worth it.

There are next to no new revelations about the case. Instead, the author rehashes Tupac Shakur's murder and then goes into completely unrelated information about Biggie's producer Puffy Combs to fill up the last chapters. Some of the interviews with Biggie's mother, Voletta Wallace, are interesting but that's the only positive thing about the book which is repetitive and extremely poorly written. As far as writing style, it may be the poorest writing I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Day The Music Died","review":"Author Cathy Scott travels over the terrain of the murders of Biggie Smalls and Tupac in a page-turner that attempts to make sense of a sordid period in the music industry, with two young artists paying the price for the pomposity of pop culture.If a reader is looking for explosive new revelations, then the street will ultimately be a dead end. But this volume strips away the myths and rumors & delves into the facts surrounding the unsolved crimes - with the focus on Biggie Smalls - and the vast potential that violently died through the barrels of smoking guns."},{"rating":"1","title":"and other issues","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I thought the book would be about BIG, but the book focused on people who really didn't have anything to do with him. The book doesn't focus on Christopher Wallace, instead it tells more about Tupac, Orlando Anderson, and other unimportant people. A lot of things are mentioned six times in the book. There are few new details. What I would have liked was more about his childhood, as Voletta Wallace is a source that shouldn't have been a problem. What exactly happened that night? Some people are keeping their mouth shut and that is a real shame. BIG is still the greatest, he should have gotten more respect than this, not only from Cathy Scott, but also from his \\"friends\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"This book was very redundant, with the same facts and quotes used much too often. It also seemed to focus more on Tupac Shakur, Suge Knight, and Orlando Anderson than Biggie himself, which is puzzling to me since the author makes the point that none of the three had any connection to \\"the murder of Biggie Smalls.\\" The book also gives no clear theory on his murder and basically is just a reprinting of the events of the past few years with several factual errors.

The only reason I didn't give it 5-stars is because he doesn't discuss the full range of scriptural teaching on the kingdom of God.

I must say that I like them much better than I did when I first heard them, the problem is, that I bought this album for Tom Waits, and I personally don't think her voice compliments his as well as Bette Midler (from \\"Foreign Affairs\\"). Her singing is not bad by any means, I simply prefer Tom Waits by himself, and there are solo Tom songs on this album which make it well-worth the cheap cost of the album. Overall, something that should be viewed separately from Tom Waits' other albums, but that is not to say that it should be ignored, this is a great bunch of songs, I just personally can't get into Crystal Gayle.

It's not a problem though, for the most part. I am using them as a liner in my scuba diving dry suit and they work good for that purpose. I also just finished a campout in the snow (with Boy Scouts). I used these liners in my Gortex mitten gloves. Yeah, there was extra room in the liners, but the liners did exactly what I needed - extra warmth. I gave the gloves a 4 because of the sizing issue.

The shapes should be just a tiny bit smaller, sometimes if they're at a slight angle it seems they don't want to fit, very frustrating for a small child who is actually trying to put the right shape in the right hole, but it won't fit.

There is a lot for a child to learn with this very simple toy.By the way, my daughter loves this toy and stores many other small toys in the box. It's like her own baby toy box. At 11 months she tries to fit the shapes into the sorter. Currently, I am watching her finger dexterity get better as she is finally able to manuever the shapes into the holes.

Hans Zimmer is one composer that I will almost alway pick up no matter what the movie is (he's no John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but then again who is?). The Da Vinci Code is not his usual action epic and he composes with a less militaristic and less rapid pace than usual, and it pays off well. It is a movie score where one can enjoy 90% of the tracks whether or not they've seen the movie. Track 13 is the best of the score and well worth the price of the CD. Not Zimmer's best, but a hell of a good listen and well worth the price.

I am re listening to it for the third time and even if nothing stands out as a theme, overall it's perfect background for the novel and the story. And that is what a soundtrack should be in the first place. The tone is somber but also mystical and almost sacred. Strings are a perfect choice and Hans Zimmer does a wonderful job overall! Each track has a spirif of its own. 13 tracks appear in the film and each is a step towards enlightment.

The bent position lasts for hundreds of throws and catches and grass landings -- we just bend it that way once and then play with it for the day.This is great to keep in the car. For my littlest son, we stand close together and just play catch back and forth -- he likes to catch it by popping his fist through the ring as it gets close.

It is to the point now (after 6 months) where it will not hold a charge at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement battery for Norelco shaver","review":"Replaced because the original battery, which was several years old, only lasted a few shaves without requiring charging. Replacing it was not too difficult. I soldered the new one in. I can't see much change in performance. Still only lasts 2-3 shaves before it runs weakly and the red charge light comes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lasting","review":"This pack had a slightly lower voltage than the original batteries and hence the razor did not spin as fast, which was issue #1. You try shaving with a slow electric razor and see how it works - instead of cutting, it pulls. However, after about two months, these batteries would not even hold a charge, which was issue #2. Actually, that is not quite correct - oddly, they hold a charge at a very low voltage for quite a long time. In fact, the razor will still turn on weeks after I charge it. However, when it turns on it runs so slowly that it is unusable. I end up plugging it in to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco Battery Pack","review":"Sorry, but this new shaver battery pack simply did not work out for me. I hate it because I really like that old shaver better than the newer models. I could not get the tabs on the new battery pack to make a proper connection that would hold. After several tries to make such a connection, per the instructions, one of the new contacts simply broke off. Sounds like I am a real clutz, but not so with most \\"do it yourself\\" matters such as this. I think you are rolling the dice to make these contacts work, but some of you more gifted will surely triumph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed to work at first but then died","review":"These batteries seemed to be working fine when I initially installed them.

But the battery life was terrible, it would stop running with 17 minutes of life showing on the meter. If you have moderate desoldering/soldering skills the replacement doesn't take long. The new battery made a huge difference, the charge life is back to like new and the shaver runs stronger longer. Money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived shaver battery","review":"I am very disappointed with the performance of this battery. After less than one year I am shopping for another replacement. The battery originally installed in the shaver lasted for many years (5-10, I don't know how long I've had it). I expected the same from this battery. Lately it requires frequent charging and dies very suddenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries didn't last","review":"I purchased this battery pack back in 2009, and two years later I am already looking for replacements.

I'm hesitant to buy these batteries again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother...","review":"I had my 5603x for seven years and replaced the heads once. That worked out to about twelve bucks a year for a great shave! When the batteries finally gave out, I looked into replacing them too, but when I opened the shaver up and saw what would be involved, including the \\"time to do it\\", (isn't 'planned obsolescence' great!! )I figured buying a new one would be doing my part to help the economy anyway, so \\"why bother\\" with such a tedious task and risk damaging other parts in the process(and then what!?). It would have been just as easy for Norelco to make the shaver with \\"snap in\\" batteries (maybe easier!) but they need us to buy new ones for their bottom line!! Hopefully my new one will last as long and perform as well as this one did....RIP 5603x!!

I didn't want to risk unsoldering the old battery from the circuit board because I thought the risk of buggering the circuit board too great. Instead I used a Dremel tool to cut off the old battery leads at the battery connections. This entailed very carefully cutting the top off of the old batteries and then trimming. It was not a trivial task but not impossible. Then I gently blew the inside of the shaver out with compressed air to remove any metal shavings and other debris. Once this was complete it was easy to solder the new battery leads to the old batter leads, reassemble the shaver and charge the battery the conventional way. It works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivered on time, worked as expected.","review":"My shaver is like new.

My son falls everytime he tries to use it and has given up.The ball worked for us when spun, but it stopped working completely after about 2 months. We cannot return it to the store as the country we live in does not have good consumer laws.

He is ok with it for about 3 minutes a day, then he is bored with it. I wanted something with music to stimulate him to walk. The outside of the box and the instruction insert states that the music playes when either the ball is spun or the toy is walked. WRONG!!! It NEVER plays when the ball is spun and only plays when they toy is jarred or dropped from more than 6 inches high. I called FP and they said We know. The ball does not play the music. It needs to be moved roughly, it is a complaint on record... This product is terrible. On top of the music function not working, it is too light, and tips if my son even leans on it (and he is only 15 lbs!). The wheels move way too fast to help then learn.

The toy is very cheaply made; the wheels are hollow plastic and skid easily on carpet and bare floors; It's not balanced for pulling up on. Every time my son tried to pull himself up using the handle, The toy would flip up. When we finally got my son standing and hanging onto the handle, the toy would fly out from under him- even with me holding onto the front side while he tried to walk and push.

The wheels aren't supposed to have resistance. My son isn't much interested in the activities on the front, but he was when he was learning to crawl.Accidents happen, and if your kid falls on any toy, it's going to hurt him unless it's padded like a pillow.

As soon as I put her in her carseat, she starts to smile and coo at her reflection. I only use the lights and music when she gets fussy, and it has kept her calm for many car rides. I love that it has a volume control - so many toys only have one setting that is usually way too loud. The only change I would make would be to turn on the music at the mirror also, instead of only being able to use the remote. I wish I would have had something like this when my 5-year old & 3-year old were babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dangerous","review":"I thought it was just me, but just like another reviewer, mine got overheated and started to smell like it was on fire - and it wasn't even turned on, it just had batteries in it for 5 minutes!! Luckily, I didn't spend my money, it was a gift. DO NOT buy this, it needs to be recalled. And what bright light decided that it needs to have two different sizes of batteries, like I have nothing else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a while but remote turns it on, but not off","review":"I bought mine March 9, 2009 and it's August 7, 2009 and it no longer works. The remote with very fresh batteries will turn the music on, but you have to shut it off manually. The music is annoying so leaving it on after the baby has gone to sleep can drive you nuts. I did really like it at first though. It takes some adjusting and it does tend to move around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blocks view","review":"This mirror is really cute but it completely blocks my view when driving. It also moves around when you turn corners and is difficult to get to stay in place. I have a mid-sized SUV and found this mirror dangerous and way too big. I do not recommend it for a car but we are using in the crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...","review":"I bought one of these from Amazon... the lights and music didn't work.

Same thing: lights and music didn't work.I thought I must be doing something wrong, but I had my husband try it, different batteries, etc. No go.

It has to be pointed exactly at the right spot or it won't work. I could see myself getting into an accident while driving, so I brought it back.

Stick with the basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a mirror","review":"This is great to use as a mirror, but worthless otherwise.

I like the remote because as soon as the baby falls asleep I can turn it off without disturbing her or reaching in the back seat.

But other than that it's a pretty cool mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS MIRROR","review":"THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT... it fit perfectly in the middle of the bench seat in my trailblazer and the mirror is big enough that I can see my son perfectly...He absolutly loves this mirror, with the lights and music...I love the remote...so if he falls asleep I can turn it off/on without stopping the car!!

I liked the idea of being able to see him while driving. Unfortunately it didn't work out that way. Before he was born I wiped off the mirror with a soft dry cloth and it scratched so badly I couldn't see anything. I decided to use it anyway for the lights and sounds but, like others, I couldn't get the remote to work.

I am planning on returning it.First I am petit and there is no way I can place the mirror in a way where I can look at the baby and at the same time see the road behind. I have to get up a little bit from the seat and then pull back the car seat canopy, only to see a blurred image of my baby. Of course I can only do this when I am at a light and not driving, which becomes painfull when I am on the highway.Second, its cool you can set the mirror to music, lights, or both.

The remote doesn't fit anywhere, it won't shut off by itself so the batteries keep wearing out, and the music won't play. I've only had it 2 months and haven't had it working more then 1-2 times. I'm going to return it to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in middle seat","review":"Upon installing our car seat in the middle seat in the back, as directed, we found we absolutely could not get this mirror to stay with only using the clamp as it states in the directions. There was nothing to connect the hook and strap onto on either of our cars and we are extremely disappointed. I do not feel the clamp is a safe way to attach the mirror because, in an accident or a hard breaking situation, the mirror would fly forward striking the baby. The mirror would work well on either of the side seats, but not in the middle. I'm taking it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The Sounds n' Lights Deluxe Auto Mirror by Fisher Price is a waste of money, in my opinion. I am able to see my son in the mirror but his face looks so small. The batteries in the mirror must be replaced at least 1-2 times/week in order to keep the sounds and lights coming!! My son does like to look at the bright colors surrounding the mirror (that would be my only positive feedback)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE OR APPROVED BY CHP!","review":"I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile, possibly injuring or killing your child. DO NOT BUY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fit for an SUV","review":"My wife and I have two SUVs and the car seat is installed in the middle seat. The problem with this mirror is that it does not stay in place. The bendable mounting bracket is not helpful as it does not grip the seat very well because each time the vehicle moves forward, the mirror would fall off (backwards). It comes with a tether strap, but that is also useless because the strap is behind the mirror to prevent it falling forward. If we situate the mirror forward enough so that it doesn't fall backwards, then it becomes too low to view through the rear view mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Money On This One","review":"We've only had the mirror for 3 weeks. I love the large mirror size, but as others said in their reviews, it isn't worth the money. The mirror itself is very easily scratched and ruined. I cleaned it with a very soft cotton cloth and it is so hazy I can hardly see the baby. The batteries run out because it doesn't stay turned off, it keeps coming back on by itself. The music has now stopped working and the lights are not bright enough during the day to do any good.We are returning it to the store and getting another brand. I should have read the reviews here first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirror ruined before I could use it.....","review":"I took the product out of the box, put in the batteries, and loved how it worked with the remote. I took the film off of the mirror and it was smudged. I went to clean it, and the mirror was ruined first thing. It was scratched by anything I tried to clean it with. It said soft cloth, but anything you use just basically scratches it up or makes it very blurry.I was given this as a gift, so I really don't know where it came from and since I am the one that ruined it, I'm not sure if I can take it back.Like I said, I loved the remote, the lights, the music....but the mirror itself is VERY cheap and can be ruined very easily. it's not worth it, because you are going to have to clean it eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"battery operated","review":"This toy was a gift from a baby shower in June. I recently opened the box and put in brand new batteries. The music and lights worked fine for at least three car drives. Now it doesn't work properly.

I won't confess how many times I actually pulled over on the side of the road to check everything out....oh dear!I bought this, my husband had to prop it up a bit with a little burp cloth tucked underneath to position it correctly, but other than that it works great. I love it, I can see her very clearly (the mirror is bigger than most) and the music is not too annoying.Great purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big mistake","review":"Bought this for all the same reasons as the others..colors, sounds, big mirror. BIG mistake. I also have an SUV, it does not stay in place. Have to use towels etc. to even come close to a good view. The remote...what a joke. Ya it works if I'm sitting in the back seat and can be right next to the sensor. It does not work. The lights are only really visible at night, the music is not even something that would be nice for a baby. And for the price too expensive for such a disappointment. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective?","review":"the first time i put this in my car i thought i was just being dumb about installing it. after the 4th time trying to install it, i finally got it to stay in the position i wanted. yet the second i had to stop, it flew back wards and never bounced back. the \\"lullaby's\\" that come out are horrible little sounds. when i was in the store looking at it, i thought it would be a awesome mirror due to the size of it and it lights up and plays music, but boy, was i wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"I bought this thinking the lights and music would help keep my little one entertained when he got fussy. Well, if the lights would work, maybe it would be worth the money! The lights did not work one first one we bought. The second one we got as a replacement actually worked well for about a month before a couple of lights went out.Don't bother calling Fisher Price to let them know about any problems, they will just give you a number to the company that licensed the Fisher Price name for this product. The company is called Blue Ridge, but don't bother calling. They will not call you back.I gave this product 2 stars because it did keep my son slightly interested. Don't spend the extra money for the lights and music, just get a basic mirror and you will be better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Wonderful Mirror","review":"I really love having a mirror in the back seat so that I can keep my son in view. I gave our first mirror to my parents after we bought this one and have regretted it ever since. I do like the shape of the mirror. I can see my son better than I could before. However I spent quite a bit of $$$ because of the lights and the music. Not worth it at all. There is only one song which just repeats itself over and over, driving everyone in the car crazy. The lights do not help you see the baby at all. The mirror also scratched a lot when I put the batteries in, so now I can't see my son after dark even with the interior car lights on. I was really disappointed with this mirror, but would suggest the basic version that Fisher Price offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by cheap mirror","review":"This item did not last a day. My husband got a few fingerprints on the mirror while installing it. I tried to clean following the directions and the surface of the mirror was ruined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car companion","review":"This is a wonderful mirror for those babies that have to sit facing the back of the seat. My little girl is just enthralled with the lights and sounds, it makes riding in the car a whole lot more fun. The remote was a great idea, I just wish they had volume control on the remote as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"The mirror is a great idea...in actuality it is not as great as it seems. The visor clip on the back of the remote is way to slim. Like others have said, it atkes a lot of batteries and drains them, when the mirror becomes smudged it is then pretty much useless and the mirror is very difficult to postion. I had purchased this mirror with my second son and now I do not use it I had to rummage for the Elmo mirror I used with my first son, I recommend that one its cheaper and simpler, spend the extra money on toys"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves this","review":"I have a 6 month old and we got this when he was born. He's always loved it (and mommy does too). Now he looks into and just sings and talks to himself. So cute!Sometimes I use the music when he's fussy or something, but not everytime we're in the car. He doesn't get bored with it very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps baby entertained","review":"This mirror works so well! From the time I brought my son home from the hospital he hated riding in the car. He would scream the whole time. When I put this mirror in the back seat, it entertained him immediately. It is remote control activated so I can shut it on and off when I need to. The mirror is big as well so I can watch every move that he makes. The characters on the sides light up. This is a must have. I dont' have one complaint about this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I didn't get much use out of this b/c when it was time to switch over to our particular convertible car seat, there was no way to safely anchor the mirror as well (b/c a tether came over the top and side of the car seat to the anchor in back.)So I was going to sell the mirror, but then I touched the mirror with my hand (I guess I had lotion on??) and there was a huge black smear. So I tried to get the smear off with window cleaner, and that made the whole mirror worse, so now it's all foggy!Also, the remote didn't come even close to fitting on my visor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose something else - this is not a good design!","review":"I bought this toy for our baby and have discovered some major design flaws - the biggest being unable to turn this toy on (at all) without the remote!!! So, having misplaced the remote for a time - i can't even turn it on. Had I wanted just a mirror I could have found something much less expensive. Another flaw is that you have to remember to slide the power switch over when you put the baby in the car or even the remote doesn't work (if you haven't lost it). And finally, it does not position well for baby to see into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Worthless Thing!","review":"Like many other parents who bought this, I see, I feel this is an absolute WASTE of money (and time). I bought one when my daughter was 3 months and rear-facing so that I could see her when I was driving. I brought the 1st one back b/c the remote stopped working after the 1st week. I changed the batteries 3 times but it still didn't work. I exchanged it for the exact same thing - thinking it was just a fluke - and WHAMMO, same thing! My daughter is now almost 1-year old and I've basically only ever used the mirror part which isn't even that great. What a waste of $$$. When it did work, the music/remote was fine. But in both cases, it was very short-lived. Save your money and buy a much better mirror without all the bells and whistles...at the very least, don't buy this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesson learned","review":"My child had really enjoyed having a toy attached to his infant car seat so when he advanced to the larger car seat I wanted something to entertain him. I thought it was probably pretty mind numbing to sit and look at the back of a seat! I thought he would enjoy this because of the music, lights, bright colors etc but he could really care less. Not to mention I can't get the thing to stay attached. Despite numerous attempts I could not get it to stay in my small car so I moved it to my husband's larger SUV. Although better, it still falls down frequently and there is no way the remote will clip on the sun visor. It really wouldn't matter if it did, it won't work unless it is directly pointed at the mirror. I think I'll keep searching for something to entertain him while traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY works w/Remote!!!","review":"We bought this for our son about 3 monthes ago & he really likes it. He likes to follow the lights & listen to the music. I like that the mirror is big enougth for me to see him in. I also really like that it has a volume control dial for the music & not just a high & low setting.However, this mirror will only turn on by using the remote. Something I didn't know when I purchased it. Otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. There is no on switch for the music or lights on the mirror itself.Also, I have found that the remote will not work if it gets cold. So, I can't leave the remote in the car, I have to either bring it into the house or put into the diaper bag. Sometimes the remote is left behind & I have no way to turn the mirror on. I am then left with an overpriced mirror. That is the biggest flaw that I have found in this mirror & to me it is a big oversight."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Dangerous","review":"I bought this for my grandson. We hadn't set it up in the car yet, thankfully. I had turned it on and was holding for the baby to look at. I turned it off and set it down next to me. I started smelling something strange, like melting plastic. I asked my son if he noticed the smell. He started looking around and he picked up the mirror and realized that the battery compartment was so hot the plastic was melting. He immediately romoved the batteries and I will be taking it back.I tried going to the fisher-price website to report this problem, but they don't have any way of doing that. But I did get an 800 number I plan to call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Idea, would give as a toy","review":"This is a nice toy, however it eats batteries. It is best when used for infants. Our baby liked it for about the first 3 months, but lost interest in the lights after that. she continued to like the mirror until she went into the convertable seat; now she can't see the mirror due to her angle. Would give this to a friend as a shower gift. Good quality and nice toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassel!","review":"SO we were taking a very long, very boring car trip and I thought that having a mirror with lights and sounds would work wonders for our 4 month old. It would have been helpful if it had WORKED. We stop four times at different Walmarts along the way (where I purchased the first) and NONE of them worked. I talked to one lady who said that she had already had 3 returned that morning. Save yourself the hassle and buy a different mirror!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! I should have listened to the reviews","review":"I put the batteries in and nothing works! No lights, no music, I could have just purchased a $1.99 drugstore mirror and mounted it on the headrest. I'm especially irked because I live in the Middle East and paid all this money to have it shipped here and it doesn't even work. What a waste of money.Please note that this actually isn't manufactured by Fisher Price; the name is licensed. I actually called Fisher Price to tell them that this company, Blue Ridge, is giving Fisher Price a bad name! I read the reviews on this and knew what I was getting myself into, but thought oh, since I generally have good luck with products, it'll be OK. Actually, it's not OK! I emailed Blue Ridge to tell them about this issue. It seems as though the receiver on the mirror is defective. We'll see what they have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me from worrying","review":"I got this mirror when my daughter was four months old. Initially we got it because she hated riding in the car seat, and we hoped the sound and lights would distract her. It did the trick sometimes, but not always. Eventually the batteries wore out, and we didn't replace them since my daughter didn't mind the car as much anymore. However, the best part about this mirror is that I can SEE my daughter. I can't imagine going in any car without taking this mirror along with me. I have never had trouble with it staying up.My daughter is old enough to be forward facing now, but since I always have the peace of mind of being able to see her then we haven't switched her from the rear facing mode (which evidently is safer anyway). I highly recommend this product if only because of the mirror feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Thing Sucks","review":"I have twins and I purchased 2 of these to go in the back of my minvan. I liked them because they were so big and the carseats were on the last row. I thought these things would be perfect. I never once got either of them to work properly. If you didn't turn it off on the mirror then the batteries would run down within hours even though it was not playing. The damn things would never stay in place. One of them actually fell off and hit my son. I wrote Fisher Price and they sent me two replacement mirrors that still did not work. So I took all 4 mirrors back to Toys R Us and got store credit. Please do not buy this mirror!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return twice!","review":"I am 9 months pregnant and saw this mirror at toys r us and fell in love with it. When i went home to put batteries in it the mirror would not activate so i figured i had to use the remote to activate it. But when i tried to put batteries in the remote the top screw would not unscrew. It turned in a circle 100 times and did nothing. I thought perhaps i got a defective one so i exchanged it at toys r us and to my dissatisfaction, when i returned home with what i thought was a new mirror, i opened the box and the remotes screws were completely stripped. Someone must have has the same \\"defective\\" problem as i, and toys r us just put it right back on the shelf!

Music is not as loud as it should be so as to be able to hear it, my baby prefers me to sing. The mirror does not look the way it does in the Internet, it is boring and has no fun for a baby.

The retractable hook is nice because it can pivot 360 degrees and can be retracted flush with case. So it doesn't get caught in tight spaces, like both of my corded lights. The light produced is as bright as both of my corded fluorescent lights.The only drawback with this light is, there is no warning when battery gets low. The light just goes out!!!

I am a huge fan of GitS and like this movie thoroughly. In my opinion though the story did not warrant a movie, as it doesn't come close to the other two GitS movies both visually and in story. Also, the story seemed a little off to me, I don't know if it was intentional given the plot line (don't want to spoil it for you).Pretty good overall though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding addition to any dvd collection","review":"For those unfamiliar with the premise of the \\"ghost in the shell\\" franchise, it is based in the future focusing on the trials and tribulations of an elite crime-fighting group known as Section 9.Solid State Society is a direct to dvd movie based on the \\"stand alone complex\\" TV series which, itself, was a spin-off from the original 1995 film.I won't go into the plot details but i will tell you as far as anime films go this is one of the best around. With an intellectual story that incorporates numerous themes and action that, for it's modest budget, is quite impressive.Finally, the DVD includes both Japanese & English audio in DTS 5.1. So if you are an anime collector, I'm probably telling you everything you already know. If you are yet to be introduced to the wonderful world of anime, this maybe the movie that gets the ball rolling...."},{"rating":"1","title":"would be 5 stars but...","review":"I am a huge fan of the GITS series, but when I purchased this DVD I encountered a gread deal of digital interference, leading eventually to an unplayable disk approx. 10 minutes into the film. No system is perfect, I figure, so I chalk it up to a defective copy and order a replacement. What do I find? Same problem, just 30 minutes into the film instead of 10. From what I saw, the story is great and the animation is excellent; overall, an excellent addition to the series. Thus, it would get 5 stars, but two DVDs (both purchased new) that are unplayable drops it down (even only seeing 30 minutes of it, it doesn't deserve a 1 star rating, to hell if I didn't get to see the entire movie)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"I'd have to agree with others who have described this movie as more of an extended television episode.

The movie started off okay, pacing was good, direction, cinematography, etc was fine and I liked the awkwardness of the film (film had a \\"realness\\" to it that most films like this just lack. You had a feeling of how the film was going to proceed and it was okay up until the first 60 minutes. Then the film just took a really dark turn that didn't quite match the tone of the first 60 minutes. And then they do something pretty bad with one of the likable characters and they basically burn the bond between the main character and us-- the viewer. So now, you are watching a movie for which you hate all the characters. And the only thing worse than the change in the movie and direction is the ending. Seriously, WTF?This movie could have been a solid B+ movie but it just completely botched the last 20 minutes of the film. Its like they didn't quite know how to end the movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenant Not My Style Review","review":"I love all things related to the Zombie lore.

This compilation of tracks from 5,7 and 10 inches released by the April March-fronted band (mostly off Sympathy For the Record Industry, the label that this CD is from) is a blast of fun straight from the garage. Oh Joy is a brilliant piece of power pop. For those who care, the original sleeve art by Ren and Stimpy creator John K. is even reproduced inside the booklet. The rest includes some great covers and originals, some fast and sloppy bits less than a minute long, while some are harmonized, catchy rippers. The whole thing clocks in at under 30 minutes, which isn't really a bad thing. My only complaint? This is their only album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great tea kettle","review":"I have all the Twist Alea and this tea kettle is not only beautiful, but, very functional.

If you enjoyed the past two seasons you will probably like this one as well depending on your ability to decepher art from trash. The first couple episodes started out bad I notice they recycled everything from the first two seasons to this one, same shows and commericials to make fun of. The Ted kennedy/jenna jammeson skit was one of the dumbest. The writers had no original material so they made it up with excessive cursing, violence, and gut wrenching vulgar scenes that were not even funny. Hopefully the next season will have well written material and not just recycled trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this book, upon returning from a visit to Grenada, in preparation for my upcomming move to the island. I enjoyed the descriptions of the island itself but I could not overlook the obvious pretention and ethnocentric attitude of the author. I am a world traveler who prefers to visit countries with cultural differences - not to point out how inferior, or morally insufficient the people are, but to immerse myself in another world and step into someone elses shoes and life. Mrs. Howard's stories came across to me as whiny and self-serving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, lotsa bad","review":"I found this book to contain some very interesting information about Grenadian people and their customs, but the text is interspersed throughout with \\"poor me\\" stories which leave this reader wondering why these comfort-seeking Floridians just picked up and moved to the wilds of Grenada in the first place. Many aspects of the Grenadian culture are not only not appreciated, but are considered primitive or ignorant. The Howards are upset that the locals step on mice which fall from their harvested banana bunches rather than treating them as pets. We are told of attacks by human vampires which are as believable to the author as the claim that men have landed on the moon. I suggest reading this book with a great deal of skepticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Kidding","review":"This book was pretty entertaining at times. However, it was easy to see why this family had so many difficulties on the island - many of their choices were pretty questionable. They move onto a mountain in a foreign country (a mountain to which they refer as \\"our mountain\\"), burn the natural vegetation to clear it for building, let their young child swing from trees barefoot WHILE the fire is burning, and then marvel that their child burned her feet when she jumped down and landed in the fire. Huh? Are you kidding? Multiply this by like 500 and you have a whole bookful of Memories to Die For. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended. Beats any other performance I've heard.","review":"First heard this group in the 60s. I've been eagerly awaiting this re-release on CD and got me a copy as soon as I heard it was out. The performance of Op 131 is exquisite, in my opinion surpassing the Budapest or Julliard quartets, which were the standard bearers of the day. Quartets like the Lindsey sound anemic compared to the life and freshness the Fine Arts Quartet bring to the music. The Guarneri and the Tokyo quartet performances on CD were better, but still left me unsatisfied. Thank you Everest for putting out this wonderful set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Bird too whiney","review":"I bought this DVD for my daughter who is from China and though I think Xiao Foo is adorable, I am disappointed by Big Bird's behavior. Not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way, but he tells Barkley at one point to \\"sic\\" the Monkey King and then later, again frustrated, tells the Monkey King to put his dukes up (as if to fight to resolve the issue). I am appalled by this. Big Bird is also somewhat demeaning to the Chinese people he encounters--they don't understand him because he is speaking English and rather than explain the language barrier, he just gets upset. I love Sesame Street, and although I will keep this DVD to hear Xiao Foo sing in Chapter 7 (our daughter just loves her), I feel I will need to use Big Bird's behavior as an example of how not to act."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great old movie","review":"I remember my dad taped this for me on BETA.

Don't know what they're talking about with $50, they can't be serious. They work great, but they're not worth THAT.I only use one maybe once a month, whenever a glance in the mirror makes me think I look exceptionally tired or ashen. There's a supposed time limit in the directions, but I leave them on until the material nearly dries out -- however long it will cling to my face. (And there's plenty of left-over goo to rub about the neck and chest, etc.) It's a fun treat, and it works great, but don't expect some magical lift or anything of that sort. It will give you a hydrating/tightening kick for a few hours, that's for certain.

He appeared in the second half of the film for quite a few minutes and it was very enjoyable to see him. Rani Mukerji stars in this film and I really enjoy seeing her in films. I believe the name of the male lead is Vivek Oberoi. He did a good job in his role. This film tells the love story of two young adults who marry dispite opposition from family. It depicts the reality of life for newlyweds.

It's his best since \`Rock Bottom', but the comparison goes further than that. \`Rock Bottom' seemed to yearn for bodilessness and mobility thro' submergence in moonlit water. But \`Shleep''s gorgeous, moving central track, \`Alien', longs for the opposite: ascent into the ether, effortlessly supported by air in sunblind instinctual motion. Elsewhere, the delicious \`Maryan' is just skybound because of its gorgeous melody; and back on Earth, \`Free Will and Testament' again finds Robert wondering what it would it be like \`to be not me'. Very varied and - despite insomnia - extremely poised, \`Shleep' is a beautiful record.

The genre was purposely and consciously neglected and stomped into the ground by record labels and critics alike, to give way to grunge and alternative rock.Long Island tried to target the still existing underground fanbase with a huge number of releases, some new, some re-relaeses of old forgotten jewels (like Bystander).

It was fun to read about how Sterling raised the raccoon and figured out how to do things with him, such as tricks and the like. He shows that he truly cares for Rascal - kindness to animals is not new or silly.One of my favorite parts was when Sterling was in a pie-eating contest, and Rascal jumped up and started eating the pie too - against the rules, but so many people thought it was funny and laughed as they watched.

But it was our good fortune that it was Sterling North, a writer-to-be who could give us all the wonderful details of Rascal's magnetic personality. The insight into North's childhood was a delight -- his father's instinctive (or was it neglectful?) way of giving the boy responsibilities. The canoe in the living room, kept there unfinished due to the expenses of reining in the pesky little critter. I sensed the coming of a dark ending. But, no, it was simply perfect. I can't imagine a reader not loving this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rascal","review":"I read this book in about 3 days, and that was even easy. It was a really good book and I really enjoyed it. But what made it good wasn't the suspense, or drama, like most books. It was the relationship that the boy and his new found best friend, Rascal the raccoon, have throughout the story. A raccoon isn't normally the first animal you'd think of for a nice cuddly pet, but Sterling isn't your normal boy either. He had skunks, woodchucks, a crow named Poe, and several cats, not to mention a half finished 18 foot canoe sitting in the middle of his living room. So Rascal was easily looked at as part of the family. It's really neat how much Sterling loves Rascal, especially when Rascal starts to get into trouble with the neighbors and costs Sterling all of the money he has saved, to finish his canoe, for repair costs. I think that if you read it, you will enjoy it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rasal","review":"I did not like this book. I had to read it for school.

Everest produced a number of sonic masterpieces around the same time (1960), so what happened here? The \\"Concerto for Piano in D minor\\" is interesting only as a stab at traditional composition by Grofe. Otherwise, the listener is at least eight bars ahead of the composer most of the way in this beautifully-written but vapid work. More invovled conducting would have helped, a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique performance","review":"There are many recordings of the Grand Canyon Suite in better sound than this one, which seems a bit thin. Still, it's nice to hear the composer's take on it. The real value of this piece (leaving aside the Rhapsody, which is not on my LP copy) is what may be the only recording of Grofe's only piano concerto, a slight but charming piece with brassy bluster and corny charm. It's in a hurry from the first bar, and doesn't really take any time out for a slow movement, and it gets some good mileage out of a Prokofiev-like reappearance of themes with more flashy ornamentation. It wears well, too.

Will not buy again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works","review":"Beta carotene had stained all my plastics orange (including baby bottles). This stuff REALLY works! I'm amazed at how well it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product that does what it advertises...","review":"Well this product even does a good job cleaning up fruit juice/vegetable juice stains inside my toddler's sippy cup. Yahoo. Thanks Cascade for making my life easier, especially since I've got dishwasher duty all the time. Shhhh... don't tell my wife I'm not working too hard scrubbing the plastic clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - Must Have Product!","review":"This product is amazing! I first bought it several years ago when it first came out in stores. Not only does it freshen your dishwasher but it also cleans the tomato based stains off of your plastics. It really does work and I would recommend it to everyone! Since I could no longer find it in stores, I was so happy to find it online that I bought a whole case of it. Well worth the money since it's cheaper than in the stores. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I have went through 3 pairs of these in about 10 years. They are wonderful. Mud no problem. Makes gardening a lot easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable!","review":"I love these clogs. I have worn them almost every day since I got them. They are really comfortable, haven't given me any blisters and stay on my foot! They dry out quickly and you can just hose them off if they get dirty. I thought my feet would be sweaty in them but they are quite cool and airy.Drawbacks: If you leave them in the sun they can get uncomfortably hot. If they get wet inside they can slip off. If they get a little water inside they make a really unpleasant/hilarious farting noise. If you get a stone in them - Ouch!But all in all a tremendous shoe. They look great and feel comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for them","review":"I go these shoes many years ago and never cared for them. They are still sitting in my shed with hopes of me using them again. I like my crocs better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive product description","review":"This IS NOT a BANDAGE.
