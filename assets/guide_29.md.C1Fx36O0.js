FUN!!","review":"Both my handicapped 8 year old son and my 15 month old absolutely love this toy!! It Taught my 15 month old to sort and now he uses his block box for sorting instead of throwing!! Even the older kids I take care of enjoy playing with this toy. The music is warm and the nature sounds are very clear. The only problem I have had is the tips of the sorting blocks break when stepped on...*LOL* other than that this is a wonderful addition to our toy collection!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fun but watch out","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 7 months old. I thought the toy was great and so did she. It was her favorite toy for weeks until a block got stuck in her mouth.After this happened a second time, I threw the toy in the trash. I am so surprised that Fisher Price would make a toy that could be dangerous to babies. I was thinking of getting rid of the blocks and keeping the birdbath but the blocks were her favorite part. She enjoyed taking them out, listening to the sounds and playing with them. I had to literally pull the block out of her mouth because it was stuck. Luckily my daughter wasn't hurt, just very upset. This toy is very cute but please watch out if you're buying it for your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUTTERING BIRDBATH","review":"I thought this was the cutest toy, so for Christmas I bought it for my daughter.

Its so cute, but their really isnt much to it, and my daughter could actually care less about it, even when I play with it with her. overall this was dissappointing considering the $24.99 cost for the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I bought this toy for my son who is 10 months old and he kept flipping it over and pulling all of the shapes out of their place. He has a lot of fun watching mommy put it together again so he can do it again. This is the most fun we have out of this toy and it only lasted a day. The toy is not really stable because it is really easy to flip over especially if it is on the carpet.I have now only had it less than a month and it seems to stay stuch on the phrase \\"Its music time\\" over and over and over again.I found out that the battery was low and needs to be changed. Now, it has taken it's place among the abyss of the toy box. I really do not feel like my son learned anything from it. Please save your money or buy the stand up table thing or that door that the kids can crawl through my son has really enjoyed those toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, colorful, and loaded with activity.","review":"My 8-month old received this gift and is enthralled with it. We've had great fun with it in just the 24 hours she's had it. The colors and the various things that this toy has are quite engaging. I have to say the one draw-back for her is it's height. When sitting in front of the toy she can play with it as any child her age and ability can. However, when she hits certain features on the top part with her hands, it sometimes causes the toy to topple toward her and bang her in the face, making her cry. No injury, just hurt feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you do with this toy?","review":"I thought this toy looked adorable on-line and had to have it for my 10 month old daughter. However, compared to the pictures it is very small. There is really not much to do with this toy for the money paid. You can not press the buttons with numbers on them. All you can do is slap the blue bird bath water and then it will count for each time you slap it. The birds are not removeable and bounce up and down when you hit them. As for the bee that is under the bird bath it is so small that my daughter does not even notice it and it doesn't make much of a noise. My 2 year old son is not even interested in it and he plays with all her other toys. I would not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as durable as you think","review":"While this toy has great educational potential and is aesthetically pleasing, I eventually threw ours out. It kept getting stuck on one annoying, repeated sound, which was clearly not intended, and no matter how much my daughter or I tapped or pushed or pulled other items to try to spur a different sound, it wouldn't stop. The only way to stop it was to turn it off -- which meant it wasn't interesting, because it doesn't light up or make noise when it's turned off. Maybe we just got a bad one, but I won't buy it or recommend it for anyone else, just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy that has made it through two kids now","review":"This is an awesome toy. My now five year old daughter got it for her first birthday from a friend. It was a favorite for well over a year, until we moved and had to leave most of our things in storage. By the time we got things back out, nearly a year had passed, and she still absolutely loved it. Since then I have had another child, who is now 15 months, and it has been one of his absolute favorites since he was 9-10 months, when I got it back out after having it away for a while. Just an FYI to all the people complaining about the sound getting stuck-this is a sign that you need new batteries. Every time it has happened to us (I think twice in the four years, including the first time when we had to toss the cheapo batteries it came with), switching the batteries immediately fixed it. Don't throw out a great toy just because of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous toy!","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 5 months old and she has had endless hours of fun with it since then! (She's almost 8 months now) She loves making the birds talk and taking out the vegetable blocks. The ABC song that plays when she spins the bee is her favorite....she's constantly spinning it around to hear the song...especially when I or her Daddy are around to sing along with it to her. The only small gripe I might have with it is that I wish that the base was a little heavier because she was constantly trying to pull herself up on it and toppling it over. However, the silver lining to that cloud is that it seems to have helped her learn to balance herself very well because she can pull herself up on it and keep it and herself upright very well now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegetables got stuck in my babies mouth","review":"I also experienced a problem with the vegetables getting lodged in my daughters mouth.

Thought this toy would be a hit. Would have been great however it broke shortly after I gave it to her. She is now 1 1/2. I haven't the heart to throw it away because It's like brand new. The sounds just don't work. They just repeat themselves and it sounds like a irratating skipped record. However, I leave the sound off and she is still entertained by the birds on top and taking the shapes out and putting them back in. Also I use the shapes as play dough cutters. Not all lost.... Just beware in buying one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy... for a few days... before it breaks","review":"Bought this for my 9 month old. She loved it. For a few days. Then the electronics broke and now it just repeats the same 3 words over and over again like a broken record.

She loves pulling out and chewing on the shapes and making the little bee fly around the bottom. She also loves pushing on the birds.The thing I love about the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn series of toys is that they have a \\"music\\" mode and a \\"abc\\" mode. The \\"abc\\" mode is the learning mode (obviously). You can't go wrong with these toys!!Now that she is older, Willow also loves switching between modes all on her own!!

I reread it recently and realized that one becomes a little more discerning in 20 years. It has the usual Taylor Caldwell flaws -- melodramatic, overwritten, with a peculiar take on human nature -- but is distinguished by a rock-stupid hero. The man is supposed to be in deep undercover, yet jumps at every misguided opportunity to make allies, assuming they are on his side with the most threadbare of evidence.This seriously undermined the book -- more so than with other Caldwell books, which can be enjoyed for a certain over-the-top intensity and sheer goofiness.

Despite the feelers put out by some leaders, the country was still in the firm hands of the warriors who had no intention of surrendering.3. Suppose we do rewrite history and carry out the invasion. Given Skates' best case, we would still have lost many soldiers' and sailors' lives as well as many more lives of admittedly poorly prepared Japanese defenders.

The worst part is that it is a live recording with a bunch of folks singing that are not good singers and can't seem to stay in key. This is not something I will ever play at a party or anywhere else. I regret that I was unable to sample the album before I purchased it, as I would never have bought this CD otherwise.

It is an excellent book to use as a starting point for classroom or family discussion of disabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaf & OK","review":"My times have changed. Nowadays, being deaf does not necessarily mean signing. With technology, deaf kids can integrate with everyone the hearing community. The title of the book seems to be directed more towards hearing parents of deaf children and not the child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute...","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was the small cute version of the bigger one I was hoping to get. The front cover \\"I spy\\" photo wasn't even in the book. It would be fantastic for a small child's diaper bag.

And unless you are going well over the posted speed limit, don't listen while driving.The album turns everything else into minimalism; emphasizing the composition, as opposed to the instruments of conventional music.When it comes down to it, I have to recommend this to anyone looking for something new. There's really nothing else like it; the big surprise is that its well done. Not repetitive, nor cliché."},{"rating":"1","title":"No POP at all","review":"This item is very cute if you just want to look at it.

You have to hold it exactly right for the corn to pop and they don't pop very well. The best feature is the spinning combine part but he can't see that as he pushes it.

The rooms in the book don't look that bad, but they do look too \\"studied\\" and too \\"new,\\" and that is what gives them the phony, showy, nouveau-riche look. I got the feeling that each room was almost created from scratch as if the people living in the rooms didn't start out with one decent heirloom or personal object. The author seems to have found rooms that generally show good use of square footage, so you can get some ideas from them. (I wasted money on this book so I am trying to make the best of it and glean what ideas I can from it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unappealing","review":"In reading customer reviews after I bought this, I was intrigued with the review that referred to the book as showing \\"interior design as art.\\" Aha! Now I know why I found this book so unappealing. The book doesn't seem to be about decorating real homes for real life and real comfort. The book comes off as one author's idea of how to impress other people. These \\"settings\\" (I can't honestly call them homes because they are so chilly and phony looking) may work as backdrops for a cocktail party, but I keep wondering as I look at these pictures where the people who have to live in them actually go when they want to relax after the party's over. A dreary and depressing book because the settings look like rooms from Yuppiedom of the 1980s. Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showhouses not real homes","review":"I'm one of the people who bought this book and were sorry. It's filled with what look like showhouses and not real homes. One reviewer on amazon tried to justify the book's nouveau riche content by saying that, \\"While the images provided reflect the lifestyle of many his clients, it's easy to translate his teachings into any lifestyle or budget.\\" If that is the case, then why didn't the author include homes that reflected a variety of lifestyles and budgets in the first place? Of course, there's still no accounting for taste......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I am giving this book only one star because I expected more from Bilhuber. The photos are fuzzy and the text is so vague that it cannot possibly help the reader in search of practical solutions. There are only a few hints or guidelines and I did not appreciate the broad generalizations. To make matters worse, there wasn't a single picture in this book which impressed or inspired me.It's not even a nice coffee table book since the photographic quality is so poor. A HUGE waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhelpful and cold","review":"The premise of \\"interior design as art\\" may suit those who are decorating to impress the Joneses, but that attitude went out with the 1990s. This book is a throwback to the past, but it may satisfy today's nouveau riche.I found it cold and uninspiring. Showiness and rooms that are too \\"studied\\" are a little tacky for today's tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This turned out to be a boring book which the author filled with photographs of rooms reflecting surprisingly similar decorating approaches. I don't know this particular author, but if Mr. Billhuber writes another book, I recommend that he bring in photographs of room styles that are more varied than these. I think this could have been \\"editted\\" down to one story in a magazine instead of being stretched into a book. I lost interest in these rooms very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners!","review":"For someone that knows absolutely nothing about putting together a room this book has my highest approval. This is like a crash course in design because he gives you all of the design basics like how to choose color, what kind of furniture to use, how to place your pictures, where to place the furniture, how to make a room look smaller or bigger with all of the above. Plus there's a lot of information on the basics of window treatments, lighting, upholstery. This book was titled very well and I very much recommend it for someone that doesn't have a clue about decorating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited in appeal","review":"I have not liked this book, and I finally think I figured out why that is. It looks like a book for apartment people. Most of us in this country don't have to live that way, so the photos in this book just don't look as if they apply to the majority of Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't have much to say","review":"I disagree with the reviewer who said that some people didn't like this book because those people are used to \\"pretty\\" decorating books that don't explain anything. Au contraire. I am used to gorgeous decorating books that also explain decorating principles. I have many on my bookshelf that do a far better job than Billhubber's (whoever he is) of presenting great rooms and explaining how and why they work. There are many better books on the market than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whos dream?","review":"This book is a waste of time as the author is clearly out of touch with how most of America lives. His designs might work well as the backdrop for the movie version of The Devil Wears Prada, but otherwise, I can't imagine anyone outside of the Upper West Side finding this book remotely of any use or inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little cold and unreal looking","review":"I was disappointed because the rooms are a little cold and unreal looking. They look more like the kinds of overdone or over-planned rooms you see when you walk through show houses than rooms my friends or I would want to live in.

Just ordered a replacement for one i purchased one to two years ago and the difference in quality is incredible. The new one was very thin and cheaply made. I phoned Chattanooga to see if perhaps I mis-ordered. The story I got was that due to the war, they had to use a cheaper quality canvas and since the canvas was flimsy, they had to use less filler. Sounded like a story to me in a fantastic attempt to substitute inferior quality and cut costs but retain the price of their product. Play the patriotism card and no one will complain!

I remember using Norton utilities in the good-old days of DOS and I never had any problems. Unfortunately, I suspect that Mr. Norton has long ago sold out to Symantec and he's on a beach somewhere. Now we have to deal with a faceless, heartless (and money grubbing) corporation. The anti-spam feature works intermittently and unreliably. Further, customer support is a JOKE. Here's the lesson I've learned: Before buying any important software or hardware, check the internet for user reviews! Ignore the \\"editor\\" reviews since that's nothing more than corporate hype.PS. If you look at the customer reviews in this section, see if you can find the one that sounds like a corporate ad.

Immediately after installation of the Norton anti-virus application my computers were measurably slower and performance continued to deteriorate. As I replaced each computer I opted to use the products available directly from Microsoft.

However, Secrest in her drive to capture the \\"essence\\" of the man has so mangled the story of his life and career that reading her work is more chore than delight. To say the book is disorganized is to deal in serious understatement. But worse than that are the inaccuracies, especially when she writes about Duveen's customers. Just for starters, apparently she didn't recognize the need to differentiate between John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his father (or maybe she didn't know there has been more than one JDR!). You won't learn much from this tome that you don't know to begin, and getting through it will be a struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the bests, but not a perfect","review":"Cengel4 and Moran5 are the two best thermodynamics textbooks. Althought Cengel4 has more information and is more interesting in reading, some readers may lose the main points in the first part of the book, from the first chapter to the chapter of exergy analysis, while Moran5 is not that interesting, but very concise in the first few chapters (it would be better to rearrange the compressibility factor z after the perfect gas). Cengel4's application part is more realistic.

I got stung!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely moving","review":"The Lions of Al-Rassan follows the life of the beautiful Kindath physician, Jehane, and the two incredible men she meets. One is the legendary Ammar ibn Khairan - poet, soldier, assassin, and chief advisor to the King of Cartada. The other is the equally famous soldier Rodrigo Belmonte of Valledo. During an uncertain time, on a peninsula on the brink of a Holy War, these two men are both exiled by their kings, and come to serve, and become loyal friends, under King Badir of Ragosa.But when war finally erupts, and both Ammar and Rodrigo are called back by their Kings to fight - against one another.In many ways, this is a story about the injustices of war and persecution, often leaving you to gasp at the brutality which ordinary people are capable of when blinded by their so called 'faith'. 'War feeds like a wild dog upon the hearts of brave men'.The Lions of Al-Rassan is also about friendship, and how a woman whom most consider an infidel finds love and her place in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and engaging","review":"Don't let hair-splitting critics turn you off this book. Its definitely worth the time. Other fantasy authours don't come close to the level Kay has reached. If you are familiar with the historical setting this book is derived from, it is a lot of fun to see how cleverly he has added a fictional twist to real-life elements while retaining their essence. Al-rassan may be fiction but it evokes the true atmosphere of Muslim Spain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lions of al-Rassan","review":"\\"The Lions of al-Rassan\\" is one of my favourite novels by Guy Gavriel Kay. It is well written, like all his work, although perhaps not as densely written as \\"Tigana\\" or \\"A Song for Arbonne\\". Although technically falling in the fantasy genre, the worlds of these novels are very strongly modelled on the cultures of medieval (?) europe. In the case of \\"The Lions of al-Rassan\\" it is modelled on the clash between the Islamic and Christian cultures in Medieval Spain. The book is a great, well-paced read, with very character-driven plot. I now have two copies at home, so I have one to read, and one to lend to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Kay masterpiece","review":"Possibly the best of Kay's work, in my own mind, it even outranks Tigana, which was nearly as amazing. While the historical foundations of Al-Rassan are interesting enough, it is the characters which truly shine. Kay effortlessly creates believeable, sympathetic characters like no other fantasty writer I have come across. Kay's writing is, as always, elegant in its simplicity, and his spare descriptions easily conjure up the scene. The handling of the emotions -always a sticky topic in fantasy - is deftly done here and the dialogue - magnificent! Despite the emphasis on emotion and spiritual matters, Kay never forgets that he's writing fantasy and keeps the story moving at a good clip. An added bonus is the ending, which is very cleverly handled and is guaranteed to shock you. Kay's best novel ever and a nice change from all that formulaic garbage (here I'm thinking of Dragonlance) which pollutes the market on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time","review":"I hate poorly written books. With this said, this is the best fantasy novel I've ever read. It is one of the Best books I've ever read. It doesn't have a fantasy flavor, really. It is simply well written. The sentences in this story are beautifully written (try reading them aloud...they flow wonderfully!!) The plot is complex, but it is incredibly moving. I've read it countless times and it still makes me cry. If you are looking for a thoughtful book with real emotion, read this. It will move you and really make you think about good and evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"The depth in his descriptive poetry is intensly pleasurable.","review":"Kay has the capacity few other writers have, of bringing the characters and their stories so alive with such elegance. The story, in view of todays history, is believable and the characters have a three dimensional depth even if he were to write in a more sparing voice. What adds to the pleasure of this read is the incredible descriptive poetry that he uses to form his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"Among all of Guy Gavriel Kay's books, this is my favorite. And that's saying a lot.For the high caliber of writing, and the timelessness of his themes, I consider most of Kay's books to be of literature caliber. When was the last time you re-read paragraphs of a fantasy book just to savor the beauty of the language one more time? Until I stumbled across his works a couple years ago, I didn't know books like this existed.Be warned, though, reading Kay could inadvertently shrink your future reading lists. My tolerance for run-of-the-mill fiction is fading fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but where is the emotion?","review":"I have to say that this book is a good Kay book, making it an excellent book. However, it is a little on the flat side as a fiction. Its historical/mythical overtones are strong, yet the characters are all too forgettable.This is a book that is poetic but not quite dramatic, full of melodrama that is instantly gratifying but brief and intangible. It might have done well as a poem but as a book, it just doesn't quite cut it.Nevertheless, the intrigue and whirlwind conflicts of war clash brilliantly in this novel. It's still a fun read if not particularly profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely dislocating","review":"I was disappointed by this book. In the first place, it jumps to and fro between different character's points of view, and I've never liked that.In the second place, there were conspicuous, blatant parallels to the Reconquista of Spain and the career of El Cid. These made it very difficult for me to maintain my suspension of disbelief because they made it obvious that the events were artificial.And in the third place the author has a bizarre habit of concealing from the reader which character it is who is in a scene, even of deliberately misleading the reader as to what characters were present. In three cases characters were killed and the reader was left in doubt which characters had died. This despite the fact that none of the [surviving] characters in the story had any doubt at all. I found this very strange and off-putting."},{"rating":"2","title":"What memories","review":"Growing up during the dynasty, this set brought back some great memories. I too wish that there were more versions with the Islander announcers as well. It's also the same thing when they've shown a lot of the old games on their website. I don't know why that is.I was also surprised the '80 cup winner game didn't have Nystrom's goal at the end of the second period. I've seen that on their web.I guess I am getting a little picky but I still love it. With this team, they could have easily made a 20-DVD set. Maybe they will come out with a part two and include games like Parise OT in '75, Bossy's 50 in 50, Tonelli's winner against Colorado during the win streak, Game 1 vs Edmonton in '83, Bossy in mid-air in '82, Bourne's end-to-end game, a couple of the Capital games from '93, another Penguin game from '93 and game 6 against Toronto in '02"},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for an Isle fan or hockey fan in general","review":"I would agree that some of the games are poor video transfers but that is something that has to be taken into consideration when some of these games are over 30 years old. They are bound to deteriorate. But I think the crown jewel of this set and makes the set worth the purchase alone is the Easter Epic which is not just one of the best games in Islander History but one of the best playoff games ever. It was a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"new york islanders 10 greatest games","review":"I was disappointed. The box was completely broken inside. I thought about replacing but decided not to go through the hassle. I did it once before and the replacement was also broken. It's not only Amazon's fault here -- they use these plastic boxes with fragile moving hinges on the inside. As for the games, also disappointing. The picture quality of the Pittsburgh game from '82 is pretty bad and as for the '83 Edmonton game it's not as bad but still worse than I saw on espn classic. The rest of the games are more decent quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the TOP of my List!","review":"I've always been a fan of LOREZ ALEXANDRIA, and I'm glad to find the ONE of her recordings that I didn't yet have.Any true jazz vocal fan who picks up any of her recordings will not be disappointed.

The cover art immediately drew me in, and the limited edition finally pushed me to buy this album. My library is made up of Armin van Buuren, ATB and The Thrillseekers, so this album was a nice change of pace; they sound somewhat akin to OceanLab with the strong vocals, not-to-big beats, and ambient overtones. Soft is a mixed bag- some songs are upbeat and energetic, others like \\"Fade Away\\" and \\"Suddenly\\" are more chill. The second disc is awesome; \\"Desire\\" is good, but the club mix is better and more familiar if you come from a trance/electronica scene. \\"Noxious\\" is probably my favorite song overall because it sounds so intense and a little \\"out there\\". Give this album a try if you're looking for something a little different with hints of familiarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Really Good To Hear Miki :)","review":"I jsut purchased this CD and I am thinking that Miki is sounding really good!!

It sounds like it's trying to read and play, but I just receive a small \\"cannot read disk\\" error on the LCD.It's a shame really. I really like the ability to have a multidisk player that couple play multiple formats. And I've always thought highly of Sony. Well, I certainly feel like the fool now.

The eyes have excessive painted lashes, which makes it look goofy. The upper lid has no ridge to add needed 3 dimensional details. To see better looking older dolls, do an internet vintage doll search; so that you can compare the head sculpt of the new and older versions. As mentioned in a previous review, the head sculpt and painted details have become steadily worse since the early 1980's. Newer, male dolls like Ken also have heads that are too big. Mattel should look back to 1977, and start over again from there. The head, face, and painted detail was much better indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that left me breathless !","review":"Bonjour, my dear Sister/Author,I am done with the book.

Cloud has done a masterful job on what will become a standard reference work among Fundamentalists--especially those with an affinity for the KJV. How refreshing to read a book which provides real answers rather than merely changing, adding, or deleting the words of Scripture! Cloud uses sound logic and solid primary sources when presenting his arguments. He is also honest enough to admit some difficult passages evade easy explanation, while defending the integrity of the text.

I write this review after reading a previous review which was a critical analysis of the author and not an analysis of the book's content.

His lute play was original and captivating, his technical performance unsurpassed. So naturally the first thing to do for me right after the concert was to get his CD. I couldn't wait to listen to it, but once I did, I doublechecked the cover to see if I had really put the right CD in the player. While it is still interesting and authentic Palestinian music, his out-of-this world lute play is drowned by vocals that leave no room to his sheer brilliance. What a pity! So, if you like vocal Palestinian music it's not a bad little CD to get. But if you are looking for a solo album of Adel Salameh's, better wait for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and Refreshing","review":"The songs are not your typical annoying kid songs.

Never tire of him even after repeated viewings.While all these movies in this collection are up there, my favorite is The Ladykillers, there is so much to admire in this movie, all actors exceptional, especially Katie Johnson who sadly, passed away some 6 months after the film was completed.It is a constant source of aggravation to me that certain producers have the gall to remake such classics as these, as if they could improve on perfection,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alec Guinness, greatest actor","review":"Alec Guinness had a gift that most actors would love: to so fit a chosen role that there is complete transparency between the actor and the figure he or she is portraying. As much as I admire Katherine Heburn, Humphrey Bogart, and other great actors of the last century, they were almost always playing screen versions of themselves. I can think of only one other actor who may be able to mirror Guinness's ability right now, Carey Mulligan, who, of course, has many years and roles to fill before she can compare with Guinness.These (mostly) Ealing Studio comedies offer ample proof of Guinness's ability to disappear into the roles he is playing. When my own daughter went to drama school, I advised her that she could save money by simply watching and carefully studying Alec Guinness films.Buy this collection.

They really should have left the background music and sound effects alone. Whoever they payed to make the new music needs to be shot. Then there are the engine sounds. None of them even match up with the type of car. What is even worse is that they change for the same car. Also, what is with Itsuki acting like a wanna-be thug? It sounds stupid. Tokyopop should have either found somebody who knows about cars before making audio changes, or just left the own damn audio alone.Japanese side 4/5 StarsNot much to say about the Japanese side.

I came into it hating cars, and such, and now after seeing all 26 episodes of the first stage(this dvd is a part of) the whole battle stage(intrim) the Movie(3rd Stage), and all of the current episodes of 4th stage(current season), I have come out loving the sport of drifting. The series is just genuinely interesting as it covers the love, work, and racing of the characters. The story (non racing) parts of the series tend to drag on in the later episodes, but they build such a suspense that the viewer is on the edge of their seats for the races. The races are where this series truely shines, one because they are fast and frentic, but two they are where the main character grows and develops as a person. I highly recommend at least trying the first DVD, because this is a cool series that deserves watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this DVD!","review":"I love Initial D, I've been a fan for a couple of years now & I was somewhat excited about the \\"new updated CG scenes\\". I'll say the \\"update\\" is a welcome advantage, that's about all thats good about the DVD. The Dub is awful, I mean really awful, I know dubs are rarely done well, but still. The new music is crap, totally changes the mood of the races, the euro beats are better, & I dont even listen to that kind of music. Please listen to me, get the import version it's way way better & cheaper too, you can find all 5 stages on ebay for like $60.

In the English version on the disc, they really bent over for American Censorship (TM). K.T.? Natalie? Iggy? Who came up with these names? Also, the original creators actually sampled the authentic engine sounds for each of the different cars for the original version. But the english audio has these \\"tricked out\\" rice rockets in an attempt to be \\"cooler' and \\"more hip\\" to the same people who think \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is real. The background music as well was mangled, as they replaced the original tracks with - face it - horrible garage and punk bands. The major KICK-IN-THE-PANTS is that the relationship between Natsumi (errr, Natalie?) and her \\"daddy\\" has been deeply removed. I guess enjou kosai is too deep a subject for American audiences. My advice? Don't buy the TOKYOPOP release. Save your money for the R2's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"First, you can get this book from Kenyon College where the author teaches (Google it up), their college bookstore has reprinted it. The book was interesting to compare to the movie and I like the movie better, although the book is good and I coundn't put it down. Any cult fan of the movie should read it - lots of the movie dialog is directly from the book, but many of the plot details are quite different. Sal Amato and Doc are not so likeable in the book, but the Eddie Wilson of the book and the movie is the same mysterious, driven person. JoaAnn Carlino is definitely an attractive character in the book. I don't want to give too many of the plot differences away, since part of the fun of reading it is to see where it differs from the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find the author, find the paperback edition","review":"Narrator Frank Ridgeway's story is that of any American adolescent, one of dreams and heroes slowly replaced by loss and friends.

In the bonds between these brothers of purpose, we find ourselves and our national heritage.Words & music still need each other. Thought & spirit govern our course through life.The author, the Wordman himself, lives & teaches. His book is available in a special paperback edition with a new post-movie afterword.

It's well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"In my view, the most interesting parts of the movie involve the musical interaction between Wordman and Eddie, and the growing popularity of the Band. But the book is a letdown.The author really never develops the musical collaboration between the Band's members. The reader is left to assume that the Band became popular, but how and why are never explained. I found the dialog to be contrived and pointless. The book's characters are never developed. The violence is gratuitous and pointless. If you like the movie, forget the book. This 30-year-old read is certainly not worth a full $12.99 Kindle price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph of Self Discvery","review":"This novel reminds us that a book can work even with a hokey,contrived plot.What is compelling here is the story of the novels narrator who has in effect blown his life trying to be a regular guy.That is the compelling mystery here,not what happened to Eddie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sun Shower\\" hooked me in","review":"And now I'm a goner.

Players will also need to utilize a lever which switches the speed the socks travel, and occasionally paint buckets to change the socks' colors.The beginning levels are generally easy, but later levels can involved multiple socks all bouncing around on conveyor belts at different speeds, and getting different colored socks in their correct bins can be very tricky.

It is excellence par excellence. Beautifully done and perfect in every way. An incredible accomplishment for an eleven year old girl. What is even more astounding is that she did it all from memory, primarily in Italian and French! An unbelievable accomplishment. Seeing her live, in concert, makes it even all the more astounding, watching and hearing this tiny little girl belt out, in perfect pitch, an entire performance.

It causes feelings inside me that no other singer has in my life, and I am 63 years old and have herd all the great singers in my lifetime.

Since she has some hearing loss, the volume has to be turned up for her to be able to hear and enjoy it. The maximum volume setting on her television is 50, but if we went over 12, the sound was so bad that it wasn't worth listening to.

But when I opened it up to preview before showing it to my class, I realized that the sound quality was atrocious and that the narrator's voice was almost impossible to comprehend. There's no way this would ever hold their attention, and even with a reading guide they would just get frustrated and lost because it is so hard to understand what the man is saying. I wish I had never opened the package so that I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot understand a word he is saying....","review":"This DVD had the potential to be great... however, I simply could not understand a word the narrator was saying. OK, I may have understood the odd word, but trying to comprehend any sentence was next to impossible. Perhaps his accent was used to give some special feel to the DVD. The problem though, was that his accent was just too thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg to differ!","review":"I was very disappointed in this very short and not very informative film.

(It was I bet it was pretty bad to our tastes) How do you survive? (You pledge yourself to the local strong man) Why was it such a warrior culture? (Because the Legions had left and there was a power vacuum to fill) How did the church spread? What did Old English sound like (There is a very brief amount of it in the start of the film)and then how did it evolve to what we speak today. Also how was Sutton Woo excavated?

However,this Americanized version changes the original title cards to the names used in Dracula. (Which this movie was based on.) This I could deal with for the price. The bigger problem is the writing runs right off the screen at times so you have to guess at what is being said.The next movie is in black & white. It is a low budget vampire movie from the forties. The movie centers around a doctor and his evil twin brother. The story was fairly entertaining and looked fine to me. I found this to be the best of the three movies.The final movie Chain of Souls is newer and is in color. The basic concept is Kyla goes to Hollywood looking to become an Actress. At an audition she discovers something sinister. Although that sounds like it could be good, it's really not. I was bored by this movie.So is this a good budget buy? As is, probably not. If they fixed the title cards to Nosferatu it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I expected much more from this toy for the price.

Made all the more remarkable due to the fact that the Finnish musicians and the American songwriter have never met in person. They have previously collaborated on a well-received British release \\"Demons In Disguise\\" on the Mod label 'Detour Records' (also in English) which quickly sold out and is now out of print, but is well worth trying to track down.

I still had some of the old one left, and only got to open this in May. To my greatest shock, it absolutely doesn't smell like the Lanvin I was used to. It smells like alcohol, and after a minute or two it has a faint but strange chemical smell, which is completely different from what Lanvin L'Homme used to be. I bought this directly from Amazon, not from a third-party dealer, and I'd like to think that Amazon does not sell fakes. Still, it's either that (which means that some wholesaler distributes fakes to Amazon's warehouse) or Lanvin has gone down the hill big time. This is a serious quality issue, and I guess I'll switch to something else, even though I really liked this fragrance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cologne smells SOO good!!","review":"I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear this cologne.

Large portions of the military action are not even touched on. The first part is a general descripiton of the war situation and most of the book is interviews with internees about their time in the camp. No real time-line or story just disjointed personal accounts. Agonizing little about the soldiers, the fighting, the rescue, or the aftermath.I have read just about every book on this subject as my Father was in the 1st Cav and participated in the liberation of Santo Tomas and in the later fight for Manila and this is my least favorite book.

The liner notes describe it as Dixie Swing and that is an apt description. Listen to the notes pour out of Al's horn and the way the music follows the typical Dixieland band progression. The style though has just as much in common with swing and even bebop. This album jumps and once you listen to it a few times you'll want to hear more of Al Hirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Hirt fans","review":"Where was this group of recordings hiding for so many years?

It was so much fun hearing Al again in his prime on a whole new set of material - including some songs I didn't know he had recorded.I've played for almost 45 years now and have yet to hear a trumpet player as good and as much fun as Jumbo.Buy this CD.

Unfortunately, I read the first few chapters andI was highly disappointed. I read one to my wife and she was also disappointed. Chero'Ne appears to me to be an amateur author and amateur artist, i.e. it is not written either grammatically very well, nor did it capture my interest and I feel like I could do equal or better illustrations (and I am clearly an amateur artist). In addition, there were typo's.She appears to be saying \\"I am great\\", \\"I am wonderful\\", \\"I am really terrific\\", \\"God is good\\". The spiritual message escaped me. I wish her well, I dislike writing this, but if I am spending $14.50 for a paperback, I don't want to have to send it back out of disappointment.

Until a stint in the federal prison system led him to send a story to the San Francisco Chronicle, where Peter Sussman, editor of the Datebook section of the paper, published it. And that's when the trouble started. Dannie's clear-eyed unapologetic but fearless snapshots of prison life exposed the outrages committed by guards and administrators. This led the federal Bureau of Prisons to crack down on him and in turn led the Chronicle to sue the prison system on the behalf of Dannie and the paper's First Amendment rights. His book, a collection of the stories he wrote for the Chronicle, gives the reader an eye-opening look behind prison walls - at prisoners coping with AIDS, with drug addiction, and with a heartless and sometimes brainless system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that can change your perception of prisons overnight.","review":"This book should be required for all politicians who vote against prison reform.

There were live weevils, or some such insect, in the mix when opened and much bug waste/byproducts of their metabolic funtions (read poop).This, to me, is simply unacceptable.I have purchased this product locally in the past with none of the bug problems stated above, so it is my opinion the contamination occured at some point after it left Pretty Bird.The company it shipped from was called, I believe, Pet Solutions.I will be buying this one from Foster and Smith next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This knitting book is unlike any of the others that I own.

You get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all. A worthy goal, but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies I really think one should try to pursue things to their limit. He really held back from delving into any dark territory. His explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit. He always managed to put a happy, positive spin on everything, which is nice, but life isn't that simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This book was way too simplistic.

It has an AUX in back that allows for easy RCA stereo attachment of an IPOD, is setup for MP3, WMA and is even Sirius ready. The only thing I don't dig about it, is the small buttons.

All areas of friendship are examined with the eye of a professor, friendships between wife and husband, long distance friendships, friendships between the opposite sex, inter racial friendships, etc. The author examines what history and literature has to tell us from Plato, aristotle, Montaigne, Mark Twain, Nietzche, etc. You will leave this book understanding that friendship, while at times is demanding, it is one of life's greatest pleasures and well worth any inconvience and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money.","review":"This was the most boring book I have had the mispleasure of reading.

You just need to be aware that your committing yourself to a buying capsules for the machine only from nespresso at 0.50-0.60 usd per capsule. Knowing that going in, I've been quite happy with the product. It takes just under 1m to warm up, and is pretty effortless both for making espressos and maintenance.

I wore socks and was careful not to put too much pressure on the ball bearings (you can tell when the motor is straining). In spite of this, one day the motor just refused to turn on. The rotating pads were \\"locked up\\", and after some careful disassembly it seems to be the cheap motor and not the plastic gears that are the problem. Not much point in keeping it as a foot warmer since this was not a strong point.

Got it for Christmas, and it broke December 27th!

It should have a powerful enough motor that it can rotate with out me regulating the pressure.Better yet; It should in fact have been designed with the rotating discs being spring loaded and the balls within those discs also being spring loaded and the surrounding base being a little larger that way it gives underneath the foot and applies a specific pressure across the bottom of the foot which would be determined by the spring not the weight of the leg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality","review":"Don't waste your money on this.

As a fluke, I thought that I would check it out of the library so that I could pick up a few Spanish words to teach myself and then him.

There's practically a fight for that book when they have the chance to look up words! The illustrations are very appealing, and I like the fact that it gives full sentences; this can really help students who are learning Spanish grammar. Since the book does use full sentences, though, it's important that they begin reading it with someone who has experience in Spanish--this will help them to understand how the sentences are constructed, identify individual words, and recognize conjugated and infinitive verbs. Highly recommended for any elementary students learning Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully illustrated, targeted to Web artists & designers","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated text packed full of illustrations and design descriptions for 14 case studies of taking traditional print media to the WEB, \\"brick and mortar\\" to \\"click and mortar\\".

I read the first few pages and was fascinated. The first story in the book had some great character pathology in it, telling the tale of an obsessed man from his point of view, but the rest of the book was literally nonsensical. It was like Dr. Seuss stories without the charming rhymes or colorful pictures if they had material unfit for children. The plots were even less well-developed than that lesser of Seuss's classics, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. This book is a bit like that New York art gallery that I once visited that had a jar of urine on exhibit as a work of art: the bizarre is being passed off as creative.

This film now seems terminally dated, with stilted dialogue, cheesy flashbacks, implausible female characters, and all the narrative energy of a dead flashlight battery. The only high points are some action scenes and comic relief provided by the great Israeli actor Topol (playing an Arab sympathetic to the Israeli cause).Why hasn't anyone ever made a GREAT movie about Israel's fight for independence? \\"Exodus\\" is marginally superior (I like Paul Newman better than Kirk Douglas), but burdened by a glacial pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically inaccurate","review":"While this is a nice film to watch from perspective of big-time American cinema of yesteryear, it is historically inaccurate and minimizes the tremendous Israeli military intelligence and strategic capability even then. Moshe Dayan et al did not need Kirk Douglas or any other American to teach them how to think or fight. Israeli military leadership has been the envy of the world at many times and the concept that a plucky American with capped teeth led the charge during the War of Independence is an insult to these brilliant fighters.

It has everything we've come to expect from Richard Stark and his creation: terse, propulsive narration, utterly amoral behavior by our protagonist, unpredictable plotting, and brutal action.The book is hard to find-- I have a copy in a box that I trip over every five years and read again, but I've never seen it in used bookstores in the last 20 years.

For years it was the only one I hadn't read. Along with PLUNDER SQUAD(read from my local library), they were the only ones I didn't won copies of. I owned original editions of all the older ones, but the prices on the secondary markets for these were out there(several hundred dollars).This was the last Parker novel for almost twenty years and I think he hadn't meant to bring him back. Richard Stark(Donald Westlake) brings quite a few characters back from previous novels to retrieve money hit while he was getting away from criminals and cops in a previous book(SLAYGROUND). it was a suitable wrap-up for what I think was the series.One of the best ones in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Two Dozen","review":"I loved this story. \\"Butcher's Moon\\" assembles characters from Richard Stark's first 15 Parker novels and turns them loose in a thriving Midwestern city. The plot echoes elements of \\"The Hunter,\\" when Stark first introduced Parker, a professional thief, as a knight errant on a quest for a treasure owed him, but denied. This 1974 novel (with a bloody battle royal) seemingly brought down the curtain on Parker's adventures until Stark resurrected his protagonist in 1997 with \\"Comeback,\\" followed by seven more Parker stories, which ended -- permanently --in 2009 with the author's death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Parker series.","review":"When the mob holds his friend hostage, and they send him a finger , Parker goes after them with a fierce revenge.

You can't get bored watching this. The problem is that it is TOO intense. There is too much action and it NEEDS lulls! That is the risk you take in modern action films. You want it interesting but not overdone. This is way overdone.Even though the acting is fine and features a couple of \\"names\\" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the feel of a \\"B\\" film. The best part of it is Scheider's dialog: the only \\"A\\" part of this \\"B\\" film.The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes.

It's a lesser effort for all involved, but was a nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon wasting time. Since it came with 2 other movies, I watched them as well. \\"Corpse Vanishes\\" isn't much of a script but was also fun if you are feeling undemanding. Both of these movies are fairly decent prints. White Zombie is, from what I have read, the star attraction of this set. The print for it is ,by far, the most scratched and damaged of the three but it's a fairly good movie; one of Bela's better ones for the low budget studios. This triple feature set was very inexpensive, which made it more attractive to me as well. All in all, this isn't going to be a star attraction in most people's video libraries, but they are amusing and a fun way to kill a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage In, Garbage Out","review":"Probably the lamest of his solo works to date.

Things go well until he overreaches by considering murder as a means to make his life happier. Ultimately he finds himself in a \\"spot of bother\\". :)This is really a very light read; the author plays it safe, probably too safe. Yet the book is well written; I especially like how the main character is drawn. The mid-1960s English setting is also fun.Bottom line: although a minor entry in the world of mystery novels, 'The Man Who Killed Himself' is a curiously enjoyable read. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sixty Five Big Ones","review":"Here's a chance to acquire sixty five of the absolute best of Artie Shaw's big band renditions of 1938-1939 (with vocalists Helen Forest and Tony Pastor). As you listen to these superbly recorded numbers, you gain a new appreciation for the craftmanship of the era and the frantic pace set by these artists, as evidenced by the fast tempo and pounding beat. This was the pre-WWII music that accompanied the fast dancing of the times. Just listening to this music produces a sense of the exhiliaration the dancers must have felt.

Most of the album was recorded in September and October of 1977, with the exception of the two duets with Waylon Jennings, which were recorded in July of 1976. The biggest hit from the album was the Cash/Jennings duet \\"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\\", which reached #2 on the Country chart. The b-side of that single, also featuring Cash & Jennings, was a hit in it's own right, topping out at #22. \\"I Would Like To See You Again\\" was another hit from the album, peaking at #12.

I bought two copies of this CD, hoping the second one would sound better, but it's the same. The original album sounded much, much better than this. There's no high end, and it all sounds muffled to me. I think the thing that's so disappointing is that since it's been released on CD I doubt they'll remaster it and release it again. I've never experienced this problem before. The songs on this album rate five stars, but the sound quality of this CD makes it unlistenable, so I give it 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found another hidden treasure by Mr. Cash","review":"I had never heard of this album and ordered it based on its good reviews and my confidence in the strength of Cash's work in general.

To add to the complexity of learning a new, dead language, the authors add a glossary organized not in the order of the English alphabet, but in the Pali order. Why not waste time looking up words? Good idea! They also fail to provide meanings for many of the words introduced in each lesson, so buy a dictionary, as many are also not in the glossary. Actual translations of the texts, if they couldn't provide the meanings of the words, would have been nice, but this is also missing. I suspect they didn't let someone who doesn't know Pali try this one out or else it is targeted for a classroom situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a small engine","review":"The plug looks fine but it says it will fit nearly any small engine.

The songs and dances are excellent, but this movie might have a little difficulty being shown nowadays since the main goal of some of the major characters is working with tobacco for cigarettes.

There was an animated feature of it being planned by John Hubley, and even a soundtrack recorded--with Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Frank Sinatra!!! Alas, the director was called before the House on Un-American Activities and the financial backers disappeared. In the interim, we had the Korean War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the beginnings of Vietnam. It certainly WOULD seem dated in the late '60's--but the film is a flawed miracle. Compared to MOST of the musicals in the '60's (My Fair Lady, Camelot, Hello Dolly) it stands oout over them all. Beautiful cinematography, great songs, great orchestrations, great singing!! A couple of the roles were mis-cast, most notably the REALLY annoying Tommy Steele."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizzare 60's Musical","review":"Although the story is very complicated, I will try to tell it the best I can. Two Irish immigrants move to a backwoods town of bizarros, in order to bury some stolen gold. The guy who the gold was stolen from, (in this case a leprechaun), has tailed them to the backwoods to take it back. Between songs and dances like 'Woody's Here' and 'How Are Things In Glocka Morra' the town battles against the intense, ramshackle house-living Senator, played by Keenan Wynn. This is quite bizzare for the usual light-hearted, song-and-dance musical, but I really wouldn't expect anything else to come out of the late 1960's. If you are interested in a queer, sly movie, get this. But you won't really go for this if you are a fan of Seven Brides For Seven Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Viewer From Florida.","review":"This Movie is great.

The music gets boring fast and all the songs sound like the same surfer thrash crap. Put a fork in Ghoul, they're done. If Ghoul goes on any further they'd probably end up being a reject worthelss GWAR-clone on Mickey Mouse surf boards..wait, that actually sounds like what they are now.

Just watch the movie and then fish for recent works with each of those young talents.From Crudup to Joaquin to Tyler to Going to Jenniffer Connelly - what we see in Inventing the Abbotts is an amazing set of performers reaching to stardoom. I believe the film should be classified as mandatory in acting schools.For the rest, I believe this script is as close to reality as it can get. A small town, a wealthy family, a classic rich/poor idiosyncratic drama, false assumptions which could ruin lives, hard working single parents, young daughters struggling with the coming of age, ... all quite well integrated into a movie which is delightful to see and to call your attention for preemptive judgement.Joanna Going, Liv Tyler and Jenniffer Connelly are absolutely remarkable and beautiful. Yet the prize goes to Joaquin, for his amazing performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"This was one of the best romance movies I have ever seen.

The plot is wonderful. Even if you are not romantic no can resist it. The acting was equally superb, specifically Liv Tyler as Pam. It is difficult not to feel sorry for Lloyd Abbot, or even not to grow quite fond of him. After all throughout the film his character was burdened with perception of being the absolute antagonist throughout the film until finally near the end Doug, begins to see him without in a new light without Jacey's hatred interfering.I conclude this review with a strong recommendation to those individuals who have not obtained the opportunity to view this film do so as soon as possible!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic but hard","review":"This is another good movie of Liv Tyler just like her 'Stealing Beauty'.

Some tracks are lazy and relaxed, some are intense and suspenseful-sounding, but they share a common trait: each has traits of a Wild West theme.

The music has a language all it's own, and the audio cues take you right back into the FIREFLY 'verse. You will recognize the twangy chords of the \\"SERENITY\\" theme, the forceful drums that announce the\\"REAVERS\\", and the romantic yet mournful sounds that accompany the MAL/INARA relationship.

If you're a Firefly/Serenity fan at all, support the show and buy this soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completes the collection of this firefly fan","review":"I have the series DVD set, I have the movie. Now I have the soundtrack. More than most series Greg Edmonson has made the music a critical element of the series. As the firefly Serenity is a character is the show, so it is with Greg's music. The funeral music almost brings me to tears by itself. Keep flying Brown Coats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"Having been a big fan of the show, the music is to my ears not only very pleasant, but nostalgic as well.

The book was needed for a class and as a result of waiting the 3 week delivery window it created much dismay on our end. I would not suggest using this vendor as they did not respond to even the most courteous of inquiries and clearly have no regard for their customers.

Though the authors have gone to a lot of trouble to provide pictures of the people and places they discuss, and though there are some compelling quotations and stories which COULD interest middle-school aged children, the text has entirely too much information. The authors attempt too much. This would be a good text for someone preparing to TEACH middle school, from which they could glean good information, but it is overwhelming to the student unless the teacher can focus and subordinate well.

In a world of talking toys and electronic distractions, puppets provide gentle, invaluable opportunities for learning, including self-discovery, therapy, and storytelling.As a parent and a teacher, this puppet is by far one of the best I've found in a long time. It is well-made; the seams are tightly sewn, and the hand placement is comfortable for a variety of different hand-sizes - both child and adult. The little nut that he holds is attached by a very short, wide grosgrain ribbon (not a flimsy string). And unlike many stock puppets these days, this squirrel has tons of personality: after only a few minutes of interaction with my daughter, I almost forgot that he was a puppet at the end of my hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was sent wrong size puppet","review":"Was sent a much smaller squirrel puppet.

I'll keep ordering it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good for kids... ;) Awesome quality.","review":"Detailing of the squirrel, the range of motion on forearms, even the movement of the lower jaw, are so biomechanically believable I was astonished. It is very easily manipulated by medium sized hand, but may be too large for youngsters to work the arms and head/mouth at same time. The materials and structure are high quality and should be a lifetime purchase. However, I actually ordered this puppet to play interactively with my DOG!!! He loves his toys to be \\"live\\" and bite back... This puppet is super high quality and he will be able to carry the squirrel around by any of his appendages for years to come.This puppet will perfectly accompany the Gray Squirrel at Pacific Avenue storybook by Geri Harrington, part of the Smithsonian Institution's Backyard collection. For that reason I will purchase another one for my granddaughter! You will not be disappointed in either the quality of materials, construction, or detailing of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"squirel","review":"I love this toy it is so well made.

Living in the Texas with squirrels everywhere it was quite an apt gift (especially as we are Australian) to celebrate his birth (my girls have a stuffed koala and emu as their birth toys). Now, my son is 3.5 yrs old, and squirrel goes everywhere with us. He has been very durable - except for the part where my son 'picked' off the covering for the acorn. Unfortunately, squirrel was left at park while we were camping, and despite going back the next day, he was gone. We will definitely be buying him again despite our 'no more stuffed toys' stance as he is such an exceptional toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibson & Camp -- Not At Their Best","review":"This is not a great recording -- but if you should ever hear the original \\"Gibson & Camp At The Gate of Horn\\" (c., 1961 on Elektra Records), you will discover an absolute treasure. \\"Revisited\\" tries to capture Gibson & Camp in that historic '60's performance, (virtually every song is contained on the original release), and falls flat on its face.

The yoga exercises did not flow well and hardly amounted to much stretching or relaxing. The quality of the production was unimpressive in a brightly lit, crowded studio. In place of this, I would recommend Rainbeau Mars series of yoga DVDs (ranging from beginner to more advanced). The quality of production is much better and the choreography and explanation of moves are much clearer and more logical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing and a great stretch!","review":"This is the kind of yoga workout I've been looking for. I've done a few others and they always feel more strenuous then they do relaxing. This stetches every part of my body out!

It's go at your own pace- don't overdo it yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Tape","review":"I purchased this video several months back, and it quickly became one of my favorites. I like Sara Ivanhoe's approach to giving instruction. She's calming and relaxing, and while she explains how to do the poses, she repeatedly reminds you that this practice should be relaxing. For those of you who find that power yoga defeats the concept of what yoga is all about, you should find this an enjoyable tape. I rotate through several of my yoga videos, but I really like to do this one before bedtime, because it puts me in a nice relaxed state. If your an advanced yogi, this might not fit your bill, but you might enjoy it when you need a break and just want to center and calm yourself. I just purchased On the Ball - Yoga Workout for Beginners with Sara Ivanhoe, and I can't wait for it to come in the mail.Happy Yoga Practice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this dvd thinking that it would be very relaxing before bedtime. I also own the Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout dvd, which I really like a lot.I was extremely disappointed in Candlelight Yoga, mainly because all they did was take a section of The Perfect Yoga Workout and put it on a dvd and call it Candlelight Yoga.For a relaxing workout, buy Crunch-The Perfect Yoga Workout. You will get much better results and wake up feeling very relaxed and refreshed."},{"rating":"2","title":"relax & stretch","review":"I've tried quite a few different Yoga instructional videos, and this is one of my favorites for relaxation and stretching. It's perfect before bedtime. The instructor has a soothing voice and she says just enough to encourage you but not seem too chatty. The music could be better, but that's a personal preference. I like that they show you modifications for beginners or advanced yogis. If you have Netflix, try it out on Instant play first and see how you like it.

My daughter was so excited to get it and we had fun peeling the pieces off of the paper. However, they would not stick to the board, even a little bit and we've pretty much lost them all.

My father and I listen to it all the time, although I like *NSYNC and all of those other bands, I even agree that kids should listen to this kind of music instead. Besides, the music that is out these days, like EMINEM and all of those other bad people, fill kids lives with bad ideas and hate towards others- however this CD will defeat the evil and bring back the good in childrens lives.

Why? Because \\"MGM\\" is merely a name affixed to a company that doesn't own the great old MGM library...Warner Brothers owns those films...so if you're looking for the best of Elvis at MGM (like JAILHOUSE ROCK, WORLD'S FAIR, VIVA VEGAS, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS) look elsewhere.If you are an Elvis completist and don't mind spending your money on this ill-conceived collection, have at it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing I have tried is that good.","review":"I have tried several recipes in this book, but overall the results range from \\"so-so\\" to awful.

Something about this book just doesn't live up to the excellence of the earlier 3 volumes. Perhaps it's the heavy lineweights of some of the plans and elevations. Or perhaps it is the sudden introduction of dozens of computer renderings which are either too bland or overdone. On one hand they fall short of photorealism, while on the other hand these collages of blazing color/material/fake-looking-people detract from the architectural purity of Meier's work. Sadly the tiny images in the chronology at the back of the book reflect Meier's style better than the projects this book chooses to present.That said, this book contains the Jubilee church, the two courthouses and a few private houses all of which are Meier at his best and are well documented with drawings and photos. That alone makes this book worth the purchase price. But if you're hoping for a book equal to or better than Vol 1 or 3, prepare to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, not works though","review":"Meier's has passed his peak after Thomas Phiffer leaving his office and that's cleary illustrated in Vol.4. The 2 courthouse projects are the best among them while those apartments are just cheesy and really get me wonder why he even take those jobs.

It makes me feel so lucky to be living here that we have the freedom to make our own choices. It makes me all the more anxious to finish my adoption process.

My cats were a little freaked out by me stretching to unknown lands, but they've since adjusted. As has my body.I had a lot of lower back pain, and while I still do occasionally I've benefited and slept better because of the simple stretches in the book.

The clarity, warmth, and imaging are the best I've heard from any remastered recording. In fact, the sound quality is better than some CD's I've heard that were recorded in the last year or two.

Poor kitty.Since then, I did some research and no longer feed him crappy dry food with corn as the first ingredient. I still feed him dry food, but I feed him good-quality protein-rich food instead, sprinkle Cosequin over it and then fill the rest of the bowl with water. Once the dry food soaks up the water, it's about the consistency of canned food. He loves it, and hasn't had any urinary issues since.

Per our vet, he was suffering from joint pain just like aging humans and the Cosequin would help it.

He is now running and playing with the laser pointer like he's a young man again. I am about to order 2 more bottles!

The side effect we noted was increased urination. An obvious one since it is also used as a supplement for kidney health. For some cats just once or twice a week may be enough.Luckily a recent bout with kitty flu caused her to drop 2 pounds and less weight has meant less strain on her hip and little need for the Cosequin.If your cat is even a 2 pounds chubby with joint pain use the Cosequin while you put them on real diet. Once the weights off many can drop the pills completely.I do expect she'll need again in the future as she gets into her high teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increases the quality of my cat's life.","review":"My cat is a retired old man with joint pain.

He is a picky eater and I was skeptical as to whether or not he would eat it. Pilling him is tough, but possible. Lucky for me, these capsules can be opened and the supplement sprinkled onto his food. Bungee actually looks forward to his treat and meows if it is missing from his dinner. So getting it into him is easy. But the results have been wonderful. He is about to turn 10. But I could see signs that his back was becoming uncomfortable. I decided to put him on Cosequin before things went bad. He is doing great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes for a crazy 19 year old cat!","review":"I've had my cat on this product for several years now. At 19 years of age, she is still going strong! She begs to be \\"beat up\\" - you have to flop her down on the floor, rough up one side, flop her over, rough up the OTHER side, then get the string and let her chase it around. She can still do about 6 laps before getting tuckered! I attribute a lot of this activity to the CoSequin, recommended by my vet originally for my 12 year old Rottweiler (who has since passed on) - started my cat on the feline dose and she is MUCH more comfortable and moves around a lot more than prior to this wonderful stuff.Buying it here is certainly more economical than getting it from my vet, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"I ordered this cosequin because the price was terrific for the amount of medication I was supposed to get. The information for this order stated that each container held 80 sprinkle capsules. However, when the product arrived each container only held 55 capsules. I think cosequin is a terrific producted. I have used it for years for 3 cats and think in has made a significant diffence in their problems with arthritis (and with one of the three with a different condition). However, I don't like when a product is falsly advertised.

There are suppose to be no side effects but my 12 year old cat can't tolerate it very well. Initially got it at the vet's for double the money Amazon charges. He was suppose to get one pill on his food in the morning and another in the evening. He doesn't like it at all and I've had to mix it very carefully to camoflage the taste. After monitoring him, I had to cut it down to half a pill once a day. His problem is it makes him have very soft, uncontrollable bowels. I'm sure you know what I'm saying. I did notice his arthritis was improving but I didn't like having to clean up the poop. I now give it to him once every 3 or 4 days, 1/2 pill at a time.I personally don't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Ingredients","review":"The problem with this supplement is the non active ingredients it contains including Red and Blue coloring.

If you want to review what you watched on the last three disks, this is a good thing. Seeing the storylines play out in three (instead of 12) episodes will help you see how they link together.But, if you just got done watching the other three disks and saw how the stories thread together early, this fourth one will seem like a waste of money because you pull nothing new out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite Must-Read!!","review":"This is definately a good book. I have always been a fan of stories that have relatives finding each other. A set of twins seperated not long after their birth find each other in the same airport they happen to be in at the same time. Deciding to find out why their families lied to them they switch places. You receive hints about what is happening to the city boy in the country but to end the family fued, you have to read the second book to find out what happens when the rest of the family finds out about the switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller That's Worth a Second Read","review":"What a delight to read a thriller that's honest, realistic, and riveting--without the burden of unwanted sex scenes and obscene language! Pacing is excellent. Essential background is deftly woven into the story without disturbing the forward momentum. Dialogue is natural. And the playful interaction between David Coleman and his wife provides just the right amount of relief from the mounting tension to give the reader time to catch his or her breath before jumping back into the action. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thick enough","review":"I had heel pain and purchased these to help. They did not work,they are not thick enough.

It has such popular tunes as Deck the Halls, We wish you a merry Christmas, Jingle Bells, Frosty the Snowman, Twelve Days of Chrismas and other Favorites. I highly recomend this Video as well as all Kidsongs Videos. They are worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"over-the-top but infectious","review":"I have a 4 yo brother who's absolutely in love with this series. He watches the Christmas special repetitively and sings along passionately (he'll actually replay his favorite songs over and over again on the DVD player.) Great for kids, because it keeps them happy & thoroughly entertained; maybe not so good for you, because you'll have these melodies ringing in your ears for a good 24 hours. The cheese factor and the over-the-top nature of this series are really what keeps the kids absolutely mesmerized and entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidsong missed the mark on this one","review":"The DVD was just OK. It only had 1 or 2 traditional Christmas songs and the remaining 5 or 6 songs were orignal songs that no one either don't know nor probably never heard before. I was hoping this DVD would have been a great way to introduce my 2 year old to all the traditional Christmas songs, but not the case. Also, the dancing wasn't the best either unlike many other Kidsong DVDs. I would not recommend this DVD if you want to enjoy it as a family, but as a toddler, like my daughter, would probably like it because of the many children that are on the DVD that are dancing and singing, plus seeing Santa Claus several times through the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Christmas","review":"We love being able to pass along the songs we grew up with to the family now growing up before our eyes.

What a disappointment! They should call it Happy Holidays as it deals with Christmas from a secular point of view. My daughter loves it, her face lights up when she sees Santa Claus but I wish it had more Carols and more holiday spirit. It's easy to see that it was shot on a sound stage with lots of fake snow. The main Story line is about a boy who goes to the North Pole to see Santa because he has been naughty all year, and he still gets a gift because he did one good deed. Another little girl gets a pony. (I guess all of it is done in a dream sequence, because as soon as the boy opens his eyes on Christmas morning he asks for a present). Still if you child likes Christmas music, you can try it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE VOMIT BAG??!!","review":"I used to be a Kidsongs fan but this is the worst one I've ever seen.

I have rolled up the boot covers and he wears it like that without too much complaining ... better than tripping all over the place.The muscle chest is not like other muscle costumes that are puffy. It's stiff, but my son has not complained that it's uncomfortable and he has worn it ALOT.Since we already had a hard molded plastic Batman mask, I like that this one came with a fabric one with the cape attached. He changes which one he wears all the time.For the price I paid, I definitely recommend this costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son loves it but I'm not impressed","review":"Well, the costume doesn't look nearly as nice or fit as on the model stock photo (as to be expected)! The muscle chest caves in a little and overall just looks a little dumpy. I am going to safety pin parts of the costume Halloween night so that it looks more tailored rather than dumpy. The mask is what really makes this costume but unfortunately, the mask does not fit well and constantly falls into his eyes covering his vision. I can see it being very dangerous walking around Halloween night with it on!! The cape is attached to the mask. Overall, pretty disappointed but my 3 yr old doesn't see the flaws and loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrespresented","review":"I bought a Black Batman costume for my sons birthday and received a BLACK GROMET??? Excuse me??

So if there is a picture of a batman costume and a description of a costume, I should assume it is NOT a costume and go directly to their website to make sure??? I guess they just advertise costumes and send gromets instead??? Instead of getting to the bottom of it they told me I had to deal with Amazon, after talking to someone overseas at Amazon, I was reconnected to Woodcraft only to be told they have informed customer service and I would hear back after the weekend. Don't trust them, they do not stand behind what they sell on Amazon and do not have the customer service to back it up, they are rude and unaccomidating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac bias","review":"This book is strictly for beginners.

Of course, I enjoyed hearing Ernie Haase and Signature Sound and was glad that BIll introduced George Younce's family.

There instrumentals have a lilting quality with an outstanding melody.The Salil Chowdhury-esque bengali ditty, \\"Jhiri Jhiri Choyetali\\" is a gem, sung wonderfully by Geeta Dutt.

The Bhatiyali and Baul tracks may or may not appeal in this age of percussion heavy music, but it provides a glimpse into the culture of Bengal.\\"Falling\\", the last fusion track on the album is excellent.One other number that stands out is Susheela Raman's version of an old bollywood number \\"Ye Mera Deevanapan hai\\".This album comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ab workouts.","review":"The DVD is composed of 10 different ab exercises.

Unfortunately it's packed so full of names, dates and places that there's no real room for narrative. As a reader I was so worried about which name went with which ship in what part of the world and under whose flag that I was often burned out on the subject after half a chapter.It includes maps which are very good and essential, and there are 'boxes' at the end of each chapter containing anecdotal information (such as chapter 2's \\"Elizabethan Era Navigation\\") that are more charming and easy to digest than the main text.I quite honestly wanted to like this book, even while I was reading it, but the author never fully developed the narrative thread that would have made this sweeping look at 250 years of piracy read like anything other than a textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Contains Little Information on Water-soluble Oils","review":"This book is primarily a course in basic painting tecnique applicable to any medium. There is almost no information specific to painting with water-soluble oils and some of what it has is misleading. The author states that they will have the same consistency, feel and volume as regular oils, which they do not. Don't waste your money unless you are a beginner who has never held a brush before.

I don't mind the weak story; I'm here for the fighting. But the problem is that this transfer was incompetantly done. The movie crops most of the fight scenes, and the inexplicable camera work is hightened by the miserable panning. The colors are washed-out, the audio is terrible, and the source film is badly blemished and scratched.If, someday, there is a retouched, remastered release, I'll covet it for my collection. Meanwhile, don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughably bad","review":"If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen this movie and wants to, be warned: Spiritual Kung Fu is NOT a flick that should be taken seriously.

I noticed that there was an instuctional section of the DVD. Not thinking twice about it, I started this workout full-force, only to find myself completely standing still. The choreography is atrocious. I tried my hardest to keep up with her, only to find out that once I mastered a move, they were onto the next confusing move. Not being a professional dancer put me at an extreme disadvantage. But I also did not expect to be buying a \\"dance\\" workout! I tried to give this workout a chance, and decided to try to navigate through the instructional section. No wonder I couldn't follow. The combinations are too complex.

It will give you a decent idea of what exercises to do, and a tiny bit of the reasons why to do them, but that is all. The authors suggest doing some very simple exercises like the bench press, for which they show photos. For the very complex, and somewhat dangerous, plyometric and power development exercises, they give almost no detail on how to do the exercise. Why would they show photos of simple exercises that everyone knows how to do, and then just skim over the complex ones that they suggest are the most important exercises??"},{"rating":"1","title":"plenty of misinformation in this book","review":"that this book gets such great reviews is proof of how little the general public knows about weight training. many of the pictures and instructions for lifts is wrong, which is potentially dangerous. among the worst is the power clean which shows an atrocious way to set up, and a dangerous way to catch. deadlift setup is also wrong.but nothing compares to the idiotic way the authors treat the squat. recommending athletes to engage in qtr and half squats is at irresponsible and possibly negligent. its far more dangerous than a full squat (do a force diagram) and does very little in the way of building strength bc the muscles are not stretched to the proper extent to force an adaption.if you want weightlifting advice, i would suggest getting it from powerlifting or olympic lifting books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"This is so basic of a weight training book that only a beginner might glean something from it.

Other standard thoughts include varying your workout over time to constantly stress your muscles so they don't become too accustomed to one particular workout routine. The author references his personal training program available via his website one too many times for my taste. When reading the book you get the feeling that the \\"cycling\\" aspect of the book seems more the result of a search and replace operation in a word processor versus a book really geared towards cyclists.If you haven't spent much time in a gym lifting weights then this book might be more valuable then I found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I am an avid bodybuilder and cyclist. I was hopeful that, as the title implies, that this book would contain information about how to use weight training to improve your cycling performance. Let me state emphatically that this book fails miserably to achieve this end. It's content is primarily focused on very basic weightlifting information which is easily found on the Internet or just asking a moderately well informed friend. Long discourses on picking a gym and the relative merits of free weights vs machines are presented instead of any in depth information about anything of value to a cyclist or weight trainer.In a word, this book is crap.

His book is a lie and his self-aggrandizing remarks on his work in Iraq are horribly flawed. He was responsible for making sure the toilets ran. That hardly make him a hero.

I have an older version of this mouse that I bought in August 2002, and I still use it. Unfortunately, they've changed something in how they make this mouse and it's not worth your money.I ignored the more recent reviews (which did not rate this mouse favorably) and bought another one of these mice just a couple of months ago, and already it has started to click incorrectly if my finger hits the button at certain angles. And the other day, my cursor started shaking around randomly. So I no longer recommend this product.BUYER BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I got this thing because my old mouse stopped working. This thing is terrible. First of all any time I would pick up the mouse and then put it down the pointer would jump to somewhere else on the screen. This alone would make the device unbearable to deal with. Second annoyance? The stupid driver from Microsoft would not run on Win 7 and there was no updated driver for it either. I returned this piece of crap and bought a \\"Kensington K72356US Mouse-in-a-Box USB Desktop Mouse\\" for $7.99. The Kensington mouse works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as it used to be.","review":"I purchased one of these exact models about 3 years ago and I love it. Still works great. Scroll wheel is fluid, clicks provide good feedback yet not overly loud and clacky.I purchased a 2nd one for my office last week. Seems like a totally different mouse. Very harsh, rough, jittery scroll wheel. Loud & clumsy button clicks. Cord is super kinked. The quality on these has really gone down. I would speculate that the factory in China was switched to a different one.Look for something else. This performs like bottom of the barrel mice."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad scrolling","review":"Although this mouse has great response, the scroll feature is ridiculously inept. I installed the software, as instructed, but it is of little value. When scrolling, the scroll wheel has little clicks that you can feel. Each click runs the mouse down WAY too many lines. On most pages one click takes you almost to the end of the page. There is no setting anywhere in the software to change this. If you like manually dragging the slider down to move down a page in smaller increments, then fine. Otherwise don't bother with this mouse. I wish I hadn't bought it, and since it completed a $25 free shipping order, I won't hassle with the return. I'll just end up putting it in a drawer for emergencies and will replace it next week with a better one.

I use this mouse at work doing 3D modeling, gaming, and for leisure purposes. The problem I've found with other mice is the middle buttons gets stuck and/or doesn't scroll well. I've never had a problem with it and I've been using the same one for over 5 years. This is important because the middle mouse is used a lot for 3D Modeling.

Sometimes, I wouldn't even be scrolling and the screen would simply jerk. I suspected the mouse and plugged in another and realized the new mouse \\"clicked\\" when I used the wheel, in other words, the scroll wheel on the first mouse, like a gear, was basically stripped out and would continue to scroll regardless that I had stopped.

It freaked me out. The film was already unpleasant and very disturbing but this scene ended it for me. I have never seen it since and don't care to. I watched part of this sequel on cable and couldn't finish it either but for a different reason...it was just plain AWFUL! Stupid to the extreme and poor on all counts. The first one was at least upsetting enough to bother me...so it must have worked on a terror level. But \\"Eyes 2\\" was ridiculous. I cannot recommend this at all.

Hills Have Eyes 2 isn't scary one bit, and looks more like a cheap re-make of the original film. Craven had a lot of trauma effecting his personal life when this was filmed, so that can be excusable to a point for this waste.

I was NOT expecting to absolutely love this book, but I was hooked from the beginning.What I find so fascinating about this novel is that the main character has commited the worst possible crime a person can commit, yet the reader can't help but pull for him. I also wasn't expecting to find any humor, but it was found in some of the strangest places.

Later in his life he moved to New Mexico, and in 1994 it influenced him to create this album, a collection of Western-influenced songs. Country music isn't really Country & Western anymore, as the Western-influenced songs have dropped by the wayside. This album goes some towards correcting that.My favorite songs on this album were Walk Right In, Too Far Away To Kiss You, and C. C. Rider. Did The Poor Man Die? was nice and silly, a good tune.

I purchased this video after about 4 months of practice and was completely bored. I couldn't even get past the first couple of segments. I found the pace slow. The first video that I bought was Crunch: Fat Burning Yoga, I loved it! I found it easy to follow and just the right amount of challenge, so I looked for other videos by Sara Ivanhoe.

I was real excited to get this dvd and learn some new great poses. I have just started doing Yoga and I already knew 11 of the 12 poses. I can not believe that I already knew them because they are such simple ones and this is \\"beyond basic\\". It is very clear and it is nice that is shows you what you could be doing wrong but I assumed I would learn the new poses in a flowing sequence. You just learn them and then hold them for 6 breaths and it's over. It is very easy to do and you could probably skip the first one. Her Crunch dvd's and 20 min workouts are better.

Simultaneously, I found it a dynamic read, in the way that the stories he included spanned years of experience, trial and error, and wisdom of what our forefathers and mothers in this movement would have done differently.

I sent it back for repair under Gerber warranty. They promptly sent a replacement knife but it had a faulty safety/lock catch.

Not sure about the blade never got a chance to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little knife","review":"Found this knife at a yard sale, and liked it so much I had to find it online. I've been a big fan of Gerber tools for a long while, and this tool has the same quality feel to it. It is definitely a 'right hand' tool, and might be a little ackward to operate left handed.My only wish is that it had been the half serrated version, as I prefer the combination blade. The only gripe I have is the clip is a little stiff, something with a little more spring would have been handy for clipping it onto a jeans pocket.As for comments that the knife is not safe, I have to disagree. The blade release slide has a 'safe' position which prevents the knife from openning. I've had my paraframe knife with the open body get caught on fabric in my pocket, but this little guy has never openned on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"My favorite thing about Asylum Of Satan is counting how many times Lucinda says Dr. Spector's name.

The actress from Asylum was beautiful, though. The quality of both films are borderline acceptable. They both have a lot of scratches and grain but considering these movies had extremely limited releases, it's a miracle they've made it to DVD. No, the best thing on this amazing DVD package is the short called \\"Satan's Dance\\" with Burlesque Queen Lorraine Lane. The whole thing is COOL!

Most of the books are well-written and very enjoyable, but this one is definitely far below the average.The characterizations are surprisingly inept, and the plotting is so amateurish as to make the reader wonder if Donald Bain really wrote it.The biggest example (Spoiler Alert):A man is murdered in a hotel. Then someone tells Jessica that he remembers when the murdered man and his brother, who looked a lot like him, used to spend summers at the hotel when they were children. Then a witness swears that she's seen the murdered man alive and well.

I've been doing Phase 1 for about 6 weeks, and I can see increases in ab and core strength each workout. (This is partly due to my starting in a rather untrained state.) In the past many ab exercises have given me lower back pain, but I've been fine so far with this workout.Like the previous reviewer, I had to pause the video during the first several workouts to get the movements right. I also initially found some exercises extremely difficult to do at all. Don't let these obstacles dissuade you--they will go away with practice. For example, Phase 1 includes a side bend for which I could barely hold the starting position at first; now I am doing 7 reps per side, and adding 1 rep per week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"It's not what i though it would be.

Madison's dating history of toads suddenly means more than we think, as the fun cast begins to interact in this well-written tale.Cynthia Borris's book should be on everyone's Christmas list this year.

Jacques Tourneur was in fact hired by Producer David O. Selznick as production supervisor for these scenes. Mammoth sets of the Bastille were constructed as well as surrounding Parisian structures.

Of course there are many other medications now on the market, but putting my child on Ritalin three years ago made all the difference. He has his confidence back, and I believe that it will lead to a successful future. No parent wants to medicate their child, but for those who do it is not a negative thing.

However, the publishing quality is the worst I have ever seen. The internal content of this book appears to be a cheap photocopy of a master record - text is distorted on every single page, in some cases very badly, graphs and charts are grainy and in some cases impossible to read, and the spine is flimsy at best and came apart on me after a single reading.Bottom line - the content is excellent but AVOID THIS EDITION!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performances in a bygone style","review":"Perhaps my liking for this series is related to their being the first Shakespeare plays I saw as a child, on the predecessor to PBS, helping to spark a lifelong love of the playwright's work and the language in general. These black and white, highly theatrical stagings may seem strange to people today. But the actors delivery their lines with such feeling and knowledge of what they are saying that the lack of cinematic movement and naturalistic acting seems irrelevant. Highly recommended for the Shakespeare buff who wants to see excellent performances by fine actors, in a venerable style that no longer exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tad creaky, but classic TV drama","review":"It's unthinkable that something this ambitious and high brow -- eight Shakespeare history plays told in 15 hours of TV with more than 600 speaking parts -- would be attempted by anyone other than the BBC. The cast is starry indeed, ranging from Judi Dench and Sean Connery to Julian Glover and Eileen Atkins. It was a smashing success in 1960 and while much discussed has been rarely seen since then, until this fine five disc set. Great fun for theater and Shakespeare buffs.

Unlike the author, these performances are hopelessly dated. I purchased the set for my British Lit. class; however my students would bolt for the door within minutes. I hoped the plays would be like those operas they filmed on stage in the late 50's and 60's. Unfortunately they are not. Also, the dialogue is, surprisingly, difficult to understand. I just attended a performance of Richard III at Shakespeare in Chicago. Every line bright and clear. Two of our guests who are not fans of Elizabethan English had no difficulty understanding. Not so with this DVD.

It was so memorable that I have never forgotten it -- especially Robert Hardy's performance as Prince Hal in Henry IV and as Henry V. He was so young and vigorous that his performance transcended the small screen and the absence of color. I've been a devotee of public TV ever since, but nothing was ever as exciting as those plays at that time. Perhaps it was TV's newness at the time, but since then TV drama has been prettied up and has lost its immediacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare at its best","review":"I saw An Age of Kings back on Australian TV in 1960 or 1961 and have never forgotten it. The performance of Richard II is the best I've seen (including the RSC at Stratford-on-Avon). Terry Scully gave a great performance as King Henry VI -- not the easiest or most sympathetic character to play. He awoke in me an interest in the historical King Henry VI that has lasted now some 50 years. I was sorry to learn that he had died of a stroke in 2001. I have often sought in vain for a video of this great BBC series -- succeeding versions have all tended to be too \\"contemporary\\" and \\"avant garde\\" for my taste.

The book enabled me to understand and accept some sides of the Kripalu teachings that had annoyed me at the time : namely the emphasis put on the body, and the psychological acceptance of oneself. After reading it, I was totally able to understand why and relate to that teaching.Even if you have read 100 books on yoga, I promise that you will find something new and interesting in this account. it is beautifully written (I cannot believe this is a first book ! what an achievement !) and the psychological anecdotes on people that I usually found boring are actually quite interesting in S.

Anyone who reads this book with an open mind will, I believe, become convinced that God's plan for our sexuality is for our good and makes sense. I recommend this book on many different levels - a great gift for teens as they struggle through the turbulent adolescent years, a welcome addition to any library (secular or religious), and a must read for parents - since in my work I have found that very few parents understand the virtue of chastity, and therefore find it nearly impossible to articulate a message of sexual purity to their teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book on the game","review":"Great for history and even the esoteric information of the sport and the rules, every facet of the game is covered.

This workout is divided into four sections. Three are designed to target specific areas: abs, buns, and thighs. The final workout is a total body challenge. All sections last ten minutes. I do all four as if the workouts aren't separate. Although I definitely feel it in my abdominals, I do feel that I wasn't challenged enough on the bun and thigh exercises. This may be attributed to slightly incorrect form (I felt I did them correctly...I'm an advanced exerciser, but new to Pilates) or perhaps I need to do more reps than the tape allows.

This DVD is a depiction of nontraditional Pilates. The exercise orders are not Joseph Pilates' original exercise orders, there is not a seamless flow between exercises, and there is music playing. Joseph Pilates did not play music because each exercises has its own rhythm, dynamic, and tempo to be determined by the instructor during a given lesson.It is important to protect the public interest by labeling products properly. Most other professions have a state licensing board to protect the public interest, but the art and practice of the Pilates method does not. To properly describe this video, perhaps video producers should call this workout a Pilates-based exercise routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT REAL PILATES","review":"If you're serious about pilates, don't go for this one.

I can't imagine this workout (if you can call it a workout at all) to get me into any kind of shape. Also, the instructor does not inspire me; her body is on the thicker, soft side, not the lean, muscular \\"dancer's\\" body you would expect from an insructor.

When I do use this DVD I always feel a burn (I sort of an andvanced beginner). I was also very suprised that the host did not drive me crazy, when I have done videos in the past the hosts generally irritate me, but that was not the case with Ellen.

The three workouts do get repetitous afer a while since there are only the 3 ten-minute sessions. As I add more DVD's I will still use this one to supplement when I only have a short time to get something in.I feel better knowing I did a 10 minute workout instead of no workout at all if I don't have 30 minutes in my schedule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout for beginnners","review":"I have always dreaded working out with all the sweating and huffing and puffing, but I love using this video because you get just as good a workout doing small controlled movements than you do when you are doing fast workouts.

It is short, great for sneaking in a little exercise time on a busy day, and it's challenging without being impossible for a novice. There is no shame in following Betsy's modivications! My husband has even started exercising with me. He's much more active than I, yet he still felt a good burn from this workout.Ellen's workout is broken down into three ten minute sections, one each of belly, butt and thighs. There is a ten minute total body routine, which is one I uses the most frequently. They are all great, and I swear since doing pilates I have much less lower back pain. Each time I go without I am quick to feel my lower back and sides bind up. Of course, form is crucial, so spend some time really learning the poses and take your time to ensure you are doing them correctly and consistently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Fun, plus good results","review":"This is a great work out for those who like quick, simple and fast results. I'm not an exercise fanatic at all, but I found this video to be perfect for my lifestyle. It's really only 30 minutes to do all three exercises and the time flies! The instructor is really pleasant to watch, and the video isn't totally cheesy like some other work-out videos. My husband and I have both been doing the video regularly (3-4x a week) for 3 weeks now and we are starting to see definite definition in our bodies. I recommend this video to people who have never tried Pilates, it's a great intro and trust me, you will start getting hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good \\"quick fix.\\"","review":"This is a great video if you are interested in focusing on those \\"problem spots\\" but don't have enough time to devote to a full work out.

I can do 10,20, or 30 minute sets right before I go to bed and I don't feel guilty about missing a work out at the gym.Some of these exercises are tough, but I like a little challenge. I have been to a real Pilates center and many of the exercises that are used in this video were the same ones that I learned during my real Pilates session. I have acutally seen results from this video and I was very happy with my purchase!Also good is the Crunch Fat Burning Pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st-time doing Pilates","review":"I bought this DVD b/c of the reviews I read on amazon.com. I am a mother of a 2yr old and a 4mo old baby and I wanted to add some new videos to my exercise collection. I've been reading a lot about Pilates b/c it has been so popular and I figured I would try this one out. And let me say...I LOVE THIS DVD! I am overweight to begin with b/c of the fact that I had 2 children in 20 months so I am dealing with the wt loss from both pregnancies. I have yet to see the scale number go down, but my pants and shorts sure do fit now! I also *LOVE* the 10min sessions. It is hard for me physically to do more than 1 session a day, just b/c it is quite difficult, but being a mom, I need the quick sessions like this and I love it! As someone else said, it is all mat work so it makes working out a lot easier! I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in starting Pilates!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners","review":"This is the second Pilates workout I've purchased and I really enjoyed it. I liked the idea of four 10-minute segments I could mix and match to create my own workout. I am still a Pilates beginner, so this workout challenged me. The abs, thighs, and buns section have left me sore in all the right places. The total body challenge is a bit more difficult than the individual segments. If you are a true beginner at Pilates, I would highly recommend this to you. As you progess, you can repeat the segments or add repititions.However, if you are already at an intermediate Pilates level or are in-shape to begin with, I would look for something else. I had my roommate try this DVD (who is a moderate exerciser.) He said the only challenging part of the DVD was the total body segment, and he had never done Pilates before, so I believe this is truly a beginner's workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"Ellen is a master of pilates. I love this DVD. You have different sets you can do and it all feels so good. I have been doing this for a long time now and I have seen and felt results in my body and my clothes.

Easy routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spot On!","review":"I've always enjoyed this DVD. I always do the entire 30 minutes. It's very easy, but I always feel results the next day.

Really helps tone your trouble spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but gets easy","review":"I love Ellen Barret's videos. This one is good, but really only for a day when I am feeling an easier Pilates work out. I tend to add in some of the advanced versions of the moves from her other videos. On the other hand, when I was first starting to work out, it was the perfect introduction to Pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Results!!!","review":"I do this workout 5 to 6 times per week. The length makes it easy to workout, it's only a 1/2 hour. After 2 weeks,I started noticing changes. After a month, I measured myself. I'm still the same weight, but my weight fluctuates and I didn't change my diet. I lost 1.5 inches off my bust, .5 inch off my arms, 2 inches off my waist and 2 inches off my hips. I didn't lose any off my thighs but I do notice that they are more muscular and I don't have that lump of fat on my inside knees anymore. My legs do look leaner. I'm very pleased with this workout and will keep it up. As some have said, the workout does get too easy after a while so I'm going to do what another reviewer recommended and start using ankle weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a beginner","review":"This video has been a very good introduction to pilates. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this DVD","review":"This is a great workout. I use it all the time with great results. There are modified moves for those who need to take it a little easier.

Ellen is a great instructor, very personable and encouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"This is a great workout for beginners or people who are just starting to get into shape.

This organizational genius established the borders of France, and France as a country, basically as we know it today. His intitiatives resulted in an excellent road system, reliable postal service, representative government, and uniform laws, but his real gift was for intrigue. He used a network of spies not only in the upper echelons of governments, but also among the people themselves. By this method, he incited uprisings in the states of rival lords, funded foreign states in wars against his enemies, assassinated pretenders to the crown and won the hearts of his subjects. All this he accomplished in spite of having physical deformities and epilepsy in an age when that was viewed as demonic. Mr. Schoonover's account is historically accurate, but has enough embellishment to make the inhabitants of the 15th century real to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"spider king","review":"this is another excellent book by lawerence schoonover. i did not want to put the book down after i started it. anyone who enjoys historical novals will really enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spider King","review":"The Spider King is one of those exceptions to the rule. I gave up on it after only 45 pages of about 300. It's a \\"biographical novel\\" of Louis XI but I didn't manage to stick with the book long enough to actually learn anything new about Louis XI.I knew I was in trouble when I reached chapter two. It was nothing more than an incredibly flowery list of Louis's ancestors, visiting as ghosts as the prince is being born. It was a ham fisted way of introducing a character and the concept of the \\"divine right of kings.\\"From there the book went on some sort of long winded tangent involving the war with England, various nobles and a child's birth keep secret from his own mother. It didn't help that the book kept throwing characters into the story without any sort of introduction; a dramatis personae or a family tree would have been useful. So after a week of having managed to read all sorts of other books rather than this \\"biographical novel\\" I decided to set it aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"HDMI and Pioneer Elite AVR's don't mix","review":"I wasn't able to use this player through my Pioneer VSX-74TXVi AVR, would not pass video via HDMI.

I believe a fimware fix might be in order from Toshiba to fix this problem, until then, I'll keep my 1st generation XA1 that works just fine for now.From what I hear this is the best player to date, best SD upconversion thanks to the awesome REON chip inside, and the build quality is fantastic, anodized aluminum sides all the way around.

I just purchased this the week of March 12th 2007 for $640 including the 5 free HD DVD's rebate offer. Just 2 weeks later this unit is available for just under $600 with the same rebate offer (which lasts until the end of July). So, if you don't desire this player ASAP...I would consider holding out another few weeks. It's probably going down in price a bit more.

I mostly bought the Toshiba player for it's up conversion feature and to get any hd movies that I can't from blu ray. The xa2 is regarded as the premier up converting player on the market today, and I would aggree.

It was only capable of outputing 720P. But it was able to output HD DVD\\"S signal at 1080i through the component output. I was sad to discover that sd dvd'd were unable to transmit 1080i through the component output only 480p. I contacted Toshiba about this problem and the tech person had no answers for me.

Also, in order for these to work you really need to change your diet.

I've read all the research, and I'm sure I do dream, but I wake up so often that I don't remember them. The only time I remember dreaming is when I'm using ambien. Ambien works great for me, but it is prescription, and I'd rather use something that's easier to get. 5-HTP is the only OTC that I've ever used that has given me restful enough sleep that I remember dreaming. It doesn't help me get to sleep, but once I do get to sleep, I sleep through until the next morning, which I never do otherwise.

Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.As for this packaging, the pills are a bit large for the mg but it gets the job done for a great price. There was one pill in the bottle that had split open but that's bound to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt Like Gallstones","review":"Initially, this product provided me with very vivid dreams and seemed to help with my social anxiety. But it also made me feel sick every time I took it, just low grade nausea at first that I assumed was due to something else. After the first week of taking 5-HTP, I started to feel like my gallstones were somehow back (despite having my gallbladder removed last year) -- sharp pains in my chest, a powerful urge to vomit, and a difficult time breathing. Needless to say, as soon as I stopped taking the 5-HTP I was suddenly better. I tried taking it again just to be sure, and yes, it was definitely the 5-HTP making me sick. But it seems to work great for everyone else, so perhaps I'm just weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"great nutrient for addiction issues","review":"This is a great product if you're trying to control addiction. 5 htp is the direct precusor to the neurotransmitter seratonin, it makes your body able to produce more.

Even more of a problem, the product description talked about foil shielding to reduce EMI, but when using this cable I get lots of interference from my laptop audio. Other, shorter cables do not have this problem with the laptop. Oddly enough, if I plug in my iPod to this cable I do NOT get the interference, so I can't be 100% sure it's the cable's fault.

I have used (tried) the Viatek Bark Stop Pro and it definitely DOES NOT work. My experience was the same as another reviewer here who noted that the unit only works on the \\"Audible\\" setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the \\"Ultrasonic\\" setting. Furthermore, it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds, banging doors, wind noise, etc.This really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality. I've tried two different units and they both do NOT work.The negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for Labs.","review":"I purchased this product to help curb my dog from barking in the yard...a habit he picked up from a couple kennel visits.

For example, it lists Decubitus Ulcer orders that are dangerous and are no longer practiced. First of all, the term is now referred to as \\"Pressure Ulcer\\" and the use of sheepskins, eggcrate mattresses and heat lamps are contraindicated in the treatment of pressure ulcers. In fact, the AHCPR guidelines (N15) clearly warn against the use of such measures for the treatment of pressure ulcers and the exact opposite is true-to keep the wound moist and not to let it dry out (which will inhibit healing).

I have played it about 3 hours and everything was ok until the buttons stopped working. First the sounds for the buttons being pushed stopped (you couldn't tell if you had unlocked something or not); and then the \\"X\\" button stopped working so you are unable to defend yourself against attacks, even though you are carrying a huge sledge hammer. I tried rebooting the system to see if that would work, that's when other problems showed up.

Immersion is the most important part of a survival horror game for me, and I simply wasn't immersed here. I also didn't like the combat system. The idea that you get 9 swipes with a weapon before it breaks was lame. Some might say \\"well, that adds realism!\\" Sure... a scalpel isn't a real weapon, but we are playing a fictional video game. This game's only real addition to the style of play (they really did keep to the traditional Silent Hill formula otherwise, here) is durability of weapons.

I grew tired of aerobics and step workouts. With this video, there is no need to jump about to get the cardiovascular benefits. As a yoga beginner, I did find the workout VERY challenging, but that is what an exercise video should be, so you never outgrow it. A beautiful sense of calm follows every session, and Mark Blanchard reminds you throughout the video that it is not about competing or completng poses, but it is about challenging yourself every time and reaching a new plateau. I will NEVER go back to aerobics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this vanity video","review":"There are much better Ashtanga videos available. This one is irresponsible and potentially dangerous for the inexperienced yoga practitioner. It strikes me as being more of an ego trip for gymnast/yogi Mark Blanchard than a genuine attempt at offering instruction. He gives very little guidance for getting into or out of poses or modifying them. Blanchard gets in the way of his own students and practically drops one woman when she slips on his sweat... I could almost tolerate his bizarre vocal affectation if he didn't seem to be so self-absorbed and patronizing. For a safer, more realistic \\"Power Yoga\\" workout, try a video from Bryan Kest, Baron Baptiste, or the Yoga Zone."},{"rating":"1","title":"too difficult, poorly organized","review":"Blanchard's voice-over voice is ridiculous and distracting, and his workout is for the most advanced students. His on-screen students couldn't do the poses at all, which certainly didn't do much for my confidence in this tape. There are so many others that are so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not just the voice.","review":"I did not like this video at all.I have taken yoga for a long time with lots of different teachers and styles.And yes the rasping voice is unbearable and it's just trying to cover for the absence of any quality instruction in the poses.If you like Bryan Kest's tapes, this is more of the same.Where Bryan Kest gets by on his good looks Mark Blanchard gets by on his prodigious yogic abilities.Still that does not mean that he has anything to teach.And if you think that by simply watching someone do a handstand and bring his feet to touch the top of his head, you will learn how to get there, you might be disappointed.It is true however: You will sweat and you will lose weight.This tape truly has it's place next to your complete Tae Bo Video set."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had better Experiences..","review":"Mark Blanchard is incredibly flexible and strong, and watching him do some positions can be motivating. His voice, however, is not. I can tune out irritations and get past most things, but I found I couldn't get past his voice and emotion. Yoga is a sport best taught in a moderate, soothing, even-toned voice to not interrupt your concentration and meditation. I wished that I could turn off the sound and just follow the tape, but then I wouldn't have had a flowing workout. I have concerns with the opening warm up as it is too strenuous for the average person's lower back and as a devotee to health and fitness, is not a move I would recommend. The repetition of it is likely to strain people's backs and cause injury. Once you get past that, the rest of the tape is a good workout and when you get to the Sun Salute flow, you will be tested and your muscles will scream. I would recommend looking for tapes with Rodney Yee or by Yoga Zone before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out - changed body image and feel terrific!","review":"I am over 55. managed only 35 minutes first attempt then just continued as I could.

I thought his knowledge and breadth of the material presented was excellent. However, I agree with many of the other reviews posted that this guy has serious narcissistic ego issues. He uses a lot of negative prompts with the class members (words like \\"don't,\\" \\"stop,\\" and \\"no\\") and his tone of voice sounds like an angry Darth Varder disciplining or getting after the class for not being as picture perfect as him. Yoga is supposed to be an egoless place stemming from compassion for yourself and others. He reminded me a lot of the Harry Potter Book 2 character Gilderoy Lockhart.

Mark Blanchard does too much of the workout to be instructive, which I think can be dangerous and half the students in the class don't know what they're doing so you can't learn from them either. And in the beginning of the video Mark talks like a normal person then during the class he switched to this horrible raspy voice that he probably thinks is sexy -- Well it's not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, unpleasant, unappealing, jarring to senses","review":"I was disappointed by this video. In fact, I turned off the sound just to get through it. Mr. Blanchard's raspy, too-casual \\" Okay, guys....\\" voice was unpleasant, jarring and intrusive. The \\"warm-up\\" exercises were anything but, and could easily injure someone unaccustomed to using their back this way. Mr. Blanchard is impressive in his strength and flexibility.

Occasionally we hit the jackpot and get good toast but we've no idea what alignment of the stars makes this happen.We bought this because our older model of this toaster worked well until it died; but something must have changed in the design or the particular one we received was defective.

The settings go to 6, but anything more than 2.2 is a guaranteed burn. There is a range of about 2-2.2 where you might get a certain browning, but it'll only be on 1/2 of the toast/bagel. Of the approx. 9\\" of length, only about 3\\" are hot, and usually scorchingly so. My wife has figured out that bagels come out decently on one side when placed ON the toaster, at a 4 setting.

I often forget to push the button and am left with bread 1/2 toasted.The supposed 4 slices of toast option absolutely does not work with bread any wider than general white bread.

(And more ...)","review":"Maybe experienced database developers and administrators might find this book useful, however, in my opinion, for someone looking for an introduction to the SQL world, this is one confusing collection of printed pages with all beginning pages referencing the final ones, and vice-versa. The author does not hide his dissatisfaction with the official standard and claims that the confused nature of the book simply reflects the inconsistencies and unsettled issues in the standard itself. Well, in that case, with all due respect to standard-setter and author - I am beginning to wonder why talk about a standard at all !"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but dated....only covers sql92","review":"This book contains both formal syntax and good examples, and is reasonably concise. It is comparable to Melton's book \\"Understanding the New SQL\\", though the graphics are better in Melton's book. It was published in 1996, so does not cover more recent standards. It covers SQL92, which was the major revision, but there have been three smaller revisions since then. Thus it does not cover SQL analytical functions, triggers and a few other things that have come into popular use.It is strictly about the standard and does not refer to products. If you are using a particular DBMS, you might prefer a product specific book since there are so many extensions to and variants from the standard in actual database products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best reference","review":"I have found this to be without question the best SQL reference book available.In comparison, the actual standards document is so poorly written as to bewell nigh incomprehensible, assuming you can find a draft of it on the internet-- otherwise it will cost you a fortune to buy. The implication is that wheneverI want to get a comprehensive and intelligible account of the syntax and semanticsof SQL, I turn with confidence to this Date and Darwen book. My only regret is thatthis book is so old that it does not address the many new SQL features introducedsince its first printing. This book is for those who want to know the rules, the details,the rationale behind SQL; I can see that its depth, organization, and sophisticationwould not make it particularly suited for those just starting out (who would probablybe better off with their vendor's documentation for starters).

I cheered the great Shackleton and his crew, but was concerned about their faithful dogs (I'm not a PETA freak, I just like good dogs). I know there are other, longer and more detailed versions of Shackleton's trip. I'm happy to have seen this version.

Nope. Now, having said that, I'm not a scarecrow by any means--I typically wear XL or XXL T-shirts. Right now I'm wearing a Reebok 2X NY Giants T-shirt that's about 4 inches longer than this 3X Russell t-shirt and I've found this to be true of every Russell shirt I've ever purchased. I don't know what they use as a template, but all I can figure is that they use dwarves. Check out the model in the picture. The shirt is hanging below his crotch--when I wear it I look like Comic Book guy from the Simpsons. I wear 40 X 30 jeans, so it's not like I'm Fat Albert--I'd just like Russell to add a couple of inches to all their athletic shirts. Their sweatshirts have the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeve run a little short","review":"comfortable long sleeve shirt.

This compilation offers some of those tracks, along with remixed and/or tampered versions.Not bad, but not quite as good as what it could have been. The remixing, as was done on some other previous compilations, makes this collection a tainted effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to follow the information in book","review":"This book was very difficult to follow.The author jumps around throughout book.Usally the author calls Tories \\"Loyalists\\" and Minutemen \\"Provincials\\" But I found places in the book where the terminology is inconsistant. Around page 100 he calls the Loyalist Militia \\"Provincials\\" VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners!","review":"This dvd is the same as the one under the title, \\"Exotic dancing for Everyday Women.\\" I love this tape as it teaches you some of the beginning moves in erotic dance. It also gives info on basic lap moves and other info about self-esteem, body love and how to create a romantic environment. There's a lot of really good info here for women who are new to erotic dancing.I hope more dvds from Susan will be forthcoming as she really is an excellent teacher and I think many students will appreciate her direct instructional approach to teaching this dance form.If you have dance experience, this dvd will not be of much help to you. For experienced dancers, I'd suggest buying \\"The Art of Erotic Dancing,\\" dvds by Fawnia or other performance related dvds on stripping. Keep in mind that with the performance dvds, you will need to have the ability to learn or pick up on moves through an observational approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"For me it was big disappointment, I could hardly get anything from this DVD. The moves were too basic, dance routines were not interesting either. Also, I would say that it shows more a classical way of doing striptease, while being a young woman I prefer something more modern & energeting (in this sense I really liked Exotic dance series). I still think this DVD can be useful for women with no or limited dance experience, or for those who do not feel confident about their bodies - self-acceptance is quite a part of this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum...","review":"I was very disappointed.

I should have had a clue when there were a *lot* of them on a clearance shelf at half off. I got the heater home and out of the box. It worked at first but then quit working the minute I turned it off and then back on again. (I moved it from one outlet to another in the same room). From the other reviews I've read about it, this is a common occurrence. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews until AFTER I went all the way back to the store to exchange it for the same thing. Now, I have the second one and it quit working after I turned it off for a little while. It actually works quite well when it starts up, which is why I turned it off after a while.

This Temperature Control unit has a thermostat in it, which will activate the heater once the room drops below a certain temperature. The heater also has a built in safety feature that shuts off the heater if it exceeds a certain temperature. The problem seems to be that this temperature limit is under the devices normal operating temperature, so as a result it will shut off automatically after about a minute of running, regardless of the room temperature. After this it will not reactivate unless you reset it by unplugging the device and letting it cool for about 10 minutes, then plugging it back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's just no heat.

And she insisted on attaching herself to him even though she had a child. She was totally selfish and didn't even think of how this would effect her little girl. And the fact that she thinks he loves her is just way to funny. Especially after he sent her away from him.Aside from all that, she repeats everything she says at least 5 times.

Not only were the puzzles so obscure, but it was impossible to determine a sequence of events with which to proceed. I found myself going to the internet for hint after hint. Another detriment to the game was the endless transporting from one area to another. To solve a puzzle, you would have to go through three or four transports only to be forced to go to another area involving a lot of movement.

I think the disk was messed up, I got it second hand from someone who didn't take care of them. Anyway! This game has adventure, and puzzles that WILL baffle the mind, and a good story line. Only thing I wish is it had a better kind of fast forward for some of the talking scenes. But, I can't complain any more.

It makes it almost impossible to figure out how to get to a specific spot. This means that the hint \\"you have to go to the basement\\" is useless.On top of that, the animation is pathetic.

Her arms are way too short. And she's not the only one. With backgrounds so wonderful, why are all the characters so wooden? They don't move smoothly and look like they are gliding across the floor instead of running. The wolf, your companion, looks more like he is covered in skin than hair.And the voice acting is terrible.

When they arrived I tried them on and they fit perfectly. In the water they do stretch.- \\"Hard to take out the insole\\": To this I don't see why other people said its difficult to remove the insoles. I used them the first day to swim and when I got out of the pool I was able to remove them easily. When they dry up, they are easy to insert again.- \\"Are they comfortable?\\": Yes they are! I love these swim shoes for my class and even classmates now want to buy some. In the water they feel very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look good, work well","review":"These water shoes look snazzy in two shades of blue, and are very comfortable and quite durable. There are two things to watch out for however:1. Like most water shoes they tend to run big, so if you are a half size you may want to order the next size down.2. Like all water shoes and rubber boots, the insoles are not glued into place. I always take mine to the shoe repair shop and get the insoles glued into place before I start wearing them, otherwise the insole curls up and folds up inside the shoe after a few wearings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable.","review":"I purchased these shoes for a two-week Hawaiian vacation. I was scared of stepping on sharp rocks or jellyfish while on the beach. They worked well on the beach! However, these shoes have since been permanently borrowed by my husband, who wears the same size shoe as me. He has worn them for anything from hiking to fishing to running to the store. I think he likes that they're breathable, versatile, and you're able to get them wet without consequences. You will slide a bit when they're wet, but I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a half size down - I usually wear 9 and 1/2 and I ordered a 9, which fit well. For the price, its a quality water shoe, but to be fair its also the first pair I ever owned! I don't think you'll go wrong if you're looking for an inexpensive water shoe for occasional use and order this pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice swim shoe","review":"this shoe came well packaged and is true to size, i usually go a half sizesmaller than my shoe and it is a good fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stood up to the Galapagos","review":"Bought them for wet landings in the Galapagos Island.

The inside sole of these shoes move all about and do not stay in place, so I have had to remove them. Instead, I have my own insoles for support, another thing this shoe did not have. I do hope the exterior of this shoe holds up. I expected so much more from a speedo product.Don't waster your money or time on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shoes","review":"These were a good pick for water shoes. Even though this is the only water shoe purchase I've made since I was five. Theyre comfortable and fit good.

They only come in full sizes. I wear a 7-1/2 shoe, so I bought an 8. I think it is a bit big, but didn't exchange them for a 7 because I was afraid that a 7 would be too small.

Got a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"super great A++","review":"This shoe is so great for negotiating rocky, slippery, surfy beaches. You must however buy at least a size down from what you'd normally wear. I wear a 9.5 and ordered the size 8 and got a perfect snug fit. The size 9 fit very comfortably but they would have come off in the water. The berry color is gorgeous and really compliments the blue water and even the sky - fun to look at while swimming on your back! I have no complaints about this shoe- it dries quickly and is really grippy on slick rocks when I'm making my way into the water for a swim. They do create a little more drag than I'd like when I'm swimming but that's nothing compared to how easy they make getting into the water. I gave mine to my mom and I'm ordering another pair for myself. My husband also has a pair and he loves them too. These shoes make getting into the water on the most rocky beach in strong surf a piece of cake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dunn's River Falls Test","review":"I purchased these shoes for a recent cruise trip that included an excursion to Dunn's River Falls. The shoes are very comfortable. I had no problem maintaining a firm grip during our climb up Dunn's River Falls. The only problem I had was some slight slippage of the shoe liner. I additionally wore these shoes to the beach in Grand Cayman and found them to be quiet comfortable and slip free. I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking to do the Dunn's River Falls trip. Note that I have only worn these twice so I cannot comment on how well they hold up over time yet. Essentially, these shoes more than met the task I had purchased them for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused blisters on the sides of my feet","review":"These felt comfortable the first time I wore them.

I have not been able to find a manufacturer that makes a good solid or one piece sole design for this purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large (length wise) fit ....not standard shoe sizing","review":"Love everthing about this water shoe except the sizing. I normally take a size 8, but in this water shoe I am a 7.I gave the pair I ordered to my mother-in who takes a size 9 & the speedo size 8 fit her perfectly.I did re-buy a pair for myself 1 size smaller than my normal shoe size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"These water shoes are fantastic. I needed to replace an old pair that apparently have shrink over time so that they are very uncomfortable. I searched long and hard hoping to find a different pair that would be much more flexible and comfortable. These are it! I purchased 1/2 size smaller than my usual as suggested in other reviews and they fit perfect. They are not too tight, but do hug my foot and stay on when wet. I will probably buy my husband a pair, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look great; not well constructed","review":"I absolutely love how these look (I got the light blue ones), and they fit really well. I'd be delighted with them except that, having only worn them twice, the footpad in one has already come loose and bunches up in odd places under my foot. It's pretty annoying. I spend a lot of time trying to tug the pad back into place, but that only works for a min or so. I'm thinking of trying to reglue it, but I'd have to figure out what type of glue to use.Such a shame because I really like these shoes otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely made, Feel good","review":"I wear this type of shoe on a fishing boat, as I've found it's better traction than sandals (and the tops of your feet won't burn). These fit nicely; I've worn them around the house and the traction is good. I wear an 8.5-9 wide in regular shoes, and these size 8 shoes fit perfectly. The purple soles are a terrific upgrade from gum eraser brown!

When I first saw this movie, 20 years ago, I thought it was great. It focused not only on the training and the sacrifices we go through to achieve our goals, but on how it affects other aspects of our lives. It takes a toll on the close relationships we have. It's hard for the ones we love to understand the sacrifices we make for that elusive mistress, the marathon. This movie in its original form explored those issues. What they have now is closer to a documentary, than trying to get to the Soul of running. Why did they have to screw up a good movie. Besides, Pam Grier is beautiful in the original version.

And again, the musical score is sparse: Some may like the stark quality that suggests, but for my tastes a little Hollywood-ization -- a little, not a lot -- would have added to the production.Please do not hear this as a bad review of this great performance, to which others have accurately paid tribute. But this is not a big-budget production and it looks and sounds like a 1970s foreign film . . . which is exactly what it is.And like others, I use it in the classroom to introduce Greek tragedy, but I caution the students not to expect \\"Troy\\" or \\"300.\\" Most of them can deal with the fact that there isn't a car chase or gunfight at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary in every way","review":"I saw this movie when it was first released and I will never forget it.

Darius is really a minor character in this book which is surprising. The sexual references are getting really old by now. Anthony's description of fractals is hard to follow, and I was a math major!

Stanley and Attenborough give excellent performances.The only problem is that I had to turn the audio all the way up to 70 sometimes, practically the maximum, and still could not make out everything that they were saying, especially during the key scene towards the end when Myra gives a seance with police officers at the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless as a DVD presentation","review":"A thump on the head to Home Vision Entertainment: this expensive DVD has NO special features whatsoever - namely subtitle options, or any of the perks that normally come with DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, You Gotta Rent This !","review":"I came across with this movie all by chance and it certainly became one of my all-time favorites. Beyond everything else this movie is SOOOO well-done. It truly satisfies in every aspect. The economy that the director used in telling this story i think is just perfect.It's sad, it's haunting, it's gripping, thick with magnificent ambient dread and it features 2 mind-blowing performances by the leads. It's really hard to decide which actor is better but i'd say you HAVE TO SEE Kim Stanley's superb work to believe it! I was blown away!If you like off-beat, eerie movies with solid stories and tour de force acting you surely will love this one!

It is useful reading for one seeking to understand how liberal contemporary theologians seeks to frame religious and church history so as to accomplish transformation more in line with the new ethic rather than the praxis that is more in line with a trust of the literal Scripture. In no way should this book be considered an objective or empirical exposition of the history of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod nor a faithful exposition of what the Scripture says in its own objective voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her true motivation for negative portrayal of her church?","review":"The question that stands out when reading this book is why the author stays in the Missouri Synod while she exposes every negative historical detail she can dig up. Many Lutheran churches have female pastors, so why doesn't she join them? She obviously does not share conservative values with the Missouri Synod. Why would ANYONE stay in a church whose values are not agreeable with his own?

No matter what people may say about the failures of Christians and various Churches, Jesus is the most compelling person I have ever encountered.

It's such a cute film and the girls even though they're complete opposites, share this innocence. A wonderful friendship of love, and non-conformity. The soundtrack was great, the girls were funny, and it was just a feel good movie. Nicole Arie Parker is just beautiful! Laurel Holloman nailed her role as portraying a tom-boy. I haven't seen another film similar to this one that I actually enjoy.

The quality of the film-making was aweful, the acting ridiculously bad, and the script read like a cross between a psychotherapists analysis and one of those pulp romance novels about angsty teenagers. Yes, it is a low budget film, and yes, it had political importance in 'the scene', but as a stand-alone movie free of context and background, I would never recommend it. It gets some credit toward the end for showing some self-awareness of how silly and dramatic the whole thing was. There were some cute moments, and it was interesting to see the humble roots of one of the big L word ladies, but don't go into this movie expecting a highly polished end product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally dissappointing","review":"I bought this during my mammoth search to find more than one lesbian film that to enjoy watching and this was definitely not it. How anyone can call it the best lesbian film they've seen is beyond me. Try Better than Chocolate, But I'm a cheerleader, Lost and Delerious or Porquoi Pas Moi if you want a good film. Anyway it's supposed to be a coming of age story, first lesbian love etc but I found it simply unwatchable. I didn't relate to the characters at all, the low budget quality was awful and there was no good storyline to make it worth getting over that point. If you want a really good coming out/coming of age film watch Show Me Love (sweedish with subtitles) it's excellent and you really feel for the characters unlike you ever could with this.

As director and screenwriter, Maria Maggenti was equally maladroit in both roles: her composition is abysmally clumsy, her every scenario cherry-picked from better dramas and rendered terminally dull by the stilted, contrived dialogue and timbered acting at her command. Worst of all, Terry Dame's amateurish score is impossibly irritating, often resembling circus music performed with jazz instrumentation.Of the billion-odd pictures to portray teens struggling with adversity in response to their homosexuality, this isn't the worst, but it's assuredly the most tedious: too gauche to enjoy, too bland to riff."},{"rating":"1","title":"On my list for worst movie (not just lesbian movie) ever","review":"The story is ridiculous, the acting is BEYOND terrible (especially from Laurel Holloman), and the stereotypes are so over the top and pronounced its not even laughable. Did a filmmaker that's never met a lesbian in his/her whole life make this film? Lesbian movies are usually bad, but this bad should be a crime :(."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd division of the spoils","review":"This film is a not atypical Naschy exercise in Euro-horror. As such you may feel you have seen it all before (which may also make you happy).

The graphics were pretty cool but the diaglouge was a joke. The puzzles and story line were OK- very solvable, until the end. As I was entering the final stage of the game, a very important \\"hot spot\\" was missing from my CD. I tried customer support and they told me that they don't give solutions and tried to sell me a solution guide.

It was so tedious that I couldn't fight my way to the end. The dialogue was absolute pants and moved at a halting, tedious speed to match up exactly with the subtitles so that- there awkward- pauses between- phrases like that kid on Malcolm in the Middle. The main character looked like he was limping when he walked, which might explain why in the heck he walks so SLOW between locations. Frequent black screens lasting several seconds between locations and insulting outfits on the women in the game complete the idiocy.

I play these type of games all the time, and I've never had such a bad time with a game.The dialogue was horrible. It was corny. There were times the words came up, but there weren't any voices. The clues didn't even give you any idea what to do next, or where to go.The graphics were something you'd see on the old nintendo, I didn't like how slow the characters walked, and how by clicking twice they wouldn't speed up like in other games I played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game Ever","review":"I bought this brand new for $20 and am throwing it away. I don't want to give it away or sell it to prevent someone else from having to sit through the torture.

Nevertheless it served the purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge price for a 100-page loose-leaf book of little use...","review":"The book is full of advertisements of the author's company. At least one third consists of things like addresses of Canadian embassies, occupation list etc (which is free on Canadian government's website). Almost all of the information and suggestions in the book can be found (free!) on various immigration-related internet sites. What's more, the scripts on the sample forms and tables at the end of the book are so small that it is almost impossible to recognise and read. The printing quility is REALLY POOR and the pages are simply put into a spring binder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Printer","review":"This is a very good LED printer. We had it at work for 2 years now and it hardly had any problems. The only problem we had was that the component failed and it couldn't print for a while. Oki did send us a replacement in two days. We print averagely 5,000 pages a month, so it only failed once, which is already a very good record to us.Overall, we are very happy with the printer because it prints excellent quality black and white copies. The color prints are also very nice. We especially like the \\"glossy\\" finish this printer has. It makes everything we print looks very visually pleased and expensive.We purchased this printer from Staples and used to buy the supplies from Office Depot. Amazon sometimes have the drums and toners in stock, so we also buy the supplies from Amazon to save some costs. The average cost for printing per page is considerably lower than a lot of laser printers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this printer!","review":"I recently bought the Okidata C5500 to replace the dying $300 color laser printer I had. I was happy with the old one, but came across the Oki for a price that couldn't be beat (less than $250 at a closeout sale) and decided to go with it. I am so happy I did. The price for the consumables is very similar to what I had been paying for the cheaper printer, so the cost to operate it is much the same, but the quality is way better!I use the printer to print our weekly bulletins at church and also the color brochures for our small business. The color is bright and crisp, text is clear and easy to read.Would I buy it again? In a heartbeat! Would I blink at paying the full retail price for it? No, not since I've seen it in action and put it through it's paces myself. It is well worth the price difference between it and the one I had previously.

Two months out of the one year warranty the new printer quit working and OkiData will not fix it.Yes, it's a one year warranty but two months out and it's broken beyond repair? Toner drums are \\"old\\" and not working properly according to the local OkiData repair guy. Build a quality product OkiData, not one that is designed to fail as soon as you are no longer liable. Did you get the GM business plan?I will never buy another OkiData Product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor driver support and cardstock issues","review":"From a print quality perspective, this printer does a great job.This printer was purchased partially because of its ability to print on card stock. However, we have never been able to print on card stock without constant jams and malfunctions. I think it's safe to say that we've never actually printed on card stock, period.The driver support for OS X is poor. OKI presents consistent excuses about how Apple is changing their driver requirements, but that didn't stop their competition from providing usable drivers. Since OS X 10.6, there have been timing issues on driver delivery and there's currently no support for 10.7 or 10.8 without using a workaround of another printer's drivers entirely. When it boils down to it, OKI just isn't prepared to release new drivers for its legacy printers.We would not buy this printer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minty and delicious","review":"I just got this stuff today.

This leaves *nine* actual tracks with JLH. Hmmmm...Of those nine tracks, we get some mostly uninspired performances by John Lee Hooker, and he doesn't really hit passing-gear until the tail-end of this short gig. Despite the aforementioned caveats, the confirmed JLH fan *might* want to add this less-than-stellar performance to their collection, just because it's John Lee Hooker.

This CD was a very refreshing look at the genre with heaps of well crafted catchy tunes and a wonderful diversity of cultural influences. Music made by real people rather than by electronic boxes.

Americans prior to Wilson felt espionage was only something the Europeans engaged in, and America was beyond that. America had not learned about the necessity of secret intelligence.

It is tricky because you can have three levers fit and not the fourth. The trick is to Not tighten the screws so you can move the spring board up and down to get all four to fit. Then tightening the screws makes them all fit into place just right. Maybe it is tricky to ensure that we put it in level, and also it is very solid.

I had no idea how closely my own values and perceptions matched Taoist ones until finding this book. It is available in paperback. I will use the book until it starts to fall apart, then buy another.

Let's consider the evidence:1)Ni proclaims himself a \\"Master\\" and touts his spiritual pedigree and credentials in many of his books.2)He publishes many many books on Tao. He has much to say. He has many many \\"insights\\" to share. He rambles.3) He places his own grinning visage on the cover of the book.Now go read the Tao Teh Ching. Done yet?

It makes you have to think entirely too much so you won't get your heart rate up enough to maintain it for 30 minutes. The instruction part is too complicated also. She really doesn't teach you step by step. It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, but she doesn't give you heads up on where she is going. You'll get lost after one, two.Try Jin Miller's Simply Step. It'll keep your heart rate up with basic stepping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated with lots of twists and turns","review":"I do not like overcomplicated stepping routines with lots of twisting and turning, and this was such a video. I tried it twice, and had to concentrate so hard on not tripping and falling, that I got a poor workout. I don't mind having to take 2-10 times to really learn a routine and follow it well, but this one discouraged me, making me think it would take forever to get, and I might eventually hurt myself in the process.

If I had known she was going to be dancing all over the place, and throw in some step, I would not have bought it.

She goes straight through the combos which twirl around, over, up, stretch, kick, knee up without slowing down or breaking the steps down. There is no way I can \\"master each move to perfection\\" as advertised. This DVD is a joke! And the \\"Invisible Warm Up\\" ha!

She was just trying to make this whole scenario \\"cool,\\" and it just wasn't.As far as the actually moves are concerned, I am a dancer and I could not catch on to all the moves the first time through. I usually do. They recommend clicking on the option where she goes through each move slowly before trying the work out. But that is just a waste of time to me. When I am ready to work out, I am ready to work out. I don't want to take the time to go through the instructional part. Then if I haven't done the DVD for a while I'll have to go through the instructional part again before actually doing the work out.

You can read many reviews of the plot below, so I'm not going to repeat it. What I want to bring up is the poor editing job that was done to this edition.I was extremely distracted by all of the errors. There were typos throughout, mainly with the letter I. Instead of only one I, there would be two, which looked like this--II. There were also punctuation issues. Quotes weren't ended or they were ended wrong (before the actual sentence ended). This was the first time I've come across something like this in a Kindle book and it was disappointing.I should mention this was a freebie for Kindle when I purchased it. Maybe the print edition isn't plagued with these errors. I certainly hope not. I believe I counted 21 mistakes.

Starting over at a new school and living with her kindly grandmother, Sabine struggles for a sense of normalcy.

An intriguing story with characters that I wanted to spend some more time with, so I rushed out to grab the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"All families represented","review":"My 2-year-old son loves this book. I got it because it has a rich representation of all types of families (rarely found in children's books, even today): parents with (adopted) children of another race (this is our family situation), biracial couples, mothers breastfeeding a baby, fathers bottle-feeding a baby, lesbian and gay parents, single parents.All this is shown not in a politically correct or preachy way, but just as a casual, panoramic view of...well, babies everywhere!Each full 2-page spread shows many babies of all races and sizes, some smiling, some screaming, some sleeping. The paintings are amusing, realistic, fun, and the babies are sweet. My son will point out certain babies, and loves the baby at the end who is so clean on one page, and, having eaten her birthday cake, so dirty on the next.This book is appropriate for all toddlers, and an especially good choice for those with family members of different races or lifestyles."},{"rating":"2","title":"They'll want you to read it again and again!","review":"We got this book at the library and my 2 year old daughter could not get enough of it. Every day for the 3 weeks we had it she would bring it to me and say \\"read mama read!\\". It has adorable illustrations of all sorts of babies doing all different things, eating, being dressed, laughing, etc. The pictures are so very cute and the babies come in all shapes, sizes and colors which is great to see such diversity. The words are simple with each page being \\"Everywhere, everyday babies are...\\" and it goes on to describe them doing various things. My daughter loved this one so much I just bought her a copy for herself here and I know it will be a hit at Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"Both my children have loved this book ever since they were infants. They seem to really relate to the pictures, activities in the pictures and the contents of the words. The illustrations are too cute, so much so that I've purchased other books by this illustrator as well. Oh, and I make sure this book is a gift to any newborn I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Gift Ever","review":"When my daughter was born, a friend sent this book as a gift. It has delighted her since she was five weeks old. Now that she's four months, the book is part of her daily life. She smiles, points, coos -- it can even calm her down when she's being fussy. She especially loves the drawing on the \\"Babies are Crawling\\" page. My own initial delight in the book -- the wonderful rhyme, the charming drawings -- was elevated when I looked closely and noticed that all different kinds of families are represented. What could be happier than envisioning a world of acceptance, diversity, and inclusion. I'm so thankful to the author and illustrator for creating this fun and meaningful book, which will definitely be my standard new baby gift. My only request: put out a board book edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that doesn't get old :)","review":"My daughter has loved this book since she was a year old, now she's almost 2 and it's still one of her favorites. My 4 year old nephew loves it as well! Adorable, intricate drawings (my daughter keeps finding new things in the pictures she didn't notice before) and catchy text. We come back to this one again and again.As for the \\"homosexual agenda\\" some people claim is being pushed on infants - it depends on how you view these pictures. I see the two women putting the baby to sleep as just that - there's nothing to suggest they're anything but friends helping out, unless you want to view it as a lesbian couple. The other picture I'm assuming people are discussing here shows a man walking down the street with his arm over another man's shoulders. I've seen men doing this at church, in (straight) bars, etc. I've seen grown men do this with thier sons. If you see something wrong in this, it's YOU that have the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"My 18 month old and I got this book out of the library a few weeks ago and now I have to buy our own copy. We read it at least twice a day and the end always makes me teary-eyed. The illustrations are amazing - tired parents, messy babies, tantrums, the good and the bad. I love that it shows a diversity of people and families and lifestyles -- just like in real life. Chhers to the illustrator - I'll have to look for more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every day, Everywhere, Babies Are Loved","review":"For some reason, toddlers go through a phase where babies are very interesting. This book in particular is one of my favorites on the subject. Little ones will recognize themselves, their siblings, cousins and friends among the pages of these babies of all different shapes, sizes and colors. Perfect for new siblings or anyone interested in babies, this is a beautifully illustrated, nicely written picture book that will have your little one asking for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best for open minded families","review":"This is simply the best book for parents who want to raise children free of bias and prejudice. With laughter and an open heart it covers the process of growing into a toddler, while including families of all races and make ups. As part of a two mom household, I found this to be one of the best books on the market not only for my family, but also for friends who wanted to introduce their children to families like mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love this book","review":"A friend gave this book to my daughter when she was one, and it quickly became her favorite. To read it is a pleasure -- it has a real sing-song rhythm -- and the illustrations are wonderful. There is a lot of detail, so we used this book to learn colors, patterns, seasons, vehicles, you name it. And for kids, nothing could be better than to see babies doing all sorts of things, ending with a first birthday party."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for my conservative family","review":"The pictures are cute, the text is sweet, but the book pictures several same-sex couples, which I don't think is appropriate for such young children, at least not for mine. There needs to be some note to the book that informs that the book has pictures of the alternative families."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know, most people like this","review":"but neither I nor my daughter (8mo) found it compelling.

The illustrations are beautiful and accurately capture life with baby, and the text has a fabulous cadence to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two-year-old loves this book!","review":"The reviewer before me had the same experience as us. I picked this book up at our library. I read this book at least four times a day to my two-year-old daughter. My four-year-old son likes it too. I had no choice but to buy it. I've never seen a book so instantly loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"My 2 year old LOVES this book, and I love it too. Everywhere Babies is our favorite!I like it because the illustrations are fantastic and very artfully rendered. The scenes are very true to life. The parents all look totally exhausted and half awake--which is accurate, because that's how my wife and I felt back when our baby was little. Whenever possible the mommies and daddies are shown with coffee or tea. The attention to detail is phenomenal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book honors and celebrates families","review":"As the director of a child care program that strives to serve all families in a culturally sensitive way, I am always on the lookout for books that depict diversity with respect. This book portrays many different kinds of families in a very natural and loving way without being overly didactic. Its realistic reflection of our society develops in children (and adults) the tools of tolerance and compassion that are so needed in the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite book","review":"I bought this book for my baby boy when he was about 10 months old. He is now 16 months old and this is our favorite book. We read it many times a day, as he is always bringing it to me. Luckily, it's a book that parents don't easily tire of -- it has simple, singsong text and lots of pictures to talk about. The illustrations are perfect for an emerging talker, as I ask my baby to point to various objects he is familiar with. He loves to find the balls and the dogs.The book really caught my attention because it depicts all kinds of families, and being an alternative family, this was important to me. I point out to my children (I also have a 4-year-old) the different kinds of parents in this book, and the different races. I also love how the book shows lots of animals. It's a very life affirming, all-embracing story and it is our favorite book in a vast & ponderous library of children's books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everywhere Homosexuals","review":"It's gross that people are trying to introduce this sexual lifestyle to children at such a young age. There should be a warning on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda-driven!","review":"On the surface, this book is charming--the illustrations are masterful and the simply rhyme is captivating and heartwarming. However, there are at least four depictions of same-sex couples. Only three of these couples are pictured with babies. So, the 'families-are-diverse and we need to reflect that' argument doesn't even work here. These pictures are not even subtle. We're not talking two men walking together--there are two men with their arms around each other. And two women lying on a bed while one rocks a cradle. As the illustrator herself notes on her website, 'Children read pictures. They really do.' I don't wish eternal damnation on the authors as another reviewer (on Barnes and Noble's website)suggested (although I think that review is a publicity stunt). I simply want them to keep their agenda to themselves and not try to force it on my preschoolers(the target audience, by the way)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so innocent","review":"I agree with the prior reviewer. Althougth subtle and easily overlooked, the homosexual undertones of the few sketches surprised and disappointed me. Although this may be \\"politically correct\\" it is NOT biblically correct and not something I would want my children to think is OK. If you are trying to instill Christian values in your children, be very discerning as to what they are exposed. The things we may overlook...our children may not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out!","review":"This seemingly innocent book about the beautiful things that babies do and what a joy they are to be around includes lesbian and gay parents in its illustrations. My daughter LOVES babies, so I thought this would be great! In fact, the words of the text are fabulously cute rhymes, BUT I do not need her to be exposed to these alternative \\"families\\" at such a young age. Thus, I do not recommend this book for anyone wanting to celebrate the innocence of babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually inclusive, multicultural vision re babies & families - WE LOVE IT!","review":"This book features parents and babies in all truthfulness: all ethnic backgrounds, all classes, old parents, young parents, lesbian parents, gay male parents, single moms, nurturing dads, biological parents, adoptive parents, grandparents, etc. No one is left out, and for that, it's an unusual rare book.The scenes are not idealized, but extremely messy, spills and gear everywhere, just like real life, but in an endearing way. Also, it's bizarre how our two year old loves to look at these pictures and proclaim \\"babies,\\" as though she herself is not a baby.We highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best for new babies","review":"I discovered this book when a friend of mine had a new baby.

But makes a lot of since. It means a lot of reserch and planning but is extremely exciting. You will discover amazing stuff if you take this onboard. Easy to read and common sence.Very much recommended to today's business owners who want to be in business in 10, 20, 30... years time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Complete Retelling of the Robin Hood Tales","review":"The Adventures of Robin Hood by Roger Lancelyn Green is a brilliant retelling of the Robin Hood tales. All of the stories are here. Robin's fight with Little John is related, as is the archery contest, Robin's love affair with Marion, and the wedding of Allan-a-Dale. All of the characters like Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet, Little John, Maid Marion, and (guess what!) Robin Hood make their appearances. Overall, the tales are well told, and the book is very complete. My favorite portion of this edition is the prologue in which the author writes from where the stories are derived. There, I was turned to Thomas Love Peacock's brilliant, if forgotten, tales of Robin Hood entitled Maid Marian. This edition will help to keep the adventures of Robin Hood in the minds of children for another generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stealing from the best...","review":"It's in keeping with the book's hero that Roger Lancelyn Green is a bit of a thief. He plunders ballads, plays, novels and poems for this Robin Hood novel.Thankfully, he steals from the best sources.This kid's book is a pleasant, briskly-written version of the legend incorporating details from an astonishing variety of sources.I'm also glad to see Marian get a large role in this book. She doesn't appear in the Howard Pyle novel at all.You could do a lot worse than let this book be someone's first introduction to the legend of Robin Hood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!!","review":"This is a truly wonderful book. Green makes everything seem so real, I actually cried in the end, and in a few parts I laughed out loud and ran to tell my sister about it. When I was reaching the end half of me almost made me put the book down and do something else so it would last longer, but the other half wouldn't let me, because the book was so exiting and I had to find out what happens next! Scince I own this book I know I am going to read it again and again!This is a really great book about Robin Hood!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh!","review":"Okay, this book totally, completely, utterly sucked. The only good thing is that at least most of the stories are here, derived from many different ballads and such. That shows that research has been done. Otherwise, yuck.

It has lots of action and I liked how Robin kept being able to to trick his enemies and he was amazing with a bow and arrow. It was brilliant to read and it was very descriptive, though I would recommend it for ages 10+ because some of the language might be harder for younger readers to understandElena age 11"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book to collect","review":"This is a beautiful book to collet, as their are other colorful cover designs in the classic series.

The humor throughout the book was for both children and adults. The follies of how Robin met his merry men were quite fun. The author did a marvelous job of integrating former works and old English references.

Raw, uninhibited humor at it's best! R. Crumb knows how to take one story line, and play off of it time and time again. There are subtlties that make the movie understandable and enthusiastic. Once you realize, Fritz is day-dreaming on 9 lives, these lives are how he would've rather have lived and ultimately died than have been forced to marry his wife!

I didn't enjoy it when released and like it even less now. The story drags along with little to keep your attention, if it were on TV you would channel surf.

I'm not the type of gal who enjoys seeing cartoon creatures having three somes and female animals jumping around naked. Just not my cup of tea. Too bad I bought both of the Fritz ... The Cat movies. It's straight out degrading. Of course, like most movies, they don't full frontal of men bouncing around butt naked.

Bowen has done a masterful job in explaining what happened, why it happened, who made it happen, and who didn't. Almost every situation is explained as to the political, economic and military impact of what happened as well as thoughts on what different could have been done and what the effect might have been.By keeping Spain out of direct belligerency, Franco protected Spain for the post-war era. Though his dictatorship was brutal, it was homegrown and homemade (except for the help of the German Air Force-Condor Legion) and for the most part, kept home. With belligerent armies in the millions, and forced labor in the millions; Spain contributed at most seventy thousand troops and workers all told, with fewer than 20,000 at any one time.If you want to know what happened in Spain during WW2, this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like them","review":"i ordered wrangler jeans for a long time. i tried lee's and love them. great fit. sizing isright on also."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA Noise Canceler","review":"Out of the box, the AHP-712's noise cancelation feature didn't work.

Also after about a week I noticed something was wrong. My car in Need for speed underground 2 kept barely moving to the left. The analog sticks looked straight, but for some reason the controller was causing my car to steer left slightly. I plugged my official Sony controller in and the problem stopped. Of course this ruined it for me and I had to return to using wired Sony controllers.

The power cord connector feels like it may break if you play it too much, but is far more solid than the Targus' power connector which feels far more fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best laptop Fans!! Don't buy any other kind but this one!","review":"I have bought several different types of laptop fans. They all ended up being crappy and stopped working. This one is the best one ever! I bought 2. I took the time to research laptop fans, after going through so many, and read the best ones to keep your laptop from getting to warm are the ones with an ALUMINUM SURFACE. For this price you can not beat it! Don't pay $30 + for any notebook / laptop cooler fan at ANY store. They are over priced! This one is worth the $20 by far! Highly recommend. I like to lay in bed at night and play Spider Solitaire and this fan absolutlely is great for your lap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend this product.","review":"I've had this laptop cooler for about a year now.

Then if I can hold this cable in a specific direction, it works....two months later, it totally died!!!!!!!!I will not recommend this cooler to anyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you your money!!!!!!!!!","review":"This worked good for about a month. Being an Antec product, I expected a superior product, sadly I was disappointed. The product actually still works when you can keep the usb cord connected. It's like where the power cord connects to the cooling pad is loose. If you jiggle the cord you can get it to stay on, but that only lasts a few minutes. So now I'm here on Amazon trying to find one that doesn't have a removable usb cord, hopefully I don't waste more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"Within weeks of purchasing my Antec, the cord leading from the usb port to the plug had separated. It's loud - REALLY loud - although ONLY when my laptop is on it.

While the cord connects from the left side of the cooler, it is designed in such a way that the usb plug must be positioned so the cable enters from the right side (for a rear usb port). This puts undue twisting on the under-guaged cable. Mine frayed and broke within a couple months of use. Then just try to figure out how to get a replacement cord - good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love it...","review":"This cooler is wonderful. It has worked very well for the last year and has held up to many miles of travel. The two speed cooling system is a real asset. The style is great. There are only a couple of small issues. I agree with the other reviews that the blue LED light can be annoying. The male end to the USB cord that plugs into the platform does have a tendency to slip out if the computer / cooler are moved. The two speed fan, when in the lower speed is whisper quiet, however when the higher speed is selected the fan noise is noticable, but not annoying. This cooler is great to travel with. It's definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous !!","review":"I shud have bought this long time ago !

The USB cable has a weird design that conflicts with the MacBook power cord connection. Your cannot use both at the same time on the left side of your Mac. This forces you to put the product's USB connection on the right side of your Mac, which in turn forces you to put a USB connected mouse on the left. Putting your mouse on the left is not good for right handed users since it can shorten your mouse cord length. The product would also be better if it clamped onto your laptop so you could lay on your back, with your knees bent, without your laptop sliding off the product. The product has been designed for putting on a desk or table, not kicking back and lounging."},{"rating":"1","title":"It smells like plastic","review":"When you're handed a shopping bag that smells like plastic, or a new shower curtain exales that same smell for a week or two, be careful.These fumes are not good for your health.The plastic bottom part of this unit has a very toxic smell.When you turn it on, it blows in your face, too.

I have some geek type friends who work on computers and they all recommended a cooler. I went with the Antec after the recommendation of one of my friends. It absolutely eliminates the heat problem. The feed-thru USB port works great and doesn't cost you a connection point. My laptop is a 15.4 inch model. The Antec unit is perfect for this size. I would not change anything about the unit.

The other complaint is the blue light which tells you that the unit is on...it's pretty bright.Pros: storage compartment for USB cable, USB cable has an extender, really quiet, does it's job in keeping the laptop coolCons: bright blue light when on, installation of rubber feet (troublesome, not impossible)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but makes a little noise","review":"Good but makes a little noise.

My laptop is small and overheats regularly without an external fan. The Targus fan I bought worked great, was smaller and more portable, inexpensive, and really cooled my laptop. However the fan motor broke after about 6 months. I \\"upgraded\\" to this model, thinking that something more expensive would last longer. It's bulky and not as portable as the single fan Targus. It also only worked for a couple of months. Now I can use it for an hour and then it blows hot air at my laptop, which does not help to cool it and causes it to overheat faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"great product great outward design but piss poor hardware design kills it","review":"great product ..... WHEN IT WORKSI got this thing to cool my laptop when it was $10 after rebate but now after using it there are loads of problems with it. The major flaw with this unit is how flimsy the power port is on this why they used this design is beyond me, would it really have hurt to tether it on the pad. They made the hole that it goes into way too big and the connector too small which makes the pin able to be jostled and break easily.

When I received the package, I opened the box, plugged it in and within 3 minutes the underside of my laptop was completely cool to the touch. I was concerned that it might be uncomfortable to work with the cooling device under the laptop on my lap but it is hardly noticeable and has not affected my typing at all. I was also concerned about the additional noise being annoying but even on high it is hardly noticeable. In fact I wasn't sure at first that it was even working.

However, there are 2 things I'd recommend to improve it: 1) shorten the USB cord or make a way for it to be hidden and secured to the base so that it doesn't get in the way [I folded and taped it to the base for my own comfort]. 2) Make the base smooth or add a soft cover to it so that it will be more comfortable on your lap. I sometimes pair the product with a lap table to rectify this issue but it would be nice if that were not necessary. The motor is fairly quiet and it does prevent the issue of a hot computer on my lap as I surf the net for hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laptop Cooler","review":"I liked this product, it is very light and easy to carry around.

I do wish the fans would blow a bit harder to get more air movement but other than that it's a great product. They changed the design of the USB plug so it's not pass-through anymore.

Yes, near the usb port there is this blue LED that shines like a spotlight out of the back. I connect my MacBook to my speaker system and then listen to music or podcasts with the lights off to go to sleep. The blue spotlight becomes a massive blue light on the wall and serves no purpose! Why, Antec, why?Also this is not \\"whisper\\" quiet.

However, this cooler is made of weak plastic so when the notebook is placed upon the cooler, the weight of the notebook pushes down upon the cooler, nudging the plastic cover into the cooling fans.This action results in the cooling fans hitting against the cooler plastic, producing an annoying noise. Otherwise, the cooler pad does reduce notebook heat, if you can tolerate the noise of the fans hitting the inside plastic. I'm returning my POS. Don't buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I have an after market handle that serves as a lift for my computer to allow the bottom of it to breath, but it still doesn't cool it enough, and the fans still come on. So, I thought the Notebook Cooler might do the trick. One of the features that I was excited about were the really quiet fans that are supposed to blow away the heat from the bottom of the computer.Well, the fans aren't quiet, and it doesn't cool off my computer. In fact, the fans were as loud, or louder than my notebook's fans. It also isn't very smart. You have to turn it on and off manually, instead of having a sensor that detects heat. The fans are loud, the internal design is lacking, and it really doesn't cool off the computer that much. In fact, it just blows warm air towards you if you're sitting next to it. About the only thing that's good about this is the aesthetic design.

Sometimes one, sometimes both. You have to get them moving again by sticking a paperclip into the blade and moving them.-The cord will break quickly. This seems to be a universal problem, because when I contacted Antec, they knew about it right away and would have sent a areplacement, except they were backordered for a month.-The \\"on\\" indicator light will burn out in about a month, then you won't know if its working or not.-It doesn't really cool that well.

Although I don't have any official temperature readings, I can say that while still warm to the touch while playing TOR the computer is no longer in danger of removing my fingerprints. The size of this unit is perfect for my 15\\" MacBook, and the USB connection is even on the correct side to make it easy to use.

For one, it attempts to suck warm air away from the underside of the laptop, which has only a very minimal effect due to the fact that there just isn't much air circulation flowing out from the underside of my machine. I think that if there was a way to reverse the flow of the fans, and have them continually blowing cooler air onto the underside of the laptop it could have a helpful cooling effect.Unfortunately I obtained no measurable decrease in CPU temperature from using this product, and will have to keep searching for a better cooling device for my laptop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last long","review":"I have had two of these now. The first one died after about 6 months. The 2nd died a couple of weeks past a year. I won't buy a 3rd one!!! The design is fair, but a widescreen computer hangs over the cooler, so does not cool the main area (upper left). It also has these little rubber things that you push into each corner, which are supposed to keep your laptop from sliding. After the 2nd day, I gave up on them, as they kept falling out, so, my laptop sat very precariously on the cooler, sliding with the slightest movement. I am now is search for a decent cooling pad.Just too much work, and not enough performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very cool","review":"The product did not seem to get that cool or keep my 2004 Toshiba Satellite cool.

The laptop runs so hot that it is harming the monitor and I will need to have it replaced.The Altec Laptop Cooling Pad worked great for about one month. It lowered the heat of the laptop considerably. The laptop was no longer hot to the touch and the monitor was not being harmed. However, after one month, the fans worked intermittently and then ceased functioning altogether.

I can see this working for laptops with single, small fans.Otherwise ANY laptop with two fans, or a larger fan will get fried by this thing and actually overheat, not cool down. The air flow goes against the computer fans and causes them to compete for air, making them work harder and less able to remove heat. This \\"cooling\\" pad caused my big compaq laptop to continually shut down due to overheating. As soon as I stopped using it, everything was fine.The best cooling method honestly is just a small desk fan pointed in a direction that carries the cool air underneath the laptop so that it accelerates the removal of heat, simple, that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from a computer technician","review":"If your laptop started to warm up couple of months after you bought it, the most probable reason is DUST. get air duster and spray it in to the fan and all the holes of your computer and watch the dust come out. dust stops your laptop cooling system. they cost like 4$ and they reduced my temp from 77c to 40c.after all that I put the artec notebook cooler to work on high setting.you can definitely hear just like your computers fan. and i promise you it did not help my temp not even one degree Celsius.another problem is that it raises your laptop by 1.5\\" from desk and it is really hard to type like that.this is the way to carpal tunnel and wrist pain!this product is being returned... if your computer is still hot after dusting it get a slanted notebook cooler. preferably with a huge fan not 2 or 3 small fans.antec 200 is good but it is 3 times the price of this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"About 2 months after I purchased this cooling pad it stopped working.

If you have seen a MacBook Pro it is metallic like to begin with, and metal on metal makes for a lot of scratching....Not Good. The fans worked ok, and yeah the light is too bright in my opinion.

I've already lost two just by putting it in and pulling it out of my computer bag. I will put silicon bumbers in place of these; they stick on and should stay quite well. The unit is not too lap friendly. I had it on my lap in shorts and the rubber and my legs didn't quite get along! It does just an OK job at cooling the laptop. I had a Belkin before this one and will go back to it when this one dies. One word of warning about the Belkin, the connection for the USB cord will pop out of its plastic bracket.

I couldn't have been more disappointed and mine is now on it's way back to Amazon.First of all, it's a very cheaply made product. I can believe anything close to $30 worth of materials went into this. Very light plastic.A bigger issue was that the power jack was really loose so it wouldn't even stay powered on unless it was rigged to keep the cord tightly pressed against the base. Also of note, one of the fans didn't even turn and seems to have been installed improperly.Even if both fans worked, it just seems so cheap.

Other reviewers were right when they said it creates a sort of suction effect. If you do not have something in between the cooler and your laptop to prop it up there is zero airflow which renders it useless. It has minimal power no matter what setting you use. The silver color finish started rubbing of within days. I've had this product for a year and it barely cools my laptop. I'm ready to toss it. It started having issues within the first two months. The only good feature is that the cord has a USB port so that you don't waste your valuable ports, HOWEVER it is so wide that it ends up blocking my second port anyway.There are definitely better products out there, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS","review":"bought it in oct 2010, its kinda broken now... the lights cooler always gets disconnected and the fan stops all the time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product, poor design.

I purchased those little plastic disks for the bottom of chairs to elevate my laptop so cool air would circulate and this seemed to solve that problem. I should have listened to the other reviewers and loooked elsewhere for a cooling fan.A lot of work for not that great of a product.

So I bought a new cable from ebay and also purchased a new one from Amazon couple months ago.This new one feels better than my old one. But the usb cable does not have outlet (it means the cable occupies one USB port without giving a replacing port). It is bad because my old laptop only has two USB ports.

I figured with 4 cores and a decent GPU, I could use a cooler. The Antec worked pretty darn well while it was operational. Not to the point where my laptop fan would shut off, but it would usually be on low. The fans and the unit itself have proven fairly durable, but the USB cord stinks! By November, so ~8 months the unit would not stay on. The connection seemed to be loose, the blue light would go on for a second or two, then go off. I blame the USB cable.

However, I got this home and found it lowered only by around 3 degrees Celsius. Not bad, but definately not what I was hoping for. The dual fans under the holes (yes, they hard to see in that pic) are fairly weak. Like the littlest amount of air you could blow if asked to blow wind at something.

But that is another story!).The only con I have found is that the little USB cable they provide with the device breaks very easily. I managed to bend the plug soon after purchse buy just repeated plugging in of my mouse cable and it broke. Replacements are $5.00 from Antec's web site, but the shipping is $7.28!!!!

I switched to one of these:ThermaPAK HeatShift Laptop Cooler 15 inch BlackIt works okay, except that it only works for a limited time before you have to let it cool off again. We've discovered you can extend that period of time by putting it in the freezer for awhile.

After some time, the cord would fray and come loose. Eventually I had to buy a third-party replacement which is BETTER than the original.- It doesn't cool as strongly as I'd hoped.OVERALL:- A well-built cooler. There's a reason why it's expensive. Buy some canned air to clean your laptop, too. This alone won't keep it cool.UPDATE (2011, June 30):- It still works. I keep it on high setting all the time now so it is audible in a quiet room.

Having said that and being annoyed that an item is not as it is presented!!!!! this laptop cooler really does work. I just purchased a new Dell fully loaded and it runs hot. I didn't use the cooler from my old laptop at first but after seeing how hot the new Dell was, I took it off my old laptop and put it on the new one...WOW - what a difference, it cooled it off right away.

The USB plug has a built-in USB socket on it so you don't lose that port while you're using the cooler. It is very quiet, and has two speeds for the fans. It does a great job of keeping the temps down. The only issue I had was one of the fans on my first unit began to vibrate and make a little noise. Amazon was great in dealing with the issue under warranty, and sent me a replacement next-day, and I just had to put the old unit in the box the replacement came in and ship it back with the included return shipping label.

Dell XPS users would be advised to get a cooler like the Zalman NS-1000, which blows cold air on the bottom of them system.Fortunately, it works great on my sister's system, so shes able to get some benefit from it.Highly recommended, if the flow direction in appropriate for your system"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for cooling, Bad for battery","review":"After the first time I used this cooler my laptop battery was completely drained and now no longer holds a charge. This could've been a coincidence, but this is the SECOND battery that this cooler has destroyed. I now have to continuously charge the battery for it to hold any kind of charge. I can barely use the laptop for more than 2hours without having to charge it again. I hope the manufacturer finds some kind of solution to this, because the cooler is really good and useful except for destroying the battery life. It is pretty bulky for anything other than keeping it on the desk, but it really does cool your laptop. There are two speeds, and the noise is pretty minimal, more like white noise, but its not too bothersome, just turn up the volume if you're watching a movie.

Needless to say, this was hardly practical in the long run.I wonder if any of these devices are designed to last very long. It didn't cost much, so I am only somewhat upset.

I'm talking orders of magnitude here... I think the fans just aren't in the right places to chill the hot spots on my MacBook. I have tried moving it around, but really doesn't help much.* Louder than my Targus Chillmat, even when on 'low' setting.* No 'on/off' switch, only 'low' and 'high' setting toggle.

The #1 main issue is the terrible USB plug design. The power plug piece broke due to cord placement. Overall, when working, it provided a very small amount of cooling (about 4-5 degrees according to speedfan). The inability to turn off the super bright blue LED, the cord storage panel on the bottom popping off frequently, and the overall cheap quality of design/materials all contributed to me hating this thing.

One of my coolers is one made of an aluminum base with 3 fans and sits at an angle. It works great but it is just not portable--to put on your lap. So I started looking for something else and I found the Antec. Read all the reviews and decided it could be held on my lap. The only problem is that I have a large 17 inch laptop. The laptop hangs over the Antec and that means the rubber feet on the bottom of the computer are not able to raise it above the cooler. It sits flush--no air flow. I remedied the problem by putting 4 rubber feet (that I bought at Home Depot) sticking then on the Antec. Now there is a 3/4 inch clearance between the computer and the Antec. Great airflow and the Antec Cooler does its job superbly. I would have given it 5 stars except for the issue of it fitting on my computer but I fixed that problem by attatching the feet to the Antec. Well worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what JUNK!","review":"I've a 17\\" custom made laptop. Is this even supposed to keep my laptop cooler? Cause it certainly isn't doing that job!

After only two months, the cooling pad is already starting to make death sounds. Within a week, I'm sure I'll be back on Amazon.com trying to find a replacement. Perhaps it's just this unit.If it weren't for the short life, I'd give the pad a 4 out of 5 stars. The blue light it emits while plugged in is extremely bright and annoying, and there is no \\"off\\" setting or switch - you have to unplug it when you don't want to have it on). The size and shape, though, are great. I could use either laptop - a large and small one - without worrying about whether the fan could cool it or hold it comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great whisper quiet","review":"This works fantastic. It is quieter than the fan on my laptop. It cools it down significantly. You can really feel the difference. My laptop has not overheated since I got this.

I was too busy with school to return it to Amazon but I wrote to the company about 6 months later, still within the 1 year warranty. They want ME to pay for a box to put it in and shipping to have it sent to them so they can \\"fix\\" it. NOT WORTH IT.

It works well with my larger Dell laptop, but is pretty thick. I like it.I got one for my wife's smaller and cheaper Dell laptop. The only problem is that you can't have the cooler plugged in to the USB port when you turn the laptop on. Wait until the laptop boots before plugging it in, or the boot fails.

It fits nicely on the cooler without any problem. Before I got this cooler, my computer would get very hot and the fan on the computer was working so hard (and very loud) to cool if off. This cooler does help so much. The low setting is not so loud. The high setting is a bit loud but still not as loud as my computer's own fan when it's on full speed.

It works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...when it works","review":"At first it did a fine job cooling down my laptop, but after a couple months of use the power cord won't stay connected.

Oh - and the smell right out of the box was atrocious! I had to put the thing outside to air out for a few days before I could use it without getting a headache. I should have sent it back right then. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use with Dell XPS 1530","review":"I got this cooler for my Dell XPS 1530. There are a lot of expensive coolers out there that cool much better then this. I was looking for a cheap alternative that would provide adequate cooling with taking into consideration the position of the m1530 fans. This cooler has 2 fans in the CENTER of the unit and the holes in the mesh are actually covered so the airflow goes through the center and out from the vents on the 2 sides of the unit.It works great for times when you want to use your laptop on a soft surface like a bed or sofa.If you're looking for serious cooling for some type of gaming or intensive application use, then unfortunately this would not be the cooler for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolutely terrible book","review":"This book is common sense.

It spent very little time providing the reader with any substantial assistance. Instead the writer delivered common things the reader should do, such as don't drink to much alcohol or make sure and consume creatine. I also found it very narcissistic. Kennedy used 126 pages to say \\"I'm better than you because college was easy for me.\\" This is then concluded by a list of grammatical errors made in writing and in speech that he found personally annoying.

It is short and to the point. Although he takes a very Calvinistic stand in the book, he shares many thought-provoking points about the Holy Spirit. It is a nice resource to have in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never forget this book..","review":"Maybe because I listened to an unabridged audio version of this book, read in the authors own voice, I have a kinder view of the rather flat, unadorned, almost childlike, journalistic style that has drawn criticism... I found the author's direct, repetitive, style soothing and comforting and almost necessary, just for me to be able to endure the hideious reality of the narritive. I am going to buy this book, keep it, and refer to it everytime I think I am having a bad day. For some reviewers to criticize this woman for reaching out and choosing the wrong relationships is appaling. This book is a tribute to the will to survive, the power of love and the human capacity for forgiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Journey!","review":"Wow! I just finished this book last night, and I'm floored. What an incredible life this woman has led! This book made me so thankful for the things that I have. I really loved that in spite of what Kim has been through, you don't get the sense that she's wallowing in self pity. She manages somehow to tell us her story without putting blame on anyone or sounding like she feels sorry for herself. It was just incredible to read the story of how she learned to forgive the people around her, and how she learned to love herself. A truly amazing story. I feel lucky to have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"Wow, this book really held me! From her life in Korea, to her (very miserable) life in the US with her adoptive parents, to her life on her own with her own daughter, I just kept on reading.I was bothered though by the fact that there are no hard dates in the book. I can understand not having a firm birth date, but for the rest of it, there could have been some years to hang some facts on and I would have liked that.I do realize there is some controvery swirling around this book -- people wondering if it's true, or fiction. Also, some delving into the whole aspect of \\"honor killings\\" in Korea. So, this book has left people with points to argue and ponder.Even so, it was worth my time reading it, and I would love to read more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"puhleeze","review":"I'm sure that any telemarketer would love to have a list of this book's fans, since they are clearly a very trusting bunch.Do they really believe that Ms Kim flew by Korean Airlines years before Korean Airlines was founded? Do they really think she watched \\"The Elephant Man\\" on TV with her husband years before the movie was released in theaters? Do they really believe she farmed rice in mid-winter (at the age of five!), and lived on a heated earth floor, and learned English in two days? Do they really believe she skipped a few years of school and still graduated at age 17?Don't they wonder at how neatly - and implausibly - the book's central event manages to combine the two most important issues of international feminism in the past decade: genital mutilation and honor killings?Most importantly, don't they realize why Doubleday still hasn't issued the book in paperback?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Korea I know","review":"I can't evaluate the truthfulness of Ms. Kim's story here, but readers should not draw broad conclusions about Korea's culture and people from this book. Like Ms. Kim, I'm an American of mixed Korean/Caucasian blood. I grew up in Korea, living there from the mid 1960s to 1980. I experienced acceptance and respect in Korea--from my own Korean relatives, friends, aquaintances, and also from people I didn't know. No culture is completely free of prejudice, but I often feel that Korea is misunderstood by Americans. I'm afraid that this book perpetuates misunderstanding of a nation and a culture that I personally know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictious book","review":"Elizabeth Kim should check her facts before deciding to write a book about the injustice in Korea. Yes, she may have suffered a great deal, but to fabricate and exaggerate what happened to her for the sake of sympathy is not accepatble. There is no such thing as \\"honor killing\\" in Korea and the author has spread this and many false rumors about Korea without checking what really happened. Also, her negative attitude towards life is depressing as she blames others for her misfortune in life in the past and present. A careful study of this book would reveal many contradictions; therefore, this book should be read as fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very doubtful memoir","review":"The book has a very intense beginning. I was astonished by what the author witnessed at a very young age. However, as I read on, I felt the book lack of any solid information that could supplement her claims/experiences. Not that I don't believe what she has been through, I just find it hard to believe that anybody can pick up a foreign language within a few days. Without any supporting references, I find the book extremely weak and consider it more or less a novel than a memoir.Lastly, given the author is a journalist, I am very disappointed by the author's story telling ability. It seems that the author devoted all the energy in writing the first few chapters which were the best parts of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ten thousand things that don't add up","review":"On day one in the USA, Ms Kim did not even know the word \\"no.\\" By day three, she \\"could understand [English] pretty well.\\" She skips two grades and is a couple years younger than her classmates, but still manages to be seventeen at graduation...Come on, fellow Amazonians, don't you wonder why no names or locations or given, not even a single date?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Comment","review":"I am a \\"naive\\", caring person and this book made me weep! To read about a child who sees her mother getting killed by her uncle and grandfather then later being adopted by \\"Cruel\\" religious parents - depressed me a great deal. But as I kept reading the book I was suspecting the writer's honesty! Especially when in page 101 she refers to the mother of her adopted mother as \\"How could anyone love that withered, malevolent old hag?\\". Automatically, once I've read that line I re-visited the holly Amazon.com and read a couple of reviews and in there I've found a lot of people who contradicted everything this pathological liar said in her \\"Ten thousand sorrows\\" book, and who calls herself a victim.I knew about the term \\"Too good to be true\\" but only after I've lost about two hours of my life in this \\"book\\" I got to know that there must be a term \\"Too horrible to be true\\" too.Nice one \\"Doubleday\\"! We'll see how am I going to buy your books from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"compelling story, not well written","review":"The first part of Elizabeth Kim's story is gripping, but then it gets wooden as it meanders through the various abuses she endures from her adoptive parents and her husband. This reads like it is a first draft rather than a polished, reflective consideration of how racial and religious intolerance affect children."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little hard to swallow","review":"I just want to say that like Jemma I also found the hyperbole troublesome. For example, when Kim's husband throws the casserole out the closed window on their first night together. (Later she describes him as a compulsive neatness freak - just the kind of guy who would ruin a window just because he doesn't like zucchini!?) Kim says that the patio was covered in shards of glass, so her hands and knees were \\"ribboned with cuts\\" from cleaning up the mess. Hello? Never hear of a broom and dustpan? Who gets down on her hands and knees in a pile of broken glass? Certainly no one I'm interested in sympathizing with."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've already read Angela's Ashes... next book please!","review":"Once you've read one sob story, you've read them all. Too many adjectives... not enough action to what she did with her experiences in her earlier years. I may be biased, but I'm tired of Korean, or pseudo-Korean writers writing about the same drab topics. From sex slaves to over-bearing parents... can Koreans write something more about universal topics in North America in lieu of the \\"Korean Experience\\", which has been played out to the hilt by so many writers before her? But I do give the author credit for not using the words \\"Rice\\", \\"Kimchee\\", or any other words that define Koreans as ugh, the white man sees us, in her book title. Hi Jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorrowful but inspiring","review":"I'm moved beyond words. Although Kim's story is sad and haunting, it made me look at my own life and appreciate the wonderful childhood my parents and family provided. It is difficult to grasp that some people suffer so much in this life and still survive. I wanted to take that small child and hold her in my arms and make her feel safe. I want to tell Ms. Kim that she is an awesome woman with such courage and integrity to survive that life and still come out a loving and forgiving woman. Unbelievable story, a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and moving","review":"I found this to be a compelling and believable account that rang true for me. It doesn't put Christianity in a positive light and perhaps that makes it hard for some readers to swallow. This is her reality and nobody else's--she bares her pain in an honest and refreshing tale that is very inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"I found Elizabeth Kim's book incredibly gripping. A neighbour (who couldn't put it down) lent it to me, and then when I read it, I ended up not going to bed until the wee hours. I suffered, grieved and rejoiced with Kim, and her healing process forced me to look at areas of struggle in my own life, and try deal with them. Thank you, Elizabeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING BOOK","review":"This is the most compelling book I have ever read! My emotions were captured as the story unfolded and, it is written so well, that I suffered along with Ms. Kim as she described her life. When I finished reading it, I put it down, turned to my husband and said, \\"This is the most incredible book I've ever read\\" - and I am a big reader! After that I was speechless as I tried to absorb all of my emotions. How can I ever thank Ms. Kim for offering us this memoir! I would like to know more about her future years and her daughter, Leigh, so I hope she'll write more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute to Mothers","review":"Elizabeth Kim's book is really a tribute to motherhood. The memory of her mother and her mother's love for her are what sustain her through her childhood and early adulthood. Her own motherhood is what sustains her, rescues her, and saves her life over and over again as she creates her own adulthood. I loved this book. Every word is perfectly chosen. Every scene is deeply etched into my memory. I read it two weeks ago, and still think about this extraordinary woman every day. And I think about her mother, too. And mine. I thank Elizabeth Kim for writing such a beautiful tribute to the unique and magnificent power of motherhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Thousand Sorrows","review":"This is a beautiful book! Elizabeth Kim is an exceptional person. She suffers through so many trials in her life and still seems to be a well adjusted person at the end. The last page of this book is stunning in its simplicity and power. I highly recommend this book for adoptive parents. It affords the rare opportunity to get inside the mind of an adopted child and understand how the changes they must endure affect them. I just wanted to find Elizabeth the child, give her a hug and tell her that there are good people in the world and people who could love and appreciate her. In the end she knows that. Just a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique life","review":"I listened to the audiobook version. Kim's whole life was astonishing, but especially the abuse at the hands of her adoptive parents and her ex-husband. These were Christians? This may go to show how \\"fundamental\\" doctrines can twist around the ideas of Christ. The word took precedence over the spirit in these folks, according to Kim. It's hard to believe that her ex-husband claimed to be a Christian at all, but I guess in some corners of these United States there are such twisted minds.Some of Kim's introspection was not that interesting, and the poetry was maybe a nice touch, but it didn't touch me much. But there was something uniquely different in Kim's life journey, and I learned a lot from that special quality. Diximus."},{"rating":"2","title":"a guy liked it too","review":"my wife read this book and thought it was excellent. She buys and reads most of the Oprah selections. I looked at the cover, thought about the fact that it was an Oprah selection, and said, \\"this is like a chick book, right?\\" she said \\"some might think so\\", but encouraged me to try it anyway. I did. I found that as a writer Kim tends to be a bit repetitive or tends to make things last a bit longer than they need last. I would compare it to a half hour show that is stretched into an hour program as an analogy, except the stretch was only about five or ten minutes rather than a half hour. It is very well written and you can truly feel the emotion she communicates. Most important and extraordinary, to me at least, was when I read the last two pages I cried. Even a guy would like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album, even from Sakamoto","review":"If you want ambient chillout msuic, this album can provide that for you and will do it in a much more interesting way than 99% of \\"ambient\\" albums. If you want IDM & glitch, this album will also more than satisfy your needs.What really makes this CD shine for me is the huge contrast between the exceptionally robotic, glitchy, inorganic sounds of Noto and the organic piano playing of Sakamoto. Anyone could bring live instrumental music together with machine music. Only someone with an incredible amount of skill can make the two fuse into such a perfect marriage while at the same time, emphasizing the wide gulf between the two types of sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This is the first product I have reviewed, but it was such a rip-off I thought it was worth preventing anyone else from wasting their hard-earned money!

This CD has hilarious songs, and while a few are really irratating to listen to after hearing them so many times(Enough \\"Here In Your Bedroom already!!!), It was a pretty decent CD.

Snoop Dogg plays a big time gambler who opens up a casino of his own with the help of the mob. Eventually complications arise and the mob is after him. The film is amazing in appearance as far as the characters dress and background scenery goes. However, there is no other real subtance to the film. The best part is after the film is over and two music videos are played. The second of the two videos is great (lots of nudity and the song is pretty cool to).

The premise is funny and that is about it. I was hoping for belly laughs but hardly smiled. It was sort of \\"Odd Couple\\" mixed with a male duo \\"Thelma and Louise\\" .Nothing to lose revolves around corporate marketing man Nick (Tim Robbins) who thinks his wife is cheating on him when he comes home earlier than expected. He is devastated and does not care what happens to him once his world falls apart. So he just drives away ending up in the bad part of town. A robber named \\"T.Paul\\" (Martin Lawrence) then jumps into Nick's SUV and threaten him with a gun. For some strange reason he throws his billfold out the window and says you picked the wrong man on the wrong day. From there on it is a wild and goofy journey from the L.A. slums to the Arizona desert and then back to L.A. to do a \\"Big Job\\".The many fights and dumb scenes are just not funny or clever. The movie never clicks for plot or jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to Lose","review":"This is what it will be if you don't see this movie. Not for kids,but outrageously funny for adults.

To start with, he walks in on his wife in bed with another man. He's having a really rough time with his boss. And to top it all off, he gets carjacked by T.(Terrence) Paul (Martin Lawrence). Feeling he has \\"nothing to lose,\\" Nick decides to turn the tables on this would be carjacker and take him for the action packed thrill ride of his life.In this 1997 comedy, directed by Steve Oedekerk, you will get 98 minutes of gut busting laughs. If you like comedies with lots of action, hold-ups, high speed chases, and revenge, I would recommend this movie to you.I give this film four stars because, while it is a very funny film, it does have a lot of foul language. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this film for young people, or people who prefer to keep young sensitive ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a super funny movie","review":"Hilarious movie!

Robbin's comes home early to find his wife in bed with his boss and runs away to the desert, taking car-jacker Lawrence with him, to think things over.The dialogue is hackneyed and stilted, the plot is horribly contrived and Lawrence seems to have been given freedom to improvise, which is is clearly not good at. He resorts mainly to doing his xenophobic 'Oooh white folks' thing while Robbins lumbers around like an idiot.None of the jokes work, the humor is far from clever and the set-ups are obvious. The bland photography and silly score are so incredibly 90s that the film, merely ten years old, looks heavily dated.There are better things that you could be doing with your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries hard to be funny, but isn't","review":"Tim Robbins plays a man who thinks he's discovered his wife having an affair with his boss. He meets up with Martin Lawrence when Lawrence trie to car jack him. They end up working as a team to rob Robbins' boss. Then they find out his wife isn't having an affair after all and he has to try to fix things. This is an amiable enough movie but has no real laugh out loud scenes and Lawrence plays the same mugging boob he always plays and his act gets old fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound is not true","review":"I'm a fanatic when it comes to sound and I could not be more disappointed with \\"Nothing to Lose\\". Not only does it not use the rear surround channels effectively (extremely low volume with echo), the subwoofer channel is not used! I had it cranked in several parts of the movie where the subwoofer should have been a no-brainer and nothing was there! In my DVD collection of 25, this one has to be turned up an extra 10 Db just to hear it. And no, my receiver or speakers are not damaged--I watch movies all the time. The VHS recorded version I have from Showtime sounds better. Why would Touchstone have released it this way?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Stuid","review":"If I could give this movie a negative 5, that would be generous. This ranks as the absolutely worst movie I have ever seen. No plot, no storyline, unbelievable situations, poor acting, etc. I own almost 200 DVDs, but if Hollywood were to put out this sort of mindless crap all the time, I would not own any movies. Folks, do yourself a big, big favor and pass by this movie. Want a tip on a good movie, get Save The Last Dance to include the deleted scenes save the \\"Record Shop\\" scene. That movie by director Thomas Carter dealt with real life issues in a sensitive and intelligent way-the director made you care about the characters.

Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence were awesome together! Robbins plays an advertising executive named Nick Beam who has a pretty good life and an awesome wife. One day when he comes home, he thinks he sees his wife and his boss having sex. After going into deep depression, he is almost mugged by a man named T. Paul. Nick turns the tables and kidnaps the robber. They soon become friends and come up with a plan to rob Nicks boss. They soon must deal with a pair of bad guys who also want the money. I highly recommend NOTHING TO LOSE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sleeper of a funny movie","review":"We saw this movie as a double-feature when it premiered -- I don't remember the movie we'd gone to see, but I remembered this one. Aside from Martin Lawrence's unnecessary profanity streak (that lost a star for the movie for me), this movie is a sure thing for some side-splitting laughter, even if one has seen it more than once. The real fun comes from the understated bits of the fight in the diner parking lot, \\"you must be really fast,\\" and my all-time funniest scene from all movies, the spider-on-your-head fire dance to the Scat Man. Genious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny, a great comedy!","review":"Another one of our favorites! Martin Lawrence and Tim Robbins are great together.

The humor is witty, yet silly and the acting, as you'd probably guessed, is a clear reflection of Lawrence's and Robbin's ability!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a hit!","review":"I've seen this movie at least a dozen time and each time it makes me laugh.

It does pull back the curtain on an interesting field and makes some of the techniques applicable to non-spy activities.This book would make a good gift for anyone (from young teens to adults) having an interest in the subject, or perhaps as a light (!) introduction for those curious about what espionage or intelligence as a career might entail."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSI Deluxe Set","review":"This set is a MUST for any CSI fan.

It is also some of the kickingest folk recorded after the Beatles Invasion. Some of my all-time favorite trio songs are here, with very little filler. The trio is at the top of their craft with \\"Gonna Go Down the River\\" and \\"Hanna Lee\\" on the loud side and \\"Yes I can Feel it\\" and \\"Rusting in the Rain\\" on the soft side. \\"Dooley\\" is a Dillards cover that foreshadows their foray into electrified folk. Four of the best cuts from the folk-rock \\"Something Else\\" LP round out this essential CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice language but little else","review":"There is such a thing as being too subtle and too dependant on symbolism. Ms Cohen uses foreshadowing that doesn't go anywhere.

Ms Cohen is a very talented wordsmith but it doesn't fell like she's emotionally invested in her material so how can she expect the reader to be?

The scenario (though overused) is perfect for a great buddy film/screwball comedy but it fails to deliver. I genuinely laughed about twice through the entire 90-minute run time.

But everything you canthink of goes wrong for them. And a few things you probably can\`t think of to top it all off.Normally you wouldn\`t think of Danny Glover as a comedian, and while he\`s not great at it he still turns in a decent comedic performance.

The Winter Garden lists (with many color photographs) plants of all types and sizes which remain interesting in winter for their color, shape, berries, or texture. It's a good book to read for gardeners who are suffering from let down when the blooming season passes. I found this bit of advice useful: plan any landscape as if it were a winter landscape. Then you will be assured of some beauty all year, and even more so when the flowers do finally pop up. Also, plant an evergreen shrub and maybe some ornamental grass (or Christmas ferns) in the center of a garden bed; colorful annuals and perennials can surround this when weather permits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great explanation of the classic Alpine","review":"In this text, Robson provides an interesting and thorough overview of the classic Sunbeam Alpine and its younger brother, the Tiger.

Those people are wrong. Without a solid script and an intriguing storyline, no movie can be saved by cool visual effects. This movie has only one memorable moment, when the maniacal, little clown turns into a cheerleader and does some goofy cheers. That was actually hysterical. The rest of this film was hysterically bad. Martin Sheen must be experiencing the lowest low of his career. To think that the same guy who had the lead in \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" a classic about the Vietnam War, would appear in this piece of trash is more frightening than anything.

If I ever see another copy of this video, I will set it on fire so as to prevent others from the horror they would surely face. But since the director obviously didn't spend too much money making this movie, they didn't lose much of an investment. When I went on-line to give my review, I was flabergasted that they actually made a sequel to such a terrible movie. Trust me, I won't make the same mistake again.

It is actually based off of a comic series of the same name. I thought the movie was great because we see so many stereotypical super hero movies, and spawn was the opposite. His character is alot darker than most(he's a ressurected human from hell)and he actually start off doing work for Satin. Honestly this movie was just ahead of its time, which is why it suffered. Before we had Spiderman,Xmen,Jonah Hex,Captain America, and now even Thor is coming out, there was Spawn which came out in a time where special effects were nothing compared to what they are today.

His mouth didn't move hardly at all when he spoke--we still imitate it to this day.

Still with me? A travesty of a film, featuring some of the worst acting in recent memory. I hope Martin Sheen dies in a tragic auto accident. I hope John Leguizamo dies in his sleep. I hope Michael Jai White really goes to hell, and he probably will after acting in this trash. If you spot this one at the video store, set fire to it.

Spawn may rule the comic book and action figure industry but creator Todd McFarlane needs to learn a lot about the movie industry.

The screenplay--if you can call it that--seems like it was written by a prepubescent; the \\"plot\\" is ridiculous and incoherent, and the dialogue, well, I have heard better in saturday morning cartoons. The film's attempt at a profound meaning is naive. Please, do not expect me to deliniate the story for you--it is muddled and unfathomable.\\"Spawn\\" left me thinking, \\"What kind of a film is this?\\". For example: In one particular scene, Spawn jumps into a fireplace (yes, a fireplace) and is transported to a hell-like dimension where he encounters an army of demons led by some kind of fire monster. If you want a good laugh, listen to the monster's farsical and cartoonish voice! It may be worth watching just for that!I have never actually read it, but after watching the film, I cannot help but think you would be better off reading the comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel shame","review":"This COULD have been a decent movie.

I have nothing against the violence in Spawn'comics. So, it was better to leave it that way when transporting it to the big screen. But no: the movie took a completely faulty script, took bad actors (Sheen is an exception, but his character is as bad as all the others). THe special effects are good, but so what?

It gets really into things, by bringing you 3, 2 and a half hour movies, which have as much blood, gore, nudity, and bad language as you want, because of the fact that it doesn't need to be rated \\"pg-13\\". This movie however, tried to cram the whole story of spawn into a 2 hour film. Now this just isn't possible. for The people who gave this film good reviews, you outta see the animated series.

When Batman or Superman stand still so does their cape, but Spawn's cape is flowing whether he's moving or not! Then there's his added features: His chains that have jaws deadlier than a bear's trap!

First off, the film scratches the surface of what the comic book of Spawn is all about. A thin plotline and even thinner characters almost ruined it.

The special effects and makeup are great, as is John Leguizamo as Clown, but there is a lot of overacting and the storyline is boggled and shameful for something out of the Spawn universe. It gets two stars for special effects/makeup, and John Leguizamo, other than that, it goes right down the crapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rentable third rater","review":"The only thing worse than the odious characters is the tenuous plot...no wait, there's the anemic dialogue...no, the leaden performances, no, actually it's the heavy reliance on the special effects. (Plot? What plot?) Leguizamo's clown is over the top, while Spawn's juvenile emotional state is irritating at best. Everyone trapped in this celluloid hell, in particular Sheen, is undoubtedly better than the material, but oh, what dreadful material. Rent this from the library, and for goodness sakes, don't let your children watch this thing. Leguizamo's character's crude one liners are not for the young, nor are the heavy doses of special effects (Satan is simply nightmarish).

You see Angela, Sam $ Twitch and some others. For the extras on the DVD... This is great. I'm not really into MM, but it's nice to see these things as an extra. Like the trailer, sketches.

I can't believe that Todd McFarlane (Spawn creator) could have spent so long developing his incredible comic book (the art alone is wroth the cover price!), and then coped out and let this piece of garbage into theaters. I thought the old Captain America movie was awful, but this movie is probably the worst comic to film translation I've EVER seen. How bad it is has become especially apparent in the last few years since the release of Blade (which rocked), and the upcoming Blade 2 and Spiderman movies. The only comic to film transition even close to being this bad in recent memory is X-Men, another complete waste of time and money.

Siedel presents a four point Manager's Legal Plan as a device for anticipating potential legal problems and then developing a plan of action in response. The unique value of this book is the manner in which it integrates a business perspective into legal risk analysis. Too often, books of this sort stick solely to a public policy analysis or a mind numbing survey of legal principles. Siedel uses interesting cses and examples to make his points. Some of his heuristics such as Fight versus Flight will stick in the minds of managers.

Finally after enduring floods of insults, Don Rodrigo reaches the limits of his patience and tugs upon a rival's beard. This unseemly behavior, so tame by today's standards, dooms the Don to exile in the land of the Godless Moors. There, the epic takes off as the Don becomes known as El Cid (the Lord) after conquering the Moorish regions for the King of Castile (his approach to trying to escape his sentence of exile).

The fastest changes the picture every second, medium changes every three seconds, and the slowest changes every six seconds. What were they thinking? All three speeds are so fast that it'll drive you completely insane. Even at every six seconds the pictures change so rapidly that you barely get a glimpse of the image and then its gone. Do not buy this. Get one that plays randomly and allows the pictures to remain for at least a full minute, maybe even five minutes.

I go through about 1 every month and then toss it in the trash can. They do not eliminate all the lint going into the water pipes but probably 80% of it. The reason I know there's still lint around is I have a second filter on the drain pipe and see the lint. But still this is a great product, inexpensive, and definitely worth the money. I would give it a perfect score if it took out all the lint, but since it takes out roughly 80% that's the reason for the score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea.

He has done this multiple times.

What a huge waste of time!Want a clue...go to Apple and a Mac.

When I saw 'All of us are trapped by a complex web of corporate and governmental behemoths ... that controls our airways, educates our children, and manages every facet of our lives.\\" I immediately became interested. This is an idea that I have explored thoroughly, and loved to read any extensive perspective on it.Gerry Spence's comparison between full-blown slaves and the american public was very compelling and eerie. And his ideals to change things, while I don't agree with every one of them, are very fascinating.Unfortunately, Spence's writing style is very erratic. The book is nothing more than a collaboration of independent ideas and perspectives sectioned off into non-continous brackets. He hardly ever has a continous thought that spans more than one page, and the discontinuity makes some chapters very fuzzy and incoherent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spence wants to buck the system","review":"Im a fan of Mr. Spence and have owned all but one of his books. This is an interesting book, but your showing your lack of resonableness if you go along with it whole-heartedly. In fact it's probably what Mcviegh read before making his bomb. We can't change the system overnight(nor would we want to if we had to replace it with Gerry's ideas). He's much like Nader(except anybody takes a better picture than Ralphy) in the sense that he could get alot farther if he only focused on changing part of the world at a time. Still it's worth reading just to think of it all in a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ideas, cleverly written","review":"Gery Spence's ideas would turn these united States into a socialist dystopia. His ideas are anathema to liberty.Example: That Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech is set in the First Amendment. We can be certain that the founders meant political speech.Spence's solution: Eliminate campaign contributions, so that only thos who control a TV network or newspaper chain can influence the outcome of an election. While he rails against the big corporation, this one proposal gives unprecedented power to a small sub-group of corporations.Whether you believe that socialists or social conservatives control the media, this effectively silences those with opposing views. Stalin and Hitler would be proud of such an idea - and to couch it in the name of freedom is obscene."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I have enjoyed Gerry Spence's advocacy of the downtrodden. I read From Freedom To Slavery with joy at its simple wisdom. But now he has given me a book that is too long for its theme, not as well-written as his previous tomes, and full of ideas antithetical to his self-proclaimed devotion to freedom. I could overlook some of his earlier paranoia and anti-liberty views in the context of his overall framework in other books, but here he suggests people be forced to vote, that citizens be banned from helping candidates they support, and that his one-time foe, Government, control more of our lives. The man has lost any concept of freedom, and why government is what Washingon called \\"fire.\\"This book is going to shock libertarians, both civil and economic. If you respected Spence for his \\"let-me-live-free\\" attitude, this book will give up any positive feelings for his opinions. Thank goodness he's still a good lawyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy and Useless Product","review":"Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick.

That's largely the problem with this--it makes a valiant effort, but I think ultimately fails in capturing the depth and hugely comedic nature of these books. The last portion of the film--after the war-- is quite disappointing--a different actor now plays the narrator & some of the characters appear to have aged dramatically (at least one with very bad makeup) while others haven't aged at all.

The DVD looks like what we would presume was a pirated copy. This is something we would not expect Amazon to carry. My husband remarked that the subtitles are so strange it seems as if it was for a hearing impaired person-since the movie is in English and the subtitles are in English-but that isn't the strangest part: there are subtitles telling you someone is clearing their throat; or a clock is ticking; or there is a clap of thunder! This is beyond annoying and you cannot remove the subtitles. This copy will go into the trash-it isn't worth the cost of returning it to Amazon.

It was obviously a direct transfer from a used master.Sad, because the film itself and all the performances are fascinating. Dench, as always, is nothing less than riveting, and the rest of the cast match her line for line.

I was a bit skeptical about the film at first but I am a convert to the cause. Watch this and enjoy, it's not a tear-jearker for those looking for kisses and roses but it will bring a lump to your throat as you watch a fragile friendship develop between the austere Queen of England and the rough and ready Scotsman who became her most loyal subject in a time of need. John Brown is never portrayed as a Saint, he is drinker and blasphemer who somehow managed to charm Queen Victoria and anger a nation at the same time. Judy Dench gives a credible performance as the brittle and aging Queen grieving for her dead husband and the storyline follows their friendship from beginning to end.

It is about life; not fantasy. The acting is superb portraying the story of Queen Victoria which is true however bittersweet. A love not shown publicly but silent yet lasting until death and carried in her heart to be remembered here on earth. I think the one exchange between Brown and Victoria as they begin their daily horseback ride was one of the most touching and beautiful love scenes I have seen. It certainly expressed a kind of love that is seldom understood to be true in our society today. Devotion and loyalty at a great cost is a concept which perhaps could be shown to our jaded teens in an English class. Her Majesty, Mrs Brown is a movie that is worth your time and attention. Guaranteed to bring your priorities back into balance when they become askewed by compromise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs. Brown","review":"Enjoyable movie.

I did not know much about the actual history of the story, and I'm sure the producers took certain liberties with history, but the story presented in the movie is timeless.Judy Dench does an outstanding job portraying Queen Victoria after the death of her beloved Prince Albert. To try to persuade her to come out of mourning and once again be in the public eye, her advisors ask a family friend, John Brown, to come and be a personal servant for the Queen. The story evolves into one of forbidden love. Mrs. Dench makes her character real, passionate, and powerful.

Very well done, very well acted. I'm going to get my copy. The only reason why I didn't give this movie the five stars that it deserves is for the following (significant in my eyes) reason:Upon the death of Her majesty, she had, by her request, buried with her, in her hand, a locket that beared the picture of a certain Mr. Brown! I found about this some time back by watching a story of Queen Victoria and Mr. Brown on (I believe) the History Channel! A detail like that should have been shared with the movie audience - but it wasn't!

I tried using the stand with a 500 page paperback book (dimensions about 8.5x11 inches)...absolutely terrible experience! The backing of the stand is too short for my book, so the upper corners of my pages would bend backwards.

It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides. The only thing it has going for it is portability. It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback, it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions. Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again. I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them. For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gift","review":"For all the avid book readers that you know... this seems to be a hit. I purchased this for my oldest daughter and she loves it. She was excited to get it and has used it a lot when reading. Reasonably priced and worth the purchase to free up hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite right","review":"I purchased this item to help ensure correct posture while reading and typing up notes. While it may serve for 'lite' reading, I found it to be cumbersome for larger books. It is cumbersome because it does not have the 'handles' that should hold the bottom of each side of the open book are not adjustable. The inability to adjust the 'handles' makes it difficult - if not impossible - for the unit to hold thick books that are opened such that an equal (and substantial) number of pages are being 'held' by each 'handle.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"This product didn't meet the expectations I had after reading the product details and all the customer reviews. It holds regular hard-cover textbooks pretty well, but I have 2 wire bound textbooks that it doesn't support. Also its very inconvenient to turn pages (you pretty much have to take the book off the stand, turn the page, and then put it back in the stand), regardless of what kind of book you are using, which really defeats the purpose for me because I normally don't just stay on the same page.However, it does fold nicely and comes with a little sleeve that is hole punched so you can carry it around in a binder. I thought that was cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Holder Doesn't Hold Books Well","review":"I have owned this product for many years considering it almost useless and only now when looking for a useful portable book stand I learned how good this one was. First, reading the reviews, I didn't even suspect that I owned such a great product and then, after I realized and confirmed it by looking at the picture, I took it out and tested again.First, as one (at least) review has mentioned, it's impossible to adjust angle between the book and the surface.Second, it doesn't conveniently hold average paperback even in the middle of the book and makes the first and last dozens of pages hardly readable.Third, even the books it can hold (mostly large heavy hard backs) require constant adjustment on the stand to remain readable so you cannot just easily flip through the pages back and forth.Forth, it, probably, can be convenient for a relatively static use of a reference book, i.e., if one needs to look on a few pages in a narrow range."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy holder","review":"I bought this product because the book stand I have now is too narrow to hold my textbooks.

But, it is only a list and an incomplete and sporatic one at that. Seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why books are in the list or left out of the list.There are only 2 1/2 pages of actual text from the author and it really is not that informative.There are several other books for collecting cookbooks that I just bought, and they seem to be better by 10 times just by merely glancing through them.

When it arrived, I was sadly disappointed. The book, although bright and colourful, is of little use. Most of the projects in the book require items specific to regions of the culture outlined (and relatively unavailable elsewhere), and often are things such as \\"buy this item and hang it like this\\". Other projects were quite campy and almost gaudy (the wrestlers' come to mind). Granted, I am in Canada, so perhaps I can't totally appreciate all it has to offer, but having studied Latin culture and interior design, I didn't feel this book correctly conveyed projects that were accessible to the average person. Furthermore, the common thread through the book was \\"be creative and make up your own stuff\\", albeit decent advice, one usually purchases a book in order to replicate projects or ideas outline with in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, not worth the price.","review":"This 12 can case arrived with 80% of cans dented and damaged.

This set is priced right and PERFECT for little hands. There are both natural and colored blocks. All have that wonderful feel of wood but are smaller than the blocks you usually think of from Kindergarden. They're perfect for my granddaughters to handle and the smaller size lets them build on their child-sized table instead of all over the floor. The set comes with a well-made canvas tote and all the blocks fit in BUT you need to actually PUT them in, not dump them willy-nilly. The 3 Yr old can carry the tote with not problem.

Those who have read Daniel Stern will wonder how Damasio can use his words--proto consciousness/self, core consciousness/self--without attribution and without making the connection to Stern's research with babies (late in the book--much too late for this reader--he mentions a visitor to their lab who implied the connection). Unlike Descartes' Error, here Damasio is muddy, particular in his use of the word \\"emotion\\" for what should more properly be called \\"affect\\" (see Tompkins and, especially, Nathanson, Shame and Pride). When writing about such complex ideas, clarity is a virtue, metaphor a plus--here we have neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damasio has become the \\"Dr Joyce Brothers\\"of Neurology","review":"What is most amazing about this book is the audacity of the author who willingly takes credit for the work, ideas, research, and theories of others. Damasio, however, has many friends, who are willing to go along with a wink and a nod, and write fabulous reviews about a truly inspid book written by a man who has never had an original thought. Some of these \\"friends\\" have a financial stake in his success, such as the New York Times--an organization which in fact created him as a celebrity in order to market him. This book represents more marketing hype and you will note in the wonderful reviews it has received, that not a single reviewer (i.e. friend of Damasio) can detail anything significant about this book other than to offer up platitudes. Yet, this book is about platitudes and is written by a man who has become the \\"Joyce Brothers of Neurology.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating!","review":"Reading this book took time, since I needed to mull over and internalize many of Damasio's points. At times, as I absorbed what he was saying, it felt like I was tripping. I have read many theories-of-consciousness books, and this is one of the best. For those of us whose minds haven't been closed by the PhD's after our names, Damasio's theories are exciting, and many of them can be verified by quietly looking inward into ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damasio's magical but realistic truth","review":"For general readers, Damasio articulates complicated information with interest and charm. For therapists, it is a must in order to understand critical concepts in therapy and sort out differences in feeling and thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I studied the topic of consciousness for a biopsychology course, and this book served as my main resource. I enjoyed Damasio's model of consciousness, but it was a painful read. He regularly uses ineffective analogies to classical music and other high-brow topics. Worse, he stretches the information out over 400 pages, despite having written a 25-page review article on the very same subjects. Save yourself a lot of time, and just read that article:Parvizi J., Damasio A. Consciousness and the brainstem (2001) Cognition, 79 (1-2), pp. 135-160."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overstated -- Don't waste your time or money","review":"This book is a mish-mash of introductory neuroscience, pseudo-philosophy and grand ideas that sum up to little more than another overstated work on consciousness. Unlike in his first book, \\"Decartes Error,\\" Damasio writes with a grandiose and imprecise style leading the reader to believe that little more than speculation supports his points. If you are really curious to read this because everyone you know is talking about it, then check it out from the library. But do yourself the favor of spending money to buy it because in 5 months when the hoopla has died, reading this book will not even be useful for conversation at cocktail parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Wine in Old Skins","review":"Everybody knows that Damasio is brilliant, just ask him. His most recent book has many interesting ideas, but this particular volume counts heavily on previously recorded case histories of his (as far back as the early 80s) and other peoples work (as far back as the 19th century) for which he takes too much contemporary credit. 75% of content is already known to neuroscientists. The writing is too convoluted to be readable by my mother-in-law. Non-neuroscientists with BA degrees or higher and a philosophical inclination are likely to like the book best."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful compilation of poems with deep spiritual impact!","review":"This is a book that more Christians should read.

Tozer has given us quite a gift in this little volume. He has chosen these poems on two criteria: first, beauty, and Tozer is a fine judge of lyrical beauty. Second, he states that those chosen must be those that knew God in a deeply personal (not simply religious or intellectual) way.I am especially thankful that this volume introduced me to the wonderful verse of Gerhard Tersteegen, a German layman of the early 1700's. For some reason, his poems resonate deeply with my soul. An example:Let Him lead thee blindfold onwards,Love needs not to know;Children whom the Father leadethAsk not where they go.Though the path be all unknownOver moors and mountains lone.Give no ear to reason's questions;Let the blind man holdThat the sun is but a fableMen believed of old.At the breast the babe will grow;Whence the milk he need not know.I only wish this volume had included some poems from George Herbert.

Now when I read some people saying it burned I thought they crazy and being over dramatic. I thought \\"How can nail polish burn your nails?\\" And it didn't burn my nails but I guess I got a little on my finger and OMG!!!!! After a few seconds I realized that my finger was burning.

Noticed red marks on the nail bed almost like the skin underneath was getting a chemical burn or something. I could not tolerate this product. A few days later I tried it as just a topcoat over normal polish, thinking my nails were just too thin from acrylic damage. Same reaction; about 5 min later intense burning began. Maybe it was because my nails were damaged from the acrylics, but isn't that what this is advertised for? Since my experience, I have read other reviews of others having the same experience.

Well, I suppose Griffin had a good excuse, as he did a little gigging from coast to coast, and played several months with some guy named Monk at the Five Spot. Anyway, \\"The Little Giant\\" was worth the wait. Griffin again employs a sextet for this date -- Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Julian Priester on trombone, Wynton Kelly on piano, Sam Jones on bass and \\"Tootie\\" Heath on drums. This time, however, the formula doesn't quite reach the dizzying heights of \\"Sextet,\\" though the disc does feature some very nice original compositions by a virtually unknown Chicago pianist named Norman Simmons (\\"Olive Refractions,\\" \\"The Message,\\" and \\"Venus and the Moon\\").

Their website says this may happen and to gently shake the piano upside down to fix. We did that. The keys unstuck... until they were pushed down again. It's a shame, really, because it was such a cute little piano, and our son never got to play it even once. I feel that the company is a little misleading. The products are made in China, but with the website emphasis on German engineering and mentioning a Florida factory, we thought we were getting a U.S. manufactured product made of German parts. Clearly, the company has little control over the quality of their end products. We paid the $15 return shipping, 10% restocking fee (OUCH!) and promptly returned this piano.

Unfortunately, it's really off-key and painful to listen to - think horror movie sounds if you try playing a nursery rhyme on it.

He likes to \\"play\\" a duet with me.The piano was delivered promptly and damage free. On the plus side, the piano seemed to be well tuned plus two full octaves of full size keys should make for a playable toy piano.On the down side I did not like the \\"feel\\" of the keys but I am used to a real piano. The big disappointment was the noise made by the keys themselves. When pressed, even lightly, the keys made a loud thunk. Louder, in fact, than the tone produced by the steel rod (no strings used here). From my perspective, the key noise made the piano impossible to play.Fortunately for me I was able to return the piano to the local retailer thus I did not have to spend $15 to ship it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke","review":"It arrived broken, we returned it. Didn't ask for a replacement. It may have been a one-time thing...I read tons of positive reviews (which is why I bought it), so perhaps it was just a fluke.Basically the keys on one side were completely loose so they didn't make any noise at all, and the keys at the other end were 'stuck' in the up position so you couldn't press them down. Keys in the middle worked fine and made a good sound. My bf is a musician and wanted an authentic toy piano sound, he was really disappointed but we didn't want it bad enough to try a 2nd time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"We got it for our 20-month old daughter for Christmas this year.

When it arrived, one note was out of tune so I returned it - it was painful to listen to. Otherwise the piano looked nice and seemed sturdy, so I ordered the piano again. This time there were several keys that were slightly out of tune, but we thought it was good enough given it is intended for young kids. Then we discovered the song book and color strip were missing, so I had to return it again. This time I didn't bother to reorder it. The other thing I take issue with, is that Schoenhut makes a big deal about German music rods, it's long history and traditional manufacturing techniques. Their website has a section on it's factory in Florida, but the pianos are made in China and the company clearly doesn't have its quality under control. I don't have a problem buying Chinese products in general, but I think Schoenhut is misleading its customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice little piano","review":"My 2 year old daughter received this piano for Christmas, and she loves it!

Not sure if we caused this or if it actually arrived that way since I didn't play it right away, granted, it's a kid's toy and not a recital piano, but still - it's a little diappointing to play a tune and have it not sound exactly right!

The scent is hard to describe, it is very mild and does not stay on the skin. Perhaps a very light honey and floral scent? The lather rinses clean as advertised. Afterward the skin feels fresh and moisturized--but I still need moisturizer afterwards.Complete Body Wash is a high quality, mild shower gel which I recommend for dry skin.

My wife thinks it was, but I'm not so sure.

The volume has to be set very low or we can't sleep with the loud hiss, and we're just in the next room down the hall; it's basically unusable at this point.

So now it has to be hooked to electricity to avoid that problem.Plus, the baby's room is on the other side of the house from mine.

We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up.

We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"still looking for the right one","review":"I thought I'd try this monitor since it was a 900Mhz and had a far range. Well, I have problems similar to Sara's. When I used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps, I would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used. When there was no beeping or loss of signal it's reception was clear. That's why I gave it a 2nd star. This product is going back to the store tomorrow and I will continue my quest to search for the right monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but beeping and Static","review":"I wish I saved the packaging for this item because I would return it in an instant. I am a mother of three and unfortunately the monitor that I had been using for over 7 years died on us. We thought this Evenflo would be a great monitor offering a wide range, so I can work in the garden while my baby sleeps.....but the monitor beeps (out of range signal) while I am standing outside my sons window! It beeps (very annoying sound) when someone walks by! In our house we have a wireless internet connection, and cordless phones (900Mhz) we unplugged both to see if that might be causing the problem but the static and noise still remained. We did the usual check of veryifying channels on both devices as well as power. Not a good product at all. You can be sure the manufacturer will be hearing from me.

It weighs a freakin' ton and needs to be put on a table (instead of your lap) to look at. Totally impractical. Additionally, the photos for the most part aren't all that great. Information is minimal. What irritates me most is each country's skeletal map which doesn't show it's relationship to the rest of the world. Oh sure, you can go back to map of the world at the front of the book and read thru all the tiny names to find the country you are looking at, but you'll probably fracture your arm in the process. Individual maps could at least have shown the country within it's continent or region.

I read the reviews and have taken not of the feet being plastic. So I have taken the trouble to get wooden bun furniture feet and the plates to mount them. They are on the bottom of the combi-cube.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting EarthChild","review":"I read this book for the first time in 1984, just before I turned 13. Revisiting it in 2010 at the age of 39 provided an interesting contrast between the two readings. The memory of this short novel has haunted me for years, and I have often considered the dilemma that it presents: whether to choose an immortality of one's body or of one's art.A pleasant surprise of rereading this book was that it wasn't \\"dated\\" by a firm anchoring in a specific year. I remembered that this book seemed to be set in the 21st century, but the exact year wasn't clear to me; it still isn't. The novel's political overtones were not as clear to me in 1984 as they were in 2010: one-world government, unilateral decisions about public health (the Mouat-Gari Process implementation specifically).What I found refreshing was that technology was not depicted as a panacea. In fact, technological progress evoked a lingering sadness for what humanity lost in the bargain for physical immortality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"When I told my friends that I was reading a book about loving my belly, they all snorted. It seems that no one likes, much less loves, their bellies. The Woman's Belly Book is more about honoring your creative power center. Using breathing techniques, visualizations and art therapy, the reader is led through the process of discovering your secret treasure. Just using her belly dialogue techiniques, I feel more connected to my inner strength. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belly-licious!","review":"This morning when my alarm went off I JUMPED out of bed... eager to do Lisa's belly \\"workout\\". It's that good! I absolutely love the way I feel after moving through the gentle rhythms...I feel deeply connected to myself with all the gaps filled in...I feel centered, whole and filled with Self. Lisa's teaching of connecting breath to belly to body is grounded, real and powerful. I highly recommend her work to anyone who is working to heal body image, self esteem or disordered eating issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this book","review":"This book is the most ridiculous book I have ever bought or read.

It was a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Magical!","review":"This book is a heartwarming mix of the magical and the practical. The section \\"Lessons from the Furry Buddhas\\" was really great. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What We Lose","review":"I may be wrong, but I suspect Ms. Berg was not abandoned by either of her parents. This story is a perfect example of what happens when you try to write about what you don't know. Lack of insight, credibility, and originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel of Emotional Truth","review":"Elizabeth Berg has spun a tale so compelling and full of emotion. What We Keep is the story of mothers and daughters, distant yet close. Berg examines the mother-daughter relationship and it impacts every faucet of life.Berg dedicates the novel to women who risk telling the truth. This is a very strong statement that one can only fully contemplate as they finish What We Keep.We meet Ginny as she is flying to meet her mother that she has not seen for 35 years. As we travel with Ginny the reader gets to day dream with her as she recollects her time with her mother and the impact that her leaving has had on her life. The novel is narrated by both present day Ginny and Ginny at 12 years old as she relives the summer that changed her life.A great literary talent, Berg is an author that does not disappoint. What We Keep is a compelling novel that will have you anxiously turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Take","review":"I usually enjoy reading EB's books as I find them insightful, humorous and easy to read in a leisurely fashion. I've read quite a few of the reviews of this book and have a completely different take. If I'd managed to raise two selfish, self-centered monsters who insisted their mother wait on them hand and foot, I'd be like Marion and lament going astray in parenting skills. How anyone could have compassion for these little manipulative twits is beyond me and only wonder why Marion didn't bail sooner. Not only are Ginny and Sharla obnoxious pieces of work, dear old dad is a major loser. Stiff, cold, inflexible, that's dad. I'd rather hang out with Marion than any of these other characters. I'll continue to read EB's books and hope they're more believable than this offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"What We Keep","review":"I sat down one afternoon and finished it the next day! What a wonderful story! The author was great at flashing back. I felt as though I was sharing the room with the sisters. I could see the house they lived in and taste the French toast for breakfast. The twists made the book a page turner. I was a little surprised at the end but glad at the same time. I would read more of Berg's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest Berg entry by far","review":"I've read all of Elizabeth Berg's books to date and found this one to be a disappointment. The characters were thinly drawn, especially the father. The scenes and dialog were just repetitions of each other, dragging out the obvious conclusion. Her previous books made you feel you knew the characters intimately, in particular \\"Range of Motion\\" and \\"Durable Goods\\"/\\"Joy School\\". In this book, you just end up frustrated as everyone tends to let everything \\"just happen.\\"Since you know from the beginning of the book that Ginny and Sharla haven't seen their mother in 35 years, Ms. Berg's challenge is to create understanding and empathy in the reader. Unfortunately, she does not pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wants to read about a mother abandoning her daugthers?","review":"And feel bad in the process? Not me! As a previous poster mentioned there is no real lesson to be learned here. Bad choices are made, and you get to feel melancholic throughout. I'll be glad when this book is out of my house.For a happy read with the right values, I'd recommend The Number one Lady Detective Agency, by Alexander Mcall Smith. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Berg's Best (and that's saying a lot!)","review":"I am also surprised to see any negative reviews on this book. I have read all of Berg's books and this is one of my favorites. I love the sister relationship, and found the book a very realistic and touching portrayal of the way women, sisters, mothers/daughters relate. I read it when it was first published and the characters and insights are still fresh in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't readily give out 5 stars but...","review":"I really liked this book. Being the second child, with an older sister I thought this author perfectly captured the essence of that relationship! It was funny in places to the point that I laughed out loud. The book was also sad and thought provoking. I think especially mothers will understand this book on a deeper level. Read it - it's great. I took it out from the library, but I wish I had bought it because I'd like to share it with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story","review":"Elizabeth Berg is one of my most favorite authors. This story was very poignant and I believe to be one of her best. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unenlightened","review":"This book left much to be desired. The storyline wasn't great, and the main character was unsympathetic and unlikeable. The only reason I finished it in spite of this was that Berg has a beautiful way with words. I liked the way she put words together to create a particular feel or image, and look forward to seeing if she has anything better out there than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Keeper","review":"I don't typically read mainstream fiction, but I'm glad I picked up this book. In the present tense, a 47 year old woman starts out on a plane trip to see her mother - she hasn't seen her in 35 years, since she was 12. It flashes back and forth to that eventful summer when she was 12 and her whole life changed and her trip now. Very smart work. If you like shows like State of Grace or The Wonder Years, or books like The Virgin Suicides or Beaches, you'll like this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What We Keep by E. Berg","review":"This book was the August selection for our book group. It was liked by the majority. The narrative by the twelve year old character was realistic and touching. The relationships that developed were interesting and revealing. The end of the book did leave us thinking that the character may have been less than complete. We did find it easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and wonderfully descriptive -- draws you in","review":"Ms. Berg does a wonderful job in spanning the distance between youthful perception and adult reality. She moves the main character's (Ginny's ) thoughts seamlessly from those of a worried adult traveler back to memories from her youth. The descriptions and sensations ring true and are vividly relayed. The outright trust young Ginny has in her universe, her sense of betrayal by her mother, the strength of the sibling relationship, and even the youthful misinterpretations are well woven into this sad but oddly uplifting story.After this read, my first Berg novel, I am looking to pick up another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"youth makes us see things that are not really there","review":"This book gives a good example of how the world looks through a child's eyes. It also shows that as we mature, we still do not always understand what was really happening during our childhood. Ginny lived for 35 years still believing that her mother was completely responsible for her parents divorce, when really her father was as much to blame. I found What We Keep to be interesting throughout, and not as predictable as I thought. An important lesson is learned; it is never too late to reconcile with a loved one, you may be just as wrong as you believe the other person to be. I enjoyed this book, even though it is not action-packed. I would encourage everyone to give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mothers and Daughters..","review":"are so special. This book has everything in it to satisfy the literary soul. Childhood romance, heartache, sisters relationships, fathers and daughters, friendships and more. I love books where things aren't what they seem and also has important life lessons. This is my first Berg book, and I look forward to more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"Another good story with interesting characters and a tough topic to deal with: childhood abandonment."},{"rating":"2","title":"BERG WRITES BEAUTIFULLY","review":"I am an avid fan of Berg, and in \\"What We Keep\\" she enhances my devotion to her expert writing.The tale explores motherhood, the bond of mothers and daughters, lost dreams, revengeful isolation, and reconcilation. Written with clarity of characters, impressive descriptions, heart-rendingly believable situations, this is a must read. The ending bares some unrealistic traits, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.Tori Amos's lyrics begin the book, and after the read they will haunt you. I can only wonder how much the lyrics birthed the book, but it is of no matter. The book delivers on nearly all counts. Well done, Ms. Berg, one of my new favorite author's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks...Great read","review":"The sibling encounters, childhood dilemmas and unique thoughts in particular. Also, I didn't realize until the end that I was also drawn into the storyline. I'm awaiting your next! I have read most of E. Berg's novels and have enjoyed them all. In her latest, I found myself drawn into the characters and their feelings on so many levels.I realy like the stories you must know these titles:A Strange DisappearanceThe Circular Study: By the woman who inspired Agatha Christie!The Chief LegateeThe Filigree Ball: By the woman who inspired Agatha Christie!The Woman in the Alcove"},{"rating":"2","title":"This wasn't supposed to be literary hugs and kisses","review":"This is my first and only book read by Elizabeth Berg so far and I enjoyed this book a lot. The ending is a bit abrupt, but people like resolution, I guess. It's unfortunate that some people were expecting the same from EB, which I believe would be a huge sign that the author isn't creative and/or is in a rut. She could really take me back to her childhood and EB capturing the sisterly bond between Ginny and Sharla was a nice read. I read this novel in a women's lit class in college and approached it from a feminist standpoint. The dad wasn't the greatest by any means, but consider what time period this was written for. Martha, the woman seated next to her on the plane, notes to Ginny that \\"people like 'differentness' in everything except their mothers.\\" If you approach the novel like that, you can empathize with both sides of the story and makes for a much more interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is my favorite!","review":"I've read nearly all of EB's books and i found this one to be my favorite so far. I felt like I was living in the house with Sharla and Ginny and could picture Marion and Georgia so clearly.

I didn't really know what to expect from this book, but I couldn't put it down.Having had a slightly upended childhood, due to my parents' divorce and numerous remarriages, this book really touched me. I have to say that I look at my family history with a more balanced eye after reading \\"What We Keep.\\" A child had a certain perception of how things happened, and is quick to create a cast of heroes and villans. But appearances can be deceiving and the ending to this book really drives that point home.Definitely a worthwhile read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A NIce Story.....","review":"I thought this was a cute, sad story. I thought it was emotional because the mother left the girls, but with Berg being such a good writer, she also made it funny & bright. I am guessing that it took the dark, mysterious neighbor to move in & befriend the mother to make the mother realize that she needed to pursue her goals as well, even though it turned out the neighbor was on the run from a rich, abusive, powerful spouse. Berg could have almost left that character out. Anyway, I thought it was cute - I loved the 'wedding & marriage vows' between 'Wild Bill Cody' and \\"Ave Maria' ~ priceless! Even if pain is caused, all must be forgiven."},{"rating":"1","title":"rating should be -20","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.

Just too small for a NikonD90 with 18-200mm lens and external flash. It all fits, but I think it will be too hard to pull it out and put it back on the fly. Also, I don't see my wife putting everything back the exact right way to make it all fit. Therefore, I think it is too close for comfort.I am returning this and ordering the 5m home.

It would go in and out easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I bought this, because I didn't want to carry my Lowepro Slingshot 100 everywhere - just needed something to hold my camera (Nikon D80) and a few accessories. I can fit a speedlight in here as well with the camera, but that is pretty much it (other than mem cards, cloths, remote, small wallet and other tiny items). If you are looking to carry around your camera and a lens, go at least one more bag up.Another reason I love this bag is because it fits nicely into any of my large purses when I want to carry around my camera, but have it protected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bag if you need something small","review":"This bag is constructed with high quality materials.

Brody is not writing for that seafood afficianado. Instead, she's touting the pleasures of seafood to the uninitiated--a role she also held before researching this book.

Although she is well-read and brings a wide variety of authors and philosophers into her argument, too much of her research is simplistic and superficial (a few letters from women's magazines do not make a very solid argument). Her basic point may be worthwhile (after all who wants to see 13 year olds dressed like sluts?), but the execution nearly defeats its validity. It's too bad she didn't speak to more women who grew up before the sexual revolution, when date raped happened but simply wasn't reported and when girls who accidentally got pregnant had to quickly marry or face ostracism. I don't know about you, but I don't want to go back to the 1950s (let alone the 19th century) - my guess is that Shalit wouldn't want to either, if she knew what it was really like for women then."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work worthy of praise","review":"Miss Shalit has written a truly thought provoking book.

It changed the way I looked at things and it gave me pride in the fact that I am a woman. Wendy Shalit reveals controversial issues around femininity and why women are the way they are. I read this book right after a tumultuous time as a college Freshman. At that time, I did not even know why I acted the way I did. After reading her book, I figured out how the treatment of women prompted me in my reckless behavior and, also, that I did not need to feel guilty for it.. I just needed to take a step back and learn from my mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Read But Lacking","review":"Found the book intersting but lacking in real discussion.

Although it is organized, Shalit's prose is right out of 90210 and her attempts at humor wretched. I could go further but the book isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it one sided?","review":"The thing that gets to me the most is that Shalit believes that a return to modesty by women will correct all these wrongs in today's society. It is not a return to modesty she really desires, but a re-instatement of virtue. This cannot happen simply by wrapping women up in unrevealing clothes, but instead requires the education of MEN and the changing of MALE ideals. Too much concentration on what is wrong with women ignores the more important factor of the other sex. Miss Shalit also does not have the worldly experience to have a grounded opinion. Regardless of her young age, she appears to have never challenged her own views. If she had, she may have been able to make a more convincing and well rounded argument. As it is, she is simply regurgitating information she has gathered that explicitly supports her purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This book should be required reading for all young women.

She takes many legitimate complaints from women concerning sexual harrassment, and uses them to bolster her argument that sex ed is at the root of their complaints. The book is well written and a good read but Ms Shalit needs to realize that one cannot alter facts to fit an agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if you are female and have no desire to have rights.","review":"After many years of women giving their lifeblood to obtain equal rights, this author dismisses everything they had worked to achieve with a swift touch of the pen.

After seeing her on C-span, I was impressed with how articulate she is but not with what she or her book has to say. Although it is IN THEORY a viable and interesting idea it promotes the sexual guilt that women in all religions have had to bear throughout history. As stated before, the way a woman dresses and conducts herself has nothing to do with date rape or rape. Rape is about power. Similarly eating disorders have less to do with body image than they do with control. Ms. Shalit should not be considered a modern feminist because her ideas are distinctly old fashioned. While I find nothing wrong with old fashioned ideals I have to remember that they obviously didn't work then, because here we are. Shalit also doesn't support birth control and sex education, and I have to wonder how much worse off we would be today, without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women regret too much.","review":"You are not a prude if you are modest.

Everybody, buy and read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilariously self-congratulatory","review":"Now that no one reads Katie Roiphe or Elizabeth Wurtzel anymore the geniuses behind the bookselling business produce us the flip side of the coin: another smug and overprivileged young woman who thinks her shallow life experiences in elite schools qualifies her to make vast generalizations about American sexual culture. The only difference is that Shalit is attacking female promiscuity rather than praising it. Her self-congratulatory prose--particularly at the book's beginning--makes A RETURN TO MODESTY something of a camp classic (that title alone!).Here's a tip: if you're really interested in current sexual politics or in women and sexuality, try reading something by someone over thirty who has actually done some reading and research and who has spoken to women outside her immediate peer group and economic class. Shalit, like Roiphe and Wurtzel, is pretty thin stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive and boring","review":"Shalit's premise would be interesting if she knew how to defend it. She doesn't.

Reviewers give us some idea: born into academia, educated in a liberal arts ivory tower, and sprung fresh into the world, a fully grown messiah of a new feminism. Ms. Shalit's writing reflects her background: she reads texts well, and people badly. Her commentary on film and on intellectual debate, conservative and feminist alike, is extraordinarily sharp. However, when Ms. Shalit speaks of \\"women\\" and \\"men,\\" the abstractions she summons forth bear very little relation to the women and men I know. It's ironic that this neo-con prodigy, set to tear down the 60s and post-everything (feminism, modernism, etc.), is really, in the final tally, nothing more than a talented literary critic."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate reminder","review":"The fact that so many American women responded positively to this book is a sad reminder to this feminist: there are a lot of morons out there, and some of them are women."},{"rating":"1","title":"a return to man-pleasing ways.","review":"Get out your thumb-thick sticks, men, I guess you were right to begin with.

All of my files were preserved - I just deleted all the old software and operating files and kept all my documents, spreadsheets, etc. Now I work at home, save to my Cintre Z and take that to work with me, connect to my work computer and that's it.

The 'big tune' is Koochy which is the first four notes of Gary Numan's Cars repeated over and over and over again for a mind numbing 9 minutes. If it sampled a little more of Cars, it might have been ok, but... Continuing this trend is Flyaway Love, which repeats the song title for around 8 minutes and has a standard disco loop behind it. Full Moon is dire, it's very Will Smith-ish, and the the albums grand finale consists of the usual house beats with four notes over it repeated over and over until you turn it off in embarrassment (I held out for 9 minutes). I wish I could bring it back to Fish records, but that's not their policy.

This one is no exception. I chose the folding option (vs flicking models) because I've had flicking ones get sand and crap in them that make them not come out as smoothly. The item is heavy and solid, and everything works exactly as you'd expect it to.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the phillips head screwdriver is a little flatter than I'd like to see. What I mean by that is it's more of a flathead with two very small bumps on either side of it. It works for sharp, fresh screws without any issue, but it would clearly be useless against any screw that has begun to strip.Other than that, I'm very happy with the product, and for the price I doubt you'll find a better multi-tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspension plier-multitool","review":"a really excellent type of multi-tool,the one lacking item is the phillips head screwdriver,that type of blade has to be one of the lamest attempts i have ever seen. the pouch isin't to bad but the velcro closure won't have a long life span."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"I bought this tool recently and really like it.

I lost it while camping a while back and have missed it since. I went for this Suspension because of its price and thought that since it was a Gerber it would be fine. The tool looks like it should have rejected at the factory, when closed the handles are not even and it it very hard to open. The screws that hold the tool together have burs all over them and one of them is countersunk while the rest are above the surface. The straight blade is very hard to open with the thumb stud. And the sheath is falling apart after only a week. The tool was under $30 so I guess you get what you pay for, but Gerber should be ashamed for putting their name on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"New 2011 Leatherman tools totally trump this","review":"I originally bought this tool while looking for a multitool that incorporated a good selection of tools as well as spring-loaded pliers. Normally, I stay in the Leatherman camp, but they didn't make any full-size tools with pliers. The day I received this tool, the first thing I noticed was how fat and stubby it was, and the tools were quite short as well. I was planning on coping with it until I decided to check the Leatherman website, and lo and behold, here were new tools incorporating spring-loaded pliers! The Sidekick and Wingman both have Leatherman quality, good-size (but minimalist) tools, and spring-loaded pliers. I heavily suggest one of those two (I have the Wingman) over the Suspension I returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as a leatherman","review":"This is an excellent multitool. I've carried a Leatherman Blast for years and this has replaced it. All the tools are accessible without opening the pliers, which is a perk.

The locking mechanism is crap. Once the side tools (knife, scissor, can opener etc.) are locked, good luck trying to close it again. Theres two buttons your suppose to push down while putting pressure on the spine so the tools will fold back down but the force required to do that is beyond what your hands can handle. I actually had to use a second multi-tool to collapse this one. Just looking at the quality of this and you know its suspicious, the metal is dull and rough, theres lots of little dents and divits and rough patches. I was convinced that I bought a fake, but I purchased it from L.L Bean whom I know stand by quality and wouldn't be caught dead selling something as poor as this.

The screwdrivers, both blade and Philips, are constructed of high quality steel and have already held up to some heavy jobs. One of the decisive reasons for my purchase was Gerber's blade and tool lock mechanism - it works and makes this tool much safer than others in my arsenal.

When I encountered a particular stubborn piece of metal, and it wouldn't give, I had to crank extra hard. Instead of the piece I was working on bending, the Gerber tool broke! One of the small metal retaining pieces that prevents the plier handles from collapsing bent under the pressure of my hand.Folks, I'm not that strong. I wasn't applying some superhuman amount of strength to the tool. Nevertheless, it still broke under the strain of me gripping it extra hard.

It is roughly a third the price of a similar Leatherman. The quality is excellent and it has all the tools you would want in a multi-tool. The size is perfect and handle comfortable. Some people have said the scissors lack a little. My thought is you are using them to trim a thread or cut a bandage in an emergency. If you want to sew a suit, use a real pair of scissors. The same for the saw, sure it is alittle small, but it works in pinch with reasonable expectations. The only tool I slightly missed was a file. All in all, the tools all work excellent and overall the tool is great value if you remember it's \\"A jack of all trades and master of none\\"!

It's bulky and cumbersome, the included belt pouch fell apart quickly and it began to rust (although not too dramatically) within the first month or two of ownership. The phillips screwdriver head is oddly shaped and not very usable and the blades are small and low quality for a tool of this heft/size. I will say, the tool itself is well made and durable other than the bit of rust that doesn't really deter from usability, but I certainly wouldn't recomend it for someone looking for a tool to meet all of there day to day needs (I work as an audio engineer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with the Suspension","review":"Maybe I abuse (or just use) my tools more than the other reviewers, but I've gone through 3 of these Suspensions in 4 months.

No kidding.2 weeks ago, cutting steel wire with it using just my hands (no special leverage) and broke the plier jaw again.The material is not steel, some cast aluminum alloy that is not strong enough for the intended use.Very disappointed in Gerber for putting this piece of junk on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I own a number of \\"belt tools\\" and use them every day.

I contacted Gerber and was told to send it to them for inspection. They want to see if it was abused. Not worth the postage as this tool is just not worth it. The \\"phillips screwdriver\\" is useless on most screws. Stick to Leatherman or even a Swiss army knife (Great phillips and saw blade).

I use it all the time for everything from cutting off stray strings and such with the scissors, opening packages, unscrewing or screwing all sorts of things with the additional optional tool kit to simply filing down a finger nail or two.

I broke the larger flat head in half and the smaller flat head blade was cracked. Granted it took me five years to break it, but three of those years I hardly used it.Don't get me wrong, it was great while I had it and the main reason I bought it was because of the handle design when the pliers are deployed.

It is not durable at all. The belt loop came out, so I turned it sideways, and eventually those straps came out too. In addition, the little grips for the knife kept catching on the pouch when I tried to take it out, but other times the Velcro would come undone and the multi tool would drop out. Luckily the tool is weighty so I heard it hit the ground. In the end I ended up having to buy a universal cell phone case from Meijer, which, sad to say, has worked MUCH better than the pouch.BUT DON\\"T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM BUYING IT.

The 2 parts of the plier did not match up at the tip, something like 1-2 mm apart. Many of the tools are extremely hard to get out of the handle and the spring securing mechanism is hard to operate. This Gerber may be worth the $29 dollars but it was supposed to be used in case of emergency (in the car) by my wife and i could see that this was not a tool she would be happy with.

Besides it being a bit tricky to reinsert the discs into the slots in the foam, the material can scratch the discs, as well as coating them with dust that can cause playback problems.If I'd known that in advance, I wouldn't have bought Seasons 1 & 2. I won't be buying Season 3 (if it ever comes out) unless the problem is fixed ... but I would actually consider buying a replacement for Seasons 1 & 2 if it were repackaged.The reason I only gave it two stars was sentirely due to the packaging. Unfair to a show that was so entertaining and occasionally thought-provoking. Well, what can you expect for a series that was so badly treated when it was on the air?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliders is back","review":"I couldn't believe my friend when he told me that a sliders DVD was coming out. The first two seasons of sliders are the best by far with Quinn, Remmy, Wade, and of course the Professor. This cast worked perfectly together. It was very hard to see the professor and Wade leave as the seasons went on because the four of them made the show what is was when it was on FOX. Yes, do you remember that, the show started out on FOX.This DVD is definately worth your money. Hopefully in the near future we could see a movie out of this with the original cast. Keep up the support for Sliders!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slide into amazement!","review":"Even if you don't like sci-fi, you will probably like this show. In fact, the only real sci-fi aspects of it are the sliding between dimensions, and the occasional thing the heroes need to escape. The rest is pure social commentary, and so far I've already gotten one friend hooked on it. This is intelligent fiction at its finest, and it's a real shame that it went downhill (more like off a cliff) after the second season. My only complaint is that the episodes are shown out of order here; of course, FOX aired them out of order, so that's to be expected. Ladies and gentlemen, do NOT pass this one up, it's a trip around the universe that you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"This was a great show and paved the way for many of the sci-fi shows that are on now.

The dvds are in a piece of foam with slits cut into it. Someone cut corners to make this cheaper. If you can find this new or used for a cheaper price then go ahead. It is not worth over $15 IMO.I liked the first few seasons of this show. If it wasn't for the cheap packaging this would have gotten a higher rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out okay but jumped the shark early","review":"This started out as a fairly entertaining show, with plenty of humor, as befits its premise. But by the middle of the second season, it started taking itself WAY too seriously. In fact, it became downright dystopian, with an emphasize on violence and darkness. If there are limitless parallel worlds, it's hard to believe all of them are awful compared to this one! I finally gave up about episode 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliding Back with Friends.","review":"The first two seasons of Sliders showed a great deal of promise. The actors were just fleshing out their characters and the relationships were being developed. Sliders was never as grim a series as Stargate SG-1 and unlike Quantum Leap, having multiple characters made it possible for a variety of storylines to take place. I really liked the boxed set and although I would've preferred more special features and commentary from Sabrina Lloyd and John Rhys Davies it's a great value.

I had the opportunity to tape the pilot and the first few shows when they were reruns. But they stopped showing it or I'm just not home in time to watch. Sliders was always my ALL-TIME favorite mini-series. I was heartbroken when they took it off the air on the regular station. The only problem with VHS though, if your VCR breaks, you can't watch any more movies. Well, I do have a DVD player. Out with the old and in with the new high-tech stuff.

They said that the show was going to appear on DVD 2 years ago, and since then I thought that entire idea had been trashed. I'm super excited that the series is finally getting some recognition and with the release of seasons 1 and 2 on DVD this is just another step closer for Sliders fans and entertainment.Seasons one and two were amazing. Not only was it the best becuase of the four main and original characters, but because the writing and the adventures were better. Something new and interesting happened with the Sliders crew in every episode in seasons 1 and 2. You definately have to get it on DVD when it comes out on August 3rd!Maybe they will reinstate the idea for a Sliders movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sliders a great sci fi series","review":"i brought this yesterday for about 20 dollars it was nice to finally see this again, because i remembered watching it and i think it was a wonderful series and would love to purchase all the seasons as they come out. weither you like the cast changes are not if you like the show as much as i do, that shouldn't matter. if you claim to like the show. the packaging is to be desire unlike other shows with have cases for the disk but if you overlooked that and see the show that you enjoyed i wouldnt worry about that, now if it is where it may possibly hurt the discs get something to put them in. thanks for a great show"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh?","review":"This show had great potential.

It is weird enough to simply put the discs into a dubious soft plastic cut-out block. Who would not be concerned that such material might scratch or even chemically deteriorate the disc surfaces (similar stuff used in CD boxes probably did). Even if it will not: who can give a guarantee.So it certainly would seem to be a good idea if you put the discs into amaray cases. But here the ultimate lunacy triumphs: the box is ever so slightly less high than these are, so they won't fit.Universal might not even have chosen that idiot box out of cheapishness because its production may well be more expensive than a solid one. They should better have put a booklet in it instead of that glued-to-the-box mini-folder.Is there a punishment for designers out of their mind or executives who allow them to live out their creative irresponsibilities and failures? Only in an alternative better dimension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show! but what's with the box?","review":"I'll agree with the majority of the reviewers here...the show was entertaining, but slid as time went on. My only gripe with the Season 1-2 boxset is the packaging. Yes, it looks really nice sitting on your shelf. Getting to your discs for viewing and putting them away makes one wish they had the ability to send the designer to an alternate universe! First, there's a cheap foam insert with slots cut into it that the discs slide into. Gee, what better way to scratch a disc. Get a little dirt in there, and it'll be worse than one of those cd books at destroying the disc. Then, there's a clear plastic cover that you're supposed to remove to gain access to the discs. Once I fought to get this off, it never did fit back together as it kept hanging up on the foam. After experiencing this once, I immediately got online and ordered a six disc dvd box to put my set in."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great show!","review":"This show was great for the first few seasons.

In this season, we see the origins of the sliders, as Quinn, a young genius, invents the timer, and slides out of our reality and into another. Accompanying him are a group of friends, including his girlfriend, a musician, and a grouchy professor.I think some of the early episodes of Sliders are a little slow. But as the season progresses sliders really begins to hit its stride. I love the episode where they slide into the Matriarchal world, and the episode where S.F. is one big penal colony. The formula for this series really allows for infinite plotlines and possibilities.Since this is filmed in Canada, I had to suspend belief a tad when scenes which were obviously NOT filmed in S.F. were shown (no snow-topped peaks in this S.F. for instance), other than that, this is an excellent, excellent series well worth the investment.4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 3 of Sliders coming to DVD!","review":"I found some sources on the net which suggest that season-three of the hit show Sliders will be releasing on DVD on July 19, 2005 =] EXCELLENT!

I am watching them now and enjoing them even more. I have been studying leading edge theoretical physics for the last 5 years(Quantum theory, Relativity, Cosmology, String Theory, nuclear physics and astrophysics), therefore I am more understanding of the sliding concept and the technical language used occasionally during the show.

I finally just took it back and got my money back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle, bunch of junk","review":"Bought this for my eight year old for Christmas. Because it was pink and I figured it would be less likely to get lost since it clipped on things. It arrived non-functioning. I called Coby and spent 45 minutes on the phone with them. Sure enough, it was NOT an operator defect, the thing was junk. In order to replace it, I would have had to send it to them,, then when they received it they would send me a replacement. It was going to take 6 weeks. Forget it. I got a return code and sent the *%^$&% thing back to Amazon, who kindly refunded my money. Thank you, Amazon! I went out and bought a pink zen stone. THAT works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"By 2010 the laws have changed yet the core processes in this book are still helpful.

I did not realize how large it was however and I have a very small wrist. It would be helpful to have a size scale on the web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arm too small","review":"The plastic arm rest that sticks out is too small and short and the arrow keeps falling off. Do the people that make these things ever test them, sometimes I wonder. All they had to do was make the rest stick out a couple of millimeters more and it would be great product. So Bear Archery, re-do this and make it right."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-657db57e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/29.md","filePath":"guide/29.md"}'),R={name:"guide/29.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
