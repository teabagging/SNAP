It's one thing to want to present the gamer with a challenge, but I don't believe you can get through this game without a walkthrough and cheat sheet, and using one all the time is just plain annoying. It takes all the fun out of it. Furthermore, if I wanted to spend all my time learning symbols and equations, I'd go back to high school math class.

The classic line-up is here: Mani Neumeier - drums & vocals, Ax Genrich - guitar and Uli Trepte - bass. Four lengthy tracks, like a couple of their other early releases. \\"Electric Junk\\" (11:04) with a cool drum solo, \\"The Meaning Of Meaning\\" (12:16), their own version of \\"Bo Diddley\\" (10:03) and the floating brain damaging \\"Space Ship\\" (11:07) which may be the record's best cut.

And if you're experienced, then you'll be shaking your head at some of the stuff written. While there are some nice pictures, even that is organized badly because you have to flip about 10 pages over to see the picture of the plant being discussed. The plant profiles section is very short and almost useless, especially the \\"Similar plants\\" category, which is very inaccurate. And there's not one mention of Aponogetons, or some other very common aquarium plants. Save your money for something better. I bought this and returned it for a full refung 3 days later.

The songs on \\"Dance for the Sun\\" all have a great beat, but are kind of folky, and Kira's voice is beautiful and mellow. It is definitely kids music (because of the subjects and the kids on the CD), but all the adults who have heard it played in my house love it.

But attempting to look goth on the outside isn't as nearly as important as being goth inside, right down to your little black heart. Not all goths are easily spotted...we don't all dress in black constantly...we don't all hang out in graveyards and love Lestat.

If you're looking for a book that is more geared to teaching you as well as overviewing products, I suggest Hacking Linux Exposed or Real World Linux Security.

Each cadenza is given such exquisite freedom, the woodwinds particularly, that the solo musician can truly explore the glorious expression of Rimsky-Korsakov. Cadenzas in the Story of the Kalander Prince, the second movement, are so beautifully syncopated, patient here, passionate there, forceful there; so beautifully dynamic, quietly reliant on a single clear note or loud enough to where the instrument is abuzz with natural harmonics. And the final movement of the piece, Shipwreck, here Sir Thomas, more than any other conductor, lets the tapestry of music unravel until there is nothing left but this one last, long golden thread of solo violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ablaze with Color","review":"Years and years ago I came across Beecham's wonderful recording of Rimsky-Korsakov's most famous piece while listening to NPR.

The first time I heard it was while driving around on an autumn evening--the leaves the color of gold and flame.

I guess I expected too much and the literary context wasn't the best but then again the fictional stories in all the white wolf books usually upset me, by there lack of story telling.

However, some knowledge in math would certainly help...a first course in probability theory and some background in dynamical systems is a good idea (at the level of undergraduate courses in pure and applied sciences).All explanations are not rigorous but the objective is to provide a good intuition about the mechanisms driving complexity.

Kantorow's playing is much more smooth & fluid & natural than the others' halting/jerky style (example: compare the beginning of the Chaconne in each recording). He sounds like he just casually just picked up his violin & started playing, as opposed to other recordings which sounds tense and rushed. The sarabandes are extra slow & moving; the minor pieces are extra creepy/spooky; & the major pieces are extra happy/carefree, etc. I also like very much how the recording miked; it's not in-your-face close, nor does it sound like Kantorow is playing in a tiled bathroom. It's just right. I assume that this is a fairly obscure recording given that nobody has reviewed it yet, so I think it's far too under-listened-to.

I bought mine at [...], and the first one I bought had 3 cds that were very badly scratched. The second one seems to have a few scratches that don't look *too* bad - I'm hoping they're playable.Double sided dvds - great way to cheap out on manufacturing guys! Next time though, don't put them in cardboard sleeves, that when closed, cause the (double sided, remember) dvds to rub up against one another. Even if the disks manage to stay in place (HA!) they'll rub against each other and scratch that way.Looking closely at the disks themselves, they don't look very well made to begin with. The \\"silver\\" at the edges of the disks is very ragged, and the edges of the disks themselves aren't smooth.I've polished them up, and got them in protective sleeves now - here's hoping they actually play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Packaging","review":"This is a great story. I have watched it many times. It is great. I was glad to get all of these disks at one time. I was elated to get Roots and Roots 2 at the same time. We can't forget about what happened during those perilous times in our history. (And no, I am not related to the author nor have any connection with him. But if he ever wanted to give me his autograph, I would never turn it down.).Like other reviews, my score is not because of the story. I am not giving it a very high review because of the packaging. I couldn't believe when I opened the box, there were 7 DVDs just rubbing against each other and the DVDs almost looked used because of it. I could deal with about anything but that. The only, so called, protection to the discs, is the cardboard sleeves that don't hold the discs during transport.The other problem I had is that I couldn't get the captions to stay off on the original series. That was quite annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE COMPLETE MINI-SERIES","review":"I have the orginal series on VHS, and refuse to buy this DVD set, because it's not complete. I have heard, and read that there are parts missing (Especially from the Roots Collection) Don't waste your time.

I was not expecting a teaching manual just the story of a teacher told with McCourt's wit he had shown in the previous books. Unfalteringly Teacher Man is not witty. It comes across as a drunken rant with few original or interesting stories, and as though the publisher was pushing for another book so McCourt just rehashed some earlier work and threw it together.If I had to sum up the book in one word it would be disdain. McCourt writes with disdain for anything and everything, including himself, but most of all disdain for the reader. A big let down after the first two.- A twenty-something woman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teacher Man: A Memoir","review":"Don't waste your money or your time on this book. While Mr. McCourt's first two books were wonderful, this one is just depressing. If you really want to read it, go to your public library. I donated my copy to a local used bookstore's free box. It's just not good enough to give to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get through this!","review":"I am forcing myself to get through Teacher Man. I find the writing very random and frankly boring. Mr. McCourt seems to have such low expectations for his students. I'm really not sure what they do in class exactly. When Mr. McCourt wrote about Kevin, the behavior problem, I kept waiting for him to have a major impact on his life, but all he did was have him wash out paint jars!! I'm tired of reading about Mr. McCourt's own life. I thought this was going to be a book about how he inspired New York students but I was mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"C+","review":"Frank McCort should have stopped writing his life story after Angela's Ashes, his incredible childhood memoir. Both Tis and Teacher Man pale in comparison. In them, we read about a Frank McCort who is a real slacker, adrift professionally and personally, and without the splendid back-up cast provided by his mother, father, brothers and sisters, as well as the Catholic church and school system. His sense of humor and lively Irish wit have disappeared. Teacher Man is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Mr. McCourt could have done something worthwhile with the time spent to write this book.And I could have done something worthwhile with the time I spent to read his book.Waste of papers.This is my first time ever writing a book review here. What inspired me to do so was pure anger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"As an up-and-coming teacher, I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"Teacher Man.\\" I was unable to put it down and finished it in two evenings on the couch. Some negative reviewers here seem to think that McCourt doesn't like kids... but I didn't get that impression at all. From my reading, it seemed that McCourt had an easier and more willing relationship with his students than their parents.I think the best part of the book is the insight. It made me feel not so different when Frank McCourt wrote about his fear of the certification proceedure or about how he felt like a fraud. \\"How am I going to pull this off?!\\" Perhaps those fears are good. Maybe trying goes out the window once you're no longer nervous. Who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memoir of a Teaching Man","review":"This book beats Angela's Ashes on interest, hands-down. What a scholarly masterpiece! Thanks again Mr. McCourt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzling","review":"I am puzzled by this book. The first paragraph stated McCourt's pride over having made something of himself after a terrible childhood. He then proceeds to tell the story of his teaching as part of this. He admits himself that he felt like a fraud much of the time. I can see why! Most of the anecdotes cover stories of his childhood and he admits to not having control over the students. (He seems to waver between intense pride and self loathing.) Although I enjoyed many of his anecdotes(the assignments to write a suicide note, a excuse note to God from Eve, and reading recipes to music), I spent a lot of time wondering how he could have been a wonderful teacher and had kids flocking to the classroom. I must assume that there is something key to McCourt's charming classroom manner that he left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthwhile but flawed","review":"This book refreshingly relates the realities of teaching. Rather than offering a \\"quick fix\\" sappy story, as do so many stories of teaching, the book outlines McCourt's gradual metamorphosis into a good teacher. It was pretty tough going at the beginning, though. McCourt's derogatory view of women as nothing but sex objects was tiresome to endure as he told tales of his sexual escapades. His \\"chip on the shoulder\\" attitude to college professors - who work every bit as hard as he does - was offensive. His tales of his teaching at technical schools was a bit mystifying: did he ever actually teach anything, or simply read at his desk while they chatted? The book gets a lot better toward the end, as McCourt hits his stride in creative writing classes at an elite high school. Is the moral of his story that good teachers need good students?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could have been his student","review":"\\"Teacher Man\\" is an incredible look at teaching, English, literature, and life itself. McCourt managed to give his students what their other subjects could not: a meaning to their lives, a significance. He also stands the idea of good writing on its head. I loved the crazy but inspired assignments and the various adventures (or misadventures) McCourt encounters throughout his career. \\"Teacher Man\\" stands on its own among McCourt's memoirs - it is not the family saga that fills \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and \\"'Tis,\\" but rather its own book, just as McCourt becomes his own person. The book left me regretting that I was born several decades too late to be McCourt's student."},{"rating":"2","title":"truthful","review":"Though not exceptionally well written, the story of this best-selling author's life as a high school teacher was fascinating. The anecdotes were developed nicely and the cast of characters was colorful. I got the impression that the book could have been 4 times it's length - with 30 years of teaching experience and the Irish gift for storytelling, Frank Mc Court could have gone on and on. Maybe he'll manage to squeeze out another novel now that he's warmed up from the first 3...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank McCourt does it again!","review":"A terrific follow-up to \\"'Tis\\" and the unforgettable \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" his latest book is an immensely enjoyable read and listen. McCourt's narration, worthy of repeated listening, is \\"ear candy\\" to audiobook devotees. The written book and audio work compliment each other, providing a full appreciation of his delightful and moving memoirs.McCourt fans will not be disappointed with \\"Teacher Man\\", and new readers will surely want to read his previous works if this is their first exposure to his special way with words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I thought I was reading a book that would inspire me to teach despite all of the hardships and pain that come during your first few years of teaching (before you really know what you're doing or who you are as a teacher). This book was a huge disapointment; I can't even finish it. Who cares about his life as far as marriage and and all the other stories he told that had no influence on his teaching style or beliefs?Even the way it is written, it's one dead end story to another. Nothing seemed to have any significance. I hate this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"parent of a teacher","review":"Being the parent of a teacher , high school sciences , I bought this book for her. Having read his other books I could not help but read this one before I gave it to her. After she read it she also thought that every teacher everywhere should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"EH","review":"Good thing it's a short book. The only worthwhile chapters were the last two, and the last chapter only had 2 words. Did not engage me at all. Your time is better spent on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"One of the most boring books I've ever read. I had to force myself to keep on reading, then when I started just skipping large sections of it I knew it was time to quit. I didn't finish it and I'm not sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I listened to the audio version read by the author. It is totally hilarious, in addition to moving and touching. I first listened to a book on tape from the library, and it was so great I knew I'd have to listen many more times so I bought it for myself. I laugh out loud frequently. McCourt's accent and tone enhance the reading, and sections of it come off like prose poetry, as engaging, funny and startling as a Bukowski reading. Anytime I'm bored I pop in the Teacher Man tape and it doesn't matter what part of the story I land in, and it never gets old. This audiobook is the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy or Read This Book","review":"In the words of Frank McCourt, I don't \\"give a fiddler's fart\\" about his sex life. This book tries to be cute right up until Chapter 18 when Frank says, \\"I'll try\\" in answer to someone's suggestion that he should write a book.It's not amusing to make fun of students, their parents and other teachers. It's not good writing to use the same voices for all of his students over 30 years. It's not entertaining to stereotype everyone who crosses his path.What \\"Teacher Man\\" does is to cash in on the popularity of \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" He blithely offends people right and left but gets away with it by playing the Irish card.This book is a disappointing bore out of what could have been an interesting look into what it is like to teach for 30 years in a city like New York, a city which deserved much better from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, funny, engaging","review":"I've never even read \\"angela's ashes\\" but this one caught my eye, and I love it. Honest, fresh, funny. Completely captivating. Buy this book (or cd!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Series of Recollections","review":"Having enjoyed ANGELA'S ASHES and 'TIS, I was looking forward to finally reading this one and I was not disappointed. While the late Mr. McCourt was an admittedly flawed fellow, his candor & humor about it speak well for him and serve to enhance his assortment of recollections regarding his teaching career. This is one of those wonderful books that may seem to wander off in its narrative, but then winds back around to sneak up on you with its powerful emotion and admittedly sentimental affect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I liked his other books much more. I thought this book would be stories about teaching and his individual students' struggles to learn, his relationships with them, etc. Instead, it seemed to be just a platform to tell more stories of his life, in that he would tell his life stories to his students, because the students wanted to hear stories rather than the subject he was teaching.It wasn't really what I was expecting and I believe he used most of his best stories of his childhood and youth in the first two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life","review":"Teacher Man is one of the best books I have read. No teacher should be without the insights that McCourt offers. This non-fiction work weaves his tragic childhood into his career as a high school and college English teacher. The best stories are the true ones, and McCourt's is the best I have read in a long time. For other real live stories I suggest the bookThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Timewhich I have reviewed in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shame!!","review":"That he didn't write when he was younger I can only imagine how funny those stories might have been. As far as this book goes it most definately is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn....","review":"I loved Angela's Ashes, I thought 'Tis was \\"just okay\\", and although I finished Teacher man in less than two days, at the end it left me with a gnawing sense of wanting more. And it could have been so much more! There were a few, brief moments of inspiration, of brilliance, but far too much ho-hum boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, offensive","review":"There may be worth in this book if you can stomach the frequent and obnoxious sexual references. Does the reader really need to know Mr. McCourt couldn't keep his eyes off the breasts of his female students? I agree with the reviewer who said that the author is simply riding the success wave of Angela's Ashes. I thoroughly enjoyed that first book, but this one was nauseatingly perverted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and dull","review":"I have never read any of McCourt's work before, but my mother-in-law told me that as an English teacher, I had to read this one. It reads quickly, but I was appalled more than once at McCourt's lack of interest in teaching and his seeming pride in being a mediocre teacher. Mr. McCourt, there is a happy medium between telling stories about your life to students and being one of the hardline teachers. To get respect you have to earn it and it is especially hard to earn the respect of 18 year olds. Very sad indeed......"},{"rating":"1","title":"I GIVE THIS A D-, &, THAT'S PUSHING IT!!","review":"I was disappointed---I expected better.This is my first, and last, McCOURT.I have a relative who is 30 years a gym teacher,that, could have written this book---maybe better!!!I found the writing about word-for-word conversationswith students from 27 years ago---annoying.

It is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank McCourt is back...","review":"Frank McCourt has a wonderful way of telling stories, and he does it just as well in this book as he did in \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and \\"'Tis\\"...I have to admit, however, that this was probably my least favorite of all of Mr. McCourt's books. I was engrossed in the Irish culture depicted in \\"Angela's Ashes\\", and Mr. McCourt's personal dilemmas in \\"'Tis\\" moved me even more; however, \\"Teacher Man\\" seemed a bit empty compared to those, and Mr. McCourt's constantly putting himself down and talking about how he just \\"fell\\" into the habits that made him a good teacher frustrated me somewhat. Like I said, though, this book is similar in style to his other two books, and was still one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it to anyone who is a teacher or who is thinking about becoming one (and I'm neither of those, although I did once consider teaching as a career)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank McCourt is brilliant","review":"These are the best books i have ever read and I read a lot.

I thought this book was going to be about the trials and tribulations of being a NYC teacher and how he overcame these obstacles in order to become an excellent teacher.Once I finished this book my main response was \\"so what?\\". It is boring, disorganized, and not really about teaching at all. He whines, whines, and whines some more and drifts from place to place without any real direction. I certainly know this is not uncommon but definately not worthy of a novel!Unfortunatly, Mr. McCourt wrote one outstanding book (Angela's Ashes) and has forced out his two sequels that are sub-par. Stop while you are ahead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"I bought this book because of the title - I am a teacher and I love reading about other teachers. It was very disappointing because the book was more about childhood memories than teaching. He just used the classroom as an excuse to write his memoirs. It is more of a biography. I wanted to learn more about his teaching and less about shipyards and Irish childhoods. I quickly read it and sold it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put down....","review":"I have a habit of not beginning a new book until I complete the \\"old\\". However once I began Teacher Man I could not put it down. McCourt is a great story teller and will now seek Tis.

I loved \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and liked \\"'Tis\\" and expected to enjoy this book too, but it was flat and lifeless. McCourt doesn't seem to have much insight into himself or his students. He just says over and over how tough they are and how they don't put up with any BS from teachers.The anecdotes about specific students all started to sound the same after the first few. In fact, they sounded like he just made them up for the sake of illustrating a point (which was invariably that kids are tough and they don't take any BS from teachers).This book was tiresome and tedious. I wish I could have my $21 and my X number of hours spent reading it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teacher Man fails to deliver","review":"He has a wonderful writing style which I admire, however I didn't like this particular book.

As many other reviewers stated, this book doesn't compare to the amazing Angela's Ashes. I wasn't expecting Teacher Man to live up to its predecessor, however, I thought I'd at least be inspired, as the topic of teaching means a lot to me. At some points, I did like the way Mr. McCourt recalled the happenings in his classroom, but these points were few and far between. Furthermore, I became annoyed at his numerous accounts of sexual conquests. If they had shaped his teaching career, I would understand the inclusion. But I did not see how they related, whereas his divorce and the birth of his daughter are rarely mentioned. A big disappointment from someone I still consider as a great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Par with Angela's Ashes","review":"Frank McCourt made his bones in \\"Angela's Ashes\\" by recounting the tales of his life in Ireland to the millions who understood where he was coming from. Many have read Angela's Ashes more than once -- so close to the heart did it hit.In his next novel, \\"Tis,\\" he did what any self-respecting Irishman would do - he took a Mulligan and milked the notoriety of \\"Angela's Ashes\\" for all it was worth. His fans forgave him and waited for this writer of lyrical prose to get his act together.With the publishing of \\"Teacher Man\\" the wait has ended. He did what his story-telling nature does best - he told of the events in his real life as a teacher in the ethnic public schools around NY City.The book is a 5-star delight. To his millions of Irish fans, he has undoubtedly added the teachers who struggle to educate reluctant adolescents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to it!","review":"I've read and enjoyed Angela's Ashes and 'Tis.

Neither can I decide whether I enjoyed reading this book.TEACHER MAN barely has a plot, but it leaves you fully aware of the path your own life is taking. It highlights people who are far from spectacular, but causes you to love everyone more.The reason I can't decide whether I enjoyed the book or not is because it took some work to get myself to keep flipping the pages--which is often true of things that are good for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I was so touched by this one. I listened on CD, Frank himself read the book, it would not have been the same by any other person.I often wonder if he was too hard on himself. The idea of his students writing excuse notes from Adam to God, or Eve to God got their creative juices going. It also allowed them to hear other points of view on different topics.I hated doing the sentence thing, I would have understood better with his PEN idea. Just read the book. It goes quickly.

Even when he is divulging his shortcomings, his wit and bare-knuckled honesty draw you in.\\"Teacher Man\\" is, to me, quite different than his previous two works, but completely enjoyable down to the last tale. I think it makes a great gift to every teacher who has ever struggled with their profession and the demise of their idealistic vision.

The tunes are simple [yet profound] and easy to comprehend.Mahler's orchestration of his song cycle is exquisite. It is interesting to listen to Janet Baker's performance of the cycle with Geoffrey Parsons accompanying on piano and hear it both ways.I think the version with piano only has greater subtlety in both soloist and accompanist's performances, but this is nevertheless a wonderful performance.Other works that provide a great entry point into Mahler include the Resurrection Symphony [I love the generously packaged Kaplan version on Conifer] and the Song of the Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Mahler performance with lots of heart","review":"I'd normally be pretty skeptical of anything titled \\"Great Recordings of the 20th Century,\\" but EMI's nailed it with this one. We have here the superb musicianship and beautiful voice of Janet Baker with sympathetic support by Barbirolli. The Kindertotenlieder is particularly affecting. Robert Fripp has called this the \\"music of God's tears,\\" and Miss Baker convinces me that this is an apt description.

And boy am I glad I ever did.The amazing intensity just smacks you in the face, and boy this is some solid stuff.

It's just beating around the bush; it just showed that Dragonforce used their sound far too much at this point, and it got old and boring. It's definitely not as good as the 2 albums preceding, and NOWHERE near as amazing as Ultra Beatdown. The songs here are commercial, polished, and boring. Anyone who can listen to this album front to back and not get bored, must be on something.There are two worthwhile tracks (Operation Ground and Pound, Trail of Broken Hearts), but even those two are letdowns compared to their other 3 albums (especially Ultra Beatdown).so, this album is all too skipable. I recommend getting Ultra Beatdown (by far Dragonforce's finest hour), Valley of the Dead, and Sonic Firestorm, and downloading this if you really want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inhuman Rampage","review":"My opinion's probably biased since Dragonforce is my favorite band, but that's the point, I suppose. Hard to compare with Valley of the Damned or Sonic Firestorm, but they pulled it off. Amazing album. I keep a rather small playlist, usually less than 100 songs, but you can always be sure that the three DF albums will be on there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible playing but needs three things","review":"All these guys have to do is tone down the fantasy and the whoaohs a little, and make their songs a little less verse-chorus-verse, and they will be the next Iron Maiden. The solos are great and the whole album is at around 300 beats per minute. It's about like if the guy from Journey sang for Helloween and they played at Napalm Death's speed. The production is flawless, the music is great, the lyrics are as cheesy as it gets, as is the booklet art. Oh, and the album art looks like a Winamp skin, clear down to the EQ, mono/stereo icons, and bitrate indicator Overall I'd give it about a 78% rating. Don't even bother to look at the book or listen to the lyrics, just headbang to it and admire the guitar solos that make up about half the record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video Games + Metal = Dragonforce","review":"Man this is really a revolution in power metal sound dragonforce, yeah i've never hear unique sound like this in power metal before, its have a video games sound, its video games from NES and atari era and herman li says yes vid games is one of his inspiration.Dragonforce is very fast and unique power metal sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast, but that's about it","review":"If you have ever listened to them before, then you know they are fast. They truely have a great guitarist and a great drummer. The only bad part about them is they don't know when to slow down. I can honestly say I would listen to this band if they learned to slow down at some point. Speed doesn't make a good song, boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthem-ish Power Metal With A Twist","review":"One thing that seperates Dragonforce from other bands is their incredible speed, this album is one of the best power metal bands out there, every track makes you feel like getting up and singing along, Dragonforce are definintley a \\"force\\" to be reckoned with.Yeah yeah, lame pun kill me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype.","review":"Many magazines were giving this cd too much hype. This is a talented band but they play that \\"Walt Disney Helloween Metal.\\" The first few lines from \\"Through the Fire and Flames\\"-\\"On a cold winter...around the world tonight\\"- is the same melody as \\"The Hotel California\\"-\\"On a dark desert...for the night\\"- by the Eagles. If you want to hear some better Power Metal bands from 2006 then try Beyond Fear with Ripper Owens or Killing Machine with James Rivera. Those bands don't play \\"Walt Disney Metal.\\" Or try \\"Threshold\\" by Hammerfall or \\"The Black Flame\\" by Wolf. As I stated, Dragonforce was over hyped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure these guys can shred and play fast...............but what else can they do ?","review":"NOT A LOT ELSE TO BE HONEST. So many people have been fooled in to believing this band is amazing simply because of the speed that they play at, but to be honest is speed really everything? All the songs on the CD lack creativity and sounds pretty much the same as the last song . Every fu**ing track on this album is plagued with fast drum beats, some crappy power metal riff that remains throughout the song and lightning fast guitar solos which is impressive when you've heard one but by the end of the CD its a drag. Don't get me wrong, to be able to play this takes a hell of a lot of skill and ability, but they need to use that skill and ability to come up with something a lot more creative and inventive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a kid, just don't have my own Amazon account.","review":"First off, to anyone who says that Dragonforce are reinventing metal or some utter-crap like that, throw away all your CDs, you do not deserve to listen to music.Now, I'm only going to say a few things about this CD.1. One of the worst CDs I've ever owned.2. Herman Li is NOT a God, they can't even play their music good.3. Valley of the Damned > Sonic Firestorm >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Inhuman Rampage.4. If you have this CD, I feel sorry for your CD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated power metal.","review":"I purchased their first album \\"valley of the damned\\" and thougth they had promise if you could just hear the singer. I just purchased this album and can see why they did not allow people to hear their vocalist. If this is what is going to be presented to the U.S. as power metal to the dopes that go to things called ozzfest, then power metal is doomed in the U.S. There are many other bands that give the genre a better light, but not this one. Sure they play fast, have sing along chorus's, but they still sound flat. Over three albums I see no improvement. Here's hoping that Blind Guardian's new album makes it out soon so that there is something new that is decent to listen to. Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"musical masturbation","review":"This recording is for non-musical guitar jockeys only. The musicians are skilled but the result sounds like a soundtrack to a bad japanese cartoon. Miles Davis should come back to life and slap each member for every non-musical 32nd note (which there are countless) played. No soul just egomaniacs trying to show how good they are. Instead of a million rotten fast notes, how about one musical note-but there are none."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"this is probably the most listened to cd that i own! next to their other 2 cd's. they're precise, fast, and great musicians all around! try and find everything they have any where else and reply to this. I don't think there is anything else out there that can to this! I can't wait for their next cd now that they are getting huge in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"Don't buy it, don't even think about buying it. If you think the menu music to Nintendo video games played fast is a cool idea then go for it, waste your money. If you are buying this because you think they have talent and your exposure to the metal genre is limited, then I present you a light in the dark. Go buy Dream Theater, they have all the unnecessary wankery and cheesiness, and only half the shame of this. If you want something with a pop sound but still retaining more credibility then maybe go and start off with Powerslave by Iron Maiden. If you choose not to listen to me and still buy this then it may be too late already, mediocrity must just be your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repetitive....","review":"I hate this album all songs are too repetitive. I also don't like the fast guitars."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should be called StudioForce (or maybe DragonFarce)","review":"I fell for the hype and bought it. It was cool the 1st time then it was just noise. Very fast noise played well mind you but nothing to remember despite the press their getting. (What ever happen to The Darkness? Weren't THEY supposed to take the world by storm?)If you go see them in concert you'll see why some call them Studioforce. Not nearly that good live. Very messy. I'll stick to Dream Theater for my speed kick. At least they can reproduce live what they release."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly bizarre","review":"why would you arrange and record drums this way? Clearly these are skillful musicians, but the aesthetic being applied here is unfathomable, at least to me. It's all going a little too fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like ....","review":"I bought this cd expecting some good metal but really it sounds like someone took their sound and put it in a blender and spewed it back out at the speed of a Slayer album on 78. Too repetitive and boring. Fast guitars and drums just banging away but for what? To sound fast. Most of all this album is BORING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This albulm is pretty good The instruments are not what earned this albulm a four star review the singer kindof sounds like a girl and the songs have some cheesy names and lyrics but if you can get past that the singer does sound good just like a little boy/woman. Any way I like how they keep the whole song fast and this is true speed metal not even coming close to being as good as anthrax but it is still good. So if you like Anthrax then you might wanna check this out it is not as good as Anthrax but it is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"WTF?!?!?!","review":"I don't know if I should fall down laughing or bow down in awe. I've always complained people don't know how to play their instruments anymore. Well...here ya go! These guys bring it WAY over the top. Almost too much? Is that possible? The song titles, artwork, lyrics, hell even the band name are just flat out ridiculous but the musicianship absolutely throttles the listener. The average listener won't \\"get\\" this album but musicians, producers and people in a music related field will be studying this benchmark for a LONG time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa there!","review":"Okay, before you cyber-lynch me, lemme just say this: these guys have talent. I mean, what you've heard is true, these guys play fast as hell. But super speed does not equal five stars, I'm afraid.Why am I not into Dragonforce? Simple: they are just way too theatrical and cheesy. It's overkill. It's just too much. It's like the birthday cake of metal: maybe good for a little bit, but you can't have more or else you may get a stomachache.I give it two stars because it does take talent and endurance to play at the speed they do; sorry, however, I can't say any more for it. Like I said, too theatrical and cheesy. I'd pass on it if I were you. But I'm not you. So I'll listen to good music while you give me a not helpful vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember When Helloween Did This 20 Years Ago?","review":"I don't understand the hype surrounding Dragonforce. They have the EXACT same sound as Helloween and almost the EXACT same lyrical content. The only difference is the guitarists in Helloween didn't need flashy pedal effects to make it sound like they were accomplished guitarists. I ended up buying Inhuman Rampage out of curiosity above all else and was incredibly disgusted and turned off for reasons I stated previously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal Chipmunks?","review":"Extremely fast instrumetation ...IF they are really playing at this speed. There are several artifacts of the recording that make it sound like it has been recorded at a slower speed and sped up: (1) the extreme clarity of each passage across all instrument is not likely (all players would have to play flawlessly at this fast speed), (2) the vibrato in the vocals sounds too fast, and (3) the key of the songs sounds higher and less dark than you would expect from a typical Metal song. It sounds like a Metallica LP played at 45rpm.If they are actually playing this fast, kudos. However, speed isn't everything. The songs just aren't that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I read all the reviews for this cd and the way it was hyped I was interested in listening to the group, no, I felt it was my duty as a musician and rock fan. I popped it in and man I was amazed, I was like, \\"Shyeah, these guys play fast, but lets see what the rest of the cd is like.\\" To my horror, every track sounds EXACTLY the same, like a trash can full of marbles rolling down stairs at full blast on fire. These guys know how to rock, and are talented, however, there is no variety, every time they break into a different sort of riff and start to do something different they quickly switch back to the same familiar groove. Overall the cd sucks musically, technically its amazing, but you won't remember any of it once you turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a neophite's point of view","review":"I haven't heard anything from power/speed/melodic metal before Dragon Force (appart from some Yngwie's solos and 'Painkiller' from the Judas Priest) ... but man, 'Inhuman Rampage' is like driving an Evo VII at 300 mph with a level 3 nitro.Slickin guitar solos, amazing drums and nice vocals. But the best of all is the 'epic' and 'fantasy' touch of this record. Seems that you're some kind of RPG knight fighting against thousand of orcs :).I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"How much can you like a mouse? 5 stars worth of mouse love here. Feels good. Extra buttons for going backwards and forwards are splendid! Oh, the extra time in my life now!No, seriously, a great mouse - buy it with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've used several of the MS Optical Intellimouse for years so when my old one finally became gunked up beyond reason I didn't hesitate to replace it with a new one. Unfortunately, the newly minted versions have a different scroll wheel design. Instead of operating smoothly with just a slight \\"bumpy\\" feel for each increment, the scroll wheel now feels loose and it rattles in operation. I thought I'd received a defective unit and exchanged it -- but the exchange Intellimouse was just the same. It works fine, but it's unpleasant and annoying to use. I'll probably replace it with a Logitech mouse before too much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft Intellimouse Optical Mouse","review":"This is a very good product works great. I would recommed it to any one."},{"rating":"2","title":"best mouse there is","review":"I own two of these mice and can asure that so far these are just absolutely the best mice I've ever had; perfectly designed, clicks are perfect, a true magnificent experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...but the longevity is not great.","review":"I've loved using this mouse for several years. It fits my hand (rather small) and the extra buttons have spoiled me for using ordinary mice. I set the left side button to go to the top of a document in my word processsor and the right side to go to the end, for example. It comes with the default set for back and forward, which is very handy in an internet browser. I set the scroll wheel button to paste when I push it in.What disappoints me about this mouse is that two of them have died. They failed gradually, stopping intermittantly but restarting until they just quit altogether. A third one is beginning to fail. (These were used in different locations, by two different people.) The mice worked for several years; this wasn't an immediate failure, but it's still frustrating. I bought a new Microsoft 5-button mouse, wireless, recently, but I don't like the feel of it and have difficulty using the extra buttons.I may go ahead and order another one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, inexpensive mouse","review":"I purchased this mouse 3-4 months ago for my MacBook and have had no issues so far. The only (minor) complaint I have with this mouse is that the scroll wheel is very noisy. In a very silent room (early in the morning or late at night) it is loud enough to disturb a light sleeper. Luckily my wife doesn't sleep light. :-)I mostly use the left and right buttons and the scroll wheel. Have had no use for the 4th and 5th buttons yet.Another \\"feature\\" I like is that the mouse matches my MacBook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good feel and fast navigation","review":"This optical mouse is the perfect weight in my opinion. The reason I did not select a cordless version was because of the weight issue. The cord if properly placed should be no problem. The side buttons cut back on time in my profession. I do not ask much from a mouse, but I can easily say this is the best mouse I have used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I expected it to be.","review":"Many of the reviews here praise the ergonomics and 'feel' of the mouse. Personally I find it awkward to handle. The mouse itself is very light and easy to move around though. However, due to its lightness, the stiff and heavy cord actually drags the mouse away sometimes. The buttons are extremely light as well. If you even look at them funny, they click. And since they placed button #5 on the right side of the mouse, instead of on the left side next to button #4 where it should be, I'm constantly clicking it when moving the mouse. I had to disable the button with the software to avoid unwanted commands. For the money I paid for it, I'm not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got so used to it, needed another!","review":"I got this mouse as a gift and loved it as soon as I started using it. It definitely provides skip-free performance, has a great feel to it, has the scroll wheel, and my new favorite thing - those programmable buttons!At first I wasn't used to those programmable buttons and I'd accidentally press them getting unwanted results (like going back to the previous web-page when pressing the left button). But then I got so used to it and realized how helpful it was - so much so that I got another one for my work because I kept trying to press those buttons that didn't exist on my mouse at work!There's definitely no going back to a mechanical mouse in this day and age after so many optical mouses (or is it mice!) are available. But if you haven't used a mouse with programmable buttons before, I'm telling you - give it a try and you won't ever want to go back to one that doesn't have them! And for the price, this one's a good bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"good solid mouse","review":"I went crazy looking at Amazon mouse reviews. It seems thatmany people are really picky about their mouse. I'm not.I just wanted a comfortable mouse for use with my lefthand.I like the feel of this mouse (I'm a guy with medium tomedium-large hands). The buttons and scrollwheel are fine. I didn't install the software that camewith the mouse -- it worked fine after just plugging in.I'm not currently using the two extra buttons.I don't have any complaints but wish this mouse weigheda bit more. I've only been using it for aday so can't comment on reliability.I bought this mouse after buying and returning aMicrosoft Comfort 1000 mouse.

Within a few days, the mouse was acting up: clicking randomly, periodically ceasing to function, and scrolling without my input. I called and complained to Microsoft, whose tech support insisted I must have \\"misused\\" the mouse and caused it to break. They refused to replace the mouse or even allow me to ship it back for repairs. Now, the mouse is getting very bad. It will close browser windows and attempt to scroll about once every two to three minutes. I recently trashed the Optical in favor of a comperable Logitech infrared mouse, which I have had no problems with, and like very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"First off, I did love this mouse when I first received it, but it only lasted a couple months of light use. I was going to get the same one, but it now costs $100! So I replaced it with a smaller mouse of a different brand, which I actually like a whole lot better. This mouse is large and caused bad carpal tunnel, too, but I didn't know that was the problem until I bought the smaller mouse. I had this same mouse before, and it lasted over 2 years, so I am disappointed that this one was so wimpy.Oh yes, and I agree the light is too bright. It hurts the eyes when it's darker, too, so I kept it covered with a cloth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with touching some time it doesn't work.","review":"Problem with touching,some time it doesn't work.I have to do it twice!What you paid what you got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scroll wheel too easy to click","review":"Overall, the mouse feels great and tracks just fine.

EXCEPT FOR THE MIDDLE \\"wheel\\" button.","review":"I was really happy with the mouse for all of 10 minutes.The scroll wheel is really \\"push happy\\" such that when I roll the wheel, the middle button registers a \\"click\\" very often. In order to prevent the inadvertant click, I have to roll the wheel with the lightest of light touches. It's significantly more senstive than my older logitech wheel, and was really really annoying to have the browser repeatedly register the middle button (which is unix is the default \\"paste\\" so I'd have pages and pages of text that I \\"selected\\" be pasted on to the browser or editor while what I really wanted was just to scroll the buffer!!!Too bad, the mouse was really high quality overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and inexpensive","review":"I first purchased this mouse at college in August 2002 and found it to be very useful and durable. The forward/back internet buttons are handy if you browse the web or even folders in your own computer, and the scroll button is easily programmable. I have been using it constantly for about a year now and it's finally starting to give me some problems. I'm not sure about the warranty on it, but I think that all the wear and tear from taking it everywhere with my laptop has done something to the connection at the end of the cable. My computer sometimes claims it cannot recognize it or doesn't acknowledge it at all unless I bend the cord up a little. I know this is a common problem with electronics in general but I haven't seen it in any reviews for this item. All in all, isolated case aside, this is a great product for someone looking for a quality optical mouse with good features at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three years and still going strong!","review":"I live in a very dusty city, and mouse cleaning was a weekly (if not daily) portion of my computer-related life. On a whim, I bought this mouse when they first came out (in Colombia) over 3 years ago. Haven't looked back since, I even gave one to my girlfriend because she kept threatening me to steal mine. On the down side, this mouse is for righties only, lefties have to settle for the normal Micorosoft Intellimouse without all the extra buttons (all 2 of them).Tracking in the device is wonderful, it seems to work nicely in all types of games, and when I go to gaming parlours I miss the programmability of the extra two buttons (reload, use, anyone?)I'd heartily reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT","review":"The Intellimouse Optical is one of the best mice i have used. although i am usually not a fan of Microsoft products, so far this one has exceeded my expectations.

I got this one for my laptop, I hate those tiny-tiny ones. This one comfortably fills your hand. It's sensitive enough for both work with raster and 3D applications as well as, I would imagine, for gaming. The wheel is also a button, so it makes 5 buttons available, which comes in pretty useful when you're working with something where a gazillion shortcuts can really accelerate your work. I find the pinky-finger much more comfortable than having a two-thumb-button setup like some other 5- and 6- button mice do.Cons: The wheel-tilt feature is absent, but I haven't ever really found any use for it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"Definately recommend it.

It is great for gaming (Counterstrike) as you can assign functions to the buttons on the side. Also just for internet surfing, the back and forward functions that come default are the best.

Though it's written by remodeling business consultants, I thought it was refreshingly empty of consultant-guru speak and actually a concise and example-packed manual for the businessperson. Many anecdotes AND real-world data examples, example forms, etc. etc.The fact is that no one book (or any sum of books) will answer all your questions, but this is one of the few books I would buy for a builder's reference shelf, and seriously, I hardly buy any books. Also a very good book if you're taking some time to get a broad grasp of the business playing field for remodelers before you jump in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good reference book on airliners.","review":"Endres' beautiful work includes just about every aircraft, from the smallest commuter to the largest airliner with excellent photos, overviews of development, specs, and detailed internal diagrams (2 full pages for most aircraft). It also includes very interesting sections on flight operations, aircraft and engine design, and the future of commercial flight. The book does suffer so many chronic typos and technical errors that you're left wondering if the manuscript was proofread at all. It also tends to slant towards British-produced aircraft, but that's sort of a nice change.

A Must Have For All Admirers Of Malcolm X!","review":"An extraordinary collection of photographs highlighting the life and times of the great African-American leader, Al Hajj Malik Shabazz, better known as Malcolm X. Presented in black and white format, this book is comprised of rare pictures that effectively convey the passionate, inspirational persona of the great leader. Though more of a pictorial than an exposé into Malcolm's \\"life and/or philosophy\\", the large photos and detailed commentary adequately outlines his ideology, as well as the tumultuous racial climate of the era. Included are photos of Malcolm's family, Elijah Muhammad, and Martin Luther King. Additionally, there are rare pictures of Marcus Garvey, members of the Nation of Islam, W. E. B. Dubois, Adam Clayton Powell, Muhammad Ali and even a young Redd Foxx. Though only 80 pages long, the cliché that a picture is worth a thousand words in more than apropos here. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great reading if you are having a rough time sleeping","review":"The title of the book should be 50 Years down a boring road.

And I have always liked his lyrics and music when he performed with Jane's and Porno for Pyros. I like to hear the story behind the person at personal and proffesional levels. Not just the \\"how\\" but the \\"why.\\" Thompson covered enough ground for me and there were interesting tid-bits about Perry and his bandmates. Thompson uses a little bit of \\"hypster hyperbole\\" but in a way he has to write in this fashion to appeal to the people that may be interested in Farrel enough to buy this book. I liked the musical, economic and personal side he wrote of. Now I see him as less enigmatic but certainly just as interesting. This is a good quick read. I hope Thompson does some coverage of some of those rock n' roll personas that present mysterious images like that of farrel.

The rifle hanging above Senator Clark's fire place must have been discussed or mentioned at least 10 times.2. The discussion of the relationship was way to extensive for this type of book.3. Why in the world would you constantly mention what people were wearing, who cares. In the case where Rapp goes to the White House in dirty jeans and un-shaved, ok that does add to the story line, but as to what people wear and what color it is, no, no, way to much.Again, good story, just way,way,way to much padding. (hint, padded sentence)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but still a great book in the series","review":"This is the 4th book in Flynn's series. If you can, you'll really want to read them in order. This one took quite a while to get going. The first 80 pages were little else but recapping the prior three books. I think some recap is fine, but this was way too much. From there, I thought it still had trouble getting traction. Finally, about the last 1/3 of the book took off and kept me page turning.I love the serial aspect of these novels, they flow nicely from one book to the next. I also like Flynn's mixture of actual history with his fictional world.So, far of the 4 books, the 1st and 2nd have been the best for action, the 3rd and 4th were much more focused on Washington DC rather than \\"front line\\" action.Appropriateness: This book contains a fair amount of language... a word or two every 10 pages. There are characters that are hurt and killed, but none are described graphically. Sexual situations are eluded to, but are not in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle abuses","review":"I just finished this book \\"seperation of power\\". I was unhappy with the previous endeavor because I was troubled by the character of Senator Hank Clark. I was glad that he received his comeuppance in this newest work.I have read many books and I am troubled by the notion that Politicians can be so very sinister and conniving. I consider myself to be a logical thinker,and a strategist. It is difficult to recognize that such devious Humans in our 3rd Millenium western culture can rise to such positions.I happen to like Chess and strategy games. This stuff of evil politicians spooks me (no pun intended).The notion that people can act so selfish and with such callousness is frightening.Some of my favorite books include \\"Shogun\\" and \\"The Eight\\" Also about strategists,corruption, and abuses of power. If you enjoyed Seperation of power, you will I am certain like these books as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard Cutouts have more Personality","review":"the cover blurbs were more exciting reading than the actual book.This guy has learned all he knows about the world from watching TV dramas and spy movies.His women characters fall into three categories... helpless hapless \\"blondes,\\" would-be spies who are actually incapable of doing much more than walking down a fashion runway, and two dimensional power figures who are little more than \\"yes-women.'The men don't fare much better. A 'president' who gives new definition to the term \\"wooden.\\" Assorted Senators who waffle between power mad and power hungry. And then the redoubtable Mitch Rap, savior of the universe. I can almost see his cape. :-PIt's a shame because there actually WAS a story in there somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book kicks some hella-ass.","review":"This was my first Flynn book and I was completely blown away. Mitch Rapp is the is the Ray Lewis of terrorist asskickers. He reminds me of Jack in \\"24\\". Flynn doesn't leave the reader pissed off at the end. The bad dudes get what's coming to them everytime and in the most satisfying of fashion. Awesome from start to finish.If you like political thrillers or spy novels READ THIS BOOK!!!If you don't like good books such as political thrillers and spy novels then go take your smelly, hairy, hippy ass and go sit on a stump and read The Five People You Meet in Heaven and take a grilled cheese with ya (and maybe some yogurt with granola). I hear PETA is hiring, maybe you can get a dang job!Mitch Rapp eats hippies for breakfast and poops them out at lunch.Peace out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic finish!","review":"Separation of Power is another Vince Flynn book packed with detailed action and character development. The bad guys are really twisted. Unfortunately, each one of Flynn's books have gotten progressively more profain.

This was a page turner. Although, I thought the Mitch Rapp character seemed to get out of everything without a scratch, and had way too much power and control of every situation, even over the President. Which was hard to comprehend. But, overall, an enjoyable read. And, I'm looking forward to more novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid by the Page","review":"I started reading this guy's stuff only recently, 2011. He is fine but it is so clear that he is now getting paid by the page and has no editor that reading his stuff is getting boring. He uses stuff like Tom Clancy does, \\"inside\\" names for weapons systems, and the tired old reference to \\"Langley.\\" Anyone else notice the recurring theme to spy novels is to always blame everything on that darn old Langley? Tired of it.

Maybe once or twice, but this was way over the top. Unrealistic \\"domestic\\" dialogue hampers down this story and adds an air of unreality to an already improbable plot. I read this because I was blown away with Vince's \\"Transfer of Power;\\" thought it was a great book.

Term Limits put me to sleep before it was time. Separation of Power did the same thing. What happen?From the beginning, and through almost three-quarters of the book, you have to read the biography of every character, or get the size, dimension, color of every room, building, car, or a description of every scrap of land. I do not consider this worthwhile reading if you have to turn eight to ten pages (or more) at a time to get to the story line. It did not get exciting - the thriller part - until the last fifty pages.Not every writer is of the quality of Robert Ludlum, but Vince Flynn certainly had the potential with Transfer of Power. I hope he will regain that unique quality, and I can look forward to his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Sensative","review":"I guess Mr. Flynn didn't spend much time writing this panty-wetter.Maybe 20 readable pages. This is a far cry from his earlier very good novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Flynn has fallen far from his first excellent efforts. I found the writing to be sophomoric at best and lacking in very basic research. Flynn has apparently never been to Italy (where I live) and doesn't know that coffee is not served \\"to go\\" as at a 7-11; He has apparently not traveled First Class either, or maybe doesn't understand that there is no higher fare a passenger can pay. Nonetheless, \\"Reilly was lucky the AA agent did not charge her extra on her first class seat due to the change of date (pg 268) And finally, why does he have President Hayes act perplexed (pg 285) that disclosure of classified material is actually something on which he can legally hang his enemies?

I see other readers did not like Mitch Rapp girlfriend in the book, neither did I, but it is a minor point and it is not bad enough to hurt it all that badly. I liked the parts in Washington D.C with Congressmen Rudin and Senator Clark the most but the parts involving Iraq was great to. If you like political or action books then this is the book for you. Also as I said before this is the first book I have read of his, so if you want to read this book and you have not read any others in the series you will still be able to enjoy this book for what is worth.

Yes, it is slickly designed, has a pretty icky red light at the back, and has flexible control software. But the wheel is seriously flawed. I bought one on Sunday and took it back on Monday. The wheel has far too much lost motion when it is pressed, sounds like a tin toy when it rotates (it is ANNOYINGLY noisy), and the tactile feedback is nasty. Pity, as otherwise it's a fine mouse. I actually tried several different displays in different shops and they all had the same feature, the trackball mouse is the same too so it must be the basic design and not a fault. My old Intellimouse did not have this problem. So I've now got a Logitech MX-500 and boy is this an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible scroll wheel","review":"If you do a lot of scrolling, this is not the mouse for you. This one's very loose, very \\"click-clacky,\\" and just plain shoddy. When you press the scroll wheel button you get two clicks: when the parts finally come into alignment, and when the button is actually pressed. The same often applies for scrolling: an initial click for the wheel to engage with its gear, then a click as you actually turn the gear. Annoying! For this much money, the moving parts should be snug and responsive. I found myself absent-mindedly playing with it like a loose tooth, wondering when it would break entirely. You'll find that most children's toys have better moving parts. I think Logitech scroll wheels are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution (if you read this)","review":"About a year ago I wanted to upgrade to an optical so I went to microsoft because of thier name is known for quality.

I tried it on my other computer with the same problems so I bought another one with same results, after a few weeks it became defective. Ever since I have been a logitech mouse user. I know this is not the same model but still see other people having similar problems with this current model. I stongly advise you to be careful taking a chance with this product.

My first IntelliMouse v3 lasted about 6 months until the mouse wheel started misbehaving. It would occasionally scroll down a single line when I wasn't touching it. It started soft but over a few weeks got much worse. I took it back and got another one. This too lasted about 6 months until the same problem started up. In addition the back button is exhibiting the 'double-click' problem (where it sometimes goes back two pages even though i only clicked it once).

It is comfortable, which is what I look for in a mouse. It also has two side buttons that you can configure. I have them configured for going Back and Forward on the Internet for easier, faster browsing. The only reason why I have this mouse 4 stars instead of 5, is because it is not 100% comfortable. Although it is very comfortable, there are better mice out there. Such as the Intellimouse Explorer Wireless and Intellimouse Explorer Wireless for Bluetooth. This mouse, in my opinion, is much better than any Logitech mouse out there. If you are looking for a good mouse with extra buttons, this is the mouse for you. If you want 100% Comfortablity, go with the Intellimouse Explorer Wireless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning! Lower profile than the original model","review":"I loved my old Intellimouse dearly. I have very large hands and its high arch was great, and it functioned very well. When it finally died after two years of loyal service, I didn't hesitate to get another one. But they are not the same. They lowered the profile to the same level as their other mice, and I can sit them side by side to compare. Also, the left side buttons are much smaller. It's still an excellent mouse and I haven't seen a better one, but if you liked the old one (including the old Intellimouse Pro ball mouse, which was also very high) for the size, you should handle this new one first.

This book is proof of why there's no place like New York. New Yorkers are the most wonderful people in the world. Only a true New Yorker could write such a wonderful book. This book brings back such great memories growning up in New York. You cover 38 topics, 563 pages on sports, boroughs, politics, theatre etc...

The stories by Aichinger, Camus and Boll in particular are useful, and allow me to get the class quick feedback before we read a longer text. I agree with the other review that it could be longer, and if the editors could bring it out again with a few new stories, without making it unwieldy like a \\"Norton Anthology\\", I think it would be useful and successful.

This is an ensemble which prides itself on celebrating music, and the music itself provides endless reasons for rejoicing. I have been privileged to hear The Nobles of the Mystic Shrine in concert on countless occasions, and I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this recording. Now that I've purchased it, I am just as eagerly awaiting the release of a second CD by this extraordinarily gifted group. Although allowed 1,000 words to express my opinion, I think it's sufficient to insist that if you love music, you must add this recording to your collection without delay. One hearing is worth far more than 1,000 words!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous points make text questionable","review":"Although material information in the book is in coherence with basic views of the realms addressed, I found certain ideas negative and foul. The equating of the cutting of flowers to the sexual mutilation of an animal is both scientifically insubstantial and ludicrous. It is mentioned several times in the text. I have the sense that the author has some issues to work through. As an individual searching with sensitivity and respect into the realm of nature spirits, I found his statements in this area to be ridiculous. The realm of vegetation and flower is indeed to be respected, but if we are to take the authors view that to cut a flower is equivalent to sexual mutilation, we must cease to eat broccoli, carrots, and any other fruit or vegetable, for these too are the children or reproductive organs of the plant.

For about the first week, my nails were growing, then stopped. Also, I saw no real change in my skin either. I honestly wonder if all these good reviews are real... Again, these are expensive.

I bought Menuhin's recording with Efrem Kurtz. The performance that EMI has hailed as one of the great recordings of the century. Well, Menuhin's violin is recorded so distantly that it's hard to hear him. And his version with Furtwangler has more insight, but his playing is lacking the smoothness and singing quality that Francescatti and Mitropolous brings to this work. If you believe that Menuhin is one of the best on this work, you should hear Francescatti. He'll make you change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Second Edition","review":"This must be taken with the 1947 recording of Beethoven's Violin Concerto althouth I would prefer the earlier one.

Then there are the very few that make you feel as if you have actually climbed the magic staircase to peer out over the landscape of heaven.

Bach) & Frank Martin's powerfully meditative Sonata da chiesa, orginally for viola d'amore & here played most effectively on oboe d'amore. Peter Jona Korn's Fantasia is the most recent work (1981), and although I can't say I find it particularly memorable, it fits nicely into a program that moves from Baroque to Romantic to modern.

The first half is very esoteric. Fine if you're deep into anthroposophy but if you are more interested in the practical applications of temperaments in your home, homeschool, or school, look elsewhere. The first half is mostly history, tracing from the Ancient Greeks to medieval times, while the second half is a little meatier with ways of identifying children's temperaments (remember, the whole point of the book) and ways to diminish or reinforce different aspects of a temperament. I'll be looking elsewhere for more practical aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"Maltbie Babcock was a Presbyterian minister in the northeastern U.S. in the latter part of the 19th century. This book is a collection of letters he wrote to his parishioners providing details of his travels to the Holy Land. It is interesting on several fronts: he generally places each site visited into its Biblical context; he describes life in that part of the world 100 years ago; he offers insight as to the views held by an educated Western Christian of his day on the significance of the area and what its future may hold. His superior use of the English language and his good humor make it a very satisfying read, and it is illustrated by pictures he took."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing account of working in a 1920's department store","review":"Ms. Kimbrough's first job was at the Marshall Field & Company department store in Chicago.

I haven't listened to Rattle's performance of the X based on Deryck Cooke's preparation, but all my friends keep telling me that I should buy it. It's hard to believe that one can do better than Imbal.I had the chance to attend several concerts lead by the Isareli maestro, and each one of these events were great, especially when he conducted Mahler. I think that his reading of Mahler's music is essential and clean. You can hear every single note on the score played perfectly. If you read what Mahler wrote about the way his music had to be perofrmed, you will find Imbal very faithful to the Austrian composer's aesthetic concepiton. Imbal conduct the X as much as the I, the V or the IX as if he were almost Mahler himself.If you like a less spectacular and morbid symphonic sound, typical of Bernstein's rendition of Mahler's symphonies (which I personally adore as well), you must try Imbal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift of Time","review":"Watch is nice looking and reasonably priced.

When I saw this on the internet it looked lovely. However, when it came in the mail, I was very disappointed. For one thing the glass bowl resembles more of a fish bowl than a punch bowl. Also, one of the glasses cannot stand up on it's own without liquid in it. The handle on the glass is too large causing it to be off balance. I would have returned it, but it was the only option I had at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very careful with it.","review":"I agree with the reviewer earlier, it is definitely way too thin. I used this punch bowl only once, and it was beautiful. What I liked most about it was it was big enough so I didn't have to constantly refill it, it was very simple to look at and it was inexpensive. I was extremely careful with it, pulling it out of the box carefully, washing very slowly and gently. However when I wanted to use it a second time, as I was gently pulling it out of the box like the first time, the top just cracked in my hand and the glass went right into my thumb almost slicing it in half.

I've been looking for a good desktop keyboard with integrated touchpad. Adesso is pretty much the only manufacturer making full keyboards with touchpads, which is great. Unfortuantely, their product is not. The keyboard itself is a mushy unpleasant experience. The touchpad, when it works, isn't too bad.

To call this \\"technology\\" would be an insult to anyone working in the High Tech Industry. Within 2 days of purchase, the screws on the back of the keyboard started to fall out; within 4 days of purchase, the keys started to \\"stick\\" and became very difficult to use; within 7 days of purchase, the keyboard stopped functioning properly and would wildly perform commands that were not the commands that were being \\"keyed\\" on the keyboard; within 10 days of purchase, the keyboard started to break down more regularly and could no longer function in a trustworthy manner; on the 11th day of purchase, the keyboard was thrown in the trash!Save your money and don't buy this. The Touch-Pad funtion is really nice, which is why I purchased this, but if the keyboard doesn't work, it doesn't matter what neat function is on it, it still won't work!Don't buy this, unless you too want to throw your money away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"like this","review":"One of the few I could find with an integrated trackpad.

If there's a romantic concerto in the repertoire that could really be mishandled by a young player, it would be this one - but somehow Menuhin, even at that age, has managed to express the poignancy and nostalgia of the music better than anyone ever has. Of course, the disc is not without flaws. As has been noted, you can hear the squeaking and junk from the transfer, and there are some absolutely horrendous errors in ensemble between soloist and orchestra. I've heard one of Kennedy's recordings and also Perlman's. For the most part, Perlman generally doesn't get a character that I really like, and the slow tempo in Kennedy's last movement kind of bothers me. I've also heard Shaham do this concerto live on radio with Cleveland Orchestra I believe, and it was really great. Someone should convince him to commit it to CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing recording.","review":"I hoped this recording would have been acceptable; EMI and their Great Recordings of the Century cds are normally economical and musical, but this album is not good. The recording has some hiss, which is to be expected as the master was recorded around 1930, but there is horrific distortion at the climaxes in the music which is not acceptable. This recording was conducted by the composer, but the orchestra is less than adequate; for example, the violins are sliding into pitches almost constantly through the variations, particularly Nimrod. The effect is, to me, nauseating. There are much better recordings of these pieces to order, unless perhaps, you are purchasing it for historical reasons (Elgar conducting) or for the solo violinist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death, Taxes and Leaky Waders","review":"I splurged on this book without knowing anything about John Gierach (sacrilege?), and felt like I'd discovered America.

I am an avid fisherman, which is why I first bought one of his books, but it didn't take long to realize that his essays are only partly about fishing. For example, I read his essay about rock bass in this book first because I frankly didn't have a clue what a rock bass was. When I finished reading it, I spent a good half hour contemplating my sense of \\"place\\" and reflected long and hard about where I live and why I live there. A well crafted fishing essay took me on this journey and it turned out that the destination was far more interesting than the rock bass that fist pulled me in.Gierach sets the reader down on a path, points out a direction, and then trusts the reader to get to wherever he or she is going to go.

He also makes clear that cheerfulness and joy are hallmarks of holiness. So much for the stereotype of holiness as bleak drudgery. The book displays the deep experience of Van Zeller.

There were some steps in the game that seemed completely bizarre, and I really would not have figured out what they wanted me to do without reading an online game faq.

They had lots more hits later that decade and there are more comprehensive hits collections available. But this one captures them when their music was still fresh and innovative - the ska period proper. Always the least serious of all the Two Tone bands, Madness were clearly in it for the fun as their happy, bouncy music demonstrates. The Prince, their tribute to Ska legend Prince Buster, and their theme song Madness, have propulsive rhythms and there's catchy hooks aplenty throughout the album. My favourites include Night Boat To Cairo, One Step Beyond and Return Of The Las Palmas 7. They never established themselves in the USA but did have one major and one minor hit there. Together with their Two Tone stable mates The Special, The Selecter and The (English) Beat, Madness made rock history and their best work remains delightful today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madness for those on the go...","review":"Road trips are wonderful things. They do, however, require a bit of forethought. If you could take only one tape with you (anyone remember cassettes?), this would be the one to have on those extended drives. Upon its release, Complete Madness was the band's capping acheivement, a brilliant compilation put out before the phenomenal success of 'Our House.' It contains the wonderful 'It Must be Love,' the hard to find, 'House of Fun,' and the rarer still 'In the City,' a song featured in a Japanese car commecial circa early eighties. Nutty pleasure to the extreme. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album! Good to be back!","review":"This is album is a welcome return for Smile Empty Soul and the new rock sound.

Therefore, the idea of having a cordless wet/dry vacuum cleaner was quite appealing, as you could in principle vaccum spills at once. However, the B&D; Wet/Dry DustBuster proved to be quite useless for this purpose. The dust/water container fills up quite rapidly, becoming full with about 2 fl. oz. of liquid. When the container fills up with water (or wine, or whatever nasty stuff you're vacuuming), the liquid passes through the sponge filter, literally hitting the fan. The outcome: the nasty stuff you're vacuuming sprays in a thin mist all over the place (an you).Pros: portable, powerful, cordless.Cons: small dust/liquid container; bad design allows for overfilled liquids to be sprayed.Botton line: ok for small dust jobs; worse than useless for spills larger than 2 oz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good vac for its price, use sparingly","review":"I bought mine almost two years now, and I am pleased to tell you that it is still running just fine!

It easily lasts ten minutes today. This vac I find is great for chasing after a two-year-old's droppings. Crackers, snacks, dirt piles, grass clippings, you name it, it is much faster than getting out a broom everytime. The downside is that the filter needs to be cleaned often, probably everytime you decide to empty the canister.

Application is easy, and it has fulfilled its main purpose (protecting the screen) as far as I can tell, but the two weaknesses I noted are enough to conclude that this is a poor product that I will probably replace with a different screen protector.Update: I switched to a Clarivue (\\"ultra clear\\") screen protector, and it's much better -- no bubbles, fits perfectly, does not ruin the vividness of the N1 display. They also have an anti-glare one that I can't vouch for, but it may be a good alternative to those who are adamant about having anti-glare finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails on one vital aspect","review":"This is a quality product in most respects. Packaging is good, it comes with an applicator card (because nobody has a small piece of plastic) and a little cleaning cloth, which is great. Application was easy but shows a tiny flaw - the thing isn't the exact size as the Nexus One screen. Yeah, it covers the entire touch area but you'll be leaving a small border on the side(s).The screen protector's surface is somewhat rough, which apparently helps prevent glare and feels kinda nice.Sadly, it also prevents solid colours form being solid. They all appear to have diffused pixels on them, kind of like spraying a fine mist on the phone (I wish I could attach a photo).This screen protector makes the Nexus One's beautiful, beautiful screen appear utterly terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The Battlefield 2 series on PC is just one word - Outstanding! I still play the original with my buddies most evenings especially on weekends. After a hard days work there nothing better than shooting up stuff to release the stress.Originally we tried to download from EA download client(which sucks, lost my $10) but it's better to have the CD in case you need to reinstall. Best maps are Warlord and Ghost town.Anyways, remember it's an expansion pack and requires the main BF2 game installed. One of the best first-person shooters ever created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I found out it best to install bf2 ,then special forces then patch.That way you don't have to reinstall bf2.It has some sweet rides to go with it.

You may or may not be able to play it due to serious errors due to memory management. Patches routinely fail requiring a complete uninstall or manual uninstall with a registry edit. It took me 20+ hours of tweaking to get the patches to work and after patching I got a memory.dll sanity check error (no I'm not kidding, google it) and it still will not work. The thing that really gets me is that my system FAR exceeds the minimum requirement, in fact it exceeds the recommended requirements and my video card is spicifically named as supported."},{"rating":"1","title":"No One Home","review":"Game had a lot of installation problems. No help from EA cust. support. Tried install on a different system.

Now I wonder why I bothered. Game is very buggy but it looks fantastic in the screenshots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry... EA Stinks on this one too.","review":"If you want to spend 30 bucks to get to the top of building, go for it.Otherwise, it's just a way to make everything so dark and nasty that you don't want to play. It really is bad.And, by the way, anytime you buy the online version you should just buy a club and beat yourself up too. EA does the worst online purchase of games possible. They really stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game really stinks","review":"This game refuses to load! I sat at the optimizing shaders screen for over an hour with no results. Most of the time it stops loading at 62%, other times it even stops at 15%. EA won't reply to my emails at technical support.It's too bad, cause I run some pretty nice machinery, too.Furthermore, even if I could play it, I probably wouldn't want to, since the subject of the game is pretty stupid. Instead of all-out war, it's covert operations. Better to just buy the Rainbow Six franchise for that. At least they do a better job at game design."},{"rating":"2","title":"BF2 Special Forces.....Girthy.","review":"I have been around FPS games for 7 years now. The idea of expansion packs sets PC games apart from console games. In BF1942 there was only one good expansion pack as I saw it. In Road to Rome BF1942 was expanded upon in a natural progresion. It made sence and the gameplay was helped along by adding new armies, vehicles and maps. But it was not a real departure from vanilla BF1942. When Secret Weapons was released al it did was add lame jets and jet packs. GIMICK!!!!!.So in my opinion the special forces expansion pack for BF2 is much like Road to Rome for BF1942. It is not way out and is a natural progression for BF2 to follow. There is no \\"experemental\\" junk for anyone to argue about and it is very realistic.Overall the Special Forces expansion pack is very good and due to patching and fixes it will only get better. Go buy it and if you dont like it then complain. If you havent bought it and complain you need to go lay down in the street adn practice getting run over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple review","review":"Ok, first off this is a great game...it really is. However, just like BF2 when it came out, it was buggy as sin. This is no different. I have so far only been able to run a stable game for about 10 - 15 minutes on select maps before the game crashes to desktop. And no, i assure you before you assume, its not my hardware. Hardware wise, i'm top of the line. However I did hear a rumor about BF2 pulls almost 1gb of RAM when set on high. But like I said, great game (as far as ive played it.) Just wait a patch or two to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"BF2: Special Forces is an incredible expansion for an incredible game.

The game has a hard time loading and I have the latest and \\"greatest\\" in speed etc of a machine. The frame rates stink, the patch for a \\"fix\\" has to be downloaded and takes a L_O_N_G time. There are bugs throughout the game. A real disappointment from EA Games. Unless you have 30 bucks to throw away, and lots of time to waste sitting at your pc trying to fix bugs don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"BF2 Player","review":"I bought this add on as soon as it came out. I was happy with the new content and maps. I was also suprised to see that some of the weapons carried back into the original BF2 like the flashbangs for instance. The only problems after installation I had were having to reinstall the 1.12 patch after my SF installation. I had performance issues the original game but cleared all those when I added a second gig of ram."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad.","review":"Got it the day it was released. If you want my full review read my review of BF2. Not bad but lacking in some areas. I mainly play this over BF2 since I played that game to death even though it is great. The night maps suck, the night vision works well in the dark but if you get into the light it nearly blinds you. I mainly stick to the day maps they are good. I wish they would make day version of the night maps since they would then be good. I like the grappleing hook and zip line. Overall worth your time if you are getting tired of BF2 and want some new maps to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Skin","review":"Dont waste your money! This game is just collection of skins. The maps are exactly the same only with rearranged buildings. I bought this around christmas and have played it probably 5 times total. The characters look pretty cool, but ultimately the gameplay has not changed for the better at all. This is just a gimmick pulled by EA and DICE to pump you for cash. The only real change in the gameplay is the incorporation of night maps. You are given night vision as well as a few other nifty trinkets that you seldomly use.Take my advice and don't waste your hard earned cash on a pointless scam to get more money for more nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like it but hate the bugs and lack of support","review":"I am still playing the game, but with this add-on now during game play I can expect my PC to crash more, extreme lag, and my personel favorite being kick off a server after joining a battle for 5-10 secs into the game for any reason though not the correct one.The game is overprice and the tech support is horrible (They ignore you).

As noted by another reviewer, you really do need to follow the directions, but they're not complicated. If done properly, the results are a flawlessly clean screen without any smudges.I prefer these to the kits with the spray bottle and the wipes because you know that the polishing cloths have not become contaminated with any grit from a previous cleaning.I also think that the 2-step process is key -- relying upon some sort of wet cleaner to just evaporate is a recipe for streaks. With this kit, using the dry cloth before the residue from the wet has dried will produce a streak-free finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"This product is great for cleaning TV and computer screens.

I remember seeing a music video in 1990 for the song \\"Gotta Lotta Luv\\" on BET and I loved it. I went out and bought the cassette immediately, and I never ever remember hearing any of the trax on any local radio stations in town. If you like his signature song \\"Cause I Love You\\", then give this a listen, you won't be disappointed. It has the slow grooves that he is known for such as \\"It's Time\\" and \\"Hear's A Ticket\\" to funky trax like \\"Get Loose\\" and the song I mentioned earlier \\"Gotta Lotta Luv\\".

Anything more and you had to take it slow or the engine would bog down. Stinky machine. My wife complained that my jacket smelled after I cleaned the drive. That's from the 2 cycle gas/oil mix. Even new, it took several pulls to get it to start. Had to resort to starter fluid to get it to start.

Yes this Toro is narrow requiring more passes but using it doesn't' even seem like work so it doesn't really matter. For the price you can get into a low end MTD thrower but after asking the repair shop what they would buy of the two they said Toro because they are easy to repair and therefore cost less to repair.

I just used it in the snow storm today and it does a nice job. In places snow had blown to over 15\\" deep. It takes a little longer than a larger unit but gets through the deep parts with no problems. As with any unit the second pass is much easier than the first. If you tilt the unit the paddles grab the ground and it will help propel itself making life that much easier.As far as the hard to start comments. This unit has a choke but lacks any throttle control, it's always full. I believe it tends to flood easily if over primed. Then it takes a while to clear because it's under full throttle. Try starting with two pumps of the primer and don't over do it. The electric start is very nice as well.4-stars because: Unit is not listed on TORO wesbite and very hard to get info about it.

My personal choice as his best (and among the best in all of science fiction) is Who Goes There, later made into a movie but don't go there.

I am at peace with the world when the strains of Jerry's guitar filter through my home.Jerry Barlow is also a consummate performer, so if you ever get the chance to hear him play, don't pass it up! His music conjures the image of a totally intense artist, but he surprises everyone with an immensely engaging personality. He is at once talented, humorous, comforting, likeable. Ultimately Jerry \\"connects\\" with audience members...giving each the feeling of somehow having participated in the performance.I am eagerly awaiting the second CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent acoustic guitarist","review":"This should be a \\"must\\" for anyone loving acoustic guitar.

Well, the file is nearly 140 Megabytes and will not fit on your Kindle drive unless it's practically empty. I downloaded and transferred via USB to my 2 Gigabyte SD card. It does have a Table of Contents but it has only one entry for the entire encyclopedia, so everything you want to look up has to be done using Search (which would be reasonable for an encyclopedia). After leaving the Kindle run for several hours to create the Search index I had no luck. I consulted Kindle Support via email and was told that it would take over eight hours to index the file for searching. I left my Kindle on (with AC adapter) for over twenty hours (just to make sure) and it still wasn't searchable so I deleted it from the SD card. Too bad. It would have made a great portable reference tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful, understandable material for important topics","review":"I found the book to be one of the most readable and clear out of the dozen or so books that I have read on Hi-tech startup.

Mike Baird's book is the most comprehensive and well-written book I have seen for the high-tech entrepreneur, covering all bases from the beginning to the end. All too often, several \\"guide\\" books will leave out very important stages/aspects, but Baird's book gives the best of examples, templates, case studies, opinions, equations, tables, etc. -- yet VERY succinct and specific.

The copyrights for recorded material only lasts for 50 years in Europe, so many of Elvis early recordings have become \\"public domain\\" in Europe, meaning that any record company can make copies of them and release them.

Since Renate Bethge is/was Bonhoeffer's niece the book is very trustworthy and gives good insight. However, the book's 86 pages of text could no doubt be shortened to 25 pages merely by lessening the margin space. The format of the book would fit poetry better than a biography. A slow reader, like the the writer of this review, can read the book in 1hr 20 min. The reason I bought this book was because I didn't know much about Bonhoeffer and thought this book, being under 100 pages might be more fitting than an 800 page book. I was disapointed to find there was little in this book which I did not know already.What information this book gives, one can find on the internet for free.If I had a 12 year old son that I wanted to give a constructive reading, this book would be perfect.

This is better than anything I hear on the radio. Well played, well performed, well produced songs that get better and better with each listen, just like rock used to be, instead of this nu-metal crap or whiny emo stuff that's so popular now.Great songs, great players, great band!Chainsaw, from the classic summer school movie with Mark Harmon is in the band, too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsoleted when it came out","review":"I see so many people who brought it in 2003 or 2004 say it's obsolete because they couldn't download the internet lessons.

I called technical support, they told me the internet courses will be available later, since the product is very new at the time I brought it.

Why not teach juice or even soda? Anyways, in the introductory lessons you see adults at the bar and drinking beer and when they ask about drinking, it's \\"wine\\" or \\"beer\\" or \\"coffee\\". -- they should not advertise for 12 and up with so much reference to drinking alcohol.Another thing is that it introduces a few phrases/words for vocabulary that are not common. For example: \\"scorcher\\" -- who says that?Anyways, I do like the bird that teaches grammar -- he is entertaining, but he's only in the introductory lessons thus far, it seems.I use this program to tutor an ESL student in English.

I ordered this book hoping for practical information about creating a funeral service for my mother-in-law, for whom we were providing hospice care in our home.Disappointingly this book did not inspire my creative process. The material was dry and read like a research paper. If I'd been writing a class paper, it would have been a good resource, but its' helpfulness in creating a ceremoney was nil. The use of the \\"mourning needs\\" list, as an organzing force for the different elements of a ceremony stifled creative process. This book would have been more useful if it had included actual ideas and resources for readings, music, eulogies and perhaps outlines of what other people have put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource","review":"Dr Wolfelt's book provides a great resource to understand the realtionship bwtween theceremony and our personal healing during the experience fo death. While the book does not replace the use of a qualifed professional to serve us in our time of bereavement , it does allow for us to recognize the unique needs of grief. With the recognition of our grief come suggestions to help and assit us in healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"persephone is beautifully coherent and lyrical","review":"I agree with most reviews I have read--MTT takes overall a lyrical view of all three works. Persephone benefits most from this. All works clearly exhibit MTT's ability to maintain a rock solid rhythmic pulse. Recordings are clear and well-focused. Since I collect all versions of these works, they were must acquisitions. Now that I've heard them, I'd put all three works near the tops of my \\"lists\\". Haitink's Firebird on Philips provides more shear wonder and beautiful phrasing. Zander's Rite is still very thrilling, though I recall a late 50's Monteux on RCA with the Orch. Paris Cons. that struck me at the time as nearly overwhelming. Igor Markevich's several recordings are similarly in a special class. So, MTT provides intiguing insights into the workings of the Rite's orchestration, but you won't whisper \\"wow\\" at its end. Persephone is, on the other hand, altogether wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for seniors, too!","review":"I love this CD for use with my senior adult day care program. The exercises can be performed in chairs or marching and dancing around the room. The instructions are simple enough for adults with Alzheimer's disease.

There was very little to none- just a lot of raping, killing, cowardice and dying.The main female character was portrayed as a young girl who's ideals and dreams all go up in smoke, but at some point it just seems like she'd get her head together and stop running off to her off-and-on-again fiancee (who happens to be partially responsible for her father's loss of eyesight and eventually his death.)Oh, and the fact that she fell in love with her second captor would be great and all.... if they actually had something besides anger and a lot of lust.I just went into the book expecting a lot more out of it (I don't mean word wise- it was quite longwinded) and came away disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating...","review":"I tried several times to get into this book but about two thirds of the way through it I had to throw in the towel.

Instead, I quit reading about 25% into the book when the heroine is repeatedly raped. My time is valuable and I read historical romances to escape and be uplifted. This book did not do that for me. I was more disturbed than uplifted. So for me, this book was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn out and disturbing","review":"The novel contains many graphic rape scenes. While I have no doubt this occurred frequently during the Civil War, it is not the stuff of romance. Also the plot was incredibly drawn out and the characters not altogether likeable. I read the brief description of what the sequel to this novel was and it is only more drama, and more rape. No thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too drawn out!","review":"This had the potential to be a great read but failed. I read the whole thing just to get to the end but it was waaayyy over done. What could have been a rapturous read was choppy and it just beat a dead horse. The main character was this awesome headstrong woman caught up in the war. Her loyalty shines throughout, a plus, however the author turns on her about three quarters through when during an attempted rape she starts to enjoy it and it becomes sickening. Too many twists following the same path! About half thie detail taken out and the bit about her body betraying her removed and it would be a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love and War","review":"Terrible book.

This book was not worth the money--in fact I returned it, and I hardly ever return a book. The title implies to me, at least, that there are tests in the book you can take, and then you can match the results to various careers. The test consist of psychological questions, and after you finish taking them, evidenly you are suppose to figure them out, with no guidance. It doesn't even give the HINT of what careers you may be suited for--there is NOTHING about careers in this book.

This book will not help you make meaningful career decisions. Instead it's just a bunch of over-generalized pop-psychology tests that you can take.

I do not think this works at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"might work","review":"Did some quick research on this device and decided not to waste my $$$.

The beep happens, and then the sales pitch begins as usual. There has not been the slightest reduction in the amount of annoyance calls we received. It seems like the product is just as sleazy as the telemarketers it is supposed to combat.

Prior to the Zapper our phone would ring 2-6 times per night with sales calls. We still get the non-computer dialed calls, but our evenings are much quieter now.I bought this device even though by the Summer of 2002 a law will go into effect, here in Colorado, where phone subscribers can put their number on a no-call list. At that time I will be free from the rest of the solicitors. Although, this won't not apply to non-profits and political solicitors! Darn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been zapped","review":"I found the telezapper very easy to hook up and understand but, after less than two weeks I had to unhook it. It also will disconnect you from calls when someone calls you from a payphone and if you have family or friends that use calling cards it zaps them off also. After several diconnects from these types of calls I had to take it back off my phone. I called radio shack where it was purchased and they wouldn't take it back because I didn't have the original packaging. I complained to the manufacturer and they were aware of the problems I was experiencing but,said they did not know it was going to do this until after it was on the market. There is no mention of these problems in any of the information they provide on the telezapper. They also will not refund your money for the product even though it has some serious brawbacks. For me it was [amt] right down the drain. It does cut back the telemarketing calls and much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Getting Telemarketer Calls!","review":"The TeleZapper has been a very poor substitute for Ameritech's Privacy Manager which worked 100% of the time.

I'd recommend looking into alternatives before buying a TeleZapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zapper doesn't zap much for me","review":"I have had the Telezapper hooked up to my phone for about 3 months now, and the telemarketing calls haven't stopped. Just this morning I got yet another call that obviously came from a predictive dialer -- you can tell when there's a momentary delay before the telemarketer comes on the phone -- the very type of call the Telezapper is supposed to intercept! So far my husband and I have yet to experience the silence on the end of the line that indicates a telemarketer's been zapped... and we get a lot of telemarketing calls. I am skeptical that this device really works, and the beep that answers EVERY call is both loud and annoying. I'd say save your [money] and take the phone off the hook during dinner, or just let it ring. Better yet, lobby your congress members and the FCC to establish a national do-not-call list, which would not only be free -- it's our right!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out details","review":"This product does what it claims, with one problem.

My father called me with a calling card and the thing blinked.This unit is so unpredictable and I've had better luck telling telemarketers to simply buzz off.

I told him that it didn't make any tones as described in the manual. He was very unresponsive and said if telemarketers weren't calling it must be working. End of conversation. Well the calls kept coming in. I called again and spoke to someone else. It was determined that it indeed arrived DOA. No offer was made to send it back only to go to the dealer with it. I opened it up and tested the battery. Only 2 volts from the required 3 volts. Off I go to put in another 6 dollars for a battery. OK, now I get the tone.

You will never shop the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It all makes sense now.","review":"Right now I am in school, studying marketing as my major and I am currently in a class strictly about marketing. For our class we were assigned to read this book. I (most of the time being a lazy student) didn't want to read the book. I am so glad that I have started. So far I have not read but half of the book, and am already blown away by all the realistic insight that has been made light by just the first couple of chapters. Walking through different stores has a totally different feel now that I am starting to understand how the creators and marketing teams come up with ideas and new ways to make the buyers notice or not notice products. It almost makes me want to try to avoid (or rather try to) all of the tell signs of marketing. I am quite excited to continue reading the book and to discover what other treasures that it holds relative to the marketing world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"So far, I would have to say I am an avid and interested reader with this book.

Thank you, Paco, for shining a bright light on what everyone takes for granted without really understanding. I can't imagine any retailer not finding something in Why We Buy that he or she doesn't already know and, having applied the knowledge, couldn't recover the cost of the book and the time to read it many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading","review":"I absolutely devoured this book. His advice was helpful, interesting, authoritative, and thought-provoking. Underhill changes the way you look at the retail experience, and he forces anyone even tangentially involved in putting products into consumers hands to rethink how they've been doing it. Forget gut feelings when it comes to what makes for the best packaging. Forget conventional wisdom and tradition when it comes to placement. Underhill shows you what does work well and, more important, gives you the courage to question the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Book About Something We All Do--Shop!","review":"I, for one, will never enter a store again & view shopping in the manner I did before I read this fabulous book. As Underhill points out, it's unfortunate that the people who lay out store floor plans & market products in the stores fall far short of common business sense when it comes to the ins & outs of understanding how consumers shop. Although the book becomes a tad stagnant in the middle, it is well-worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Managers!","review":"If you would enjoy having a shallow and superficial tour of retail stores, this is a great book for you. If you are looking for in-dpeth analysis of why people buy,how people shop,what people do when they shop, etc. so that you can understand shopping patterns, then look else where (like Daniel Millers book - A Theory of Shopping). But for easy answers to difficult problems, this book can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book.","review":"I enjoyed this book immensly, because it examined a practice which we all seem to enjoy, yet we never stop to think about the different theories and practices within the industry. For example, we never think to ourselves how the merchandise is placed so that it is perfectly in our view, and how the store is laid out so that we take in all of the atmosphere and stimulents which are directed towards us. As with all books, the reader will find some parts of this book to be somewhat \\"boring\\", but you will find plenty of instances where you find yourself saying \\"so that is why they do that\\" and \\"gee, i never realized that\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read for Psych Majors","review":"This book appeals in particular to individuals who are interested in marketing, human behavior research, and also to anyone who does a lot of shopping. I happen to belong to all three of these categories and really enjoyed reading this book. I read the book for a research paper about the social psychology of business. It was a pretty easy and fast read and as a female who loves shopping, I was very impressed with Underhill's insights into how women want to experience shopping, for example, that mirrors get women to stay in stores longer and thus buy more things! As a psychology student, it changed the way I thought about research methodology and the kinds of human behaviors that can be studied outside of the lab. The only problem I have with the book is that some of his examples are a bit dated and his chapter about online shopping (and why it will never work) should be updated, since clearly this is not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book or Sales Brochure?!?","review":"Although the subject matter is undeniably interesting, the book's aggregate content is unquestionably remedial.

I think I can count about two pages of gender specific characteristics on purchasing, otherwise this book was anecdote after anecdote of \\"stupid\\" things retailers do. The book's title was extremely misleading. Perhaps \\"How to Sell\\" would have been more appropriate. \\"How to Sell\\" and \\"Why We Buy\\" are two totally different animals.And what's with our author telling us, time and time again, the simple solution to those \\"stupid\\" retailer mistakes while offering no quantitative results to back up his suggestions (which is kind of interesting based on the fact that's what he does for a living).Overall, I feel cheated because our author has insight and knowledge to share that he simple chooses not to.

What are the best ways of displaying various types of goods? What is the best way to appeal to a variety of socio-economic groups? Buzz words and wants for different VALS profiles.

This one is a business book primarily of interest to retailers (although I see similarities in retail and online habits). Paco (and his researchers) followed and recorded the behavior of tens of thousands of shoppers. From this he is able to run a consulting business that makes recommendations to retailers on minor changes they can make to increase their sales.Examples include - Provide a spot for people to sit, especially the person who brought the shopper. Leave parking spots for people at fast food places since 10% of the customers buy then go eat in their car. Children and old ladies are the primary buyers of doggie treats - put them where they can seen and reached.He gives many examples of simple changes that can be made to increase sales.As with all brilliance, many of his observations are obvious.This book is a must read for any retailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not why; but how!","review":"From a laymen's view, it seems like Paco Underhill's methods have merit.

Shoppping is something we all do, to some extent. Mr. Underhill explains some of the ways retailers try to manipulate us into buying more than we planned to in their stores. One of the best things to take away from reading this book is a more critical eye for how the retail establishments you visit are succeeding, or failing, in their efforts to attract your attention and your money.

After reading it, you can't help but look at your operations ion a new light. For example, are brochures important to your business? If so, read about the needs of different demographics and the importance of signage. It's all easily translated to collateral development.This book won't change the world.

What I found was pleasing; a book that not only told me what I needed to know but also gave me an entertaining education in Marketing that few classes at my school have paralleled. Students are forced to read incessantly, but this book was a pleasure to read, and I was not surprised to find out that many professors in the Marketing department already had it.

This book is good if you are just looking for superficial information about where WLAN's are being used and how. It misses the mark entirely if you want details on the physical and the MAC layer. Also there is only a passing mention of the next standard that is expected to take off in the 5.6GHz frequency range (802.11a). It is a ok book if you are unfamiliar with the DS and FH modulation schemes employed in the 2.4GHz range (802.11b)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless LAN's in a nutshell","review":"I found this book to be quite helpful. Each chapter is a new step in getting prepared and setting up a wireless LAN. There is a lot of good information provided in this book, from history of wireless to implementing your wireless. It gives both sides of the network too, the pro's and the con's- most books only do one or the other. In my opinion, this book is designed for both the amateur and the experienced network administrator- basic and technical at the same time. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"better than Lacey but not a lot","review":"They teach that divorce is possible, but not remarriage.

Ms. Prue's depiction of elves is chilling--very unlike the \\"little people\\" we think of as elves, and even very different from the elves in Tolkien's works, who are learned and kind to humans. It's a side of fantasy we don't often see: The side that doesn't include scorcerers or mystical beasts or any of the sort of magic we'd recognise. The cold side. The side ruled by the Sidhe, the Irish elves, ice cold, indifferent, scornful. Far from the kind elves we know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Tom","review":"This book is a good science fiction, calld Cold Tom, by Sally Prue. The nain character in this story was Tom.

They are very narrow and have no shape. You can't even tell which is the left or right foot. The satin is very smooth and pretty and the color is perfect.

She tries to tell you if you have a certain health problem, it's all due to an emotional issue. There is no science involved; which I find ridiculous. We all know certain things are in our genes, that heredity plays a big part in our health.

It runs off two AA batteries. Of course you could use your own rechargeables but you get the point.That being said, I really like that fact because when it runs out of juice, you just pop in new batteries rather than having to charge it. I've owned a lot of powered screwdrivers before and I like some better but this one is still great.I find it awkward to use the forward and reverse buttons where they are located. I prefer the kind of switches where you push the same switch forward or backwards, but that's just personal preference.The reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because for the price, you can get a similar item with a tilt head and this one doesn't have the torque of higher voltage similarly priced items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tool.","review":"Very easy to operate and strong enough to make a tight twist.

No major torque jobs or anything, but by the end of the project the screwdriver was out of power and wouldn't tighten the screws even snug.

It saves a lot of manual work, especially if you're doing a project that would have you using the screwdriver over and over.

I never dropped the necklace or smacked it around but it had one large chip at the end of the point of a flake and another small one.

These songs take one to different spheres, evoking the spirit of different nations while also raising the listener to higher emotional plateaus. All songs are worth a listen; my favorites are \\"Rajna\\", \\"Divine\\", \\"Overwhelmed Beneath Me\\" (which immerses you totally in its sheer femininity), and the crowning achievement, Lycia's \\"Baltica\\".

Get the Angela Lansbury version instead -- she's a lot more beleivable and seasoned than what the \\"Evita has-been\\" attempts to do here. I'm surprised Steve let that one pass. Bernadette Peters should have been the person for this role, no doubt. I've listened to that awful flat over and over again, and it just helplessly stuns me. If you don't believe me, listen carefully to the second bridge to the refrain, and you'll stop listening to this particular recording forever. The New York Philharmonic, naturally, is just exceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Patti. Patti, Patti, Patti. What did you do?","review":"Patti Lupone being one of my all-time favorite singers and Sweeney Todd being one of my all-time favorite musicals, I thought this CD would be a sure thing. Sadly, it isn't so. There are a few things that bother me about this recording, but none more than Ms. Lupone's take on Mrs. Lovett. Ms. Lupone is a great singer but, man, she was just all over the place in this concert. I don't know what happened but it sounds like she spent the entire evening trying to find the character and just never got there. I was sorely disappointed. In a perfect world, I could take George Hearn off this recording and put it on a disc with Angela Lansbury from the original Broadway recording. Patti Lupone is a wonderful performer, but you wouldn't know it if this was the only time you heard her sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about perfection","review":"A fantastic gem and rare treat to have a recording with this cast.

With the vast amount of money used to influence decisions related to medical care, it is impossible to determine if what occurs in A Garden of Magic is not happening right now under our noses. Once independent organizations are now accepting cash for endorsements. How can the general population know where these organization's true motives lie? From syphilis experiments in Alabama to AIDS research in Africa--now cures for cancer--G. Roger James has written a novel that will leave you enlightened, yet entertained. The next time you read of a cure for cancer in the paper, you'll wonder what really transpired behind the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethics or Money","review":"Double thumbs up. Action packed with interesting characters and a great plot. The writer's expertise shows through in the way he handles the medical jargon, physician/patient interaction, and conflicts of issues related to research/development of medical treatments. However, he does not let his professional knowledge bog us down in educantese. The necessary information fits into the story line with nary a snag in the story flow. You become interested in the characters and what happens to them. And the book raises the question internally: How would you react if you had the opportunity to get rich while helping humanity? Would you remain true to your ethics or become willing to overlook seemingly minor ethical issues when so much is riding on the outcome of your work? James gets you out of the gate quickly and keeps you nailed to your chair to see what's up next. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER DISASTROUS COPY CAT","review":"Here we go again.

The tempi are so slow, so unstylistic, so contrived, there is no Latino essence at all in this music. It sounds like quite over pompous salon music. The pianist is terrible. And the sound quality of the disc sounds like she was recorded under the English Channel!As a Cuban, I find the minimization of our great national treasure, Lecuona...offensive in this collection.

Maury Klein has written a well researched, but highly readable account of the last months of James Buchanan's presidency and the beginning of Abraham Lincoln's first term. In vivid detail, Klein discusses the secession crisis in the South, but focuses mostly on South Carolina. Klein gives great mini-biographies of the differing players and uses tons of diaries, letters, and newspaper accounts to really make the story flow. From a research standpoint, the book is history at its best, but it is also great history because it is engaging and lively and you want to just keep reading. If you read just one book on the coming of the Civil War, this might just be the one to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shot heard 'round the world","review":"\\"Days of Defiance\\" deserves to rank with \\"Battle Cry of Freedom,\\" the Pulitzer-winner of a few years back, in its drama, pacing and sense of context. It is among the rare Civil War books that do not wallow in detail, that amplify the poignance of flawed people making decisions the reader knows to be tragic, and that kindle the sense that the story is about America, not about which general charged into which thicket with which regiment. The author picks a tightly circumscribed period in which to tell his story: roughly the five months before the bombardment of Fort Sumter (although he synopsizes the previous half-century to give essential background). The highest praise I can think of for this book is to say that he makes those five months, yes, suspenseful. Follow this book's enigmatic Lincoln into another brilliant Civil War book, \\"Lincoln at Gettysburg,\\" and you have a window into a period truly lit by fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"History that Reads Like a Novel","review":"Maury Klein has done an outstanding job of making the roll up to the Civil War pop off the pages. From the dour last days of the Buchanan administration to the careful balancing of public and private interests by Lincoln, all set against the backdrop of moves by secessionists in South Carolina, Florida and D.C., Klein covers the steps and missteps that might have headed off the war in a manner. This is a fantastic work, written with the critical eye of a historian, but influenced by the wit and timing of a novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"good on the outside, but on the inside...","review":"so i was looking @ the outside of the binder when it arrived and was pretty impressed with how it looked, till i opened it.

Bertie is a King to admire. The man worked very hard with a speech problem to overcome and somehow he managed to rule England during some very hard political times to include WWII. He was never preped on how to be a King as his brother King Edward was trained and ready for the position. This is a must see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bertie and Elizabeth","review":"Purchased this DVD after watching The King's speech and wanted to know more of his story.

Yes, it is not the King's speech, but I LOVE Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), so anything he is in will be the best for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"Once I saw that this had been a masterpiece theater movie I knew that it'd be good. And it was. Nothing OTT, nothing fancy or overly dramatic, just a simple biopic about the Queen Mum (before she was known as the Queen Mum) and her husband. If you've seen the King's Speech, this could almost be a companion piece in that it's the same general storytelling style - understated - and just more expanded than the King's SPeech was (King's Speech just dealt with a few years, this dealt with 20ish)If you're interested in the royal family or maybe you're a teacher wanting to bring a period of time to life, this is a good place to start.

It was fortunate that she did possess a wicked sense of humour.After viewing this film one could imagine something of the private anguish this family endured.It speaks well that the Yorks were so loved by the people and the princess Elizabeth was well grounded for her future role as queen of England.A gentle love story with a mixed blessing as an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bertie and Elizabeth: an overview","review":"Having a thorough knowledge of the events surrounding the life of George VI of England is something of a liability when viewing Bertie and Elizabeth. Although the actress who plays his wife, Queen Elizabeth, bears some slight resemblance to her character, every other actor in this production fails in this respect. In some cases, their lack of credibility cripples this production, and at best, this is a tepid and unsatisfying look at what was an important and dramatic period in England's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen Mum and King George VI","review":"Being an American royalist, I must say that the depiction of the royal family in the turmoil of abdication is well done. Heretofore, the abdication is portrayed as merely romantic. However, there were royal responsibilities and those ultimately fell on King George IV. Much like Princess Diana, although one cannot underestimate her impact on the world, one cannot neglect to recognize what taking upon oneself the implicit responsibilities entail. Very well acted and delightfully portrayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but too short","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much. The characters were well drawn, and it gave a good overview of the marriage of George VI and his consort Elizabeth, later the queen mother. However, the movie was too short to really do justice to all the material. We were moved suddenly from the christening of the future Queen to the introduction of Mrs. Simpson with little notice of the intervening years. The build up to the war was rushed through, lost in the king's anguish over the division between him and his brother. And we see far too little of the princesses as they grow - Elizabeth jumps from 10 to 19 with barely a mention in between. This movie should have been a complete miniseries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short of one DVD","review":"The DVD is excellent. But the mailing service is not recommondated. This DVD is in 2 volume.

Can't give it to my friend a unfinished DVD story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Story...","review":"As the saying goes, behind every great man is a great woman; the story of Bertie & Elizabeth is the very epitome of this statement. Bertie is a shy, stuttering young prince and Elizabeth is the head-strong, beautiful debutante who's caught Bertie's eye. The courtship is brushed over but the married years, which involve the turbulent times of the Royal Family during the abdication, then World War Two, are viewed in-depth.

The shapes are similar and if you have both they could be used together. Like the other reviewers, get the largest set you can afford. A lot of blocks go into the support of the marble track since the long tracks aren't deeply grooved enough to run a marble through once it passes the hole (if you put a long track on a flat surface, the marble goes down the slope, into the hole, then can't flow out unless the track is elevated, so if you just stagger several tracks and think you'll have an easy \\"waterfall\\" effect, it won't work, you will need spacer blocks). Regardless, it's a quality product with a satisfying feel and sound, whether the marbles or the crashing of the blocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and great quality","review":"This is a great solid product that is open for endless hours of creative play.

But Big Rig digs deep into this American subculture and puts a human face on it. Like most of Doug Pray's films (Scratch, Surfwise, Infamy), he makes you understand what's behind the common misconceptions of truckers, so you can come to appreciate their contributions to our daily lives. Unexpectedly entertaining and enlightening at the same time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent storytelling!","review":"This film highlights the stories of professional truck drivers who transport everything from groceries to hospital equipment across America's highways and, in the process, support the livelihood that the rest of us maintain. Director Doug Pray pulls off an outstanding job of portraying his subjects as respectable, hard-working, and passionate individuals who are dedicated to their service and career. I love his work! He has so much passion for his characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheelin & Willin","review":"Saw this two years ago @ Seattle Film Fest (where it won at least one award) and was fascinated, since my previous experience w/ big rigs was from my college hitch hiking days in the mid'70s. What a fresh insight this doc is, and everyone who ever has to share hiways w/ 18 wheelers should see it.I've been waiting not so patiently for its release, and am glad it's available here. But, really, please make DVDs available so I can purchase a heap to give to friends. No, I'm not a big rig driver, just enjoy this slice of life, and the \\"film making\\" aspect was above my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"As an employee for a Landstar dispatching agency, I have come to love drivers. I was looking for a video that would help me see the ins and outs of their side of the equation. This film had very little of that. If I didn't know so many drivers personally, this video would have left me with the impression that one has to have a messed up past, a severe dissatisfaction with the government, or a willingness to sleep with hookers to be a driver. As a flag-waving american who doesn't consider his past to be a total mess, this movie left me with the impression that truck driving is just not for me. The attempt was obviously to gain sympathy for drivers, to put a human side on a society that is sort of labeled as a commodity rather than people. If I didn't know better, I'd walk away thinking all drivers hate the government and have been divorced multiple times. Definitely did not like this approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, not \\"Perfect\\"...","review":"Like the other reviewer, I feel it's difficult to label this CD \\"The Perfect Mozart\\" without including the 25 Symphony. However, that shows how pointless it is to label ANY CD \\"The Perfect Mozart\\" - especially just a single CD. Most of my favorite Mozart isn't on here. It just goes to show how silly it is to think of a Mozart \\"greatest hits\\" album.However, what is important is how the pieces on the album are played and I must say that they are all played well. Much of it is conducted by Neville Mariner, who did the music for the movie Amadeus. I am listening to the CD now and for some reason - possibly because of the irreverent nature of the album - on the computer all the performers are labeled \\"some dumb orchestra\\".All in all, this is not the \\"only\\" Mozart album you will ever need, but it is a good random sampling of some of Wolfgang's catchier tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great companion... is NOT a novilization","review":"Despite what is stated below, this book is in NO WAY a novilization.

The samples sounded good and the reviews were good also. When I received it I discovered a couple of things. First, the band is very good. A cross between the Shins, Weezer, and a few other influences you will probably recognize. But the production was muffled making everything sound very neutral- you can never tell this kinda stuff from the samples. Maybe this is what they were striving for, but it hurts the effort they have put into crafting fine songs. In the end I would recommend this album because they are clearly a good band with huge potential to create fun and original music. But this album could have been better and I hope that next time around the band sounds bigger than a basement recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack of my life!","review":"I live in the \\"Queen City\\" and have attended so many SSLYBY shows.

Read Strauss. Don't read this. There are a bunch of photos of woman with come hither looks(all looking like 80s disco queens), one of which has the women showing thigh. Lowndes helpfully tells us that these looks mean a women is interested and men need to pick up on the looks. No fooling. (Although I have not been blessed by one of the looks. Guess I am toast.) One photo shows a nerdy looking guy being touched by three women and Lowndes says that women touch men they desire. She forgets to say though that many women just touch you to stress a point they are making.(Sure if they play with your hair, that's another thing.) This is dangerous advice. She has tiresome chapters on genetics and early imprinting(she tells the story of a pal of hers who falls for a guy who looked like the pal's dad).

Have to wonder who it is really writing all these positive reviews.

The insightfullness in this book comes from the body language/signals. There are slight details of female thoughts on dating and what they want in their men to be like(all visual perception). If that is what you are looking for then you may be fulfilled by this book on that part. I am giving this book this score because I have to rate it against the genre of material as a whole. Thus 2 stars out of a material of content and context of 5 stars.Don't read this book for anything else. There are no conversational tools. There are no true insights to the female mind, like what she says and what she really means/wants.

Some of the advice is not bad but its can all be boiled down to about 20 pgs, the rest is filler of jokes and wit and humor that she thinks makes her fun, wich is kinda true but not for people who are looking for some answers, her style of writing is best for an advice column in a newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book full of useable information.","review":"I think this books really teaches a man how to know when a woman wants him to approach her.

I think I sometimes noticed the positive and negative responsive before subconsciously, now I'm much more aware of the reaction on a conscious level.

It will even take a chunk out of you if you're just not paying attention and lowering it to your side. This is unacceptable. DO NOT BUY THIS. Another problem is that the backside drywall blade is very dull, making it inefficient when seeking to split and rip wallboard. Although it's otherwise a well-made and balanced tool, those two design flaws prevent it from being useful for more than single-use jobs. A much better choice is to go with theDead On 18-Inch Annihilator Bar. It comes with a brilliant spike that allows you to punch through a wall quickly and accurately to see where the wiring is.

We sell a lot of them at the lumber yard/hardware store I work at.It has one huge, fundamental flaw, which I can't say I'm surprised by, considering that Stanley is pretty much a Chinese name anymore. The flaw is that this hammer was made for lefties when the construction industry is dominated by righties. How do I know this? Look at the curve in the pry bar. The teeth scrape against the inside of your right arm when you hammer with it. Sure, you could have your wrist bent so the teeth fit into your wrist, but I don't find that comfortable, as bend my wrist and elbow when I hammer.It was also noted by someone that the hammer head isn't ground.

That's what he meant.\\" The content is good- layout is bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very good book for Algorithmic Techniques","review":"I don't agree with the other reviews. This book is a serious one and it is a \\"smooth\\" version of \\"Algorithms: Theory and Practice\\" from the same authors, which has a 5 stars rate. The book don't teach how to program, but the main kind of techniques in algorithm design (Greedy, Divide and Conquer and Dynamic Programing techniques, and others like Backtracking, Probabilistic Algorithms, etc.). I teach a course of Algorithm Design with this book (having the Sedgewick and Cormen books like additional very good references) and I think that it is a very instructive course on algorithmics (but NOT in programming, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I didn't like the organization of the book. It starts with page after page of the mathematics used to analyze algorithms. This could be shortened considerably. Then an analysis of some multiplication algorithms which are poorly explained. Most explanations are long winded and the pseudocode isn't that great. The one section that is o.k. is on probabilistic algorithms, including prime number generation and a little cryptology. In general there are many better books of this kind (Sedgewick, Baase, Corman, Aho, etc.)so that one wonders why this book is even out there. Maybe the author feels that organizing the book based on algorithmic technique as opposed to algorithmic function will help the reader. Sometimes it's just annoying since things like sorting are spread all over the book depending on the techniques used for the sort. Choose another book for algorithms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obtuse, incomplete explanations","review":"I had the misfortune of enduring this book during a graduate level course in algorithm analysis. Bad writing and incomplete explanations make the book a bad choice to learn this complex topic. Most of the itricate and particularly tricky parts of various proofs are left as \\"exercise to the reader\\"! Why bother when there are so many better ones to choose from?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutsy and Funny","review":"I enjoyed every minute of this very funny but cute comedy between Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee who kept the crazziness going all thru the movie. I laughed alot and will recommend this movie to anyone who could appreciate a cute love story that can keep a smile on your face with an unexpected ending. The friends of both Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin was just as funny and I enjoyed them also. I am very happy I purchased this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun stuff - Darin/Dee's second best","review":"My second favorite of the three Darin/Dee comedies, and the last one they filmed. Obviously not Shakespear, but cute premise and good supporting cast, and great chemistry between the two leads. Esp good is Donald O'Connor, one of Darin's real life heros. It's great to see them work together.It also demonstrates that Darin's considerable songwriting talent peaked when he was commissioned to write a song for a specific context, as occured in many of his movies. The resulting theme song here, That Funny Feeling, is really wonderful and infectious.Recommended for fans of Darin, Dee, or just fans of goofy romantic comedies in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought these films for a friend who lives in Belgium and when she went to play them it says she was forbidden to view them as they lived in the wrong zone.

Fortunately I know someone who can break the code and allow her to view them. But what a hassle.

The scene is New York City and Jane is a young maid-for-hire; having met Tom she is too embarrased to have him see her tiny apartment so she takes him to a very nice apartment, i.e. one that she cleans. What she doesn't know though is that this grand place is really his; he goes right along with this deception until she stubles accross the truth of the situation. Feeling greatly deceived, she sets out to exact her revenge; this proves, though, that love happens in the most unexpected places under the most humerous of circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing movie","review":"The family enjoyed this movie.

When I finally got it I found it was completely useless.I got a 5.5 on the TWE, and I can tell you the exam is not about memorizing patterns as this book tries to teach. You just need to know about grammar and how to answer the question you are asked in a standard way.Besides missing the objective of the exam, the size of the pages and the font used make the book unreadable.I strongly recommend you Barron's \\"How to Prepare for the Computer-Based Toefl Essay: Test of English As a Foreign Language\\" instead of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Hoffman at Club Med","review":"The story flowes very fast without a confusion of suspects and misleading red herrings.

Sources that are mentioned in the text are not in the index nor clearly explained.As an example the source I know as the \\"Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature\\" was mentioned, more than once, under an odd acronym and I did not find any explanation or comment on the acronym or the different title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too narrow in focus, and dated.","review":"If your brick walls are the immigrant generation, do yourself a favor and get a book specializing in that country's research rather than this one. Despite the 2005 copyright, the majority of the advice would have still held true a decade ago. And the emphasis on early American record issues is a real minus for those with later arriving ancestors. Despite the introduction's suggestion, the problem-solving techniques alone weren't worth the lack of examples in my problem areas.However, if you've been working on your genealogy for decades, need a refresher, and are working on your DAR application... you might love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book, different from the rest","review":"I just finished reading this book and I loved it!

But this is bulk sci-fi at its best. It takes a story that has been written at least a dozen times, and remakes it in a way that is very readable and entertaining. The main characters are from a tribe of superwarriors who have to fight much stronger and better equipt enemies. While this is a plot that has been made several times, and by better authors, this books works like most saturday action movies that Hollywood creates. It's not that thought provoking and you know what is going to happen but it is still good entertainment for a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Guide to Writing","review":"Oxford always comes through with reference books that you need.

Apart from Smith, Moreno on Glossa also offers a better introduction to De Visee's fine music than Monteilhet. However, Monteilhet does offer some pieces unavailable elsewhere, which earns him some merit for good intentions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best standups out there","review":"I love this special, the entire set is AMAZING, it's structured without feeling like it, and it's is just plain hilarious.

I'm so glad that I didn't pay for this. The first few minutes were spent with him screaming about how fat people should die of the swine flu because fat people somehow are so annoying to him that they don't deserve to exist. I generally don't like comedians who rely on fat jokes, racist jokes, bathroom humor or the like. The cursing doesn't bother me, but it seems like he relied on it so much to be edgy. Maybe I'm just not in a good mood right now, but I stopped it within a few minutes. I may give it another shot at another time and give it a higher review since I didn't watch all of it. He annoyed me within minutes. By the way, everyone who has given an unfavorable review has had hoardes of his fans reply with hateful comments disparaging them. Save your breath.

The action and acting were very well done. The characters of Van Helsing and Anna were well matched and enjoyable to watch. The depiction of the creatures (including Dracula) were some of the best that I have seen. Hugh Jackman's (Van Helsing) acting was excellent, especially when he said \\"Ladies first\\" to Kate Beckinsale (Anna).

It takes place in a parallel universe where all monsters of literature live and interact with each other and kill each other and die (maybe). Hugh Jackman is so pretty as Van Helsing, NOT the one from literature, who **** SPOILERS ***** turns out to be the Angel Gabriel with memory loss and who also becomes a werewolf and bites Dracula on the neck. I hope by now you have quit expecting a dreary fantasy drama. Unlike with Star Rings and Lord of the Wars, this one really doesn't feel like a video game for boys. This is a breathless romp (bated breath, not no-breath-dead), with lovely hunk Jackman, fun sidekicks, beautiful babes with brains, furry animals, oceans, mountains, forests, castles, the Vatican, you name it.

Particularly the opening sequence, where Dracula's deceptively attractive face is overlaid by flashes of a horrifying monster, and it becomes very clear that this vampire has none of the sweet, cuddly qualities so common in many modern vampire depictions - he is utterly evil.But besides Dracula?

Better yet, you can turn on the mute button and watch the movie with no sound at all, so you won't have to endure the poor acting and ridiculous dialogue.

What does Frankenstien have to do with Vampires? Van Helsing is a serial killer that gets hired to kill monsters. I saw it in a movie thearter for a birthday and I wanted to leave but I couldnt.

Almost non-stop action the whole time- unfortunately this gets repetitive after a while, as do the computer-generated affects, some of which, particularly the brides of Dracula, are admitedly impressive. However, others such as the Mr. Hyde CG character looked more like something out of 'Shrek'. Beckinsale's accent was cartoonish. Her and Jackman's acting talents are mostly wasted as there is little character developement. And the plot--Dracula needs Frankenstein to give life to his thousands of dead vampire babies.

First off when the movie starts off it seams like some sort of spoof film based on the old frankenstein movie. Once the black and white section ends it starts to get a little better.

Anyone who has ever seen an action/horror film should not watch this movie. It is by far the worst movie I have seen in recent years. I recently purchased the Legacy Collection and it pains me that the Van Helsing movie is even mentioned on the DVD's of these timeless classics. They are works of art and this is a piece of garbage. The plot is ridiculous and the CG is lousy. The most appauling thing is the actors struggling through every scene while trying to maintain their horrible over the top accents. Anyone who is thinking of seeing this movie should use the money to invest in the classic DVD set instead because Van Helsing is a travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad, Sad Little Movie.","review":"Van Helsing was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

It was so bad they didn't even bother to make a sequel (guess you don't know everything, amazon reviewer guy).I think my issues with this movie could be summed up easily enough by the fact that this is supposedly a VAMPIRE movie, yet there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting concept, dud follow-thru","review":"The concept was a dream for monster fans -- combine Werewolves, Frankenstein (Shuler Hensley), Jeckel/Hyde, and Dracula, with Bram Stoker's vampire-chaser Van Helsing, adapting Van Helsing into a young man, with Hugh Jackman to play him. Then feature lots and lots and lots of Dracula's Brides screaming through the air against green-screen. And miss out on many possible expositional scenes. One of the few movies I've wondered when it would mercifully end, and I'm a Hugh Jackman fan. My son and I kept saying, \\"But why didn't they . . .?\\" -- show, not tell, and my daughter-in-law shrugging, \\"It was what it was.\\" What it was was a mess. When the TV \\"Making Of\\" feature was more exciting than the film, Houston, we have a problem. Read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Helsing against the Cartoon People","review":"Somehow they managed to get beautiful fresh-faced Kate Beckinsdale and lather enough make-up on her to make her a candidate for Madame Tussaud's wax museum. A bit to aggressive with the hair curling thingie didn't help either. No lead had enough \\"quiet\\" time in which to establish a character...they had the depth of Playstation 3 people. All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in \\"dark-o-vision\\"...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here. We've seen enough how movies are made specials that we are bored by CG cartoons. The \\"face in the sky\\" ending was embarressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it -5 stars if I coul","review":"This movie is a ******* mess... if Shelley and Stoker were here w/ us, they would probably commit suicide after watching this terrible movie. It's just the worst distortion of the original stories I've ever seen. Yes, the special effects are great; yes, Hugh Jackman portrays Van Helsing in a very \\"Wolverine\\" way and yes, Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous; but this movie represents a literary crime in the worst degree... What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The producers spent lots of money for a turkey of a movie...","review":"I think movies have been steadily getting worse overall for the last couple of years. It seems like Hollywood must think that the public is so dumb that they'll go see anything with a big budget and lots of special effects. They forgot about having a decent story on this one. It's not the actors fault; I love Kate Beckinsale, Hugh is good as Wolverine, and the Dracula guy is actually pretty cool, but the plot sucks. I saw this at a matinee and still felt like I wasted my money. Don't buy this, rent it if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"good comedy, even kind of gooffy","review":"A more than queer Dracula, a clumsy good-for-nothing Frankenstein's monster, a hideously exaggerated Mr. Hyde, a lot of alien like (born from hanging insect chrysalides?) baby vampires and three subnormal bimbo Dracula's brides make me laugh so much I though I would drop dead.Nice special effects, although too much computer stuff (that justifies the extra star. would rate it one instead)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing but worth watching","review":"After waiting months for this movie to be released, I was disappointed with it considering i am a huge fan of vampire movies! It is worth a watch as it is a pretty good movie but it is no way this years blockbuster! My friend has seen it twice simply because she has a huge crush on Hugh Jackman! Other than that she agrees that when going to the cinema The day after tomorrow is a much better choice! But go check this movie out anyway if you enjoy dracula movies as this is quite an original intake on Dracula story."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive mistake","review":"Films like this really should not have millions wasted on their being made, and the box office returns really did not much make up for it. Overall this movie is crap-tacular (though not as crap-tacular as if the events of this film were to occur in real life.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTION SEQUENCES HELP ELEVATE CLICHED STORY!","review":"When one watches \\"Van Helsing,\\" one experiences an adrenaline rush as if riding a roller coaster or bungee jumping off a high bridge! The action sequences are breathtaking, and those are the best things about the movie. The story, sad to say, borrows everything from old horror stories like \\"Dracula,\\" \\"Frankenstein,\\" \\"The Wolf Man,\\" and \\"Jekyll and Hyde.\\" But the plotline is more similar to the many James Bond adventures, especially the fact that Van Helsing (a \\"Bond-ish\\" performance by Hugh Jackman) works for a secret agency run by the Vatican assigned to take out monsters, complete with a Q-like Monk named Carl (David Wenham of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fame) and an M-like Cardinal. The cast do what they can in the film, with Kate Beckinsale (be she ever so fine) giving the film's best performance. The story is unoriginal, but when the action sequences occur, \\"Van Helsing\\" is one wild ride!Movie/DVD Grade: B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak movie skinned with good looking CG","review":"the directing of this movie is really poor, the the camera always rotate insanely fast anytime you found something flying in sky, which when you realise that later it looked really boring because its like telling you straightly this part is done in CGI and its fake so it spin so fast so you dun find the glitches in details... so poor, the directing is a big time sucker, the director is the worse i've seen for doing this kind of big bugget movie, the whole drop bored even they managed to give you CGI thril every couple of minutes. Dracula - the Bram Stocker one from 10 years ago is absolutely better than this crap, such a pitty.. more of these the holywood will drop dead liek these vampires.. 2 stars are all given to CGI studio, zero for anything else involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"I watched the clock hoping that it would end quickly and put me out of my misery.Complete disaster. I found myself laughing although it is certainly not intended asa comedy. Jackman and Beckinsale must have gotten huge paydays to agree to be partof this garbage. The acting is so bad, and the characters so undeveloped, that at the end,you honestly don't care who wins or if they all die. You just want it to end. Even the CGeffects are poor when compared to other films of similar genre. Take my advice, save yourmoney, and just stick some needles under your fingernails instead to get the same amountof enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen","review":"This is, hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Painstaking Film To Watch","review":"This movie is the very definition of style over substance. In fact there ultimatly is no substance whatsoever that I could find. A dull parade of special effects wrapped around over acting and pure juvenile silliness. Hugh Jackman is great in the X-Men movies but he should have left this script out on the back porch and let the sun eat away at the pages, come to think of it that would probably have made a better movie than Van Helsing turned out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am your average movie goer- I love garbage","review":"Any review that tells that you must love this film BECAUSE its absolutely stupid garbage is a joke. This movie is a joke. A very unfunny two hour joke. The cast, the acting, the action, the script, the direction, the special effects. Its 200 million dollars thrown down the toilet. This is not camp. Camp is intentional. This is a complete mess. A ship worthy of going down with the Titanic. A waste of Hugh Jackmans talent and time. If you must lower your IQ to enjoy a film, that is a sad state of affairs. This is why hollywood continues to give us garbage because there are those that eat it and call it candy.But hey you must love it...because its stupid and terrible. But thats why its good, right?(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to its potential","review":"I was suprised I disliked it because going into the movie I was very open to the concept. I happened to be in the mood for some vampire-killing. What disappointed me was, instead, giant plot holes and action-scene overload. Not to mention it seemed to be a full moon every three to four days!The movie doesn't let the character of Van Helsing develop to his full potential. He is very mysterious and you do find out more about his history as the movie progresses, but I feel more time should have been devoted, instead, to his background as a slayer rather than the mission at hand. There is very little opportunity for any dialogue between the characters and you find out the most about Van Helsing as he confronts the Count, not through any flashback scenes which would have been interesting.It had a great idea but they really dropped the ball through bad directing and too much computer graphics. I really wish they had done this better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps it was intended as a joke?","review":"This is one of those movies where you sit stunned, waiting for the moment when it becomes clear that the whole thing was intended as a joke. That moment never came, but I still think it's possible they intended much of the movie to be wry or camp -- they just missed. How else can one explain a Mr Hyde who looks and acts like a pinkish version of Shrek, or a Dracula who's trying his best to be a family man? Surely (surely!) plots don't get to be this stupid by accident.Jackman and Beckinsale get to play their roles mostly straight, and they do an OK job.Don't buy this. If you must rent it, you have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Monsters Reborn","review":"(...), Van Helsing is sure to be a genuine good time, a guilty pleasure that will be panned by critics and loved by audiences. Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstein's monster - how can it not be a blast? Sure, it's like paying to go on a theme-park ride, but don't you LOVE theme park rides? It's been too long since Universal Studios allowed their true classic monsters \\"out to play\\".Movies like Van Helsing are not about Acadamy Awards, they're about fun! The special effects look cartoonish but fun, the performances are likely to be cheesy but lovable. Go see it and love it - you can feel guilty later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average Viewer","review":"I liked it. Good story, reminded me of the earlier days of horror/action movies before everything became demonic and gore.Simply...Good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie, Better than what i Thought","review":"I was one of the people that was hesitant to go see this movie after a coulpe bad reviews here and there, But My friends and I all enjoyed this movie very much. It has some Very well done Graphics and the best Werewolfs i have ever seen in a movie to Date. The Vamps and the Werewolfs look so real and the way they act in the movie is kinda like how i imagined them in a few books i have read. The Story line is rich and keeps you wanting to know more and more, Some people seem to think this movie has to much action in it, i found it to be just as much as any other movie. I guess some people thought this movie was going to be a biography, or one of those movies like Bram Stokers Dracula(Long, Boring, Dull) I must say this movie was a breath of fresh air after having seen Troy a few days before. Van Helsing is an awsome movie and i think people that like Sci-fi and Fantasy should go see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Helsing!","review":"I don't know why anyone has complained about this movie. It had a GREAT story line that really supported the idea of having all those classic monsters in one film. Every actor did a really good job, but to me it was Richard Roxburgh(Dracula)that really stood out from all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Great Music, Excellent Entertainment","review":"It seems a lot of people take this movie a little too seriously. It is a parody/spoof of all the Dracula/Frankenstein/Vampire movies. As such it was great entertainment with lots of action, outstanding music and good special effects. If you are looking for a serious movie about vampires, this is definitely not it. But if you like action, great music and understand what tongue-in-cheek means then you'll probably really like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Hell-No!","review":"Ok, are you telling me that this is the same guy who directed \\"The Mummy\\"? How can that be? \\"The Mummy\\" was actually enjoyable, unlike it's Transylanian counterpart. Apart from it's weak storyline, poor direction and mediocre effects Van Helsing also manages to be downright boring! This movie made me feel like a kid...and not in a good way! The directors adolescent attempts to frighten me with mythic monsters was ungrounded; he should have just let me read the script! Woefully bad characterizations of Hollywood horror standards left me feeling drained and baying at the moon. There was no bolt of lightning that could have broken the spell of boredom woven by this forgettable flick. If you decide to get this movie I want you to think less frightening and more fromage, less action and more assinine."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding!","review":"I'm also an ENORMOUS fan of the Mummy movies and Universal classics, but this movie definitely lacked their \\"something special\\". It was ok if you were in a mood to get out of the heat and into an air-conditioned theatre to see a movie, but it can never be considered a cinematic classic. I walked in all set to be sucked in but the popcorn was more entertaining. I'm a movie fanatic & normally buy every movie I see on the big screen, but I think this one will just stay on the (Amazon) store shelf. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"so much movie, saying so little, my head hurts","review":"I watched Van Helsing last night. I want my time back. It reminded me of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but different. Kind of like, Wolverine hunts LOEG. The only good part was the end battle between VH and Dracula. The soundtrack is pretty good though, but the movie actually gave me a headache, just like Team America did.The mistake was trying to fit 3hrs of info into what I think was just under 2, then instead of condensing the script to give you the most story, the script was condensed to allow for the most visually lush and lavish scenes, and it never let up. Add to that the time inconsistencies (was night in a frame, woman steps forward, shot now from behind and it's daylight) to downright annoying acting (give me break on the friar)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucked.","review":"This movie was so boring. I thought at least it would entertain me but it was just crap. A movie about a guy who goes around hunting monsters should, if even done somewhat well, be one of my favorites so that says quite a bit. I gave it one star because what's her face is pretty hot but other than that I hate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I saw a few clips from talk shows and though it looked like an interesting movie, boy was I wrong. I'll give them credit for the costumes, which were eye catching, but the script needed major work. Dracula was so over done that initially I thought the whole intro was a comedy bit. I usually like romance in movies, but the romance in this story seemed forced in as an after thought.I like to be entertained as much as the next girl, but even for entertainment for entertainments sake can be better than this.By the way, if you liked Underworld you'll probrably like this one, just not as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyingly bad...:-(","review":"Eventhough i am a big fan of hugh + kate, i must say i did not like this movie. The acting of all the characters was bad and the plot was poor. In the whole the movie lacked originallity. I do not know if anybody else noticed, but i could see the microphones during many scenes in the movie. They appeared many times on the screen and that was really bad for the movie. The director should have been more careful, because his mistakes affected the image of the actors. His mistakes made the actors look at least foolish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Understandable - Van Helsing (Sommers)","review":"I don't know why people vilified this movie so much. Probably because of the cheap CGI (like in \\"Mummy Returns\\"). The story is stupid, the action sequences over the top, and all is irrelevant, but is fun nevertheless, and every action (even the stupidly impossible ones) is sliced in understandable bits of information (that is more that you can say about so many Hollywood films these days). Is a grandiose \\"B\\" movie (or rather a \\"direct to video\\" film) with a budget closer to \\"Titanic\\" than to \\"Re-Animator\\". But I will continue viewing Sommers' films, if he manages to slow down and acquire a better technique using the overblown effects that he likes. In the summer of 2004, two of my hopes for the pop-corn film (Sommers and Twohy) had failed (or at least that's what the public, the critics and the B.O. dictaminated). What went wrong?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go See Interview With The Vampire or Blade atleast","review":"I wanted badly to like it but it was kinda pointless and dumb. It had one part that I enjoyed which was the flying women vampires who get tricked. But other than that I couldn't recommend it because it's not entertaining. It could have been shorter also but that's just me saying. I did like the end when it said for my dad. That was sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The church gets their own Indian Jones","review":"The film is a CGI smorgasbord version of the old Universal features like Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman;The plots lameness is exceeded only by the miserable acting, as it was extremely tough for me to \\"suspend belief\\" and get into the story. A monster killed who has no memory set out to kill Dracula in Transylvania. But this is not a movie that was put out so we could measure it for credibility: it is two hours of entertainment: it is a movie that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment. It is not meant to be a classic horror tale nor a comic book, but instead something you can forget after 2 hours of wasted time.Van Helsing is the Indiana Jones of the church, with a mission is to capture monsters. How far can you go with a plot like that? About 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Laugh","review":"I only saw this movie in the theaters because my friends invited me and boy did we get a big laugh! For one thing, that random turn Dracula did with his one arm outstretched was beyond unnecessary (we're still debating the point of that). I found this movie to be cheesy and way over the top. It is full of one-liners that in the end make the movie more corny. The only ohter good thing about it is <3Hugh Jackman<3 and laughing at random parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Boring","review":"Yea I wanted to see this movie my friend saw it he said it was awesome, my brother in law saw he said it was boring.And when I saw it I agree, theres no plot to it, and its boring and dumb the only scene I like its the action scene in the beginnig but its still dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romp that does what it says on the tin","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this romp. Loved the inventive story line and thought the Q character of the Friar was excellent. I do wish people wouldn't expect something incredibly taxing when they see a film such as this. Great fun, well acted by Jackman et al. I liked the under played Dracula. I only hope the DVD shows deleted scenes and alternative endings of which I am sure there are a couple. Well worth seeing, unlike LXG which was disappointing against such a great graphic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabriel, The fan of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror","review":"I Imagine that this movie will probably be like \\"The Mummy Returns\\" with Brandon Frasier. You know like Sommers the creator is brining back old 40s and 50s horror movies and turning them into a new century horror kind of comedy like movies. I think that van helsing will probably be better because Hugh Jackman has more challenges in the movie like the Wolfman, Frankinstein, and Draula. Over all I am looking foward to it in May.I finally seen the movie and it was disappointing in some areas. Dracua did not put up a good fight at the end and he acted like a sissy yet supposed to look bad? Second of all I did not like the ending to much when Kate Beckinsale died which was unexpected for the audience. Third of all some people are right that there are to many effects in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare It Isn't","review":"Shakespeare it isn't, but dang, it's just plain fun! All it takes is the willingness to just sit back and go along for the ride. The performances are forgettable and occasionally laughable, but the CGI is great! None of it is believable, and it not to be taken seriously, but it sucks you in if you let it. It's like they gathered up all the monsters they could find and locked them in a room with a crew of stoned CGI guys. Silly it may be, but it works. David Wenham's hilarious horny friar is worth the price of the ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable,and exciting...................","review":"Saw this movie yesterday and really enjoyed it,in fact my whole family did. It was off to a somewhat slow start but the action really picked up. I can't understand why people are so critical,sure it's Universal and the monsters are cheesy-looking, I still enjoyed it. I think it brought to life whole different version of why Frankenstein was like he was and why he was like he was. We went to enjoy this movie and we did,and I recommend it, Can't wait for the DVD...... Van Helsing was sooooooo hot...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Helsing","review":"Great movie! Both discs played without a problem and the extra features were great! This is a must buy for any fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment....","review":"Naysayers are quick to point out the shortcomings of this film (i.e. inconceivable/fake weaponry, over the top special effects). Bare in mind people that this endeavor is aimed at entertaining the public (not to portray reality). I urge you to watch this film and draw your own conclusions. Do not succumb to the distorted perceptions of others. I would definitely recommend this film for it entertains and succeeds in taking viewers away from our sometimes dull realities (if only for an hour or so)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Role for Hugh Jackman","review":"Hugh Jackman has the confidence to make this movie enjoyable. Kate Beckinsale and Hugh had chemistry and you could tell they enjoyed working with each other. The rest of the cast were wonderful too, the entire show was just one twist and turn and it all fell into place. At the end when they were riding their horses past (what appeared to be) Stonehenge, it was almost as if you could imagine that Stonehenge was THE DOOR to Dracula's Lair !! I enjoyed this movie very much- buy the DVD so you can watch the out takes and how the movie was made - just great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SPECIAL EFFECTS EXTRAVAGANZA","review":"Comes off as more of an action/adventure than horror and is bestenjoyed if you adjust your expectations accordingly. From Mr.Hyde, to werewolves, to Frankensein's monster, and finallyCount Dracula himself, and lots of sexy vampires, Van Helsingcomes off like Indiana Jones on steroids! Packed with nonstopaction and outstanding special effects and visuals. Lots ofdark humor, and good fun all around. At a bit over two hourslong, it fits in perfectly for an evening of exceptionalentertainment. Highly recommended.Thanks, and enjoy,Tom"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bang for your buck!!!!","review":"First of all, this is not a horror. This movie is a non-stop action, adventure romp which Sommers has proven time and again that he can provide successfully to his audience. Don't try to analyze this film. Don't try to dissect the relationship between the characters. Just hunker down with a bowl of popcorn, turn down the lights, turn on the surround sound system and enjoy 2 hours of pure visual delight, edge of your seat action and Alan Silvestri's bombastic score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Van Helsing is a very good movie. Perfect if you are looking for a horror film to enjoy. Hugh Jackman is amazing.After the movie, I had to run to the internet and get more information on Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula. What a great performance ! He was the best Dracula yet !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing live action cartoon.","review":"People said the Mummy movies were too CGI dependant, possibly true, but they never took it to the ridiculous extremes shown in Van Helsing. Leaping off Notre Dame, swinging across huge chasms on chains, fighting werewolves and vampires and not so much as a spot of blood to mess up the faux period costumes. Jackman and Beckinsale clearly know they're in a cheap B movie and try their damnedest to salvage something from this mess, but to no avail. This could have been a fun movie, but the director lost the plot and I doubt the computer graphics people even read it. Rent or borrow, but don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"um.....hehehe...ummmm","review":"no seriously...there actually are people who want to take the time to sit and write a huge long detailed review of this movie and all of the \\"wonderful storyline\\" and history behind the tale and all? why......?the first few minutes were very well done, say I. Afterwards, it just went from ppthhhhhhh to ppppppthhhhhhhhhhhh to PPPPPTTTTTTTYHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH to put it quite bluntly. The first encounter between v.h. and mr. hyde was totally unconvincing. And Dracula was just an obnoxious guy who walked around saying stupid lines. (\\"give me liiife\\" \\"that is not all I can do with your skin\\" etc.etc.etc.) The CGI fx for our friends like the wolf-man and the vampires' flying forms were pretty darn fake looking.....the wolfman looked all smooth and blurry and not fitting in with the background at all. Sorryno, not worth buying or seeing more than 1 1/2 times"},{"rating":"1","title":"Play the game insted","review":"What a film!!! I can't wait to get the video game. Or maybe that was a video game. The whole film looked like a series of XBOX cut scenes. Unlike XBOX you can't skip these when sitting in a movie theatre. I got headache imagining the thousands of crunching computers it would have taken to put together this mess. Apart from the CGI pornography, the uninspired dialogue is also straight out of video game land. The screenplay may have been written by someone in the post-production department. The guy who plays Dracula is mediocre at best, and the overacting of his female companions is absolutely ridiculous (or was this intentional?) I realize this film is somewhat tongue and cheek, but that's no reason for the film to be this bad. I am grateful that I had to go to the toilet and I missed about 10 minutes. I also fell asleep for another 10.

I like Hugh Jackman but this movie hopefully wont dent his career. The story was abysmal. It was too thread bare and had too many things that were trying to be part of the story. If the writer had used only the vampires it might have been ok.I have a belief that special effects should enhance a movie(like the lord of the Rings) but not overpower it. Money should have been saved on special effects to have a real writer do the story.The guy playing the vampire was awful. You think with the budget someone could have hired a real actor.Anyway if you must see this rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Helsick","review":"Despite Hugh Jackman's charismatic presence, nothing can save this woeful effort from The Mummy director, Stephen Sommers. Whilst concentrating on the special effects, Mr. Sommers forgot one crucial detail...A PLOT. Two dimensional characters and very bad acting (Richard Roxburgh is appalling) have, unfortunately, put the final nail in Universal's coffin. How the powerhouse distributor will recover from this is yet to be seen. Somebody's head definitely rolled because of this one. A shame it wasn't Stephen Sommers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamentable","review":"Who had the idea to make this movie? It's really bad. The actor playing Dracula is a bad actor, I can't believe he was playing Dracula. Frankenstein looks like a cyborg of B movie. If you have ever read Dracula of Bram Stoker -which is a great book-, Van Helsing is an old man, not a mix of Jedi, Men in Black, Spiderman, Batman, Indiana Jones and James Bond. This movie it's a joke of bad taste. Bela Lugosi, where are you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of the crapiest movies ever","review":"This sucked. The cast was bad. The story didn't make any sense at all. What the hell kind of a chance was there that in the 1700s there would be cars and a legion of super monks in tha freakin vatican. Also Kate Beckingsale was badly casted, her accent wouldn't fool a retard. (...) I mean for God's sake this guy was crying when a few people chased him with a torch. The twist was ridiculously stupid also. Van Helsing becomes a Werewolf. OOOOO wow amazing. This looked good in trailers and I thought that ever since they got the guy that directed the Mummy that it would be alrite, but I was dead wrong. Waste of money in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit Inducing","review":"This is one of those movies that cause suicide rates to raise. I went expecting to see film history's most classic creatures in a more modern way. What I got instead was the absolute castration of all things pure in this world. The ties between all of the characters was such a stretch that Denise Richards would have gotten a hernia. There is absolutely nothing that is of high quality about this film as they even managed to mess up hot vampire chicks. I thought that it was horrible enough when Steven Sommers decided to mutilate the mummy in THE MUMMY, but he took it to an entirely different level when he drained a boil on Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde. I hope that Hugh Jackman at least got paid well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Are you kidding me? This is the biggest piece of crap since the hulk.

With that aside, it was a fun film if you leave your brain at the door. The character of Van Helsing himself was super cheesy. He is like a cross between Michael Douglas in \\"Romancing The Stone\\" and Indiana Jones. This is a movie that should be seen while on the big screen as it will lose half of its effectiveness on a TV screen.

They have taken the great character of Dracula and ruined him with this junk. The movie is too campy, and cartoonish to actually be exciting or entertaining. The acting is some of the worst i've ever seen in a movie. The special effects look cheap as hell in certain scenes, and they overcrowd the movie like an episode of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.

The first five minutes were good (Where Van Helsing encounters Jeckyl and Hide) but the rest is horrible. The acting is terrible. Note the scene with Dracula and his three wifes. It is sure to go down in the notebooks as one of the worst acted scene in history. This movie is trying to hard to be cool and ends up as just another Hollywood pice of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen Sommers should be kicked in the nuts!","review":"How do you take one of the hottest actresses alive, one of the best action heroes of our time, use the majority of Universal's awesome monsters, and still make a terrible movie?!! Stephen Sommers, that's how! I have NO idea why they still pay this guy to make movies! After this garbage they still let him direct G.I.Joe!!! I was SO excited to see this when it came out at theaters, but was SO let down when I did. The stunts in this movie are beyond ridiculous, and there are so many coincidences that the story just becomes laughable. I just watched this on television the other day, and felt the need to vent. If someone in Hollywoodland is paying attention, PLEASE DO NOT let that Stephen Sommers douche make anymore movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a horror movie??????","review":"I was really disappointed in this movie. The girl was the chick from Underworld so I thought it would be aweasome and since we was just human there was nothing special about here. The previews make the movie look better than it was. Althought the Wolfman and Dracula were aweasome. That is the best Wolfman I have seen in awhile it was even better than American Werewolf in London and Paris and I think thoes are two great werewolf films. Dracula was so cool and so sexy but the movie overall was not that great and really boring I almost fell asleep. The Frankenstien was pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Worst Movie EVER!","review":"Besides Baby Geniuses, this was the worst movie ever. I can't believe I wasted my money on this piece.

So dissapointed in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"This movie was more than i expected. I read some of the reviews, most of them saying that Dracula sucked in the movie.I felt that too, but then i realized that he was ok. 3 werewolves for the price of 1, a gray one, a brown one, and the coolest, baddest, biggest werewolf i've seen,the black one, Van Helsing himself. And 3 hot looking vampire girls, they were all so beautiful, not to mention Kate Beckinsale, too bad she dies at the end. This movie was great, the music is amazing...why not say it...this is the closest i'll ever get to see a Castlevania movie.

I'm not sure how many real people are actually in this film because after a while it looks like a saturday morning cartoon. Too much CGI and not enough of anything else.

I loved Deep Rising and both Mummy movies, am a devoted fan of the Universal Classic monsters, and think Hugh Jackman is a fine actor. Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed with Van Helsing. Sommers overloaded his film with entirely too much cartoony CGI, the acting was so overblown and melodramatic that any opportunity for decent characterization was rendered inert, the dialogue was ridiculous, and the main character failed at nearly everything he attempted. This Van Helsing was supposed to be a Victorian butt-kicker, but instead ended up as little more than a whipping boy, and that is where this film's greatest weakness lies. If you want to see Hugh Jackman portray a capable hero, then watch either of the X-Men movies instead. If you want monsters, then watch the original Universal Classics or the 50s Hammer films. If you want a cartoony CGI nightmare, then by all means, watch Van Helsing. F-"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"I bought this movie for my 14 year old son.

Wonderful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"very over dramatic","review":"I laughed so hard at this lame attempt of a movie, my sides hurt at the end. The writting, was as if a cliche' marylin manson fan wrote it, and the visual effects [cgi] made it more cheesy. Was this suppose to be a serious movie?!? Or to just entertain the easily entertained. The acting from Hugh Jackman wasn't much of a streach from X-Men. Kate Beckinsale was casted into this movie, and she was a fish out water through-out the movie it was a waste of her actuall talent. Atleast Underworld was more serious than this piece of cr*p. This movie was made in hopes to try to flock the people who like eye candy.

I bet it's beautiful.\\" Something like that, anyway, right in the middle of a hunt for the vampire.

The acting was very poor as was the story line. It seems as though they were trying to attempt to rise to the level of \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\". They didn't even come close.

Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I saw a few clips from talk shows and though it looked like an interesting movie, boy was I wrong. I'll give them credit for the costumes, which were eye catching, but the script needed major work. Dracula was so over done that initially I thought the whole intro was a comedy bit. I usually like romance in movies, but the romance in this story felt like it was forced in. The movie was so bad it was actually funny.I like to be entertained as much as the next girl, but even for entertainment for entertainments sake can be better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I heard about the negative reviews this movie had received, but I decided to give it a chance anyway. I regret it. I love the sci-fi/fantasy-action genre so, naturally, I figured this was my kind of movie. The character of 'Anna' is completely wasted. She has all these cool weapons but she never gets to use them. She's just there to be tossed around by the bad guys and to serve as the object of Van Helsing's lust. I thought Hollywood had moved past that, but apparently I was wrong. Van Helsing himself is completely uninteresting. He has ancient memories, he has past history with Dracula, he's the \\"left hand of God\\" - whatever. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of it. It didn't really have anything to do with the story anyway. The only good part was the character of Dracula. He was campishly(is that a word?) cool. But, all in all, it was a waste of my money. Now, Underworld, there was a good fantasy-action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good Movie","review":"The first half hour of this movie made you wonder what kind of shlock was in store for the last hour and a half but I was very surprised to find myself drawn into the plot as it continued to develop. By the time the final climax of the movie came I was fully excited and into it. I highly recommend this movie and if you just bear with the first part being pretty corny, the rest of the movie is highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly awful","review":"Ok, I went into this knowing that the reviews were bad, but how bad could it be...it has Hugh Jackman and David Wenham, both great actors. Well, lets just say its really worse than the reviews say. It was the WORST movie I have ever seen, and I went to see Walking Tall a few weeks ago! very sad. David Wenham was the best thing in it, and he was basically a pathetic little geek. Kate Beckinsale is as bad as always, the accent should have tipped us off anyway. My recomendation is to avoid this one, and go see something more interesting.

If not, try \\"Underworld\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Film With Some Amazing Effects","review":"Now that you've had your fill of misguided second rate reviews read this one.Short and sweet. Van Helsing is a great spin on the classic vampire tale with some amazing special effects. The actors really turn out some great results, and the plot is terrfic.There is one flaw and depending on which side of the fence you are on, it may or may not be a big deal. The ending. I found it to be a bit dissapointing. Actually, it was lame. It subracted from an otherwise amazing movie.Overall assessment? Buy the movie. It takes a lot of creative license with a classic tail. For those who are whining that you can't mess with the original storylines may I remind you, the original story, Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", was fiction, not history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie disappointed me. I was already anticipating a movie that was laden with special effects. I was anticipating insipid humor. I was still disappointed. Hollywood consistantly uses special effects to compensate for poor plot. This movie disappointed me considerably. I anticipated better acting, and an attempt on a plot. They didn't even try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not highbrow film....","review":"...but lots of fun. The movie was good, not awesome, but really a fun watch. They did jump the shark - without giving away the plot points, the bit where Van Helsing howls near the end.... yech.But anyway, for me, Dracula made the movie worth going to see for a second time.

If you want good vampires, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch it for what it is, dont bash it for what its not","review":"I watched this movie (after watching many old horror movies when i was younger), and felt that it was fun, popcorn entertainment. This movie actually brought back memories of when i was younger and watched the old dracula or wearwolf movies. If you want realism go see a movie with crowe or gibson, if you want to watch a movie that will flat out entertain....this is it. Too many people these days over-analyze the movies that they watch in hopes that they will be the next ebert or siskel.

You get vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein, and Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde all rolled into one. This movie takes advantage of the current state of special effects and makes most everything appear quite lifelike.The film has an overall dark, gothic feel to it, with good performances by vampire hunter Hugh Jackman in the title role and by the lovely Kate Beckinsale.The film is not for the faint hearted, there's lot's of violence and gore. If you're a fan of vampire movies, you'll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, Van Helsing almost gets there","review":"Overall this was a good movie. The special effects were great, the action was intense, and the plot had potential. Unfortunately this movie is hurt by a rushed ending and some unfinished parts. Van Helsing apparently has forgotten about his past, and this a great addition to the movie and adds some suspense. However, the movie never got into at all and completely ignored it at the end. This would have added some more excitement. Also, the conclusion of the movie is so brief you dont notice it. Characters die (won't spoil it for those that haven't seen it), and its over. After 2 hours of preparation they should have made the end worthwhile. Still, overall this is a good movie and seeing it isn't a bad idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Horror","review":"\\"Van Helsing\\" (2004) should have been an enjoyable homage to the classic Universal horror films of the 1930s.

It's actually so boring I haven't seen the end of the movie yet, and I don't care who wins, who dies, nor how...

It's just a shame that it choses to ignore all that it has to offer in favor of CG gone wild.Van Helsing is the hunter of all of that is evil. Employed by the Vatican to rid the world of malicious and deviant creatures of the night and day, he is now faced with a menace that far exceeds anything he has ever faced...Dracula. Along the way, our hero meets a cast of characters. Some who are out to help him, and some who are trying to kill him.Hugh Jackman really helps to save this movie from being a pitiful dreg of film making. He always seems to have this humorous expression on his face, even when he is faced with great peril. Yet, not even the Aussie God can help this movie with what it lacks.A thin plot consisting of ridiculous twist and turns, and way too many CG effects. You would be better off renting this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"Stephen Sommers did it again: crap. He said he adapted the story of Dracula to our times? The story begins in Transylvania with Frankstein, and that's false, Frankstein was in Austria when he made the creature. An Van Helsing's name isn't Gabriel, is Abraham. Van Helsing isn't young, he's old. In the movie he looks like a mix of Spiderman, James Bond, Men in Black and Batman. In few words the movies is boring, has no plot and it's made with for people with a low I.Q..Save your money for a better movie and not in this CRAP of Stephen Sommers."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst horror/fantasy movies of all times.","review":"It's one of the worst horror/fantasy movies of all times.

The acting is so so. The plot reveals nothing new about this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speechless","review":"As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves. The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.

The plot has no heartfelt storyline, no good acting, no convincing special effects for goodness sake, as much as I love Hugh Jackman, I rather see him in X-man than this just unbelievable bad movie.the action weren't great either, like I said the special effects were BAD, and the people action looked like those old people from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Bunch of chases, and other than that bunch of cheezy and at times grossed out (and not even the gore kind most people like, this time think Gremlines)cartoony flicks.And not even a happy ending to cheer me up at the end.that said, Underworld is a much better movie, at least that one felt more realistic and the characters are cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for a 12 year old","review":"If there is substance in this film it is lost in action. The movie is one of those typical high budget summer hits, having the lifetime of 1 summer. Once you have seen it there is very little that makes you wan't to see it again and the movie does not make a worthy investment. The movie does have EVERYTHING, Dracula, werewolves, the Frankenstein monster, Mr. Hyde, Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Van Helsing and an odd friar for comic relief. But since it has everything there is little room for a good story, only short plot drivers to connect endless action scenes built around computer generated graphics.

Of coarse the show was about video games and how awesome they are and cool it is to spend all your time buying and playing them. If your inclined to agree with this nerd's opinion what is there left to say? Thing is, this thing here, VAN HELSING, is the best possible argument for video games being better entertainment than movies you could ever come up with. This is one of the most horrible, absurd pieces of junk I've ever come across. The whole thing is like a stupid video game. But you don't get to play.

This was originally planned as a sequel to Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, with Anthony Hopkins set to reprise his role of Van Helsing. Perhaps some of the quality of that original film would have benefited this absolutely pathetic attempt. Entertaining because of how bad it is, but truly forgettable.

For those who refused to buy this expensive import, you can now get a good region 1 version for much less!end-of-line"},{"rating":"1","title":"simply horrible","review":"If you are thinking about buying this movie,don't!This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a really long time.The special effects are not that special and the acting by Dracula's brides is simply laughable.While Dracula himself could use a little charisma.The only redeemable thing about the whole movie is Kate Beckinsale and the few scenes of Hugh Jackman shirtless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Helsing via Jackman","review":"Great fun for all action fans and a vampire movie for those who don't especially like vampire movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste","review":"I have several older movies I sometimes plug into at night as a sleep aid , but this film won't even make it into my snoozer stash. It's too loud and intrusive to fall asleep on. An absolute waste. The one star is for Kate Beckinsale , she had the only fake accent that didn't grate on my last nerve. The special features promise a movie that must have been sent to an alternate universe. Why do I have a copy ? I got it for Christmas.

I hope this review helps a bit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, not what I expected","review":"I saw the ads and read all the buzz about this movie so I thought it might be pretty good, I was disappointed. I wondered what was going on with the B/W intro, turns out that was a flashback- it looked about as good as any part of the movie. For the rest you get an odd mix of action, some humor bits (including the James Bondish weapons lab in the Vatican Cellars, and the friar who develops some of them), and a lot of visuals.I'd get this one for the extra's,(I'd love to see how they did all of that stuff),not the movie itself.Spend less than twice the money and get any season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you'll get better value."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIGIPAK SHOULD BE OUTLAWED","review":"Love this movie or hate it.... The studios should stop throwing this Digipak packaging crap at us. When we are paying extra for the latest \\"Special, Ultimate ,or Extreme Edition\\" of a DVD, we should not have to deal with flimsy cardboard packaging that doesn't have any shelf life to it. WAKE-UP AND GIVE US KEEP CASES (There is a reason they call them \\"Keep Cases\\")PS the Movie only edition, comes in a Keep Case. Go Figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it, it's that bad.","review":"I love Huge Jackman but other than his game performance, the movie is just a huge mess from beginning to end. The rest of the acting is horrendous and the story feels like a five-year-old wrote it on the fly. Special Effects don't make a movie and this is a prime example of it and a bad example on top of that. Even the Mummy movies were much better than this and that is because those movies had very good acting and a little thing called a plot. Something Van Helsing does not have.Avoid, you will thank yourself in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolverine with a crossbow","review":"He's not far from his Wolverine character in this one. It still is entertaining if you like the action genre. On the DVD you get to see a 360 degree view of the castle and the extras are worth the price. I still think this could become a franchise. Too bad the producers of the X-Men never made a Wolverine movie instead.If it wasn't for Hugh Jackman both films would have never been tolerable. It's a testament to his talent when he can carry a movie that's almost straight special effects. Acting in front of a green screen can't be very satisfying as an actor and he pulls it off well.You don't have to be a fan of the monster films to like this one.It has enough outlandish stunts in it to make it one you can see at least twice and still enjoy. Myself, I love the old classics and hope more of them are relased with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Helsing Rocks","review":"This film is great fun and a great re-imaging of the venerable old vampire expert into a nineteenth century super hero. Jackman is the perfect choice for this role, and one would hope that there's enough room in his busy schedule to periodically lend his talents to the continuation of this complex character. The special effects and art direction in this film were superb, and the world created is ripe for further story plunder. Excellent vampire/supernatural fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun at the movies..","review":"Alot of people have compared this film too the two Brenden Fraiser \\"Mummy\\" films. There are lot of similarities: They were all released to theatres in May, they all are re-workings of classic 30's-40's horror films and they are very entertaining.Hugh Jackman trades in his Wolverine costume to portray the mythical monster slayer, sponsered by a secret sect in the Vatican. This movie has some great special effects and action sequences; the DVD picture and sound are great (which makes up for the lousy picture and sound when I saw this film at my local theatre).The DVD extras are'nt that interesting (they rarely are) but the film is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of like an 19th Century James Bond","review":"There hasn't been a film yet made of Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" that does the book justice. So the makers of this film came up with a good idea. Make up a new story with some of the characters from the book (including the vampires), and throw in Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein and Werewolves. It all makes for a very fast paced and entertaining film. Kind of a cross between James Bond, Constantine, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in the 19th Century.Whereas Bond serves for Her Majesty, the Queen of England, Van Helsing gets his license to kill, and his peculiar armaments, from the Vatican. After eliminating Mr. Hyde at Notre-Dame de Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to terminate Count Dracula, who is trying to use Dr. Frankenstein's science to bring his thousands of still-born vampire children to life.It isn't stuff for the Academy Awards, but it is good fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Helsing Vampires","review":"I was at the screening of Van Helsing last Tuesday and my first impression is that the movie is quite amazing.The CGI stuff looks like it needs more work (pygmy bats look quite silly), but the werwolf and the brides are fantastic.As far as the actors, my praise goes to Mr Richrad Roxburgh who created a new Dracula, whose sadness and hollowness is rather touching.Kevin O' connor is great as usual, hidden in the heaviest make up you would imagine.Kate and Hugh team up very well even though Kate's beauty is challenged by the three stunning vampire brides, especially by the charm of the dark head vixen ( Sylvia Colloca, I think).On the whole, a very good job that will hit the box office!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!","review":"What on earth are all of your problems with this movie? Some of you say its boring?? Well, struth, you must be one hell of a hard person to keep interested. If you thought this movie was boring, then i think no other action movie will ever keep you interested.What is this crap about the story was so hard to follow? I am guessing that the people criticising the story, are the people with pathetic concentration spands. Maybe if the director had known you like simpler stories, and not complex ones, he would have made it more easy for you.Special effects did not over take this movie. It made it great. I cannot understand the critics of this movie. When i saw these reviews, i hadnt watched it, and didnt want to. But when i eventually did watch it, at a friends house, i couldnt bellieve that these critics were talking about this movie.For me, this is a great movie. You critics need to stop knocking a movie that isnt bad at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transfer quality","review":"I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater, so I looked forward to the DVD release. The DVD transfer was a big disappointment since the dark scenes came out grayish and pixelated. A good portion of this movie takes place at night because of Dracula and the werewolf, but the bad transfer was particularly noticeable in the beginning during the Jekyll & Hyde scene. When I found out that this title is available on HD-DVD, I decided to get it right away, and I was not disappointed. The transfer was way better and you could appreciate the dark scenes the way they were intended. The great thing about high definition movies is that the colors are more vivid and black in particular has more depth, which gives the image on screen more contrast and clarity. It is true as well in this movie. If you enjoyed this movie, the only way to appreciate it on video is through HD-DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie -- just ordered the new blu-ray release!!!!!","review":"It seems that people either LOVE or HATE this movie -- there's no real middle ground for this one. I love it and just wanted to add my positive vote!! I actually ordered the new blu-ray release, and that says a LOT, because I rarely buy dvds.

Hollywood stick to the source material and stop creating a lot of BULL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad Kate Bekinsale was in this trainwreck...","review":"This film is a joke, and not a very funny one. From start to finish, this film is a ridiculous excuse to cram as much cg imagery and revamped monsters into one horrifyingly bad film. It ranks up there with Big Trouble in Little China in the \\"So Bad it's good\\" category. But really, its mostly just freaking terrible. Indiana Jones, James Bond, Blade, everything in this movie was stolen from a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so monster flick","review":"The idea of throwing all the 19th Century \\"monsters\\" (Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and werewolves) into one flick was done to better affect in the goofball Abbott & Costello movies. Making Van Helsing a renowned monster hunter backed by the Church and a team of brilliant gadget makers is corny. If you want to get to know Van Helsing, read Bram Stoker's Dracula.Van Helsing has beautiful women and great special effects. The action is attention-grabbing at times. But neither are enough to make this a good film. There are some fun bits but the movie's definitely not worth the purchase price and maybe not even worth the rental price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good of a movie.","review":"This movie was OK, but not very good. There are too many special effects in this movie, and they take away the movie's realness. The script is campy with some of the stupidest lines i've ever heard in a Dracula movie, and the acting is laughably bad. Hugh Jackman should've ditched this movie, and the same for Kate Beckinsale.

The combination of old-school monsters with the incredible special effects held much promise. However, towards the end of the movie, approaching what should be the climax, I found myself nodding off...over, and over again. Make no mistake, I wasn't tired, just tired of this movie. I suppose it was how every fight was designed the EXACT same way (Hugh Jackman gets hit hard, gets up, proceeds to stomp villian arse, repeat), or the absence of those elements vital to a good movie, such as plot and cohesion of said plot, but by the end of this movie, I was just plain bored.

Kate Beckinsale I found to be a boring character, just hoping for her scenes to be over to get back to Van Helsing or Richard Roxborough's fantastic Dracula. As mentioned in other reviews, the special effects are great, my only complaints being Beckinsale's performance, not enough screen time for Dracula/Helsing and Frankenstein, and the lack of the explanation of the connection between Helsing and Dracula. All in all however, this is certainly good enough to go out and see, and pick up in your video store after a markdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This movie is TERRIBLE.

On the upside some things that were supposed to be serious came out so cheesy and stupid that you had to laugh.

Hideous pacing (well, nonexistent really), terrible direction, unconnvincing CGI, abominable writing, wooden acting and probably the worst Frankenstein Monster and Dracula designs since the Al Adams days.

I really had high hopes for this film...Coming off the high that was Underworld I was syked to see another monster mash but this film left me feeling a little irritated. I just really did not like it, and maybe I'm wrong, but this film seems to be one of those love it or hate it type films and I guess I fall into the hated it catagory.

And when the script icludes ideas such as \\"Vampire eggs(?)(almost similar to the eggs in Alien-movies) that needs to be electrified by using power from the Frankensteins monster itself...\\", it\`s just sad that any studio has showed green light to project like this.Eventhough someone could manage watching this dispiting that the script seems like to be written by a 10-year old boy, it needs to be said that also the character and set desing showcases the total lack of talent. Not for people over the age of 12.For the only one in this film why did Van Helsing(played by an australian actor) have to sound like an American?

Another reviewer here mentioned comparisons to \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" and I couldn't agree more except to say that \\"League\\" was far, far better. The poor chump Van Helsing didn't even get the girl!!Trying to be serious, it even fails at comedy--like the monster rowing out to sea at the end--that was supposed to be dramatic??

Then Victor Frankenstein works for Dracula (ohh come on) and Dracula is funnier than scary. I laughed at Dracula because the actor who plays him DOES NOT go for the notorious dracula. And a warewolf is the only thing that kills Dracula, whats going on here?!?!I am not going to list all of the bad things associated with this weak film.

Once again, as has become the norm for films in this genre today, an over dependance on CGI effects in lieu of a good script. Nothing like human beings bouncing off stone walls like rubber balls or flying through the air to sustain belief. Hugh Jackman must have been high on goofballs when he read this script. 2 hours of uninspired, unemotional dreck.

I was very disappointed that it appears to simply be a gear guide. If you are into that good, but it's not all that useful for someone like me. A sleeping bag is a sleeping bag I don't need 20 pages tell me about them.I also expected a little more that just gear information. Obviously this is something you need to take into account but it's not everything. I would perhaps have called this book the complete gear guide but it is certainly not the complete walker.

It could use an update probably around 2012-2013. Good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"We are using this book for a Masters level graduate course in Experimental Design. The book is poorly written. It seems like it is basically a compilation of lecture notes. I would use Montgomery over this text. Even our professor admits that it is useless to study from.The plus points are that it covers certain things that other text books don't (Error Rates, SNK, etc.). These are only covered minimally, though, and don't make up for the poor coverage of most of the other subjects in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few truly modern MS level texts","review":"Unlike the market-leaders that are showing their age, this book takes a modern point of view of experimental design, not excessively tilted towards industrial settings. It's also the only book showing how to use Hasse diagrams to find expected mean squares, which is by far the easiest way. The book also pays considerable attention to the design, not just the analysis, of experiments. It emphasizes practical, rather than mathematical, depth and insight. It's terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the processing time on this order!","review":"So you may not notice it says under the book title: usually ships between 1-3 weeks!

But this week, as I was using it, I heard a clunk and hot water came spewing out. It was so hot and coming out so fast that I couldn't turn off the water under the sink, I had to shut the water off from the main line. When I removed the faucet, I noticed that one of the hoses just popped off the main faucet head causing the water to come out full force from the main line. Other faucets of this type have all the hoses screwed-in to the main head to avoid this problem. This faucet has 3 screwed-on hoses and one hose just pushed on. I had to replace this faucet and now I'm thinking of replacing the one in the basement as well because this could happen even when not using the faucet.

Kudos to the author for bringing so much emotion out of his readers for this story. I think we all loved Grace Kelly, and wondered how it worked out for her in Monaco. She is of my generation; boy oh boy, those were the years! All of this was news to me, I must say. Back then, we didn't get all of the details as we do today, about anything. The world was a different place. You had to wonder what your favorite stars were thinking, you never really knew. Not like now, when it's all on the TV. Anyway, I loved Princess Grace even more after I read \\"Once Upon a Time.\\" It's so nice when a book can make you feel stronger about a person you already hold in high regard, isn't it? That's what this book did for me. I hope her children, Stephanie, Caroline and Albert, have an opportunity to read this book.

Regrettably, there is none. Mr. Taraborelli retells the same story of the \\"fairy tale gone wrong\\" that has been related in countless other books and magazines that have appeared in the decades following the death of Grace de Monaco.

I lived in DC for 12 years once, and upon return, picked this up as a way to see how the city has changed. It did that, and more. I discovered new aspects even of neighborhoods I had lived in. Bruton has a skill at picking an interesting route. At times I wondered why he would divert me for one block with no reference, but every little twist has brought worthwhile views. The book is a good size for holding in the hand while walking; the practical directions are first rate; and he provides background mainly on buildings and sights that are not explained in the location itself, so that you have an opportunity to explore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other choices are more effective and of better value","review":"I'm a big fan of pre-shave oils because they really do help my shave, probably more than any other product.

The chapter about vectors just confuses me a lot and I really wish the author would give better examples. In addition, I don't like the way the exercises in this book are organized.

The book is solid from beginning to end and really immerses the reader in the life of the main character, Cavanaugh.Of specific note, Morrell's fight sequences are detailed enough to follow each movement, but not so much so that you feel like you can't let your imagination run with the story. Very visual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another success.","review":"I picked up this novel wanting a sharp, intense thriller, and got what I expected. Morrell's fiction is especially augmented by his very detailed research - it is interesting learning his debunking of fictional fallacies - such as the fact that a bullet shot into a gas tank will NOT cause an explosion. My only disappointment with this book lies with its publisher - I considered that too much of the plot was given away in the liner notes. I have a habit of never reading them in regard to an author I know I will read - King, Koontz, Morrell, etc., and in this case I was glad. The inside cover blurb gave away something that was a significant revelation to me reading the book without preamble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrell's best book in years!","review":"THE PROTECTOR is a tour de force that ranks right up there with THE FIFTH PROFESSION and THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROSE. Cavanaugh is a protector (different from a bodyguard in that Cavanaugh is a highly trained special operations agent). When he's assigned to protect a biochemist, things go wrong. Cavanaugh's team is killed and he's forced to turn to his wife for help as he tries to set things right. Morrell uses plenty of authentic tradecraft and the book rockets along building suspense. If you're not on the edge of your seat turning pages as fast as you can, you don't have a heartbeat.Tight plotting, smart characters, cool action set-pieces. This would make a great movie, but there's no way that Hollywood can match what Morrell brings to the table.On a scale of one to five stars, THE PROTECTOR deserves a six. Don't start this one late at night or you'll be up until the wee hours of the morning and the last satisfying page is turned.Whatever you do, don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrell delivers another solid action novel!","review":"Morrell is a very skilled author and one of the best. I've read Assumed Identity, Desperate Measures, and The Totem. My favorite is still Assumed Identity which is one of the most exciting books I've come across. The Protector is my second best from Morrell and it is well worth the read. As other reviewers have stated it could easily be a movie. It keeps you enthralled with his writing style and the action scenes. The plot builds up climatic events quickly and the book is hard to put down.

I look forward to Morrell's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adrenalized Protector !","review":"Imagine an addictive secret substance, unleashed on the protector of its source, causing that victim's reactions to contradict his normal sense of confident control.Cavanaugh, former Delta Force ranger, now security specialist, finds himself in this state of stunning confusion as he and his wife pursue the biochemist who not only has the adrenaline/fear-producing drug but also carries its precious antidote. The chemical rush felt in Cavanaugh's body is exemplified through David Morrell's writing, as the reader is jolted between the deceptive guises of hunter and hunted in an energy-bound thriller.The Protector has some of the flavor of Morrell's First Blood. The complexity of the plot will transport you with virtually no ability to predict which corridor of the puzzle leads to safety. Prepare yourself for twists and turns and all-out action as you begin a novel you won't want to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"It's difficult to believe that this is the same David Morrell who wrote \\"The League of Night & Fog\\" or \\"The Brotherhood of The Rose.\\"This is a very poor effort from an author proven to be a worthwhile read.I can only describe reading this as though it were a storyboard for a video-game version of a bad McGyver episode.Read anything else by Morrell, but do yourself a favor and skip this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Rate - 5 Stars Plus","review":"I won't waste a lot of time on describing the plot.

The Protector is fashioned with realistic characters who know their business and generate dynamic responses based on undefined dangers. Morrell, as always, does his research.

Twists and turns, combined with three dimensional characters makes The Protector difficult to put down. This book is in a league with Morrell's best. Well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"With The Protector, David Morrell grabs his reader at the beginning of the book and does not let go.

When his latest assignment takes a terrible turn, Cavanaugh becomes both the hunter and the hunted as he tries to unravel the mystery and extract a basic form of justice. Beyond the plot's twists, turns, action, and suspense, Morrell brings together an interesting cast of characters who complement Cavanaugh's character.

The drums and vocals are loud and clear, but not the guitars. It's like they forgot to remaster the leads because they sound really weak.

The new transfer is vastly superior and has marvelous extras, but \\"Genevieve\\" prevails because of the (1) four fabulous stars (Sheridan, Gregson, More and especially Kay Kendall), (2) sparkling script, (3) technicolor photography of the British countryside, (4) exciting and funny chase at the end, and (5) music written and performed by harmonica great Larry Adler.

They have some glue that comes pre-installed on the visors but only one of them had enough to do any good. I will say they looked great and they kept the rain out when the window were down a little bit so the vehicle did not get as hot inside. I replaced them with some visors that stick to the outside of the Chanel, they don't look as good but they work a lot better and they are only smoked instead of almost blacked out so you can see through them so they don't cause a big blind spot.

The broken drivers side would not fit in the track and pop out a little after rolling down the window.I installed them per the directions and left them up for 4 days.

I frankly prefer Chekhov, however, to the megalomaniac Tolstoy. Reading Chekhov is truly uncanny. He utterly refutes our common cliche'd notions about \\"Russianness.\\" His is really the most modern voice of nineteenth century literature, without the \\"modernism\\" of our century that has so easily dated. I fell in love with Chekhov partly because his Russian is the simplest and most prosaic of any Russian writer and I was consequently able to read him without mediation. I would have included certain stories in an anthology in lieu of others, namely: \\"In the Ravine\\" (V ovragie) \\"Murder\\" (Ubiijstvo) \\"An Attack of Nerves\\" (Pripadok) \\"The Peasants\\" (Muzhiki) \\"Gusev\\" (Gusev) ...and many others...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Build a Word","review":"I recently had the opportunity to review the WordWorld DVD Get Up and Move.

I thought this book was it, and I was so excited, especially after glimpsing the first chapter on line. When I received the book, I was horribly disappointed - only the first chapter covers the rose in art and culture - the rest of this huge heavy tome is illustrated with hundreds of botanical rose illustrations taken from the Horticultural Society's collection. This book is good for the serious rose grower who wants to know detailed information on each type of rose, their latin names, and what parent roses were used to create hybrids. With that said, it is a beautiful book, but not what I was looking for - I gave it away to someone.

This Lovejoy is such a horrible person, it's impossible to care what great finds he makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antiques yes - women no","review":"I could not believe the author's view of women.

I recommend them every chance I get and those that have taken the suggestion, seemed to enjoy them as much as I did. This book is fiction at it's very best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of His Best!","review":"I've read just about all of Dean Koontz's novels, and thought he might have nothing new to offer...I was wrong! Though a tiny bit formulaic (if you've read Koontz, there are certain things you can safely assume will happen), it is a great story, told in spellbinding style. A fun and engaging read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"koontz gets his groove on","review":"a surprisingly good effort for koontz! i'm accustomed to either skimming his novels in a day or two, or simply dismissing them after 100 pages, while i lingered over this book. writing was much better than usual, although a little heavy on the metaphoric descriptions of ubiquitous wind and rain; and i did spend some time wondering how and why some dude was conjuring himself out of mirrors and loose newspapers. the main character, ethan, is believable and interesting, and the plot doesn't totally flag at the end. a suspenseful read that's uncharacteristically meaty for koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Yourself","review":"Another delightful tale from Mr. Koontz. This one tells the tale of how you can find yourself after you've lost your life, or at least how your life used to be. Truman learns to live again through a lost child and the return visit of an old friend. I enjoyed the ending... I didn't see it coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disagree with many of the reviews","review":"I just didnt' connect with this book. It was a neat premise but lacked a real believable plot. The characters were uncharactoristically cardboard... Koontz doesn't usually pen characters that are so lifeless and unmotivated. The chapters were like 3 pages long, which is not out of the norm for Koontz by any means... but out of 90 something chapters, I wound up skipping more than 40 just to get through it. That's a bad sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playful poetry not proper to prose","review":"Page 3: \\"Through skeins of rain as fine as angel hair...the gray-green quartzite cobblestones, polished to a sterling standard by the rain...\\"A corny plot woven into 650 pages of this stuff (or 16 CD's if you're unfortunate enough to hear such clumsy alliteration spoken). Koontz has done much better when he tried much less."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cuppa....","review":"You know when you're just about to get on a long flight and you grab a paperback at the airport newsstand? Well, I grabbed THE FACE thinking I'd amuse myself with a fun, fast paced suspense thriller. Having never read any of Koontz's prior works, I wasn't prepared for this strange mixture of genres: detective meets supernatural.I won't give away any of the plot points in case this is your kind of book...it wasn't mine. I will say, however, that good story structure and interesting characterizations wre overshadowed by corny dialogue, incessant pop culture references and some of the most repugnant, sadistic scenarios I've ever read in a work of fiction. If this were a movie, it would be rated NC-17.If you like angels and demons with your cops and killers, you will enjoy this. Otherwise, work on the crossword puzzle in the airline magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"consentration is key...","review":"This book is very involved but yet is a page turner. I am a major fan of dean Koontz and i would reccommend this book to his other fans. At first it seems nothing makes sense until it all ties in together. After you fit the puzzle pieces into place you are on the edge of your seat to read what could possibly happen next. You need to pay attention to all the people who have a role in this book. Its full of chaos and magic but on a spirtual level. Not a God sort of spirtual, but more on the terms of help from beyond. I supposed you describe it as Angels. The evil within in the pages of this book is pure malice. Definitly not for the faint of heart. A very good book to get you thinking and take to another realm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in a While","review":"Koontz's best since False Memory. Utterly disturbing, Koontz paints a masterful canvas with his words and style.

Excellent! I've recommended it to many and will continue to do so. It was such a terrific story, I actually cried at the end of the book. Not the usual for me after reading a Koontz book. It has become one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Face","review":"This mystery is set in Bel Air, California and centers in on the family of Channing Mannhime, a world famous movie star. Frick is the son of Channing, is a 10-year-old shy, lonely that has been home school through his life living at the estate. Ethan Truman is a retired cop that the family hired to head security teams throughout the estate. Corky Luputa is an anarchist who looks for crime and murder wherever he goes. Corky wants to kidnap Frick to bring terror and fear to the world. Frick and Ethan receive strange calls and experiences from angels warning them of the coming attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I've been a big Dean Koontz fan since \\"Cry for the Strangers\\" and this is the only book by Koontz that I not only did not enjoy, but did not finish. I was really disappointed in this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like The Face","review":"This is my third Dean Koontz read, but had it been my first it probably also would have been my last. There's no question this author can string words into phrases that are stunninglylyrical and insightful. Or that he can capture a readers attention with a fresh, intriguing premise. And even though his characters are so intellectually fleshed out, meticulously revealed through their heads rather than their hearts, they often, ultimately have great soul. But in this book, I was sadly dissappointed in all these areas-except maybe for the initial premise. Soon into this story, I found myself wondering about who was who, what was real or imagined, what was important. I kept having to go back, wondering if I missed something, hoping it would all become clear in the middle or at least in the end. It never did. At least to me. With it's cool title and inside -cover rave reviews I expected something great. But in this case, the juice wasn't worth the squeeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I only read non-fiction until I read this book. I have tried reading fiction before by Stephen King and it was a horrible experience. 400 pages into a book and not a damn thing happened. Too boring. I found a copy of the Face at my sisters and took it with me. I couldn't put it down. I thought this book was very, very good and because of this one book I am now turned onto fiction. I'm reading Odd Thomas currently and have bought other Dean Koontz books to further my love for his work. The Face is definately a must read and I reccomend it to people all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Face your fears, buckle up, and hold on! He did it again.","review":"One wild ride indeed by Dean Koontz. He includes everything but the kitchen sink in this thriller! It is easy to figure out why there are people out there that consider Koontz one of the best!I can imagine being the person of Ethan Truman, and sometimes feeling the anxiety. But then you think also of what it might be like to Fric. Koontz throws a lot of stuff together. From Broadway roses, to Jewish food, maybe even a dead body here and there, right? I enjoyed the NO FEAR attitude of Hazard Yancy. Corky Luputa made kind of an obnoxious villain, yet a worthy opponent.While it kept my attention, it was easy at times to put down. However, near the ending, it goes nuts, and you find yourself saying, \\"He did it again.\\" So, all in all, Koontz does not disappoint. He thrills us, entertains us, and for some people, he actually inspires us. No harm done there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone in too many ways","review":"Stephen King writes multiple works that fill 30 CDs in the audio version, and you want moe. \\"The Face\\" is 16 CDs where the story would have been more acceptable with 8. Blatent redundancy, multiple linquistically complex descriptors of people, events, thoughts, etc, where one clear and cogent descriptor would have not only sufficed, but would have been better. A decent story line, stretched to the maximum, and overwritten. It is my \\"entry\\" move into Koontz and I am afraid it is also gong to be my \\"exit\\" move.One reviewer noted it was the best work of Koontz so far. If this is true, I am most tnankful that I did not read earlier works. His writing style reminds me of more than one bombastic professor lecturing in my undergrad classes in American Lit. And you ask why I gave it a \\"1\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally finished it... Loved it...","review":"Took me a long time to finish but as I got to the last 1/4 I was getting anxious to find out what was to occur.Very interesting book and got better and better as I read more pages. My only disappointment was what happened to smelly cheese man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read, but long-winded.","review":"First of all, I really enjoyed the plot of this novel. I've always enjoyed homicide, mystery, and a slight bit of supernatural activity in various books. This book combines all of the above into a great story.There are several segments, however, that are rather long-winded. Koontz gets overly discriptive at times, and I found myself skimming areas of the book for key words just so I could continue on with the story.We understand that you are an educated man Dean, but you don't have to try to dazzle us repeatedly with lengthy, unecessary descriptions of a room or person. Or perhaps he was simply trying to fill space in the novel.Regardless, it was still an entertaining read, and I loved the story. I kind of \\"figured out\\" Dunny's involvement well before it was confirmed, but it was rewarding to have my suspicions verified later in the novel.All in all, I'd recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mess","review":"The Face by Dean Koontz is a mess of a novel, but has enough redeeming qualities to see it through to the end. Ethan Truman is head of security for the \\"Face\\", an extremely popular Hollywood actor. He begins receiving threats from a murderous anarchist that threaten not only the Face, but also his family. At about the same time, several characters experience supernatural dreams and visions.The characters and their environments are described so intracately, that the story becomes tedious at times. At well over 600 pages, whole chapters could have been chopped out of this book. However, the story is so odd, so bizarre, that one must finish this book to see how Koontz ties it all together at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you trudge through, the book isn't awful.","review":"I'm relatively new to Koontz's writing, and have read four of his novels. This is the weakest of them all. The first 60% is incredibly tough to get through. It seems Koontz spends so much time with describing unnecessary details. Perhaps he's paid per word. His writing can get so bogged down with too much information and \\"vocabulary words.\\" It's unnecessary stuff, and I tend to skip tons and tons of paragraphs to get to the story.The person who gave me this book couldn't finish, and I nearly quit too. But the last 25% of the book is pretty good, again, once you get past all the unnecessary details like why one of the landscapers put long poles in the ground to help the young saplings. Who cares Dean???? Really? Who cares?There's a lot of Christian allegory and some myth in here, which I like a lot, but overall this book is a big disappointment. You want a great Koontz book, read \\"Life Expectancy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Koontz... The Face","review":"This is the first Dean Koontz book I have read. I like Clive Cussler and Robert Ludlum. Lots of action. They keep me reading. I am half way through The Face. It is slow paced, not holding my interest as yet. Dean is a wordsmith. Story filled with a lot of unnessary paragraphs... clutter. seems to me written to impress the readers as to how he is able to use words."},{"rating":"1","title":"built to nothing","review":"The begining of this book started strong and mysterious. As I read further I realized the story had no real depth and lacked in many ways. The ending was weak and I really felt I wasted my time on a 600 page novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 200 pages","review":"I acutally cannot believe I waded through 200 pages. I like Dean Koontz-usually. I liked Lightning, Strangers and Phantoms very much. I kept reading hoping that this book was going to get better. It didn't. I had other books waiting to read. I soon didn't care about the characters any more. I will not give up on Koontz however!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!!","review":"To me, this book was a major letdown of what I was expecting. It just didnt grab my attention like a really good book does, although I do have to admit that it got better as it went along.And one other thing that I did not like about it was the fact that the guy who worked in the morgue had the same name as the guy in Rosemary's Baby, Roman Castevets. I was thinking that if you are going to write a book, at least use original names."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Face","review":"This book was so full of metaphors, adjectives and the like, it made the reading unbearable. It was nothing like any Koontz books I had read in the past and I was extremely disappointed. The storyline revolves around a little boy and the man who saves him from a physcho killer. Half of the book could have been left out. I won't stop reading Koontz but hope this new styling of writing doesn't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"My First Koontz and the last...simply terrible... Wooden characters, wooden dialogue...wooden suspense...the writing is simply sloppy...flowery,laughable language...too poor to be compared with Stephen King. I have read only two books of him (SK): Misery and The Dark Half but you can see the difference from the first sentence...I mean miles away. How does this serious-writer-wanna-be (I mean Koontz)get published? This is the only suspense one gets from this book...Avoid if you have a sound mind and your time/ money worth something to you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean has done it again!","review":"Anything by Dean Koontz is a good read. But this one is also good (of course) this is a guaranteed page turner. Dean hasn't done anything else like this before, but he did an awesome job doing it. I would also recommend The voice of the night by Koontz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Entertaining!","review":"Dean Koontz' tale of life and death and good vs. evil is skillfully told as the characters of Ethan Truman and Aelfric Channing come to life. Mr. Koontz portrays children so well and is skillful in his development of Aelfric as the poor little rich boy. I found this to be a delight to read as well as a page turner. I have read all of Mr. Koontz' books and am not disappointed in The Face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow getting going, but worth it","review":"I think Dean Koontz is one of the better writers out there, his love of flowery language notwithstanding. This story about an ex-cop who heads security for the world's most famous movie star (is he modeled on someone?) and the star's son is interesting enough; throw in the crazed anarchist who wants to kidnap and torture the boy, a solid and colorful cop friend, and a ghost who acts as a guardian angel, and you've got something really interesting. Koontz is a master of plotting and of developing interesting characters. For me this book tended to drag quite a bit for the first 100 pages or so, but then it kicked in and I wanted to read it until I finished it. I definitely recommend this book to Koontz lovers, as well as to lovers of this sort of supernatural thriller genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Face","review":"I swore after the last book; I was through buying Koontz's books, but after reading the reviews, I did. I bought the book on tape to listen while driving. I've had it for a month, and I haven't finished it. I read the reviews, and I'm not sure we were reading the same book. I don't plan to rehash the plot but I am half way through, and I'm still not sure where this story is heading except a lot of murder and mayhem or is it \\"Much Ado About Nothing.\\" One day I will be so bored I'll finish. How I long for the old Koontz!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw the hard cover in the garbage","review":"Rarely do I not finish a book. Never have I thrown a book into the garbage can until now. I got to page 180 and decided to stop torturing myself. It's about nothing. Everytime you think it's going to get good, you will be dissappointed. I can't believe how many people wrote a positive review. I had to check to make sure we were all reviewing The Face! I am done with Dean Koontz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Evil","review":"I should preface this by stating that I have every book written by Stephen King and John Saul. I have quite a few by Dean Koontz. At the beginning, I thought that the two \\"deaths' that Etan Truman, the private detective, could lead to fascinating reading. I was wrong!!!!!!! I have never read a book that featured such an evil and vile character as Corky Laputa. I have never thrown away a book, but this one is in the trash. I have never had such a feeling of pure disgust during or after reading a novel. If this is what Mr. Koontz aimed for, he succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"What gives. This is a slumming effort by Koontz. It reads as if it were inspired by a bad TV movie. Lacking in origniality, interesting characters, meaningful insight, character development, etc. Of course, not everyone requires these, but I think that they would have been nice.Avoid this. Read one of his other efforts - many are worth it. But not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Koontz with presumably a straight face, has his chief villian in The Face refer to one of his torture victims as \\"stinky cheese man.\\" How lame is that?I have not read a Koontz in a long time, but reading the other reviews I see that Koontz has written many good books. I'm sure that's true, The Face is not one of them.Do yourself a favor and skip this stinky cheesy book. I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time in order to skip the overly descriptive and flowery language. Give me a break, if I want to read Shakespeare, I'll read Shakespeare. Instead I was looking for a suspenceful page turner and I didn't get it.This book was at its height of stupidity at its end -- which couldn't come soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great Koonz","review":"First, I agree that it is not appropriate or intellectually honest, actually, to review a book that one has not finished. But those folks did tell us that fact -- so you can take the reviews for what they are worth. I thought this book was just great. The plot was intriguing; I cared a lot about the characters. I loved the way it all fell together at the end. I enjoy Stephen King, but I prefer Koonz. He seems to have a view of the universe that is a bit more \\"redeemed,\\" so to speak. There are truly good people, capable of great sacrifice and love. If you enjoy Koonz's books, most folks would also enjoy this one. And the end was just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"For fans of his older stuff, this might not be the best choice. I plodded through it, only because it was Koontz. \\"the husband\\" and \\"taking\\" are much better examples of his current works.This book meanders about aimlessly for a while. I stopped reading it three times to read other stuff, and finally cmae back to it when I had nothing else to read. Characters are well formed, imagery is intense as always, but the plot left much to be desired until the final third of the book.Ended well - if you can make it to that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Know Yet","review":"Generally a Dean Koontz book grabs me from page one and hangs onto me until the end. I love his writing, BUT I cannot seem to get comfortable with this one. Am I the only one who sees it as a complete change from his normal writing? I've only gone 150 pages into the book and every once in awhile I stop and think...why am I reading this? It full of tedious and minute details that just go on and on. I'm still waiting for that magical ride he usually takes me on - the one where I forget time and become totally immersed in his tale...but so far, its not happening :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone have an editor?","review":"Mr. Koontz has finally suceeded in attempting to become Stephen King... at least in page count. This book throws useless description, weak metaphor, and as many polysyllabic words as he can cram into an overdrawn and weak mess. I found myself struggling to complete a chapter. Some of the characters are interesting, but as find yourself skipping whole pages and then just skipping to the end, you wonder, \\"why did I pick up this book in the first place?\\"Koontz thinks he knows how to write kids, and some of the lines are funny... but most of his characterizations are just weak. If Mr. Koontz can succumb to his editor's requests to cut out the excessive detail, the annoying and poorly constructed similes, and the maudlin attempts at sympathy... then indeed, maybe he will pick up some of Stephen King's other talents instead of just spewing verbiage.This book is predictable and skippable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"This was recommended by the manufacturer of our shower enclosure for cleaning the glass.

If you're one who enjoys lyrics, you may want to pass on this album, unless you want to understand how great music doesn't need great lyrics. The music, the production, and the lyrics on this album are tight and layered. It's almost perfect. TDL exemplifies the notion that lyrics, when used in their perfect form, are nothing more than another instrument in a song's success. It combines elements of jazz and rock in a seemless fashion. I've purchased every album since TDL, because I loved TDL so much, and while they do not match the quality of this album, they all prove the consistent quality of music this group can generate. For singles listeners that want to preview this album before purchasing the entire album, Panda is the best song on the disc, but the entire album is top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats All The Fuss?","review":"Its ok.

Reviews saying thigs like how it is way psychedelic and exciting and amazing and all that, but really Ta Det Lugnt is nothing but mediocre progressive rock. Sure, Mr. Ejstes plays a lot of instruments, but that doesn't mean he does it in an original or interesting manner. The music is highly un-original. There is no personal or interesting twist to the style(s) of music being ripped off, so there is no reason to bother listening to it when you could pick up one of the hundreds of more progressive, more psychedelic, more original albums recorded around 1970 or so. I gave it 2 stars however, because even thought its nowhere near amazing, there is much worse music out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now listening 2nd time around","review":"This is pretty incredible.

Though his examples are comtemporary to the Nixon near-impeachment (and prior to his resignation), it is refreshing to read a treatise on impeachment that does not constantly refer to Starr, Lewinsky, Tripp, et al. It is not written for the lawyer, so it has a popular flavor that made it a quick read while still imparting a great deal of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie of the year!","review":"I havnt paid to see a movie at the theaters in several years, prefering to rent. But I just had to see this movie. I was not dissappointed! Having gone to art school, I know first-hand what Jerome goes through in this movie. From the teachers to the students this movie hits a bulls eye. It really shows how stupid and shallow modern art is. It feels great to laugh at the pompous art establishment-such an easy target that deserves every single brick thrown at it. Broadbents character steals the show as a miserable, bitter artist that has something in common with steve buscimis' character from Ghost World, but is much, much darker. In fact the whole movie gets very dark , just like his rent controlled apartment, and the ending has a nice sting to it. This is such a delighfully quirky movie and makes a wonderful altarnative to the hollywood movies that are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short in everything it tries to be.","review":"Art School Confidential tries to be a little bit of everything; \\"boy meets girl,\\" dark comedy, indie flick, thriller, mystery, artsy-fartsy, etc., etc. But the problem is that the film is spread too thinly. If the producers were to have stuck to one or two genres, the film may have been really good. But unfortunately it falls short in all categories; it's somewhat funny, a little romantic, terribly predictable and not thrilling at all. I was expecting a very indie flick when I heard about it, then I thought I was watching a great comedy when the movie started, then it all just went downhill into a jumbled (and unbelieveable) mess by the end of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistically Independant","review":"I loved this movie. The acting is great, the raw artistic passion is there and as dark as the story-line was the movie did not fail to induce laughter through its witty sarcasm.The ingredients are all there: passion, artistic talent, art school environment, murder and loads of bitterness. Add to that a dash of John Malkovich and you have got one hell of an independent movie on your hands.It gives a rare view of the art world from every angle possible. The art student's view, the washed-up artist's view, the art professor that never made its view, the art dealers' view and the artist's muse's view. What more could you ask for?Definitely a movie worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting critique on the modern art school","review":"I found this movie very funny and and interesting critique on modern art school cirriculum. One such point is the view that well done representational art is devalued to the point that it's not very good art. Funniest line is when our budding art student visits the art professors office. The prof senses some skepticism from our budding art student who asks about the paintings of triangles in the office. The prof responds appears offended and responds with something to the effect that he's taken twenty years to learn how to paint triangles. Ha, ha, ha! Ah yes, the absurdities of the modern art movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE.","review":"Terrible movie.

Sure, those other two series didn't have a full-frontal shot of a nude male model. (Not *that* kind of model, a nude drawing model.) But those other two series - or at least the original in each series - had original humor.This movie? Not so much.To be fair, it may redeem itself later on in the film. But I couldn't even make it past the first half hour to find out.

The stereo-types are \\"mildly\\" amusing... the actual comedic content is amatuer... Angst is captured deeper in a Blink 182 song. \\"Chasing Amy\\" has more \\"witty geek dialog\\"... In fact there's a terribile lost Ben Affleck movie from the 90's called \\"Glory Daze\\" that stands to look good compared to this wobbly trainwreck of celluloid on stilts.(My 1 star rating does not pertain to any of the Art School Confidential DVD's extra features. I did not watch them.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't send a good message about art","review":"The whole concept of artists as being crazy to get fameis kind of a satire here: the serial killer is a failedartist.

Unfortunately, the movie itself drags on, seems much longer than its actual runtime, seems fairly predictable, seems mean spirited rather than humorous, and is chock-full of unlikeable characters that it's almost impossible to empathize with. I almost walked out of the theater, and have no desire to see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Dark Comedy With A Few Surprises","review":"It tooke me a while, but I finally got around to seeing this movie, and it is pretty good. Funny with a lot of satire and an odd sub theme that ends up playing it's way out in the end. Jerome is a suburban kid who has always been different and picked on. He grew over the years to love art, and became good. He finds a brocure for an art college, and gets the chance to go and be amongst people who may actually finally appreciate him. Well, that's what he thought, but the more he tries, the more things come apart. Rent this movie, the acting is pretty good, the story is original, and the ending, well you have to see.

As a journalist and author, I recently found myself referring to Dr. MacDonald's book (and others on forensic matters) for a very complex tale of rape and murder. His grasp of police processes and rape issues, their underpinnings and their ultimate effects is eloquently stated and well organized in this text. His experience in forensic psychiatry, supplemented by his advisory work for the Denver Police Department and consultation status for the courts, is a valuable resource. I recommend this text as a good civilian reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erroneous Triva Book","review":"This book is not entertaining at all, the author has a way of interjecting his own views into the facts, and some of the trivia is way off. The most offensive of these errors is when he quotes Lou Gherig as saying \\"I stand before you the happiest guy on the face of the Earth.\\" Are you an American? Even my 100 year old grandma knows that the baseball legend said \\"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.\\" Not \\"the happiest guy on the face of the Earth.\\" Come on, man.

There is some interesting and unusual trivia in the book, though. Some of it seemingly would only be known by someone like this author, who seems to be a stereotypical 60's-era Hollywood insider.Another word of caution: the author (for some unknown reason) seems intent upon injecting his own personal views into the book. The most telling example of this is when he refers to would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley, Jr. as a \\"bad shot.\\" That tells you all that you need to know about the political views that the author sneaks in throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivia with a left-wing bent...","review":"This is a slightly different kind of trivia book in that it is not just a \\"question and answer\\" book. It provides some text to go along with individual topics, and also, unfortuantely, an apparent political agenda. The author eveidently finds it necessary to intersperse some of his 60's-esque politcal and anti-Christian religious views into the book. It seems like a book written by a stereotypical Hollywood insider.That said, the actual trivia in the book is not too bad. The reader gets the chance to learn some things that someone who is not an aged hippie would not otherwise know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for the Money","review":"This DVD brings back so many memories of when I watched Alvin & the Chipmunks when I was a kid. I bought this for my son who is 6 years old and he loves it! What I was impressed with the most was the length of the DVD (almost 5 1/2 hours). It is a double sided DVD that has two full length Alvin & the Chipmunks movie(s) and the other side has a cute monster movie and several (15 minute or so) episodes of Archie Comics. Worth the purchase and highly recommended for all those Alvin fans out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a revisionist, apologist, anti-American \\"historian\\".","review":"For anyone interested in reading this book, or anything else by Gary B.

Don't waste your time, your money or pollute your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels Like Home","review":"Josh Rouse is basically the most amazing new songwriter. If he makes 3 more albums as solid as his previous two, he will no doubt reach the level of respect and neccessity as Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. All ten of these songs are soaked with basic human longing and disappointment. \\"Laughter\\" opens it up, an underdog's theme song with the gorgeous line \\"I think my plan is safe from laughter\\" as its centerpiece. \\"In Between\\" is a gorgeous, flippant ballad about getting over someone. Songs like \\"Hey Porcupine\\" and \\"Directions\\" focus on the disappointing behavior of other people without seeming preachy or hypocritical. It all ends with \\"Little Know it All\\", a gorgeous song which contains a line that the music world should take to heart: \\"Be on the lookout for me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trumping \\"Nebraska\\"","review":"Roots rocker Josh Rouse made a giant creative leap between his debut album \\"Dressed Up Like Nebraska,\\" and his sophomore effort, \\"Home.\\" \\"Nebraska\\" was a relatively conventional rock album containing just enough twang to get Rouse labelled as \\"alternative country.\\" With \\"Home,\\" the rural trappings in Rouse's songwriting are gone and taking their place is a solid mainstream rock album of the kind that used to be hugely popular back in the 1970s.The album kicks off with a triple threat of excellent tracks, \\"Laughter,\\" \\"Marvin Gaye\\" and \\"Directions,\\" that all contain sweet pop melodies and strong hooks. The rest of the material is not quite up to that standard, but \\"In Between,\\" \\"Afraid to Fail,\\" and the horn-laden ballad \\"Little Know it All,\\" that closes the record are all first rate. At only ten tracks and under 40 minutes, the album is short by today's standards, but still sweet.Overall, a strong sophomore effort from an unfortunately largely overlooked American songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"a quite pleasant record of mellow songs and warm sentiment","review":"this is a good record. mellow, and light, not the poular screaming and yelling of thesedays. take a break from all that with josh's new record. the first record \\"nebraska\\" is an instant classic, but this comes just as close, just a diferent direction. lots of attention to songwriting and mood. a great slow mellow record. gotta love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home - Josh Rouse","review":"I discovered Josh Rouse a couple years ago with Dressed Up Like Nebraska (a disc that I would give 4 stars). I was impressed by his ability to combine pop hooks with meaningful lyrics to create songs that stick in your head even days after you've heard them. I have since turned a number of friends on to his music and not one of them has been disappointed. I purchased Home as soon as I was aware that it was out. Although my expectations were not incredibly high (I hate it when a second album is not as good as the first) I was very pleasantly surprised. Where the first album had lulls, the second album maintains it's appeal throughout. I would definitely recommend this disc to anyone who enjoys solid meaningful music. Also check out \\"Chester\\". An EP he co-wrote with Kurt Wagner from Lambchop. It's only five songs but it's pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Josh Rouse's brand of alt pop blandness falls neatly into the singer songwriter schmaltz genre so popular with tired middle aged professionals who wistfully wonder where their youth went. Boring enough to be instantly forgettable once it has stopped playing but annoying enough to grate while playing, HOME has little to recommend it, the best song is probably \`Directions' but it is definitely a tune you can do without. Advice for the eclectic buyer, never, never buy an album that contains a song with \`porcupine' in the title, you'll save yourself some grief. Recommended for people who can't remember the names of bands they like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money pit of a printer","review":"This printer will eat you out of house and home. We bought it because we looked at the toner cartridge costs, and found them to be very low. However, what they do not tell you is that the print-drum is a separate expendable item, not part of the toner cartridge as with other printers. They cost nearly as much as the printer. We never got the anywhere near promised 3000 pages out of a print cartridge, and it wanted a new drum cartridge every other toner. After a year, we gave it to GoodWill, though I can't say there really was any good will in that gesture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissolving into the Eternal","review":"In the composer's own words, \\"When I find myself alone on a precipitious summit... then I begin to dissolve into the surrounding spaces, I cease to feel like a separate individual, and am covered by the powerful, everlasting breath of eternity. ...

When listening to the \\"Oakvale\\" track, there are so many different parts to the song that you just dont hear when playing the game because 1) You didnt stay in the town long enough to hear it or 2)was to preocupied with Man killing to actually listen to the background music. I strongly suggest that you buy it just for the fact that it is a great companion. Also, if you dont own the game, buy the game first."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this soundtrack","review":"Danny Elfman is the man! If you liked the soundtracks for Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, not to mention the Simpsons theme music, then you'll love this album as well. I got it stuck in my head while playing the game which, incedentaly if you havent played I strongly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done","review":"The theme, which is all that Elfman contributed to this set, is stand-alone, the best track in the entire album. It maintains a great tempo, and reminds you of some deep and dark introduction to some masterful movie.The rest of the tracks are excellent and blend nicely, while complimenting Elfman's work.You would almost expect this to be a piece for a movie, it doesn't have the feeling of a game composition at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"Although this appears to be a new book by Florence Farr.

She has gathered recipes that not only enliven the palate but also are very practical. The recipes are uncomplicated and have easily obtainable ingredients. The book has the flavor of Paris - one can almost be there and smell the glorious aromas. This is not a coffee table type cookbook.

I recommend this for teachers and particularly parents who question the value of reading aloud to children, as well as those who agree to \\"spare their children\\" the \\"punishment or burden\\" of recreational reading.

And this is one of my favorite albums of all time.If you doubt me, cue up User-Maat-Re. It's a nine-minute track, but absolutely pulverizing. I tend to think that metal bands who release songs over the five minute mark are overly pretentious, thinking they can sustain it longer than they can, but Nile proved me wrong (along with Machine Head, but that's another review...). The song is intense enough that I sent it to multiple friends in order to entice them to buy the CD themselves, even snagging two who normally hate death metal.Every aspect of this CD is heavy in the highest.

Not that I have anything against Cannibal Corpse, but I just find Nile better. They are one of my favorite Death Metal bands right now. I like them second to Death(R.I.P Chuck!). The album overall is very heavy and great. It's one of my more heavier albums I own along with Cryptopsy's \\"Whisper Supremency\\". The beginig is an instrumental, an accustic sounding one, so skip.

This is why:* No maps!* Directions reverse left/right and east/west in several areas.* Incorrect information about many of Yuri's Fusion levels.* The Item Descriptions are often vague. Furthermore, information about the Items and Equipment are scattered randomly through the book. Ultimate Armors and the like are in an odd place near the front of the book instead of with the Equipment list. And if you see an item mentioned in the walkthrough, good luck finding it in the lists.* Directions often neglect to mention the existence of valuable items in treasure chests in an area.* Very thin spell data. Why aren't there lists of the extra spells you get when Solomon's Map sections are completed?Overall, this book gives you as much content as would a text-only guide that you can find free all over the net -- an error-riddled guide at that.

Obviously those whom put together this guide didn't think this game deserved a good guide or didn't think they needed to include maps for who knows what reason. I've found many typos in this book as I've used it, some range from little things to not including item information such as weapons that are located in a certain area. But because of the side quest section I did give this a 2 star rating beyond that its really just not that great, I've seen better FAQ guides online from the private person that what I recieved from the company whom designed this guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this guide rushed?","review":"I agree with the other reviews so far.

First, this isn't very helpful when the author tells you to move west when the west direction doesn't occur until a few rooms later. Next, the author is very confused with directions. Sometimes right and left are mixed up. I think that even if you do not like reading online guides, you'll enjoy it much more than this guide. The pictures in the guide have no relevance whatso ever. OVerall, its just a rushed guide that is lacking in many ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much \\"strategy\\" in this \\"strategy guide\\"\`","review":"No Maps.Directions (NSEW) often reversed.Many, many items MISSED.No guidance on sidequestsNo information on Magic crestsNo information on items/armor/enhancementsNo \\"strategy\\" provided.Nice picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use an Online FAQ, that's all this is.","review":"Sure this book has everything you need to get through Shadow Hearts II, but since it relies solely on verbal descriptions, you might as well not waste any money for something you can get for free on Neoseeker or Gamefaqs, or some site like that. The only reason I got one is because it was $1.25 at a game shop. $1.25 is cheap enough for me to pay for the convenience of not having to look up a good FAQ, but a price in the teens definitely is not. Don't buy this unless you are an extreme fan who wants to see some repetitive concept art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"I bought the guide on line after I had purchased the game online. I think I paid like $17 and had to wait at least two weeks for it because it was shipped from Switerland!??? When it came in I was so excited because I am a huge SH fan, but when I opened the package and took the book out, I was very dissappointed. I knew there couldn't be much to this guide when it only had roughly 160 pages to it. I mean, the game itself takes at least 50-60 hours to complete, and that's not including the side quests. Sure the guide mentions things I would not have other wise figured out on my own(maybe), but when you're really needing some crucial help, it's not there.I guess buy the guide if you're a big SH fan, you know , just to have, but otherwise, just look up a walk through online and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Binder I've ever owned.","review":"I bought my first Active Use binder about 3 years ago and it has withstood heavy use/abuse all throughout that time as I have been in college. I carry it with me to school every day in my backpack and everywhere I go to study. It has held up like a trooper. The binder is comfortable in the hand and the rounded design allows it to slide in/out of the backpack with ease. I also enjoy the rubber strap that keeps the binder closed as it prevents loose papers from falling out. After about 2 years the strap wore out but the binder itself is still going strong. It is a little pricey compared with the average PVC coated cardboard binder but it holds up much better and feels better in the hand. If you use binders a lot, these are worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I bought this because the girls at my salon told me it was great. They lied. I kind of hate this lotion. I never see any results. I even bought the level 10 because they said \\"ohhh you dont see results because you have to switch them up\\", that was a lie too. after 4 visits I started to see my tan slowly come up, but seriously? 4 visits and $80 later I slowly see results? There are soooo many other lotions that I could be using that would make me much darker and they are much cheaper. Oh, the pump sucks too. My pump broke after a month so it was a huge pain in the butt to get out. blahhh! please don't waste your money! Try Love Junkie! I love that product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, so sad; yet frighteningly genuine.","review":"As a post-epidemic work, some might find this book either irrelevant or a curiosity from another age. It is most emphatically neither. While many younger gay readers will possibly fail to grasp the pathos of the subject's life, a very large part of that life has been painfully lived down to the last detail by those of us gay men above the age of 50. Indeed it became so painfully real in places, that I was tempted to put it down; however Holleran's crystalline insights and observations drew me further and further into the story to the extent that quitting it became immpossible. For these insights/observations and his delightful command of the language, I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"After the Dance...","review":"The Beauty of Men is the painful story of Lark, a survivor of an AIDS decimated group of friends in New York. Middle aged and still in shock from his enormous loss, Lark has moved to northern Florida to care for his paralyzed mother. The emptiness of Lark's life there prompts a deep exploration of his past and his current state as an aging gay man. Depressed and in a state of \\"identity limbo\\" Lark finds brief solace at the local boat ramp tearoom and in his fantasies of a relationship with one-night-stand Becker. Given this brief synopsis it should come as no surprise that The Beauty of Men is not a lighthearted read, but it is a compelling and rewarding one. Lark's profound sense of loss and remorse is tempered by both undeniable truth and periodic humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I have never sat through such annoying tripe in my life.

Move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching tale of growing older","review":"Andrew Holleran has succeeded in this book to bring to life the loneliness of an older gay man living outside the bigger cities. Through flash backs we get an insight into his earlier life and how he eventually ended back home caring for his elderly infirm mother. Loneliness isolation fascination for the unobtainable are all cleverly covered as the reader is led through a sad life. The biggest sin in the gay world is to grow old and Hollern depicts this with much thought and feeling. Highly recommended to any age group"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleak but beautifully written look at \\"one\\" gay man's life.","review":"\\"The Beauty of Men\\" is a dark and brooding meditation on what it means to be an aging homosexual in a culture consumed with youth and beauty. With a surety and eloquence hitherto absent from his writing, Mr. Holleran conveys the emptiness and loneliness of a middle-aged man dealing not only with the impact of the plague, but with the mind numbing realization that \\"...even without AIDS their world would have come to an end...their nightclubs would have filled up with another generation.\\"It was important for me to remind myself while reading this dark gem from the author of \\"Dancer from the Dance\\" and \\"Nights in Aruba,\\" that this is but one future available to gay men, NOT the only one."},{"rating":"2","title":"So \\"on target\\" it hurts","review":"There were several times I came close to putting this novel away, but something...call it curiousity, involvement, identification with the main character--whatever--wouldn't let me quit reading until the end. Unremmitingly depressing (which is even sadder because the novel is so true), it tore me apart emotionally, and I'm still not quite the same. But rarely will you find a book so honest in its depiction of loneliness. It's almost overkill. I kept asking \\"My God, is THIS what I have to look forward to as I age???\\" I'm not even sure it's a cathartic novel, because I was just as sad when I finished it as I was during the entire reading. Even the title is mocking and ironic. But one thing is for sure...you won't find more captivating, powerful writing anywhere else with novels dealing with aging and homosexuality as you have here. It's almost a anti-novel. Is this Holleran's own self-study?? Whatever the case, be prepared (and warned) before you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but interesting","review":"I will say from the outset that this is probably one of the saddest books I have ever read. I kept waiting for the redemption, for the turning of the wheel, but found only the myth of sisyphus. As the character slowly toils up the hill pushing not one, but many rocks- his mother, his dead lovers/friends, his own age and guilt at still being alive, and the slow, painful fantasy of his new 'lover.' At each turn of the wheel, I felt as if I was being wrenched deeper into oblivian. I found the scene in the bath house in jacksonville to be the most moving- each man settling for that which his age will capture- so different from their youths when they commanded the scene.Overall I found the book worth reading, but one that should not be read with any sharp objects nearby"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare me the Angst!","review":"I found nothing at all likable about the protagonist in this anti-fable of gay life. The reader is given no opportunity to dodge as the barrage of self-pity and guilt rains down from the author. The book, however, ends miraculously well. I just wish I hadn't had to sink my boots in all of Holleran's mud. I was really depressed at the picture painted by Holleran, so much so that when the subject of the protagonist's obsession finally confronts and reviles the protagonist, I want to applaud. I too wanted to deny the protagonist from my life, because I, like the obsessee, could feel nothing for the protagonist. If only there was something to learn from this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry or depressed?","review":"On reading this novel I didn't know whether to be angry or depressed. Does Holleran really hate gay people and gay life so much that he feels impelled to write nearly 300 pages of gloom and doom? If a gay man can feel like this, how can we hope for acceptance from straight people? In the 1960's, a well-known British psychiatry textbook referred to the sad plight of elderly gays, growing old and infirm without the support of wife and kids. This attitude was bad enough then - far worse that Holleran should repeat it ad nauseam in the 90's. I shan't be reading any more of his writing, he's a traitor to the cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is not the same as shipped","review":"The need to update the picture they have for this product.

I had to start skipping those scenes -- too gruesome. I also think that Colin Harrison must feel insecure in his masculinity -- why else would he have two of his male characters perform two-hour sex marathons that leave their partners (who include a female twosome and a nymphomaniac) begging for more? (No I'm not making this up -- pretty pathetic, huh?) Maybe this is a guy type of \\"thriller\\" -- I don't think I'll be reading this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"Afterburn was my first Colin Harrison book. You discover quickly that he is a talented writer, and the story starts off with a bang. Unfortunately, the tale degenerates into a web of depressing subplots involving characters whose personal tragedies are almost painful to watch unfold. Everyone's sins come back to haunt them in a big way.With some social commentary from the author leaking through in several places, you begin to wonder if he really has this bleak a view of the human condition. All in all, a well-written book, but you better have a copy of a Dave Barry book nearby to read to recover from the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame.","review":"Afterburn's descriptions and the metaphors Harrison employs are remarkably vivid and unusual. The characters are interesting and well developed, too, and the plot twists were engrossing. The ending, however, was perhaps the most unsatisfying downer I have ever read, and it ruined this otherwise fine book for me. I'm still scratching my head as to how the author (and the reader) could invest so much in a lead character, only to have him meet the fate that's dealt out in this book with infinitely less resourcefulness and results than he (the character) demonstrates in the preceding 400+ pages. I don't demand happy endings, but I don't think that what was done here was true to the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Although there are some graphic as well as moving segments,overall this novel is poorly edited, often having abrupt transitions. It drags on and on in places and,plainly,isn't that interesting (altho it TRYS to be). I'd find a good 5 star mystery (there's lots) and not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut it in half","review":"You don't have to literally tear the book in half, the editor should have done this for you. Second book of his that I could not finish. So much fluff and unnecessary dialog and blandness. Just when you think the story is picking up you get thrown back in to the drivel of the characters. The author doesn't let you feel anything for these people. You try and care about the characters in the book but it just doesn't happen. I really wanted to like this book but in the end I just couldn't stand it anymore and had to get rid of it. Just my opinion but unless there is nothing else left out there to read, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible waste....","review":"Very few of the books that I buy do I not finish. This was one of them. Terribly formulaic in that dark 90's sort of way, off-putting in its bleakness without any kind of redeeming balance. Try Thomas Harris if you like that sort of tale; one winds up strangely admiring his Dr. Lecter. While Charlie in this novel is not the same kind of character, he winds up being disappointingly pathetic. A good review of this book prompted me to buy it sight unseen - an awful mistake. Truly a 0 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling, yet flawed","review":"I have read all of Colin Harrison's books, and had eagerly awaited this one. Although the pace is just as driving and the characters as interesting, the violence - expecially the scenes with the drill - seemed gratuitous to me. I know Harrison is drawn to the dark underbelly of society, but in the past any violence or kinky sex was tied to character development. Here Harrison seems intent on providing grisly scenes of torture simply for shock value. As another reader suggested, you would do well to read \\"Bodies Electric\\" and \\"Manhattan Nocturne\\" before this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"In all my years of reading I have never encountered a book that made me feel as though I had been cheated out of a portion of my life. If there was a way to go back in time and not read this I would do it.The story of bad things happening to miserable people leaves the reader feeling somehow infected by contact with the book.Harrisson has great command of the minute details of life but misses the big questions,who cares and why should they?If you can imagine a Quentin Tarantino movie without humor or plot resolution, it would be Afterburn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read at your own risk!","review":"I whole-heartedly agree with a previous reviewer who described the experience of reading this book as \\"time in my life which I can never have back.\\" I wish I had read that review before buying this book. This is the first novel by Mr. Harrison I have had the opportunity to read, and will be the last.The scenes of graphic torture spread throughout the book are visceral and intense, but at least seem to be relative to the story until the end. The way he concludes his narrative is disturbingly pointless and callus, but worst of all unbelieveable. He subjects the reader to some of the most disturbing imagery I can recall, and for no good reason.Do yourself a favor and don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence Du Jour","review":"I read the whole thing, and wished I hadn't. The writing is great. The situations are convincing, except for the killer sex. The characters are consistent and generally avoid stereotypes. But I felt exploited by the use of violence that seemed entirely prurient, violence solely for the sake of sensation. I did not learn anything from the way the characters dealt with it, largely because they and their grim circumstances were foreign to my own experiences, and probably those of most other readers. I want to encounter people whom I recognize or imagine I might meet. I want to feel like their experiences might be my own. There's a lot of shock value in this book, but it only left me feeling used."},{"rating":"1","title":"eloquent and hateful","review":"He writes well, has obviously done loads of research, but three graphic torture scenes involving saws, dismemberment, etc.?

Afterburn will be the summer must read of 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page turning trash","review":"While Afterburn is extremely well written, is a real page turner, and has fascinating passages, the book is morally repugnant. Most of the characters belong in the federal prison in Marion, Illinois. The message? Crime pays if you are smart enough. I usually like \\"dark\\" books, and I have very liberal views about literature. However,after finishing this review, I am going to through this garbage in the trash. Physical torture should not be elevated to \\"literary\\" status."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pile of sadistic tripe","review":"This book does for literature what fecal matter does for holiday dinner. In a wandering, hollow story Harrison writes of a main character who has none, a series of events that are pointless, and a sick focus on over-described torture.

It was a page turner because I kept thinking it HAD to get better -- it didn't. The book was sex (described in the most lewd, crude ways), torture (a REPEATED event throughout the book) and dismemberment.

I can't think of one redeeming quality in this book. I guess bad guys always win? One reader asked wonder what vets think of this.

But I found it lacking. The characters came off as shallow and unsympathetic. While the plot moved along, at times it was jarring, with the action moving from one character to another. Some story lines were picked up and dropped. In places, the book was extremely gory, unnecessarily so. One scene in particular, where one character is brutally mutilated, was hard to get through. At the end of the book I felt cheated, that I had spent many hours with these characters and didn't feel anything for them, except perhaps distaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sorry introduction to this author","review":"After hearing good things about Colin Harrison I was looking forward to reading this novel (my first by him)...what a waste! I was tempted to put it down several times (particularly after the first torture scene) but hung on hoping things would improve. Unfortunately, additional gratuitous torture scenes were the reward. There is some good character development but it was just too grisly for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A throwaway","review":"I too did not finish this book. It had a compelling start, but soon fell into needless gratuitous sex and violence. Certainly isn't worth any media praise it received.

Wouldn't want anyone I respect finding it in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing Characters Treated Badly","review":"Harrison is a writer of considerable ability who, in Afterburn, has drawn interesting characters with great potential. But reader beware, its unlikely you will be satisfied with the direction the story takes them. Even jaded as I am, I was deeply disturbed by the action described. As some books are a 'good read', this is a 'bad read', not due to poor writing but because of the unpleasant events depicted. I compare this book to the awful 'Hannibal' in the graphic torture described, and although Afterburn is the far better crafted book, I'm still sorry I read it and cannot recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"Afterburn is my first exposure to this author, and I can see why this novel generates the strong sentiments, both positive and negative, that it has. Let's start with the obvious-Colin Harrison is a brilliant writer and Afterburn is a daring book. It is not your average cookie-cutter feel good run-of-the-mill thriller. And that's the problem for the people who hated it. The sex, the violence and the torture are all so vividly portrayed that you shrink away from the words even as you read them. But if you're daring, and if you can appreciate the word smithing that underpins Afterburn, then you'll enjoy it. If not, you'll hate it. I came down firmly in the enjoy/admire category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Harrison, why?","review":"Dear Mr. Harrison, you are obviously a talented and skilled writer. The opening chapter describing the life of a bomber pilot in Vietnam was quite compelling and really drew me in. But after investing my time and money what was my reward? Over the top, gratuitous violence. I have no objection to a torture scene, but yours were just sick for the sake of being sick. Same for your sex scenes. It's fine to write about, but why beat us over the head with it unless it advances the story? I am very sure that you could create a literary and artistic piece of work but you took a jack-hammer to the piano. Not to mention the fact that the three main characters were a greedy, vindictive, unsympathetic lot. There really wasn't anyone to root for by the end, so why not just kill 'em all?

This is that rare novel that earns its \\"literary thriller\\" tag. The story, characters, and writing have stuck with me since I closed the book. It's a dark and violent story that's driven by three characters whose obsessions get the best of them. Add that to Harrison's writing and you've got a potent book.

I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fifty years at the Craps Tables","review":"\\"Fifty years at the Craps Tables\\" by Mr. Stuart is NOT a book about craps. It is ramblings about Las Vegas and various casinos. Apparently, telling stories about casinos and his previous play, mostly all wins, of course, is suppose to be a book on craps. Boring. His craps system?...\\"Play the pass line and take full odds. After the come out roll, make a come bet and take full odds.\\" That is the entire book! What a waste of my time and money. I recommend this book for the circular file!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy for history, NOT for tips on how to play craps","review":"I bought Mr. Stuart's book to learn from his 50 years at craps. I was disappointed with the guidance offered as the vague info could be summarized on a matchbook cover. I gave 2 stars for the interesting anecdotal info on the history of Vegas, but if you're trying to learn how to play READ SOMETHING ELSE. Historically, I've purchased 5 books, and have practiced methods and the best books to read are John Patrick's Advanced Craps book or Craps, the Real Deal : A Guide to Craps Strategy by Vogel. These books cover detailed money management, strategies/systems, charting a table, etc. The book by Frank Scoblete is also good, and different as to offer another strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy needs a 12-step program!","review":"An enjoyable memoir by a guy who's been playing craps even longer than me -- far too long, in other words!

Taken apart from every other Dracula film, this is a wonderful take on the story - with Dracula popping up in England. The film, by avoiding the Transylvania prologue and moving the action direct to England, builds a swirling air of mystery around the Count. A ship has wrecked, boxes delivered for the count are full of dirt...and a wolf was the only survivor - until Dracula is found waterlogged and hiding in a cave. Then, it kicks in. This is all about the romance and Gothic melodrama/mystery. Watch it in that spirit and you can't go wrong. BTW, those laser-lights were a big deal in 79 and most films don't age well when held up to scrutiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still scary","review":"[...]. I just want to add my thoughts on what I think is the single most scary scene in a movie adaption of Bram Stoker's classic so far. The scene were Van Helsing and Seward confront what was once Mina, Van Helsing's daughter in the catacombs underneath the graveyard scared the living hell out of me when I was a kid. Too bad they drained the color from the movie in its new version...All of you who know the original will know what I mean. This scene sent me and my buddy vampire hunting on our local cemetery with self made wooden pickets. When we entered the cemetery gates after dusk some graveyard candles that very much reminded us of Mina's glowing eyes in that particular scene sent us running homeward, [...]...A true classic :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Re: Color muting!","review":"This is not a critique of the film itself. That's been admirably done by all the above interested parties, pro and con. I've got to put my two cents in about this DVD's visual quality. As a film buff, I was eager to see Mr. Badham's original color concept. If the transfer were bright and clear, I think I would have been well satisfied. But beware!...Most key scenes are so dark as to make the viewer squint in frustration trying to make sense of the visuals. Worse yet - The \\"bright\\" scenes appear to have been photographed through a misty, gray cloud. If you truly admire this film, please think twice about purchasing. Rent it instead, if you must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish; Slow Paced, By-the-Numbers Script","review":"Remember being impressed with this film when it debuted, however its 79 release put it (just barely)in an earlier era of mainly straightforward, by-the-numbers scripts with no surprises. The bonus feature interviews of Langella and director Badham are very interesting. One of them has the opinion that George Hamilton's \\"Love at First Bite\\" Dracula spoof, which came out earlier in the summer of 79, hurt thisfilm.This movie does a good job of projecting the proper atmosphere, it just doesn't seem as good as it did in 79."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"DVD TOO DARK; unable to view; have heard it is current \\"technique\\" to get people to buy BlueRay?; will not be buying ANY more DVD's"},{"rating":"1","title":"major letdown","review":"Reviewer was on honeymoon at St Michael's island offshore Cornwall, SW England, which served as the set for Castle Dracula while the exteriors were filmed. The evenings included watching the count's carriage being raced up and down the beach by sinister coachmen obviously under instruction to whip up publicity. So we faithfully trooped in to see the film on its first night and regreted it. A major letdown after the book, and a letdown as a film. None of the beautiful exteriors, spectacular sundowns or landscape of the Cornwall coast make any appearance, while much effort is wasted on fake atmosfere; and as for the acting, observing the furniture had more merit. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated, overlong .. and unfaithful to the book","review":"Despite some simpering reviews, mostly on the star qualities of Langella and Olivier, this is really a fairly bad movie. Slow, ponderous, changes from Stoker's for no visible reason, and generally wooden performances form the actors.Much has been made of the fact that the movie was overshadowed at release by Nosferatu the Vampyr and even Love At First Bite - if it wasn't for them, the lovie argument goes, this film would have shone. Well actually, if it was overshadowed, perhaps the critics should ask why.Nosferatu featured a monstrous Dracula, who happened to be more sensuous than Langella, who camped it up as much as Love At First Bite - but without the comedy to go with it.Had they stuck to the story, they'd at least have that in their favour ... as it is, it's just one more lumpen movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Dracula version but an explanation","review":"At the end when we see \\"Dracula\\" fly off we aren't sure what we see. It could just be Lucy's delusion we're seeing. Hey she just came back from being a Vampire herself you know. More likely though it's just Dracula's cape flying away in the wind without him in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make 'em like they used to!","review":"The editorial review is WAY off on this one! This is by far the best Dracula made to date. The actors were perfect for their roles and the script and directing makes it a classic. Frank Langella's portrayal of the character is sensual, alluring, and a perfect example of the bad boy you should stay away from but are inexplicably drawn to! My sister and I can't watch this enough times!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for DVD, the movie gets a 4","review":"John Badham's \\"Dracula\\" is still among my favorites of the Dracula legend. Frank Langella added new dimensions to the characters, a smoothness that made the vampire more scary, though just as romantic. Terrific movie and Lucy will creep you out forever. But the DVD treatment is not so wonderful - rather than keeping the contrast deep with real blacks and whites, it looks more washed out than authentic. This may be what the director wanted but it looks too underlit - not the sight of near B&W that was long rumored. I love the movie and will keep the DVD but prepare to be disappointed by the wanting picture quality. For the rest of us, this Dracula is far superior to Coppola's over-the-top fang fest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best vampire movie ever.","review":"I bought this and had it sent to a young friend who loves classic vampire movies. I used to have it on VHS myself and I watched it so many times the tape nearly wore out. Frank Langella is the best Vampire--ever. He is so sexy. Beautiful scenery---it's just all good. And my young friend said she throughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted the full color version, which is why I bought the VHS","review":"instead, I got the same washed-out film as on the DVD. I have no idea why John Badham thinks that bleeding the color out of this film was a good idea. The rich colors added to the overall sensual and dangerous vibe that Langella projected so well. Making this colorless--not the same as black and white--simply robbed the film of its vibrance. I thought to avoid that by ordering a VHS, but this one must have been made from the film used for the DVD somehow--I am not a techy and have no idea how this was done, but the VHS film--to my deep disappointment--was bleached out and lifeless and I could just spit with frustration. I really want to own this film in all its glorious color, but I have no idea how to do that.

This is my favorite simply because of the cast and the location. No need to go to the mountains of Transylvania keep it in England. Langela plays the role to a T.

It's just a very good production of a well known story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexiest Dracula Ever!","review":"Gerard Butler inDracula 2000runs a close 2nd (his role is much smaller), but Frank Langella is still the hottest vampire of all time. His voice, his movements, even the way his eyes flicker - it all adds to the effect. He grabs your attention from the first time he sweeps into the room, whips off his cloak, and says, \\"Good evening.\\" Yes, they do switch Mina and Lucy around, but most Dracula films don't follow the book exactly. Kate Nelligan is beautiful as Dracula's feisty love interest. Renfield is creepy. Lawrence Olivier makes a great Van Helsing. The only one I didn't like was Jonathan, probably because he was such a wimp compared to Dracula. Scenes in the asylum seem very realistic. The love scene is a bit hokey, but who cares? The music is still gorgeous. Quality of the DVD is good, but the picture is a bit dark when compared to VHS. You can compensate for this with your tv controls. Don't miss this highly underrated version of Dracula!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula, staring Frank Langella","review":"This is by far in my opinion, the sexiest Dracula retelling on the market! Frank Langella just nails the role as the disturbingly hypnotic Count Dracula. He has fleshed out the character so well, that you actually root for him to escape with his new bride and let the villagers be damned.There is maybe just one scene where I think things were a bit campy (Dracula smashing a mirror in front of Van Helsing) but beyond that, an elegant telling of the tale. An excellent DVD to add to your collection of monster movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not be tricked about this movie.","review":"Please, to everyone thinking about buying this title, to all Dracula fans I say Do not be tricked in buying this Dracula movie 'cos you will be really really sorry...Believe Me...But if you like thriller & dramatic movies, then try it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is it??? been a month and still not here, and they won't do anything about it","review":"i am very mad at this company. i bought this a month a go, and it still is not here, and they will not do anything about it. according to amazon the delivery date was 2 weeks, but then after you purchase it, they send an email to tell you it could take up to 6 weeks. false advertisment, and i can't even get my money back... i suggest not buying from this company"},{"rating":"1","title":"scared me as a child,but it seams very creaky and tired today","review":"in 1979 i saw this movie when it was released and it scared me to death,so when it came out on dvd i bought it,but something has changed(maybe i grew up) but now the movie seams flat and the cast looks like they are sleepwalking through the movie.frank langella is good as the count but the movie is so off that the good job is lost in the hopeless script and mindless direction. all in all wasted chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most wonderful slice of cheese ever put on DVD","review":"I was thrilled when this came out on DVD!

The word association sections are simply hilarious. Just ask hockey superstar, Eric Lindros, or maybe the Hanson Brothers.

They've healed significantly faster then had I used the old fashioned, squeezing with the fingers method.

Well that left a red circle on my face and made tears come out of my eyes ...but left the blackhead firmly in place.If there is a better way to use this tool I highly doubt it will produce effective results.

I had to open all the blinds and point it toward the window before it would even take a picture. Oh yeah, and all the pictures in the camera are erased if you turn the thing off.

This book was absolutely great! It really hit hard on some of the sins that are more common for women and they often believe. This book really convicted me and opened my eyes to how many lies I believe. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, I believe that you have to be a mature Christian or do it alongside one. Some of the things are hard for people to swallow but I encourage you to read it with an open heart and a lot of prayer. This is a great book, if you like the Excellent Wife or Titus 2 woman you will like this :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Caution when reading","review":"I agree with a lot of the reviews here. There are things in this book that are too far over the top for me! One problem I had with the book was Nancy DeMoss' stretching the Scriptures. One I found shocking was her using Eve's attraction to the apple as a sign of food obsession! Another was watching the DVD that goes with this. Mrs. DeMoss read Gen 3:16 and either added \\"You will desire control over your husband\\" or her \\"Bible\\" says this! This is NOT the scripture! It says that you will desire your husband.....not desire to rule over him. If you are reading this book, be aware that Mrs. DeMoss misuses scripture to twist them to meet some of HER OWN thoughts and theories! I do agree with another title here that says don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. If you can get past some of her own stuff she puts in the book, there are some things to be learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reality...","review":"A friend recommended this book, and said that it would soothe my spirit and lead me to understand what God really wants for my life. The book didn't even come close-the author doesn't address the reality of women living in the 21st century. I felt as if I were in a time warp back to the 1950's where women do as they are told, and if we work outside of the home then we are inviting temptation to cheat on our husbands by exposing ourselves to male colleagues. This book denounces any type of modern women's movements that have lead to equal rights and freedom of speech. This book made me depressed after reading it-and I really thought that I know God to be a loving God and to not dislike me just because Eve made a terrible mistake. Only positive is that after reading it-I knew that my faith was based and grounded-and that the guilt, shame and degradation of women put onto us by other's negativity is just not worth buying into. Very disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give less than one star if it was an option","review":"Some of her points are good and she can support with Bible Wisdom.

If I am not in the Will of God for practicing family planning would that not mean she is not in the Will of God for not marrying and reproduing offspring??? I feel that she is making judgements and the only person that can make judgements is God and If a women chooses not to marry and have children or she chooses to marry and have 500 kids that is her choice and we are not to judge either decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away.","review":"This book will not set you free.

(I have the companion study guide too.) I felt that Nancy had a lot of good points, and if you read the book with a discerning eye and heart you can get something good from it... but I found that she didn't offer more than a few verses (sometimes only 1!) to back up her claims, and she was also very opinionated about a few topics that I don't think are so clear in Scripture.She also gives a lot of \\"do's\\" and \\"don'ts\\" which sometimes can be discouraging rather than encouraging. Overall, I did learn from her, but I felt it required too much filtering on my part. Some of the things she says come across pretty offensively if you do not give her the benefit of the doubt.Bottom Line: There are better, more encouraging books for Christian women out there!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for a small group study!","review":"This book is an incredible conversation starter for a small group. While my group did not necessarily agree with everything Ms. DeMoss wrote, we did have great discussions following each chapter. Many of us had never thought about the issues she brought up.

I led a group of college students through it and they all enjoyed it. Many lies were brought to our attention that we did not realize we were believing but definitely were. One thing however - Nancy seems to disagree with birth control as well as women working outside the home. Knowing that these issues were going to be brought up I was able to cover them how I wanted to in our small group.

They did not want their way of life disturbed. The church today has gotten soft, teaching us to \\"feel comfortable\\" as Christians and it is dying for want of the hard Truth. Jesus was tested, had trials and suffered. Should I expect less than my Lord? I may not like everything Nancy says, even question her authority on some things, but it causes me to search for the Truth myself instead of taking the word of someone else. I especially like the chapter on lies we believe about sin. If we confess and repent, we are freed. Otherwise we stay captive to ungodly living. Lies Women Believe has challenged me to a deeper walk with God. Thank you, Nancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I enjoyed studying out of this book with a whole bunch of women from my church.

However, I have been quite disappointed. I was expecting to study the Bible. This study is more about Ms. DeMoss' opinions; however, she does present scripture as she presents \\"the lies women believe.\\" She presents Truth with no Grace. I feel as many others that it is a list of do's and dont's.I prefer to do a study of books of the Bible rather than someone's opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies Women Believe","review":"This book had a lot of extreme views. Demoss generalizes constantly. I felt she twisted scripture to explain her point of view. I did gleam some good out of the book. I am a fairly new Christian and I felt it was more harmful then good. I felt it could give a Christain women a feeling there are only absolutes to God's way, that we are not individuals. I felt it weighed me down more than lifted me up. I had to go back to God's word and study because at times I felt the study was toxic. I think Demoss is very biased and narrow minded. I would especially not recommend it if you are a new Christian. I also about group study I would only recommend it if you are with seasoned Christians who are willing to be objective about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"We studied this book in our women's Bible study group...only for as long as we could stand it.

Six men needed bowls filled. A spoon would be too slow. A stainless steel turner, retired from its earlier use flipping burgers, rested on the corner, ready for use.No one saw the quiet silver patina, or the non-slip grip. The motion was effective, fast, and unnoticed, as it should be. The elegant understated style meant nothing, as the tool served its function. Instead, the turner scooped and bowled the chili before the second commercial began. And six men ate their fill, and then ate some more.A swift rinse, and the stainless steel turner was delivered into the dishwasher.May your chili always scoop quickly into your bowl.--Brockeim"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest piece of sci-fi ever created","review":"Everyone must see this show.

Recently I've been streaming netflix with earphones on as not to wake others and the fan noise brought me to insanity again. Installed this fan today and its quiet so far. Its silent on lo, audible on medium, and a little louder than I'd like on high. I left it on medium and I'd say the volume of air is at least equivalent or better than the factory Datech fan.

I then confirmed that it wasn't due to the installation (case vibration, etc.) by detaching it from case and running the fan sitting on my desk by itself. When it continued to make the noise I sent it back for a replacement. I had the same problem with the replacement and returned it for a refund.

It's small, light weight, the speed adjuster works fine, the adapters and screws are just enough to get the job done.This fan is almost silent. Like sub-20 db. At the highest setting you can hear a faint buzz but at mid and low it's like it's not even on.That being said, I had to give this a 4 star review because with that fan silence comes a price.

Quieter than most stock fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjustable speed fans","review":"These fans do a great job to replace the stock case fans - or to place in cases without fans, or to supplement existing fans in your case. And as a bonus, they come with a switch that allows you to set the speed on the fan as needed to cool your rig.The highest speed does generate a bit of noise, but it also generates the highest cooling, so decide if you want a cool case or more noise. If you want the least noise and the least cooling, move it all the way down. Naturally, the middle is just that. All around a nice set of options."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bright in an Antec 900 case","review":"I just received this fan and installed it. Overall, it's very good. Has a \\"big\\" and \\"small\\" connector (I don't want to get too technical here), a speed control, and the price is reasonable for a LED fan.However, when used as a side fan in my Antec 900, the fan is a bit too bright due to the entire fan being clear plastic. This means that the blue LED's light up the entire fan, which then makes the outline of the fan clearly visible through computer case's grill. I would have preferred if the fan case was black and only the blades clear.4 Stars only because I never give something 5 unless it is truly a master piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The variable speed makes it a winner","review":"This fan replaced a cheap blue LED lit fan that lasted about two years before its bearings wore out and it rattled incessantly and stopped occasionally. I initially hooked the new fan up set on High and it was a little on the loud side, not awful but louder than the one it replaced (when it worked). I set the fan to the Middle setting and did notice a little less air movement but it still seemed sufficient and definitely quieter. Once I shut the case and powered the PC back up I monitored the system and the system temp stays at 40 degrees Celsius. When I had the failing fan in the case the temp would get up over 65 degrees Celsius and cause the over temp alarm to sound. So all in all I am happy with the fan, plus if I need more cooling I can always kick it up to High."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gold Standard","review":"This is the gold standard power supply, there are nicer, more expensive power supplies but this will suit about any application and deliver powerful, quiet cooling. I've removed and remounted this thing about ten times and it's still going strong. The 3-speed switch isn't detachable and you'll have to be creative if you want to use it outside your case, but if you need variable speed I'd look into a fan controller anyways. Not a con just something you might want to know. Mine hasn't been cleaned since I bought it over a year ago and has been on high speed nearly 24/7 and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it. I will probably be buying more of these in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"new fan","review":"IT looks nice with the blue light,but when I replaced my old one with it my computer ran hotter even on it highest setting.

Wallow for example is a perfect balance of metaphor, and realism. The guitar in Wallow is also amazing and Doucet's voice is perfect for this type of CD.The Albim isn't perfect. There are a few songs that don't stand up to my high expectations that songs such as Wallow and Vladivostok have earned.

Often the scanner would stop reading the document before I had scanned it completely. Thus I had to scan the same item multiple times. The manual warns that may take \\"a bit of practice\\" to get the speed and steadiness of your scan-passes correct. But after four tedious hours of climbing the learning curve, I boxed it up for return, and went back to the photocopier. Next trip, I'll go back to dragging a flatbed scanner into the archive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"It is very difficult to get a decent scan without several tries for each page. With practice I was finally able to scan a flat document on a desktop, but the quality still wasn't great. The main reason I got this pen scanner, however, was to scan archives of very old documents bound into books. Since they're never completely flat, it is virtually impossible to get through a page without it shutting itself off. The manual suggests that for books you should start at the binding and scan left to right, instead of top to bottom, thereby creating a \\"landscape\\" document. But guess what - the scanner is only 8.5\\" wide, so you can't capture a regular letter-sized document in landscape format. I think it's a great concept, but for limited applications. With improvements, and possibly a longer \\"pen\\", I think the product has a lot of potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Table Of Contents Info","review":"Introduction: A New Look At A Lost ArtChapter 1: What Fundamental Analysis Is (And Is Not)Chapter 2: Lessons The Market Taught MeChapter 3: Trends, Cycles, Seasons, and the Random WalkChapter 4: The Building Blocks of Technical AnalysisChapter 5: A Key to TechnoFundamentals: SupplyChapter 6: How To Look At Demand TechnoFundamentallyChapter 7: TechnoFundamental ReferencingChapter 8: Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks, and Related ScienceChapter 9: Practical ApplicationsChapter 10: Synthetic Investing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for most of us","review":"I switched from Mac OS to Windows XP, after getting really sick of not having Mac versions of the software I wanted for finance, medicine, programming, games, etc. This book does nothing for me, except to convince me that I made the right move by using a platform used by 98+% of personal computer users."},{"rating":"2","title":"it fits suzuki DR200","review":"It fits perfectly Suzuki DR200 dual.

She loved it so much because the non-stick was so easy to use and cook out of AND CLEAN that she asked me for the set of 3 smaller skillet pans for everyday use, which me and my brother were also able to use with ease for any cooking needs in the kitchen, and we have been using them for around 8 years or so and they still work amazing! So now as her birthday has just passed, she wanted the whole set so she could have the extra pieces and a matching set and everything in her kitchen she would ever need for the stove top and the quality is amazing as usual so i have no plans of replacing these at ALL and will hopefully be able to get a set for my own home as soon as possible! i love this line cookware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Set","review":"Cannot say enough good about this set.

There are also less well-known saints including St. Albert the Great, St. Erasmus, and St. Rocco. Each card also features the feast day for that saint and what he or she is patron of.The \\"Saints\\" cards illustrations are simple in style but have an appealing aspect to them.

There are several opinions on who are the best, but in my view we have: Max Emanual Cencic, Aled Jones, Tery Wey,J B Marnier, and the boy featured on the DVD, Steven Mockel.In my view the voice of Steven is the best of all, it is a pity that there are not more recordings featuring him. Steven sings 1st Soprano in the Sub Tuum Praesidium along with Alfred Halbartschlager. Steven's singing avoids the thin,sound,weakness, too often associated with boys voices.

The rich colors and flowing movements in the pictures made it very easy for me to understand the scenarios and emotions conveyed by each card. The readings have always been very accurate with this deck as well. The only reason that I have not given it 5 stars is that it lacks an in-depth accompaniment book (probably because the imagery does not relate to other schools that would lend to a deeper understanding of the Tarot). Still, for the beginner, and even the expert, this deck is a delight :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first deck, and I lucked out!!","review":"Everyone told me to start with a simpler beginner deck, but I was really drawn to this one and bought it instead.

They look like copies of copies of copies. The colors are dull and the images are fuzzy. The facial expressions are unreadable.

All things in life are transient and in the end what was once our bodies eventually becomes mingled with dust from other sources.

We depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor, to the point of just not using them, which put us in a very unsafe position at times.

We have gone through two generations of Motorola Talkabouts, with this line being the third. These are the worst of them all. The last generation of blue and black ones was fairly bad, with several ceasing to work within days of purchase, and so we thought we would upgrade to the next model up. Of the 6 we purchased, 5 did not have adequate sound transmission - cutting off at the beginning and end of transmission or not working at all. These are junk, don't waste your money!

I highly recommend radios will good power like these for the outdoors, rather than weak .5 watt FRS radios. I found them larger than many in this class, and a bit under powered at only 2 watts max, but OK.However, it should be noted that this walkie talkie tends to show up in the \\"remanufactured\\" sale list quite often. I suspect this as something to do with the audio problems that others have commented on, or it could be something else. If lots get returned and resold, it usually means something is systemically wrong with the design or manufacturing process. In any case, buy with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn down you volumn","review":"Used the Motorola two-way radios on a 2000 mile road trip - great communications with day long battery life and swapping in AA Batteries did not decrease range of quality of transmissions.

They may not have been the best in every area, but they were always consistently high quality and they always worked. The last 3 models I've owned have all been Motorola.I purchased the T9500XLR (their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio) the other day to replace my T4900s. I was appalled at them. The sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older, cheaper T4900s. And worse yet, the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually - at any range and at any transmit power. Whether in the next room or half a mile away, the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out. No settings affected this.I ordered a pair of Midland GXT710VP3 radios instead. They're *way* better. They're what the T9500XLRs should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but limited","review":"The product worked but only about 500 yards.

It was frequently very difficult/impossible to understand what the other person was saying (confirmed in both directions). This wasn't an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such. Simply, it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded. I have an FCC license and have owned numerous Motorola radios over the years. This set was a real disappointment. A radio that can \\"ideally\\" communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can't understand what the other person is saying -- even from a very short distance away.Furthermore, the housing of these radios lacks durability. The rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone -- just cheap-feeling plastic now."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed","review":"I purchased these radios a few months ago and essentially have been unable to use them. The voice clarity does not exist. No one is able to understand anyone. It cuts out sporadically. I would say that the distance is terrible also, but I can't tell if the radio is cutting out or I just can't understand anyone.

The novel tells the story of Abigail Stevenson, a very different woman of her time, interested in being a famous writer, finds herself immersed in the more sordid, but fascinating part of life, including sex, money and greed. A very passionate story of a women who knows what she wants even if it is not the proper thing to do. Malcom Macdonald is a wonderful storyteller and depicts an era that was not all prim and proper. This tale gives us an idea into the early world of writing, publishing and women's rights. Abigail and Annie are both very strong and enigmatic women in a time when women virtually had no say. A wonderful conclusion to this engrossing family saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but rather lightweight","review":"We bought this to replace a Circulon saute pan that was over 16 years old and it was rusting in the grooved interior. The original was all metal without non-stick coating. This pan appeared to be the equivalent with the coating added. I like the new saute pan both for even heating and for its durable non-stick coating. I have used it for over a year now. The one disappointment is that this is thinner or lighter metal than the original. Foods and sauces can scorch or burn more easily. The original was amazing for how scorching or burning were avoided, apparently thanks to the grooved Circulon surface in the bottom interior of the pan. I must be more vigilant now with this pan and I place it on par with other good saute pans I owned before the Circulon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvey looks like Jay Leno","review":"Harvey is a train with a magnet crane who helps out other trains when they lose their loads or go off the tracks.

I am sending them back to the manufacter for replacement with a 1 month wait. For the price and care I put into them I expected more. I cook frequently and I wanted good pans. thats why I spent the money for these. The metal covers are not useful as you can not see the \\"doneness\\" of anything you cook.

It's hard not to be moved to tears by John McDermott's tribute to his parents and his collaboration with Kearns and Ronan Tynan on \\"Red is the Rose.\\" But Finbar Wright is a worthy replacement for McDermott. When he joins with Kearns and Tynan on \\"Fields of Athenry,\\" it's enough to send shivers down your spine.

I was not aware of the history of the group and that for me the standout of the group was in fact a and-in/replacement for John McDermott - Finbar Wright. His voice is rich and romantic able to hit those high notes that hit you in the heart aw well as the ears. When he blended his voice with Ronan Tynan and Anthony Kearns you would think you were listening to a small male choir - the effect is staggering. Ronan's version of Scorn Not His Simplicity nearly brought not only the audience but himself to tears. When you read his bio you will understand why. I would only hope that Finbar would join this group for such recordings. If you want the analogy in pop music terms just imagine a pleasant voiced singer could not make the concert and Barbra Streisand took her place. I own over 2,500 CD's and this has now become one of my top ten.

The overall sound of the Tenors as a group has been much improved by the addition of that fine tenor Finbar Wright. His voice and style matches beautifully with that of Anthony Kearns and Ronan Tynan.I loved this album because it has such a good mix of songs. From the operatic There is a Flower that Bloometh sung by Anthony Kearns, the beautiful Carrickfergus by Finbar Wright and emotional singing of Phil Coulter's song Scorn Not his Simplicity by Ronan Tynan to the fun of the Percy French medley and energy of The Kerry Dance and Will Ye Go Lassie Go?If you enjoy good singing you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but not Blue Collar Comedy Tour Quality","review":"Ron White is hilarious comedian. He gained notoriety on the \\"Blue Collar Comedy Tour\\" and was every bit as good as Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy. Since I enjoyed that show and very much enjoyed his major label CD, I looked around for what else was available. There was not much but this one did come up on the search.This is an earlier work. His timing is not as good and in his later work and his stories are not as funny but they are still very good. Some are also pretty dated. Unless you remember Olga Korbut and Nadia Comanech (?) as great gymnasts from the 70s and 80s Olympic games, some won't mean much.His style is somewhat abrasive but the sarcasm is more directed towards himself than towards others. That doesn't stop him from launching a few zingers at others but a lot of it is self effacing.If you like lowbrow, Southern style humor, you could do a lot worse than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"some of his original stuff, an early rising star, good for the collection","review":"Yeah, I agree, some of this stuff was not the caliber of his recent albums with Blue collar and his other two major label releases (Drunk in Public and You can't fix stupid), but give me a break, he had to start somewhere, and this album captures that. Yeah, its a bit down in recording quality, and the act isn't as refined, but its still funny. I my book, a must have in the Ron white historical Archive.

Though the author manages to occasionally produce some interesting wordcraft, her work is mired in the pretentions that plague academic poetry, relying too heavily on references to classical works and mythology instead of more human elements. In addition, many of her works are too abstract, in my opinion, to really involve the reader.

The author, who is from India, was an auditor at a UAE bank and clearly knows the inside scoop on this very corrupt country of seven sheikdoms. However, his command of English grammar, punctuation, and spelling of people's names is really horrible. Unfortunately, the book suffers not just from a lack of nuts-and-bolts copyediting but also from a general structural editing. He needs help with the overall organization and expression of his material. The presentation of facts is fairly chaotic, bordering at times on incoherent, and accompanied by many documents too tiny to read but not labeled or explained very well. I am very interested in the author's topic and greatly appreciate and respect him for what he is trying to do, but I must say that I regret having paid $19.95 for the book in this condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Title if like his Accountancy Business!!!","review":"Certainly an inadequate assessment of 9/11 banking which is not surprising when you consider how shabbily he runs his own accountancy business.

In the cover sleeve, they put the emphasis on the fact that this was a hard album to make in and of itself, since it was recorded \\"live\\", which means that anything can and does happen. At no point do they tell you about the song or the sequences, which leads me to believe, after listening to the album, that indeed, they knew it was low on content. Do not buy this album if you want a sample of TD's original seventies music. This is not representative of their best material. Instead, may I suggest Ricochet, Force Majeure (My favorite from that period), or even some of their late seventies, early eighties material, such as Thief or Tangram.

The actual concert during the brief periods where you can hear it over the \\"Tangentization\\" is a classic. 1976 was a transitory year live for Tangerine Dream. They were beginning to bring some element of structure to their concerts. The freeform Moog freakouts were gradually being replaced by sequencers and the guitar noodling sounds suspicously like the opening chords to Pink Floyd's \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\".

If you have an equalizer u can get rid of the sound by dropping out the high end but why should we have to do this with a legit release!?? When they put together Ricochet they claimed to have listened to 50 to 70 hours worth of tapes. WHERE are those tapes?? Why release a doctored badly damaged tape??

The result was ranch sauce added to the apple pie instead of whip cream. Don't get me wrong I have every release of TD particularly the 70s-2000s and never missed the classic year releases but this one is a total disappointment.

Here is a concert that drew critical praise and is an important foundation to the technological revolution of the band, but it is manipulated years later for release.Artists may complain about fans who seek out bootlegs to supplement their collections, but this album is a major reason why; failing to let the real music do the talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused?

It's a justly famous performance and is out there in very good sound if you look for it.This means therefore that an extra 10 mins worth of overdubs and added sounds have been added. Presumably in order to make it up to a minimum length for an official release.

My daughter has me insert her name in place of Lily and her sister's name as Lily's baby brother, etc.But mostly what I love is it gives us an opportunity to talk and read to together. When my daughter wanted to bring her new \\"purse\\" to school, we discussed what happened to Lily. When she had a fight with a friend and my daughter was wrong, we talked about \\"sorry.\\" But as my daughter now enters pre-school, it gave us an opportunity to talk about how Lily loves school and my daughter will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful for Corporate America","review":"This book, about waiting your turn, sharing, and cooling off before responding inappropriately has great applications for the work environment. Reading about Lilly attempts to retrieve a note written in anger from her teacher's grasp reminded me of e-mails sent that one wanted to take back. Besides, it has illustrations that are totally hysterically humorous. A great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it, and it was way too wordy","review":"...and he said \\"wow\\" because that was just about all you could say...

It is so funny and I love how Lilly is so ostentatious with her purse. She is exactly like I was at that age and I love the message of not impulsively taking revenge on someone before simmering down. I recommend this book to everyone and I promise you will love it! I even named my Hamster after Lilly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is perfect for my 6 year old niece. It's the cute story of Lilly, who is so excited to impress her favorite teacher that she fails to give him respect and is punished instead of wowing him with her new things. She's mad at first but learns that he is trying to help her and not hurt her in doing so. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse","review":"This is a delightful, imaginative story about the antic of a young girl when she takes her purple, plastic purse to school with her. I believe this book is a great read-a-loud story to preschoolers, kindergartners, and first graders. There is a soft Lilly doll (mouse) to use and enjoy during the story. It is a great springboard for oral language lessons and vocabulary. Another homerun for Kevin Henkes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid's Review","review":"This laugh out loud, heart-warming book is fantastic. There is this little mouse named Lilly. Lilly loves school. She even acts like a teacher to her little brother, Julius. One day Lilly came to school very happy. She brought something very special and her teacher doesn't like it. Lilly keeps a purple plastic purse and she wants to bring it to school. Honestly my favorite part when she teaches her brother the alphabet. I recommend this book for children who like to laugh. Will Lilly get in more trouble? Will her teacher forgive her?

The reason I would recommend this book is so people could decide if they like it even though I didn't. I didn't like this book because Lilly was mean. In the book I read that Lilly was writing mean stuff to her teacher just because the teacher took her stuff away when she wasn't supposed to have it in school. This convinced me that it was not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious!","review":"This story, is so tedious I couldn't keep my kid focused for more than a few moments at a time. The story took so long to get to the point, when you got there you could care less!Unfortunately it was required reading so we were forced to take the long winding road."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it!","review":"i would give this book no stars if I could. It shows the ambivalence of our culture's attitude toward limit setting with children, as well as our inability to deal with anger. I would not let a child of mine near this book, no matter how entertaining it is. Having the teacher give Lilly presents after setting a reasonable limit undermines the idea that adults NEED to set reasonable limits and need not apologize for them; it gives the message that adults should try to get children to like them at all costs. Having Lilly feel deep shame for expressing her anger in a perfectly appropriate non-violent way delegitamizes her angry feeling and her way of expressing them. I am appalled but not surprised by the book's popularity; I would hope adults would start to think about the message this book gives to both aults and children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politicizing a children's book??","review":"My MIL purchased this book for my daughter who is 15 months old. I just recently sat down to read it to her. All in all, a cute book, but I was surprised and annoyed at the illustrations in the book. This book definitely has a liberal slant to it - the teacher wears \\"artistic shirts\\" and in the picture, he has the words \\"Global Village\\" and \\"One World\\" written on the chalkboard. Really? This is supposed to be lower elementary school, and I found that to be a thinly-veiled attempt to convey liberal politics to the reader. Additionally, although not as annoying is that when Lilly's parents help her apologize, the dad is wearing a peace shirt and is making the treats which seemed to be, again, liberal in nature.The author is free to include his politics in the book, but I thought that parents should be aware of this agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One and Only Cat Calendar","review":"This is an essential calendar for cat lovers. I have been using the cats page-a-day calendar since it was printed in black-and-white (and just got my 2005). It has and good mix of funny snapshots along with well-posed photographs of cats. Award winning photographs are presented at the beginning of the year and for each week. Each day offers some bit of good information, quotes, facts about cats or just the story behind the photograph. It is a calendar that I like to page through and I save the discarded days for use as scratch paper. The plastic base can be recycled at the end of the year. All cat lovers should have one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surpassed expectations","review":"I had pretty low expectations when I first tried this camera. I had no idea how much it cost as it was a gift. It actually worked pretty well. Picture quality is decent for such a small camera.

It's the first time I hear the \\"Chopin-humour\\" in these pieces! He also gives the right importance to the left-hand. And let's be honest: isn't it just a miracle someone can play like this? He definitely shows he won the Chopin competition deservedly!.And the then Liszt sonata! It's one of the best recordings I've ever heard. Fantastic virtuosity, passion, drive (hear the allegro energico!) and vision.A DVD production like this will not be to everyone's liking: at some points e.g. I would like to see just the hands.

The text is full of instructive and often very funny examples of illogical thinking. These include personal anecdotes, as well as examples from the media, history, science, and even Shakespeare. The author's breadth of knowledge, and his ability to explain the principles of logic to a lay audience make this book well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy","review":"I got Kathy Troccoli's first album, Stubborn Love, back in 1982.

This is the first album I've heard since the soulful, lively Heart And Soul. I knew her sound would have changed vastly since then, but I wasn't expecting this.This is a very slow and sleepy album. She plays various worship songs and hymns on a piano, all at incredibly slow tempo, often flowing from one song to the next, but they all sound exactly the same.

If you barely touch the thing while its plugged in it makes a whole lot of static in your headset like the whole thing just does not connect right. So i decided maybe to try again since nobody seems to make headsets with this type built in anymore and it is a lot easier keeping the mute and volume right under the controller instead of dangling somewhere around your chest. Well it turns out to just be crap. I would not buy this product again.

I have read just about all of the alternate history I can lay my hands on - I think it's a wonderful means of learning how close we've come to disaster. This book was a fascinating read in terms of topic, but had very little to offer in terms of analysis. Each short essay explores a different possibility, and granted many of them go into some depth explaining how the possibility might have come to pass, but the level of depth included for each scenario is truly insufficient. Kenneth Macksey, on the other hand, really understands how much information is necessary for an alternate history: in his books, The Hitler Options, and Invasion, he gives excellent alternate history accounts. So does Peter Tsouras in Gettysburg. This book just doesn't give enough. The best thing it has accomplished has been to give recognition to a valid means of studying history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Stuff from Good Historians","review":"There are a lot of horrible alternative history books out there. In my opinion some of the worst are by the popular writer Harry Turtletub. Other than his Guns of the South, I find most of his stuff really really bad.I was very pleased to see a book of alternate history written by distinguished historians. John Keegan the Great Military History, McCollough from American Experience and Author of Truman, and Caleb Carr just to name a few.As historians, teachers, history fans, we can argue all day about some of the scenerios and what ifs found in this book. That is the fun part. Who Knows....But the bottom line is this: the book is very thought provoking. The scenerios are food for thought. The historians who are used in this collection know there stuff and can write.This is a fun book to read and even better to debate. Its time and money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Most of the essays contained in the book are mere accounts of things that actually happened. Only at the very end of each chapter is there any mention of actual alternate history and then it is often very short and only presents a general overview of what the world would be like if different events had taken place. The exceptions are probably the essays about World War I, Hitler and Midway; otherwise the book is just a collection of information that could be readily found in textbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Entertaining, intelligent look at what could have happened had things been a bit different. Well considered fun with history makes one think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much background needed","review":"Many of the writers presuppose that the reader knows a great deal about each historical situation. I'm all right in this area, but I frequently became confused to some of the references. I'm sure this is heaven for the historical buff, but it all left me a little cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look into what might have happened","review":"History is immutable fact; perhaps that's why looking at how things could have turned out differently is such an intriguing subject. \\"What If\\" offers up a dozen or so essays written about potential turning points in recorded history, where a slight change in events could have altered the course of history for all time. The writing syles of the various essays (examples include a notional Allied failure on the Normandy beaches and Arab victory at Tours) are brisk and easy to follow. I wasn't immediately sold on some of scenaraios invoked by the essays, but that has caused me to further research those ideas, includin reading dissenting opinion, and isn't that what a good book is suposed to do? Make you interested to read some more about a topic? Bottom line: this is a good intro book for someone interested in counterfactual history. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IF....WHO KNOWS?","review":"I found this book interesting in part but I cannot really recommend it for this reason: It is possible to take any historical, natural or personal event and mentally change an element in the sequence of events that apparently brought it about, then write a story about how things might have worked out differently. The resultant work is not history, natural history or biography, it is pure fantasy. Historical events are so complex that even knowing that something has acutally happened, it is only with the utmost difficulty that historians attempt to explain what has happened or why. The idea that a historian sitting in an armchair could change around some causative event and then explain what the resultant events would be is sheer nonsense. No man or machine is brilliant enough to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"The premise is great but most of the items read like lectures and some do not have an alternate.

The chapter dealing with the Mongol invasion of Europe in the 13th Century was simply outstanding, and the chapter on the American Revolution was quite thought-provoking. But I thought the Civil War section was unimaginative; in speculating as to what might have happened if Lee's orders hadn't been lost in September, 1862, the author describes a battle taking place at (surprise, surprise) Gettysburg. The chapter dealing with the Aztec defeat of Cortez had great promise but a good deal of nonsense; how on Earth could the Aztecs have built a navy? Also, the sections on World War One and World War Two could have been much better. Still, for all its faults, I thought this book was an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I like alternate history and thought this would be interesting.

If you break one, you have toxic powder all over the place. They are not for ceiling fans where any vibration could cause the tubes to shatter or leak. Mounting CFLs with the base above the tubes is also not recommended since it causes the base to overheat and the bulb will not last as long.Basically, this is a very good product if installed properly and the precautions are followed (remove the government-mandated piece of junk in the base.

Canon repaired it. After 1 year and a half, the camcorder died on me. I read other reviews and other people complained of other or similar models in the ZR series dying after the 1 year warranty was up. This was ridiculous. I am never going with Canon again.

I edit my works on the computer, so effects were not important (and should be used sparingly!) The Canon ZR-80 is lightweight and well-balanced. The ability to return to 'easy' mode with the flick of a switch from anywhere in custom settings is a great feature. The camera turns out nice-looking video with practice. Another plus: I was able to train a cameraman for a family event in less than one minute. I showed him the zoom and the pause, and off he went. As with most digital cameras, there is no video noise between pause and record. If you don't want to edit on a computer, the pause-record method makes for clean segues.

First let me remark that talking about content, the book is very good. It contains elegance, rigor and the explanations seem OK.

Its verydifficult, and just makes your eyes water over. It sucks. There exists better books on analysis. I'm not sure about measure theory and other books, for this is the only one i've read.

It is an upbeat piece featuring a good Pakistani Qawwali. The other reason I bought this compilation was because of Talvin Singh. I hadn't heard of \\"Ghoom Charakhana\\" but I'm an avid fan of Singh. I think he is the best solo artist among the Asian Underground Movement and he didn't disappoint me with this piece. \\"Sweet Pain\\" by Joi is another excellent remix, but this single is on \\"Star Rise\\", a compilation of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan remixes. Incidentally, Fun Da Mental is also on \\"Star Rise\\" and they deliver beautifully. The remaining pieces on the CD were too mellow for my taste. It was relaxing to the point that it lulled me to sleep.If you are interested in getting into this genre of Asian Underground music, \\"Anokha: Soundz of the Asian Underground\\" is the best place to whet your apetite. It is probably the best compilation of Underground music yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many bands have tried to do this.","review":"This is a combination of fusion jazz, ambient and house music all done with an asian/indian feel. The warbling vocal, sitar and foreign lyrics are all represented here. So is it listenable? Yes, the disc is surprisingly accessible to western ears. The sitar piece is elegantly done, and the warbling vocals (which I have a particularly hard time with) are not so over done as to drive the listener away. This is one to listen to first, then decide whether or not to keep it. Myself, I think it deserves a second listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"My husband and I have been married for 34 years.

I actually purchased 3 copies of it; one for our newlywed daughter and son-in-law, one to replace our copy, and one to loan to other couples.

When I first started reading this book, I thought the writers might be going a bit overboard. They had not even begun.In a nutshell, Las Vegas is ugly, corrupt, evil, racist, anti-union, but don't blame the city, it truly represents all of the US.I was starting to think the book sounded like a press release from the old Soviet Union, only to find they actually refer to workers as \\"the proletariat\\".Las Vegas corruption also helped cause the Vietnam War, the Reagan Administration, and if you were one of the few \\"good guys\\", your death would most likely be suspicious (an \\"apparent\\" heart attack)But worse of all, its absolutely boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoia Strikes Deep","review":"While many authors tend to overlook the criminal influence in Las Vegas and view the known criminals as a group of Damon Runyon characters these authors go to the other extreme. Every problem and political scandal in the United States today is traced backed to Las Vegas in their view. I hate to admit it but the book was so boring that I couldn't finish it. If you are looking for the worst this book may be for you but if you want an even handed approach look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Fiction","review":"Although the title sounds tempting, it is a waste of money and time to read this book-- glorified gossip is more like it.

I said to my wife, while reading this book, \\"It's startling\\", she said, \\"I can imagine\\" and I had to reply, \\"No you can't\\". I guess I expected exposes of sleaze, but sleaze (in the conventional sense of back-room oral sex, or whatever) is just background noise. The real sleaze is the tightly integrated relationship between organised crime and \\"straight\\" society, described in a deadpan style that makes the hand-in-pocket relationship between mobsters and pols seem completely ordinary - as, indeed, it is in Las Vegas's history. The overriding theme - that America - or, if you prefer, modern society - is at least as corrupt as Vegas and that Vegas may be an honest admission of that corruption in some strange way, is made with finesse. Only some leaden writing, from time to time, stops this from beiung a 5* review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"A lot has changed in Las Vegas since this book was first published, but that doesn't change the fact that is remains a stunning read. Learn a little bit about the corruption that created America's playground, the hack \\"journalist\\" who started--what is now a media empire in the city--a newspaper to coerce politicians and land developers, and all the shady politics that involve a number of names you will recognize from today's \\"corporate\\" Las Vegas."},{"rating":"2","title":"a powerful bias","review":"Excellent detail, thoroughly documented. The book covers a wide range of significant figures in the city's colorful past. The major problem is that the authors stretch to fit the past 50 years of US history into the Las Vegas nutshell. Perhaps the bigger problem is the all encompassing political bias of the authors (conservative = reactionary) and the absolute lack of questioning of the cultural norms that the city's rise has supplanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"culture of self indulgence","review":"Alright, maybe not THE definatative work on the history of Vegas, but this city has grown quite a bit in fifty years and considering that, there is much to write about as compared to say Eklo, NV.

Miller claims to expose all sorts of intimate details of Foucault's life for which he has no actual evidence--only his own imagination and a loose construction of the context--and then bases his biography on those constructs. In the end he does little do illuminate the late Foucault, doesn't engage with any of the lectures which are being translated these days (and which were available in taped form much earlier) and consequently fails to extend to his subject what most biographers would expect for themselves--a serious engagement with the life and thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets Get Real about this Biography","review":"I give 2 stars because Miller is uncritical and his premise is excellent, looking at Foucault's life as a Nietzean exercise, but his execution of it is rather clunky. 1)His interpretation is overdetermined. Reading this biography flattens Foucault's works into being about the same thing. Foucault, in Miller's hands, appear to never have had shifts in his thinking. 2)Reader beware! Miller quotes Foucault out of context. One will always have to compare Miller's quotes against the original. 3) He overpersonalizes the philospher failing to provide a context of which Foucault's ideas had arisen. If you want a well-balanced biography try David Macey. Macey respects the reader's intelligence, he allows us to decide for ourselves unlike, Miller who imposes his interpretation on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage- Why Not Illuminate the Man's Thought Instead?","review":"This book had been recommended me, as a Foucault freak, and I must say that I was immensely disappointed. As one of the above reviewers said, he's just digging up a bunch of dirt that doesn't have much redeeming value in the end. I love S&M myself but 200 pages detailing Foucault's odd and disturbing behaviors in his personal life did nothing whatsoever to illuminate, for me, the connections between his personal life and his works. Follow Martin Heidegger's advice here: don't learn anything about the life of the philosopher you seek to know, let his works speak for him! A lot of academics were offended when Heidegger taught Plato this very way- way back in the 1920s- but believe me, it is an approach which is not yet outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too general","review":"Great topic but this book is full of supposition and not much that we haven't read a hundred times before.

From what I recall from that time, Keel's whole career was built around that single, and for a good reason: the rest of this album is the very definition of metal filler, with the possible exceptions of Easier Said than Done, which sounds like a tamer version of Kiss's Lick it Up and Let's Spend the Night Together, which is a Rolling Stones Cover. Good 'ol Ron Keel at least knew that hair metal's selling point was catchy songwriting, and seeing that his band was sorely lacking in that department he would ultimately ditch the genre and go country years later.

I read somewhere that some of Diehl's books were great and others not so great - IMHO Chameleon was not one of his best.The first few chapters looked pretty good but after that the plot became devious, frequently unbelievable and difficult to follow. There were scenes and characters that didn't add to the plot, and baddies turned out to be goodies and goodies turned out to be baddies. The technology part of the story has dated a lot as things have changed greatly since Diehl wrote the book in the 1970's or 1980's.William Diehl had a reputation as an excellent thriller writer and it is great that his estate is releasing most of his books in Kindle format.

The most annoying thing about the novel, however, is the way he introduces characters in disconnected scenes and gets us acquainted with them only to kill them off!

If you love the OPC or are just looking for some fine reading, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manatees on Location","review":"This is a wonderful book that is divided into 8 sections and depicts beautiful photography. The mother/daughter team give an accurate description of the manatee and their plight. Also, manatee anatomy and their sixth sense are explored. THis is a good book for any level teacher who is introducing a unit on Manatees or Endangered species. A plug for Save the Manatees is also mentioned with contact information on their back book jacket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for all disciplines...","review":"This book encompasses the history of the Yangtze, as a history major I enjoyed learning about the history pertaining the Yangtze. Moreover, it discusses the political motives behind the construction of the dam. Also, this book addresses the social as well as environmental costs of TGD. It is a great book for students, travelers, environmentalists, historians, and those who have an interest in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal on bg gate","review":"good secure gate... a bit of a pain to get through if using all the time... harder than normal gates but good for keeping baby in... best gate we found for large openings in the price range...would reccomend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Pressure Mounted Gate","review":"This gate isn't a pressure mount. It's definitely not portable. It pressure mounts onto plastic things that you SCREW into the doorway. No thanks. I'm disappointed that it was misrepresented in the description and I'll be sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive advertising","review":"I was looking for a pressure-mounted extra wide gate, and came across this product and thought it fit the bill by reading the product description. The description reads as follows: \\"This features pressure mounts for easy set up and take down around the house and on the road.\\" The utility of the product might be okay, but I had an issue with its advertising. This product DOES NOT pressure mount. It needs hardware to be installed to the walls. If the manufacturer just wrote that it needs screws to mount, it would have saved me the two week hassle to get the one that I truly was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate 0 stars I would","review":"Our opening is 46 definitely does not fit! either fits the minimum width or the max.

Then yesterday, the entire metal bottom of the gate snapped in half. The warranty is only 90 days and they didn't have a part they could ship to fix it. The only option is to buy a brand new gate. I'm not going to do that just to have it break again. So irritating and a huge waste of money. I'll add a picture later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I ordered and received the Regalo Maxi Gate a few weeks ago, but have been unable to install it because the diagram in the instruction manual does not match what was shipped. I called the phone number on the manual, only to find out that the number had been changed. I did get the new number and called it, but the canned response just said the office was closed--no information about when the office was open. I am going to send the gate back if I do not hear from someone in the next day or two, and will contact Amazon to find out if I can get back my return shipping, as the product is relatively heavy and will cost a fair amount to ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Gate","review":"This gate is so poorly built it is not even funny!!!

Beware","review":"I purchased this gate Oct 2011 and last night we noticed my daughter got out and upon looking noticed the metal completely cracked!! SO it is not useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every opening","review":"Although this gate may be suitable for wide openings it does not take into account moldings on the wall or thresholds so it has pieces that are supposed to be mounted to the wall but it requires it to be in the middle of the molding so that half of it is not touching the wall. It also has a piece for the middle of the gate that should go in the middle on the floor, but if you have a threshold then the gate again won't be able to support this piece and won't be able to install properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for the price....","review":"I rated this 2 stars, if says three stars I dont know why, anyway Seems fairly sturdy, good for the price, BUT the things I HATE about it is you have to screw brackets into the wall to secure it, the gate installed sits an inch off the floor so there's a bar you have to step over when you walk through it(Huge Trip Hazard), it's NOT a space saver if you choose not to have the gate up, the latch on the gate is kinda child proof, the release slides to the side to open latch i do and do not like that, and the gate only opens one way! SO its not a bad gate but not a great gate, you get what you pay for and Im glad I didnt pay anymore than I did for this and it's serving its purpose But in the future I will pay more for a better gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit all openings between 38\\" and 60\\"","review":"Although the instruction manual claims, \\"This gate can be used in openings from 38 to 60 inches,\\" there is a window between 40 and 45 inches where the gate cannot be made to work. Using only the main gate (without extension) it will span up to 40\\" and the gate with extension can only be shortened to 45\\", leaving the gap between 40 and 45 inches, which happened to be the opening I wanted to span.In addition, I didn't like that it would only swing one way; also, the latching mechanism seemed cumbersome. It's probably a good gate if you have a very wide opening, but otherwise, stick with something else. The two stars are because the product was not as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"1) Gate did not reach 59 inches because that is what I needed EXACTLY.2) Gate was also bent during shipping and it was a pain in the rear just to try to bend it back3) Door opening was very small and narrow, so if you're a fatty, don't come throughI would have given it 4 stars if it fit 59 inches. Either I was sent the wrong one, I don't know. All I know is that I spend a LOT of money on Amazon.com, too much to have this mistake. And it's such a hassle to have to return items because I work so many hours a week that I literally work USPS/UPS hours and more so I literally have to lose money by taking time off work to return it. Thats why I do all my shopping online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not fit our 48\\" door opening","review":"I bought this gate to fit in a 48\\" doorway, but we could not adjust it to fit. Other than not fitting, it seemed like a nice enough gate, although it was not very tall. I was a little concerned my active 2 year old would try to climb on top of it, but we could never install it, so I don't know if that would have been a problem or not. I think if you had a larger door opening or a smaller one, it might have fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protrusion!","review":"My hallway opening is about 44.5\\" which falls between the claimed 37-59\\" capabilities of the product. However the provided extension leaves 5 inches of itself protruding into the pass-through, just waiting to snag something or someone. Only option is to take a hack saw to it or return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"By no means the best","review":"I was looking for something to span the gap from my kitchen to the living room. unfortunately i had to work around a baseboard, and decorative molding at the top (beneath the side counter area) I made it work, but the gate is not as sturdy as i would have hoped and I bought it 6 months before i installed it, so i believe it is to late to return :/ looks like we're stuck with it.... So long as it does it's job and keeps my little one out of the kitchen, I will be happy... I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy something else","review":"Cheap construction. You have to permanently affix to the wall, unlike competitors' models which work by compression fittings. Buy the Richell or Carlson gates. They are sturdy and versatile. Plus they are nicer in appearance. The Carlson also has a small pet door built into the bottom of the swinging gate which allows your poor cat to escape your mean old dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great...","review":"I purchased this gate for use as a baby gate. It's pretty cheaply constructed and doesn't seem that sturdy. I was also upset because the description led me to believe that this was pressure mounted. It's not. I don't see how they think that this would be portable. You do have to screw this into your wall. I wanted to send the gate back when we received it, but my husband wanted to start using it immediately and didn't want to send it back. It's not worth the money. Also, if I dont lock it, my 18 month old can open the gate and escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"really cheaply made: is falling apart after 1 week","review":"I probably go into this filing basket about once a week and it is half filled at most.

Can't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Flimsy, doesn't fit well, way over priced.... We ordered 2 on the same day at the exact same time and they are different colors from each other. To boot, we have to pay for shipping and handling back so it actually cost us money.

Functional and looks nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect File Storage Solution","review":"This basket really fits the bill. I have a very small home office and did not have the space for a filing cabinet. This wicker basket with the built-in hangers for hanging files is just right! The wicker around edge was a tad brittle and some pieces (nothing major) broke off. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. Other than that it is a good value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with quality","review":"I love the natural look of wicker. These boxes had pieces sticking out randomly and the paint job appeared chipped. If I had seen the boxes in a store, I would not have paid $40 each for them. Please note, the boxes were not damaged in transit...they are just poor quality.Buyer beware, you are responsible for shipping the items back to the vendor. When I went to return the items, I discovered shipping to California is very expensive...anywhere from $32 to over $100. Needless to say, I kept the boxes because it was more money down the drain to return.Lessons learned, review the return policy! There are many alternatives out there and I should have chosen one with a better return policy in a state that is cheap to ship to. I was told by the very nice man in the package store that next to Hawaii and Alaska, California and Texas are the two most expensive states to ship to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicker breaking as soon as it arrived","review":"I'm amazed that someone would say the wicker around the edge was \\"a tad brittle, and some pieces broke off\\" and then give the product four stars! The fact that pieces are already breaking off when the box is brand new might be a clue that it's of inferior quality. The broken off pieces of wicker make the box actually dangerous--you can scratch or cut yourself if you aren't extremely careful hanging files in it. The best I can say is that it looks nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Alternative to Plastic","review":"This is a charming file box! My daughter was more than pleased to give up a plastic crate in favor of this covered wicker box. We have about 25 hanging files with papers in it.

I havent had much trouble with anything at all, everything works fine (i have SuSe and XP running). As a amateur photographer, i really like the 4-1 card reader, it helps me out a lot. There are lots of USB ports, you get a firewall port in the front, making things a bit easier to reach.Performace is just awesome with this computer. I can run multiple programs at once, and the computer doesnt slow down or freeze.

The first issue is the audio mix, it is poor with the guitars very much in the background. Next is my biggest issue, the singer talks over the solos, sings out of key, barks like a dog and in general ruins the show. In the song 100th Meridian (which is a great song), he starts off okay but very quickly strays off into a bunch of ranting, comes back briefly to the original content and it ends. Zero satisfaction for somebody wanting to hear to anything remotely close to the original tune. This is just one example. Simply put, the singer ruins this show.I will say that it is a very nicely shot DVD and the band (aside from Gord?) is top notch. With that said, I cannot sit through it again and will be pitching this one in the rubbish bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have never seen The Hip in concert and after watching this DVD, I don't want to see them live. I love their music on cd, but Gord Downie ruins every song on this dvd. He rants and raves and spazzes out on every song. He talks over the music, which is very distracting, example, yelling at his microphone:\\"Microphone stand thinks he's a man, but can't get away from me!\\" When he does sing, it's more like yelling. The one nice thing is this dvd is less than I would have spent on a ticket. I will just enjoy their cds and that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better each time you watch it!","review":"If you think Tragically Hip is a good recording band, you'll love them live, and every time you watch this concert you'll enjoy it even more.

Ellie is the only one who gives Lazlo a chance, and finds out that he really is a great guy. This story teaches you that looks can be decieving.

When she asks the others to say, \\"Hi,\\" they ignore her. Then, while chaos reigns and rains about her, the teacher uses a \\"voice shrill and tight\\" and \\"white chalk (as) her tool...\\" Boo!

A book should stand or fall on its own merits, not because of whose name is on the cover.

The only thing they could tell me is that DivX4 & XviD specifically won't work, but they have no idea what MP4 formats >will< work.The reason why this rates two stars instead of one is the price that I found ($70), burned DVDs >do< work (all DVD +/-RW that I tried), and as an added (unadvertised) bonus, it will read both NTSC and PAL video.As a side note, the A/V input cable is (to my knowledge) non-standard, using a single, three-wire 3.5mm mini-plug. By contrast, I also have an older (1st generation) portable DVD where the A/V cable split into two 3.5mm mini-plugs (a two-wire standard audio and a single-wire video) which allowed (now) standard cables to be used as replacements in case the included cable was lost or destroyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this for everyday use","review":"Worth a few bucks if you get the Joovy Caboose.

After ordering them and tasting how sweet they are, I decided to look closely at the nutritional information displayed on the Amazon page and saw that there is 8 grams of sugar per slice, and each bar contains three slices. That would be 24 grams of sugar per bar. The bar packaging says that there's 19.6 grams of sugar per bar. I'm not sure which information to believe, but it's most likely the 24 grams per bar. The sugar is from dates and brown rice syrup, but sugar is sugar, and that amount is way too much sugar for me.The bars are also crunchy, I was expecting them to be chewy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basically taste the same as sugar-sweetened sesame bars","review":"I couldn't taste a difference between these and the sugar-sweetened bars available elsewhere, and they consisted of closely-packed sesame seeds held together by the syrup - maybe the reviewer who claimed they were mostly syrup got a bad batch? Mine definitely weren't. Good for people who want to get away from refined and artificial sweeteners.

Wrong. Peck and Lily do visit some circle sites but this book is about 1% stone circles and 99% Peck going on and on and on and on and on and on about himself, his life, his beliefs, his personal health, and why faithful Lily forgave him for all the pain his freewheeling, skirtchasing lifestyle as one of the \\"it\\" crowd of the '60's and '70's self-discovery movement caused her. This is not about Britain's heritage sites, or even about self-help, it's about Peck patting Peck on the back for being such a smart fella. A bad book without any redeeming qualities. A waste of money and time. Oh, and Dr. Peck, Scotland is not, as you claim, \\"larger than all the rest of the United Kingdom combined.\\" Jeesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"Never having read \\"A Road Less Traveled\\", I, unfortunately, purchased Peck's cassette \\"In Search Of Stones\\", with his voice on the tape. The tape was very disappointing to say the least. From the wonderful things I have heard about his other books, he is obviously a man who does not walk the walk, with his infidelity when he was touring and lecturing his book. I felt no remorse from him whatsoever. His voice became grating after a while and I could not finish the tape. It's easy to have a philosophy about life, however, living that philosophy is not so easy. I don't believe I will read any of his books as there are so many good writers now, who I beleive do live their truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"Having read a couple of Dr Peck's other books, I bought this one hoping to find the best of all worlds (travel, archaeology, religion, and spirituality). I was disappointed on all counts. The 'stones' part was a rapid-fire description of site after site. Because very little is known about the history behind these stones or the people who constructed them, the book becomes a somewhat thinly disguised autobiography (in spite of his denials at the beginning). One must admire Dr Peck's honesty in cataloguing his many physical (smoking, drinking, various health problems)and psychological (marital infidelities, addictions, relationships with his kids, and other) problems. It makes me feel a little more human, but it wasn't what I expected when I bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMMM?!?!?","review":"Wanted to get insights . . . after reading a bit, more just wanted to stay awake.

I recently returned from a two month trip to China with several hundred pictures in the viewer. I have always followed their instructions to the letter and somehow this time both the computer and the viewer locked up. I was forced to reset both and in the process ALL MY PICTURES WERE LOST. Epson should have a foolproof way that won't let you lose your files without manually deleting them. Generally that is the way it is on computers unless you have an outright crash.And, everything on your camera card downloads everytime, a very bad feature.

The processor is much faster and it loads and cranks through the photos much more quickly. The addition of a full USB port allows input from any USB device including flash memory. The display is slightly larger and the colors are spectacular. I did experience a few little software glitches (screen freezing, etc) but updates seemed to resolve the problem. I was able to transfer my 5000+ photos from the p-2000 to the 3000 in about 20 minutes -- albums intact. They only needed to be renamed once they were over.

The instruction booklet is very bare bones and basic and at time is so cryptic as to be of little use. When putting a slide show together the unit will not allow picture taken vertically to be shown that way. They are show horizontal. I have been unable to rotate them in the unit. I have also been unable to get the unit to accept the rotation when I use either of two editing programs I have. The unit just will not show them in their correct perspective. Getting music into the is also difficult.Over all it is a great unit to move pictures from place to place and store them.I would purchase the unit again and do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in Europe","review":"This viewer did exactly what I hoped it would do...download tons of pictures from my card to later enter into my home laptop. Although it doesn't offer much editing features, it does allow deletion on the very clear 4\\" screen and that is enough for me.

My first graders loved this silly story of an old man who thinks his wife told him to bring a door (\\"la puerta\\") to a friends's barbeque. Of course, she said bring \\"el puerco\\" -- a pig -- to the party. But the old man is too busy to listen carefully...and off he goes down the street with the door on his back! On the way, he meets with multiple adventures -- all of which require a door for assistance. By the time he gets to the barbeque, he has a few special gifts -- and a funny story -- to contribute. (But still no pig...) Like all Gary Soto books, the conversation is sprinkled with Spanish. The illustrations by Joe Cepeda are colorful and lively. This was (by a narrow vote) my student's favorite Gary Soto book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny, with illustrations that support the text well","review":"I love using this book with K-2nd graders...they really laugh at the grandfather's hilarious mistakes.

This is the edition that I believe was shown on PBS in 1982.Harnoncourt is noted for his presentations of Bach's music using the sort of ensemble that Bach himself would have used in the churches he served. You can expect period instruments and the use of boy's choir and soloists. The pure and clean sound of a boy soprano is, to my thinking, more ethereal than that of a mature women soprano. Though it may lack the power of the adult voice, it is more true to the sound that would have been heard in Bach's day.I have looked for this recording over the years and am happy it has now been released finally in November, 2005. A classic and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Low-budget Ghost Film","review":"This is a good low-budget ghost film with great music and spectacular locations in England.

Seems like a showcase for someone more obsessed with himself than with creating an artistic statement. So much more could have been done lyrically with the ideas that were presented.

I was expecting MUCH more from this CD from the reviews I have heard and from the word of mouth form people who have seen them live."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a game!","review":"I really enjoyed this game. It brought me back to the style of play I first experienced with the Final Fantasy series. Something about the mini battles and the turn based fighting is a welcome change to all the real-time combat every other game in the world incorporates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong story, solid RPG","review":"Well I'll start with a little recommendation, if you do not like RPG's do not buy this game. Secondly I will say that this is a very traditional and mildly interesting game with a fresh battle system and some interesting content. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, the dialogue is fresh and often very funny and the storyline itself, though simple, is solid and, often stemming from its simplicity, enjoyable. To those accustomed to the open play style of Oblivion and other open-ended games this will be quite a change as you are guided from level to level and are forced to back-track through relatively boring environments on occasion, in the style of metroid prime. All and all this game is an enjoyable experience that I highly reccomend you partake in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A steal for less than $10!","review":"Maybe not the best game I have ever played, but the game is one of the best I have played for the price I paid. I enjoy turn-based games and role-playing games and I have enjoyed many hours of good strategic fun with this game.

From a more personal note, I raised two sons who would never be caught writing in a journal as children, but if \\"My Nature Book\\" had been available when they were growing up, they would have jumped all over this. It is fun, encouraging and allows the young writer to relive over and over the mini adventures they experienced and shared with natures world.

A great all-round collection varying from the traditional mbira-based guitar to the rapid-fire guitar of jit, to South African influenced pop to the sweet sounds of reggae. Although heavy on the work of Oliver Mtukudzi, the album represents the sounds of Zimbabwe quite well. Most enjoyable and a great addition to any African collection. Highlights are Oliver Mtukudzi's Under Pressure, Solomon Skuza's Patimile, and John Chibadura's reggae mega-smash Zuva Refuka Kwangu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring and Brilliant","review":"Poirier is the true hero. He should be a featured player in the new X-Men flick. He loves the strange and weird and isn't afraid to champion the mutants and freaks he captures so eloquently in this collection. I recommend all of the stories. The writing here is daring, dark and unabashed. Poirier goes to places that would send David Foster Wallace and Dave Eggers crying to their mommies, if they still had them. For me this collection evoked Beckett, the great Harry Crews and the best of A.M. Holmes. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant American Classic","review":"Wow! Each story is more powerful than the last, but each is unique in its voice, setting, and theme (although sexuality seems to be a popular one!).

You sense only a contempt for the characters that makes what happens to them matter not in the least. The exception is \\"Worms\\" which showcases Poirier's skill at drawing quirky characters. Here, he also makes you care about them. \\"Pageant\\" and \\"A Note about the Type,\\" in particular, seem rushed and sloppy. A disappointing collection from a talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing","review":"What may be perceived as topical edginess does not equal entertainment. These stories each have several things in common, most notably that they proceed in an obvious manner, focusing upon the desperation of the characters and the clear motives for this desperation. Ultimately they go nowhere. This book isn't terrible. Its pedestrian. That said, I would rather be angered enough to put something down than simply lulled to a dead end while waiting to be stirred.

I can tell you first hand that this sharpener puts a darn good edge on the knives. If you are used to sharpening your own knives with a stone and you are good at it, don't expect that, but it is reasonable to be able to shave the hair on your arms afterwards...Other plus about this is that it is extremely easy to do, as any knife can be done from start to finish in less than 20 seconds. All in all, a great product and I would certainly recommend to most everyone. MG"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for a good price!","review":"This is a new purchase, so we have only used it once. My husband used it and says he loves how it puts a new edge on both straight and serrated knives. I thought the edge was a little rough near the hasp, but that may be more a factor of someone who hasn't perfected their technique yet, rather than the sharpener. For those few areas that are a little rough, running it down an hand-held honer works well. That being said, the result is a very sharp knife again. The Waring PRO KS80 is well priced and worth the advantage of sharpening your knives at home on your own schedule, rather than having to plan when to take them to a professional. I would recommend this product to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Sorry to say, but this moved too slowly from screen to screen and was rather dull.

We've also discovered that this is great if you have very tight muscles in your neck and need constant deep pressure in a massage from someone else--but this helps avoid finger/hand tiring of the massager.

Well I am very dissapointed. The tiger tail does not roll. Maybe I got a defective one but I am not pleased. The single foam roller does not roll, it gets stuck.

They go on to argue that delivering each kind of value requires a different organization and culture, and hence the most successful companies are those whose business strategy is focused on delivering a particular kind of value to the customers that appreciate it the most, while remaining competitive in other areas.

The brilliant comedy overture, 'The Tinker's Wedding,' more conventional in its material and style but still unpredictable, provides an attractive make-weight.

The music is good, or at least most of it. The problem with this DVD is the way it's filmed. The stage is a ball of white light, Bryan is wearing a WHITE shirt, playing the BASS guitar and the video director shows the crowd more than the band. Of course this may be because there are only 3 band members. Don't waste your money on this DVD, it [STINKS]!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD ROXETTE THE BALLAD Y POP HITS","review":"The new one goes out to the dvd of roxette for amazon.com Hewanted to ask it if it is possible warn me.Thank you AttentivlyJose moraga"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"That one word is really all that needs to be said. If you're a Bryan Adams fan, this is a must own DVD. It's amazing how he can go from an exhilarating version of \\"It's Only Love' into the most beautiful rendition of \\"I Do It For You\\" that I've ever heard! The small band doesn't hold him back at all; the songs sound better than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bryan Adams Live in Ireland","review":"I was very excited to see this in my local music store. After the Unplugged dvd I was expecting another brilliant musical journey. I was SO disappointed. On this video, Bryan has cut the band back to a 3 piece, just himself on bass, Mickey on Drums and Keith on guitar. Gone are the keys and the second guitars of previous recordings. Even though it was mixed by Bob Clearmountain, the band sounds thin and unremarkable, especially when Keith takes a solo and there's no 2nd guitar to fill the space that Adams normally slotted into. Also, the white set? What's with that? Everything is white. Clothes, amps, guitars kit, lighting (although his lighting has always been weak) I saw these guys live in Perth in '96 as 5 piece and they rocked. It's a shame they didn't maintain that on this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cartas Insignificantes","review":"Cartas de un asesino Insignificante es una novela, quenos transporta al mundo de la mente humana, como reaccionaante ciertas emociones, y como puede cambiar las cosas con solo desear cambiarlo, como el ser humano crea su realidad, y como percibe su alrededor.El libro trata de una escritora que se muda a un pequeño pueblo,una mañana se encuentra unas cartas tiradas en las paredes de su casa \\"Asuma usted su rol de victima, como yo asumo el mio de asesino, la voy a matar\\" son las palabras en la primer carta. La escritora las lee, y las tira a la basura, es aqui donde comienza a desarrollarse la novela, a traves intercambios de cartas, y nace una relacion cazador-presa.Los seguidores de novelas como \\"El tunel\\" de Ernesto Sabato,definitivamente se veran inclinados hacia esta novela. Una recomendacion es leer el libro lentamente, y dejar que se acumule un poco de intriga, entre cada carta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and Rigorous","review":"Mr. Forte succeeds in the difficult task of marrying in this book the two adjectives of the title of this review. You feel the love for the subject and the thought given to it. Maybe one can disagree on the choice of the songs analyzed but, of course, that can only be a matter of taste, though I have the impression the choice was dictated sometime by the innovations brought from the song to the idiom rather than by its intrinsic aestetic value (I'm referring to songs like How Little We Know or Something to Live For: very interesting ones, but hardly classic like other ones which didn't make it in the book). But this is a minor and subjective complaint to a great work which must be read both from music lovers and would-be songwriters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible \\"bad guy\\"","review":"Don't waste your time with this one.

I love the ending. Sound and picture quality are ok. Good movie to check out. I recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best low-budget horror movie ever!!!","review":"I'm so glad I accidentally stumbled upon this movie. I don't even want to start telling you what this movie is about. I can assure you it has the best twist ending since the original Saw. It is freakishly original, And fresh to the genre. Some of the acting is off. But the main character makes up for it. So if you love horror movies and you're not afraid to watch low-budget films this is a movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"RENT dont BUY","review":"Salvage, it is a poorly written movie, lacking any gore. you want gore go watch sponge bob you will see more gore in that cartoon. The idea for the story line was good, but the execution was horrible. do not expect any T&A either, either the actress was under age or not paid enough to flash anything. It starts out strong then flops after the first murder scene. IT IS NOT LIKE Groundhog day, the lines are stupid. the only redeeming quality is that the film footage is clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ground Hog Day in a Junk Yard","review":"Nothing much here! Just marginal acting and the repeating of a plot over and over again. Just like Ground Hog Day with no plot or character development.

You sit there for 90 minutes doing your thing until you come to the realization your arse is numb and it's time to wipe, flush and go on with life. Nope, no sir, didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent budget horror movie","review":"I liked this, similar to the main theme of Jacob's Ladder, Dead Man, the story revolves around a murderer that dosen't know that he is dead. Like the Tibetan Bardo Thodol says when a person dies they can carry on as if nothing has happened and this is what happens in this film. Enjoyed it and will watch again congratulations to all involved carry on the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"SALVAGE CAN'T BE SAVED","review":"Cerebral and manipulative, SALVAGE is an independent thriller that ultimately caves in on is own plot devices. Lauren Currie Lewis plays a young girl who keeps getting murdered over and over, she thinks its a weird dream but the script hints at something more. Is she losing her mind? Who is this demonic Duke and what is her ultimate fate? Lewis gives a good performance but it's not enough to save this muddled, confusing and ultimately unsatisfying psychothriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Bad Movie","review":"Short and sweet, if you watch this movie, you will probibly become dumber. The terrible acting, pathetic filmography, non-existant plot, and the un-creative and untasteful score go together to create the most rediculus film since \\"Manos, the hands of fate\\". If you go ahead anyway and veiw, let alone buy this film, don't bring your regrets to my doorstep. As a film composer, if amazon.com had a lower rating than one star...I would have chosen it. One star gives more credit than deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvage Review.","review":"This movie doesn't not look like Blu-ray first off. It looks like something downloaded off the internet. That's how bad it looks to me. But mroe important is the movie itself to me was BORING. Although the movie was like mystery/horror I wasn't feeling this movie at all. It it actually looked like Blu-ray It might of been a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Low budget films have a place in this world. Some are really good!

They are very high quality for a reasonable price.

It's not really written with too heavy a hand conspiritorially, it mostly just presents the newest information on world government, NATO, advanced military weapons, Echelon, etc. The final 5 of 13 chapters are about the revived Roman empire and the anti-Christ. If you're already knowledgeable on the subject, I'd recommend the book \\"Hope of the Wicked\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Andy Griffith Show","review":"It's The Andy Griffith Show Allways a lot of Good Clean fun and good for the kids to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cemetery Island","review":"Cemetery Island .........

The acting was very good and the plot was good. Do they even make movies with plots anymore? The cast was very believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best film noir from 20th Century Fox","review":"I ended up buying this DVD after checking it out from the library 4 or 5 times. The combination of Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews is irresistable (as they were in Laura). Dana Andrews once again plays a detective whose down on his luck and in trouble for working outside the law - a character he was born to play. Gene Tierney is the femme fatale who can freeze an iceberg with a single glance but melt a heart with a single smile. Another favorite of mine, Craig Stevens, has a small part of the guy who ends up dead due to the Andrews character's conduct. A good addition to any film noir collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD Contains NEW Highly Offensive Material","review":"After BUYING and PAYING for this DVD . I discovered that........When the DVD first starts to play you are FORCED to watch a video describing that it is wrong to copy a movie. The video depicts various types of theft with nasty heavy metal music. The ability to press the menu button (and have it work) is disabled by the authors of the DVD.This would be no different than if you sat down at a table in a restaurant and the waiter came up and lectured you in harsh terms, about the immorality of skipping out on the check and not paying.Wait for the DVD to be fixed before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat","review":"I've already submitted a written review on this book.?.It was written in the 1950's.

Won't happen). I picked out \\"Peaches\\" honestly because nothing else looked as juicy. No pun intended.I read through the book and found that I was actually quite fond of all the drama, and the variety with the characters. This book was a pleasant summer read for me, but I wouldn't suggest that you race to the stores in a rabid flurry to buy it. Buy it when you want an easy read full of girl fun and drama.

I would highly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this challenging and fun work out. I like using the bands and the way Kira explains what muscle or area that is being targeted. There are also 3 different work outs that fit any time frame you have available to exercise.

This toy is addictive for adults!","review":"Rubik's Sudoku is well thought out and makes it possible for people who feel they are number or math-challenged to enjoy a measure of mastery and accomplishment through this game. The addition of color patterns provides an important 3rd dimension to Sudoku. A storage drawer in the base keeps the instructions and spare parts from being scattered. The swing-open clear plastic lid provides a space to organize the tiles before you have figured out where they go in each game. The tiles have a tab that inserts into a slot to keep them firmly in place, yet easy to move when you discover you weren't thinking clearly. And it is addictive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sudoku Game Board","review":"I've enjoyed Rubik's Sudoku every morning since Christmas. It's near perfect. I would change just two things:I'd include more of the marker pieces (I'm always at least one short), and I'd use some color other than midnight blue because it doesn't show up on the black gameboard. Unlike the AD photo, my game pieces don't have painted numbers, so the blue ones are nearly invisible. I like that the pieces are double-sided with a different style of number on the reverse side. You can use one side for the pre-determined numbers, and the reverse for the numbers you fill in. If you goof up and have to back-track, you know which pieces to leave on the board. The book with the pre-determined numbers have plenty of puzzles - I haven't had to repeat a puzzle yet. You can also set up the board using puzzles from the newspaper or any puzzle magazine. I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys Sudoku."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"This is a great game. I also use it to solve newspaper puzzles.

I found this episode \\"Love abd Death\\" to be my favorite episode. I found the ending to be shocking~if you were watching the show from the begining like I was~you would to. I feel that this episode really shows Lori Singer's actting ablity. I only wish that this show would have stayed on the air longer. I highly suggest you buy this.

The supporting cast included Miriam Margolyes, Juliet Stevenson, and Jeremy Irons. Stilll, I think the soundtrack is far more entertaining than the film itself. There are few songs but the original score is worth listening too and is inspirational at times. The original score is also light, refreshing, and light all at the same time. I enjoyed listening to it in my car driving.If you liked the film, you love the soundtrack. If you don't care about seeing the film, you will enjoy light airy original score that should have been up for an Oscar nomination too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellow Bennie","review":"Yuko graduated from the same college I now attend.

WHY NOT THE FULL VOCAL AT LEAST? Back when this song was new, the stupid Vasquez remixes were only on vinyl just like Wannabe (except for an edit on import CD). The import had the Motiv8 remix which I did not care for. It's nice that a full dance remix does show up here - not Juniors (otherwise I wouldn't be fussin') but I guess it will have to do.

In fact, to put \\"spirituality\\" in the title of this book is extremely misleading. The text is simply a concise treatment of basic systematic theology written at about an undergraduate level. The only thing Larsen includes that might possibly justify the title is a small section at the end of each chapter that asks questions about how the principles he lays out are applicable to life, but that's a far cry from what he set out to his readers.Now, I suppose if you're looking for a very simple, basic text on Christian systematic theology, this would do the job fairly well, but to state that it is directly related to Christian spirituality is simply false.

There is no glossary of acronyms and many are missing from the index.An entire chapter is spent on RIP1, with redundant statements about the lack of VLSM support and obsolete status.My experience was that issues of technical sublety were as often muddied as they were explained.There is good info in this book, too, but considering the Cisco name, I expected much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Never before has a Cisco book covered so many protocols so poorly in so little space. I actually felt more confused about IS-IS after reading this book than I did before I started. The coverage of other protocols is little better.

There are some good chapters here and there in the book, and some good information you won't find elsewhere, but the middle chunk of the text is a waste.

Watch their big tomcat's eyes as he tells the story. In these days of the blatant scary fiction of R.L Stine and Goosebumps The King of the Cats is subtle, beautiful, and foreboding in a sort of mesmerizing way that is truly uncommon in children's literature. I don't know if it is, but is has the feel of an old oral folk tale, worn smooth to its most basic elements by years of telling. At eight, I loved it, at twenty four, I still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cat story ever","review":"This book has been haunting me ever since I read it to my sons over 20 plus years ago. I checked it out of the Murphy, NC Public Library and we enjoyed it for a week. I lost track of the author but have never forgotten this haunting tale. Occasionally I would check on library books shelves but never came across it. My sons are now 26 and 30 respectively with no grandchildren on the horizon so I wasn't trying too hard. But once again I decided to try to find this book and ended up buying a version by Aaron Shepard here on amazon. When I received it I knew it wasn't the book I was hoping for. But FINALLY I have tracked down the Paul Galdone version and I can't wait until it arrives!

Although the 2 main characters are very likeable and their acting is good, the disco-type music in this so-called scary movie was just annoying. I also found the 'love-scene type' music very inappropriate. The type of music they used just made me hate the movie even more. I was hoping for a 'haunted house' theme in this movie and it just didn't deliver. I will give this movie 2 stars because I liked the 2 main characters.

It wouldn't even recognize the dvd and locked my system up. After a lengthy internet search I figured out (not on HPs web site) that I had to change the firmware to LiteOn LH-18A1H which the drive seems to actually be with a HP label. Download a couple of programs and flash the drive and it was back up running again, but it now reads as a LiteOn drive. Maybe I should have bought a LineOn drive in the first place.

Nice solid construction seemed like this it would be quality product,but it just doesn't work!Incredibly difficult to get the can locked into place under the blade. Once the can is locked, the motor jams while trying to open the can. When in the locked position, the system stops. You need to hold the lever up just a bit, to allow the can to turn and open. After a month of frustration I returned to the local BB&B; for another. Exactly the same problem.Been living with it for over a year when today I decided I won't be dealing with this POS for the holiday's. Just ordered the West Bend based on the reviews.

It worked less and less reliably the more I used it. After about a year it took about 2 minutes to open a can - having to re insert the tooth into the can lid, trying to puncture all the spots it missed. Finally the arm broke off when I lifted it to inspect the tooth - never ever buying anything from Cuisinart again - that was my first and last cuisinart product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed to be land fill","review":"Junk! Made to wear out. It is no secret that manufacturers design to wear out so you will have to buy again. There is a plastic insert that fulfills that design making the opener scrap after 6 months.

If you have money to throw away, buy one or send it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst can opener I have ever had","review":"This can opener worked well the first few times. Then the feature that stops the can opener automatically stopped working. Now it starts working and then stops before the can is open, so you have to restart several times to finish opening the can.

The last decent one I had was one I bought in the 1970's. After more than 25 years, it finally gave out. I haven't been able to find a decent one since.Then I came across this Cuisinart and thought, mistakenly, that it was a good brand. I paid about $50.00 thinking that I was getting quality. In fact, it works no better the $9.00 cheapos from the drug store. Cans won't seat properly. They keep falling off. If you manage to get it to work, the can might spin, but the top is not cut. It might cut part way, then fall off. I got tired of struggling with it and now it's now in the garbage. I am embarrassed that I made such a foolish choice.It's just one more crummy can opener that doesn't work. Nobody cares what they sell any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This can opener didn't work well especially with large cans. I was very disappoined. We paid at least $50.00 for this thing. It would bog down and acted like it didn't have enough power to rotate and cut the can. I was ready to throw it out when my son discovered if you press \\"in\\" very hard it will work. Pressing down (as with most can openers) is not enough. Press down and in simultaneously and it usually works. I have had can openers much lower priced than this one that actually worked better. I didn't expect this type of cheap merchandise from Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Experience with this can opener","review":"Doesn't even deserve one star! Only did 20 cans and many messes later I've had it. Paid a lot of money for the name and it's looks but what a mistake that was! Wish I would have read all the reviews first. No one should have to fight and fuss to open a can like you do with this one. Called Cuisinart and they are sending me a new head (said it's only for people who call and complain, no recall!!!!) I sincerely doubt the new head will be any better but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now. Made in China, maybe their cans are different? Lost my faith in Cuisinart products and hope they honor their warranty since the product is discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"The can opener lasted less than 2 months before the black plastic insert on the cutting arm came lose.

It obviously has design flaws that they chose not to correct. Cuisinart replaced the first one when it broke after about 3 months, but they wanted me to pay for shipping the old one back, which was approximately $46.00, DUHH. It only cost $49.99 new, so why should I send the old one back. When the 2nd one broke they refused to do anything because I didn't send the original one back. This will wind me up with Cuisinart in general and I will never buy any of their products again, plus I plan to tell anyone that will listen about this very unpeasant experience.P.S.I feel that I must add a post script to this review. I talked with the nicest lady and she insisted that they send me a new can opener and only wanted me to cut the cord off the defective one & return it. I'm sure it will have the same design flaws, but they did stand behind it and my wife thinks it's pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased with warranty","review":"Received this can opener as a wedding gift and loved how well it looked. However, a few months later it broke! You push the top down and it does nothing, no turns and no sounds. I call customer service to find it is still covered under warranty but in order for them to send me a new one I would have to pay them $10 right then over the phone and also pay out of my pocket for the S&H to send the broken one back to Cuisinart.

The decision to go with a countertop model was made because both my husband and I spend a lot of time in wheel chairs and a counter top model would be easier to reach. We love the look of it and it blends well with the rest of our kitchen. It cuts smoothly, and is fairly quiet. It handles larger cans effectively.The only thing I would change is to have a heavier base, as it does tend to move around more than I thought it would from the description.

Thinking 32.00 might not be too much for something pretty and well made, not to mention a name brand I paid it.

As others have said, it is an expensive piece of junk! We have fought with it for several months now; my husband can fix about anything, but he can't keep this thing working. The problem is that it will not hold the can in place; it makes no difference the size of can, from a 6 oz can of tuna to a 32 oz can of tomatoes, it doesn't hold the can securely in place. It's a battle to try and hold the can up tight enough for the blade to cut around the can, with it constantly slipping off the clamp. I have cut my thumb more than once, pushing up on the can to get it to clamp, while it repeatedly slips off so that it can't maintain a steady cut!

Please do yourself a favor and believe all of the terrible reviews that you'll find listed on this site. This was an expensive product, as can openers go, and it broke within days of taking it out of the box. Cuisinart refuses to fix it without charging me for both the cost of having them ship me a new one, as well as the cost of shipping them the broken one.To be honest, having seen all of the other terrible reviews of this product listed here, I'm surprised there hasn't been some sort of class action lawsuit created over this thing.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

Outside of it being a little finicky about positioning the can I have had no problems. After studying the can opener a little more I think I know what happens to cause the plastic guide to break.To open a can requires lifting the lever, the same action required to remove the cutter for cleaning. I'll bet people are lifting the cutter to the point the cutter assembly begins to slide out, then jamming the lever down, breaking the plastic guide. The guide is just that, a guide, and not designed to take the kind of forces the lever can impose.I do not see a problem with the design, but understand how the less mechanically inclined would. If you take the time to read the manual and understand how the cutting assembly fits in place, you shouldn't experience the breakage problem some do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away from Cuisinart Can Openers","review":"Like the \\"Cuisinart SCO-60 Deluxe Stainless Steel Can Opener SCO-60\\" also reviewed on this site our Cuisinart \\"Deluxe\\" stainless steel can opener broke within a couple weeks of buying it.

Save your money it is definitely not worth it. My previous can opener (KRUPS) I've had for over 7 years, the blade had become dull and it was looking dingy so I opted to buy a new one. I was so excited when I got this nice looking stainless steel can opener at the very beginning of Dec. 2006. The can opener broke within 4 weeks, the attachment with the blade came completely off. I thought I was buying a quality product and was horribly dismayed to find out otherwise. I now am expected to return the product at my expense.

I can't believe that, for $50, Cuisinart couldn't design a can opener that opens a can with a smooth edge. This thing is an accident waiting to happen.

Going to return it today and get something that cuts safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, works poorly","review":"This is the best looking can opener I've ever seen. Too bad it doesn't work well, and it broke before it should have. Beauty isn't everything.I received it as a gift in Dec 2006, and it broke eight months later, using it maybe twice a week. It didn't work well from the beginning: I always had to try 3-4 times before it would latch onto the lid. Eventually, a plastic part broke right where the handle meets the body of the can opener, rendering this item useless.I've used a variety of can openers, naturally, but I've never seen one that would cut the lids so badly--the edges would be rippled and super sharp. For the money, it should work better and certainly last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A breakable part for built-in obsolescence","review":"This attractive, solid-looking, metal, electric can opener has a breakable plastic part that has been mentioned in several reviews.The part is indispensable for the opener to function and a replacement is unavailable.

It doesn't make it through half the can before bogging down to a stop, and once you reset it a few times and get the can open, you are left with the most jagged, dangerous lid I have ever seen. On the positive side, it's heavy and made a very nice thud when I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"My husband thought I was crazy to spend so much on a can opener, I thought it would be one of the last I had to buy.

I have long, extremely strong nails that I simply put one coat of Nailtiques on every morning.

Tried using a small philips screwdriver, a safety pin, etc., and it simply would not open. The lack of sound was disappointing, though our child still liked the pretty puzzle. We got another battery-activated Melissa & Doug toy that was also a failure -- the \\"Vehicle Sound Block\\" toy that is supposed to make the sounds of the vehicles when the blocks are lined up correctly. We could get the batteries in, but the toy simply didn't work. No sound, no nothin.' This company seems to do well with plain wood toys, but when they branch out into electronics, the products are fairly shoddy. I plan to avoid their products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"We usually love all the Melissa and Doug toys, but these sound puzzles are disappointing. I bought two for Christmas, the farm one and the vehicle one. We couldn't open the back to put in the batteries for the vehicle puzzle (as the other reviewer said), and for this farm one, the sound quality is so bad! The animal sounds aren't even recognizable in some cases. The puzzle itself is fine, but I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Toy. Ever.","review":"At first glance this seems like a pretty neat puzzle. Don't be fooled. This puzzle uses photoelectric sensors to detect the puzzle pieces which seems kind of clever, until the sun goes down. This thing moos and neighs and quacks at all hours of the night. If there are pieces missing, and you turn the lights off (to go to bed, for example) this thing moos, neighs and quacks. Any flash of light (or darkness) sets it off. More than once I've been scared witless by this puzzle. Awful, awful, awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but poorly made","review":"I was excited about this product, I bought this one and the one with the zoo animals sound.First it work, but then it began to work only when it wanted...Sometimes one animal work, sometimes 2, sometimes all of them...But it's unpredictable and really frustrated overall!How do you explain to a 19 month old that the puzzle does'n't work all the time.At the end my daughter was not interested in it at all...Too bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Puzzle, Tinny Sound","review":"This is a fun puzzle but the sound is pretty ugly. The wood puzzle pieces are nice, but the noises are somewhat indecipherable. Regardless though, the puzzle was good quality and my son loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but...","review":"The artwork is great, and the pieces are easy for little hands to remove and fit. The sounds are good, but there is no off switch or volume control, and, as it should be, a screwdriver is needed to remove the battery. I am not sure how it is supposed to work, but you can wave any piece over any slot and it will make a noise (for instance, wave the dog over the rooster and it makes the rooster noise), so I don't think it is a great learning toy with the battery installed, anyway. Also, if a piece goes missing, the board will randomly make that animals noise at anytime, day or night, unprovoked, which can be amusing, so long as it doesn't waken or distract your kid at an inopportune time. Ours was a sweet gift, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone, which is too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I've been so excited to get one of these for my son's 2nd birthday. We bought the pet one, and put new batteries in. The sounds worked great for about 2 minutes. Then none of them worked. Then only the horse worked. Then just the horse and the parrot. My son easily put the puzzle together about 20 times, so obviously it is too easy for him, but he was frustrated because the sounds were not working. Then the dog started barking for ALL the animals. I think the technology just needs a little improvement. Come on Melissa and Doug. You're better than this! We are taking it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haunting/Annoying","review":"My friend gave me this puzzel. Now know why. To get it out of her house! The farm noises start up when you turn your lights on/off or when you walk past it. In the middle of the day/night you hear cock-a-doodle-do mooooo-mooooo. It becomes annoying and sometimes just plain creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another favorite","review":"This is another great Melissa and Doug product my parents bought for my daughter. When she was two, she got this for her birthday. It was so cute to see her face the first time she lifted one of the pieces and heard the animal sound. Personally, we thought the sound quality was fine.The wooden construction provides plenty of durability, and she did not tear it up. We were able to pass it on to her younger cousin. The sound quality was deteriorating slightly by that time, but it was still relatively easy to hear. We had it for about one year before passing it to her cousin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super annoying, you will not keep this toy for very long","review":"Every time a shadow passes, or turn a light on or off it will make animal noises. There is no off button, or any way to fix this beyond storing it in a completely covered box or some other thing that will completely block all light. I mean the kids playd with the toy a little, but the annoyance of it constantly making animal noises all the time when not in use is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"No off button for animal sounds & too thick for wire frame","review":"I repeat - No Off button! This is the most annoying feature of this puzzle board. Other reviewers have explained the trigger for animal sounds, which is helpful, but our other puzzle boards sit nicely in their wire frame holder without a need for a heavy floor pillow to cushion or stop random animal noises.The other major con is that it is slightly too thick to sit in the wire-frame puzzle holder.Same durable excellent quality as other M & D wood products - colors/picture does not rub off, no rough edges, but unfortunately the animal noises occur rather inconsistently. For example, the rooster will continue to crow even though the only piece missing from the board is the pig. Amusing at first, but became annoying rather quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible noises - and scares my daughter!","review":"The animal sounds on this puzzle are terrible. I think the sound quality is very poor, and so that, coupled with realistic animal noises, just sounds freaky to a little kid. My 19 month old tells me \\"no farm\\" and \\"scary\\" when she sees it.On an adult note - I HATE this as well, as I think the noise triggers from light, so if the puzzle isn't assembled when you hit the lights, you get some super creepy Moo'ing or Neigh'ing from another room - it also enjoys going off whenever the sun is setting, so can catch you off guard then as well!So not worth it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible animal sounds","review":"I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old twin Grand Sons. The animal sounds are scary and don't sound anything like the real animals. I would not recommend this puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Design Flaw, No OFF Switch","review":"My daughter received this as a gift and she does enjoy the animal sounds that accompany the puzzle very much. The problem is that the puzzle uses a light sensor to activate the surprisingly loud animal noises. So the puzzle will go off with no one near it whenever there is a change of lighting unless all the pieces are in place, there is no off switch. Who wants to be crawling under the couch at 2 in the morning trying to find that last piece so that stupid cow will shut-up. It just boggles my mind that they would take the time and thought to design something so clever and then fail to include an off switch. Isn't that an unwritten rule for toys that make the noise? Or maybe they're just being authentic. I grew up on a farm and livestock do not have off-switches either, except for the butcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farm sound puzzles","review":"We purchased the puzzle for our 2 year old niece.

I was amazed that she knew where each animal fit.

We bought both the vehicle and animal puzzle and hence the example given here. My 18 month old \\"bang\\" (didn't even need to be in place) the roaster piece onto the cow spot and next it's \\"moo moo moo\\".

A lot of it is a description of family and relationship fights and the heroine's very, very shallow view of life and \\"ideals\\".What is really bad is the fact that the editors didn't catch some \\"gems\\" as \\"cubic zirconiums\\" (Hello?!!!) and \\"Lamp chops\\" for dinner (interesting...).

I had much higher expectations for this one as I've really enjoyed other RDI books. I found Evie to be whiny, self-centered and a rather disagreeable person. There was very little to draw me in to like about her at all. The characters all seemed flat and lifeless. I finished the book continually hoping that it would improve, but I never felt connected to it. The pace picked up for me about 3/4 through, but still not very engaging.

I was inspired, amused, shocked, saddened and impressed. I understand why Sheri had to write this book. Her husband, Ron, is a saint and should be cannonized. Her daughter, Montana, is a lucky young lady to have a mother with such inordinate strength. Those who criticized or deserted Sheri should be hung by the thumbnails. Shame on them! Sheri writes with tremendous passion and I will be eternally grateful to her for sharing her life with the rest of us.

What Sheri, the author did in writing this book is that she has paved the way to better understand the uniqueness of this disease. Her title of the book \\"sick and tired of being sick and tired\\" aptly describes the process of fatigue,lack of energy, pain, not feeling well etc. that all TA sufferers go through and whose symptoms go undetected or misdiagnosed for years, only to be found out in the later stages of the disease.

It started off with the promise of a good plot and an interesting story line, with intrigue, drama romance and mystery, but the book itself did not (to me) live up to Jayne Ann Krentz' actual potential. It all seemed flat throughout the entire book. The characters went through every thing like two paperdolls just going through the motions without any real feeling. There was no build up in the drama, and no mystery, and the conclusion was obvious, trite and went on longer than it needed.Everyone sometimes has an off-day, and I think this book was Jayne's."},{"rating":"2","title":"unusually historically accurate","review":"They have gone to great pains to perform/ record this majestic icon of music AS IT WAS WRITTEN AND INTENDED TO BE PERFORMED with period instruments and interpretation.

Upon examination, I found a crack from the top of the pot and along the bottom! I've used this pan and have many Le Creusets (which have never given me any problems) many times.

She goes to great lengths to show how such a society is much superior to ours and much healthier. Yet there is not an inkling of a suggestion of how we are going to do this, or how we can re-adapt into hunter-gatherers, or what we would do with our complex infrastructure, etc., etc.This reader, in particular, would much rather spend an afternoon at a good movie rather than digging for roots to feed my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since most of the world's population would have to die...","review":"Most of the world's population would have to die in order to go back to her pre-civilization utopia.

The ghettos are very large and very poor. Whenever the come to America, they buy the largest trucks possible and then get the gas in Mexico which have no laws in how it is produced.

Bran is a spoiled, bratty prince who finds himself King and his kingdom invaded by cruel and greedy foreigners. Bran runs away into the woods and must come to terms with his responsibilities. Although a very well-written book with a lot of character potential (I especially like the character of Bran), this book is a 500-page beginning with no real plot, resolution, or drama. I might read the next books in this King Raven series, but I doubt it would be worth my time. There is little resemblance to Robin Hood, the spirit, the myth, the character (of which I am a big fan). It's a pretty boring book of a hero finding his way. If you want great Robin Hood, see BBC's new series or Robin of Sherwood. I'm still looking for a good novel, though. Grade: C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Lawhead is a well established author but seems to have lost either his ability to write grammatical English or the means to find a competent editor or both.

But it's been a while since I read the first volume in one of his trilogies. I thought this was slow, uninspired and pointless. Of course you were left wanting more, but that's because nothing much happened in this volume. Let's hope the other 2 are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Could not finish.

It seems so. This retelling of Robin Hood, which has some narrative drive and energy, is also, like the Twilight series, a thinly disguised Christian tract, and one that largely compromises the multitudinous sources (NOT predominantly Christian) that were gathered together in the stories and ballads about Robin Hood. No worries. Robin and the boys still run wild in Sherwood, untamed by King John, the Sheriff, American Evangelicals, and other forces of oppression."},{"rating":"1","title":"largely pointless","review":"The book is a decent adventure story, but despite my best effort I could not figure what is the point of retelling the well-known legend.Whatever original the author has to say, is best given in the afterword and one would be well advised just to read these few pages and skipthe rather tedious preceding few hundred pages of forced action. I gather the author found it exciting to surmise that Robin Hoodmight have been Welsh, but I for one could not care much about this historical footnote. What is the general point of the book escapes me entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible choice of font","review":"good story but the choice of a non standard font makes this book difficult ro read on a kindle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Minds Only","review":"I am not a Lawhead fan. I've tried to read his previous stuff and I just didn't like it. I've finished the books but not the series. His Arthur series was not to my liking. This series however, has changed all of that. This book was entertaining and enjoyable. I didn't get too wrapped up in trying to make his story fit my traditional understanding of the story because each author should be given the freedom to do their own interpretation. If you can handle that, buy this book, if you are some sort of traditionalist when it comes to story telling, then stay away from this one. Trying to piece together who fits where will drive you mad and take away from an excellently spun yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Lawhead Book","review":"I've never read anything by Stephen R. Lawhead prior to reading HOOD. I thought that the book was refreshingly brilliant. How many different ways can the legend of Robin Hood be retold before it becomes old hat? It seems that Lawhead has found at least one more way that is altogether entertaining and enlightening.

I think there was a good bit of set up here, to lay the foundation for the subsequent books. So, not as much swashbuckling as I'd have preferred, but still a very strong telling of the tale and it left me looking forward to the follow up books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Stephen Lawhead is one of the all time greats, and \\"Hood\\" does not dissapoint. Lawhead endeavours to marry legend with historical fact, and in so doing creates an almost believable work of fiction that intrigues and leaves the reader excusing, and even identifying with, the hero's failures and human fraility. Captivating from the start, this book is one you can't put down. It's brilliant from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real Robin Hood?","review":"Who knows? Robin Hood set in 11th century Wales works for me though. Bran ap Brychan is a care free and nere-do-well son of a Welsh kinglet who in a few short and horrendous weeks is orphaned, cheated out of his ancestral kingdom, and thrust into a battle for his life and the iives or his subjects. The Normans have been in England for a little less than a generation and having conquered England set their eyes on Wales. Through treachery, political maneuvering, and conquest they are carving up the eastern portion of the only land left to the original inhabitiants of Britain. Will Bran grow up fast enough to make a difference or will he flee to safety and comfort in the north?As usual Stephen Lawhead delivers a gripping tale of heroism, moral crisis, and historical and mythical detail that dazzles the imagination. I loved how he wove familiar characters into the new setting bringing life to a story that has been done to death. I look forward to the sequal. 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling and deeply spiritual","review":"Lawhead is a talented storyteller, with just the right mix of elements to keep you spellbound for hours. He offers more than just a good entertaining yarn here, underneath the interplay of political forces and personal struggles, there are deeper spiritual issues at play here. Deep questions of religious faith, spiritual exploration and personal discovery interlace the narrative throughout. In Bran's (Robin Hood's) search for identity, you can easily wrap your own life story. I loved this one, and cannot wait for the rest of the trilogy to come along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"I'm not sure what I expected when I asked for this book for Christmas, but I'm glad I did. This was a grown-up fairy tale on a story that we've heard a million times. This is an interesting twist on Robin Hood and how he (and his men) become who they are. I really liked this book and I can't wait for the second one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It had so much potential","review":"I thought the idea behind this book was incredibly interesting and I absolutely love that it was set in Wales. That being said, it felt like Lawhead spent more time trying to develop the characters (which I can appreciate), but not enough time on the actual plot. There was so much potential, but it ended up really falling short. Based on this and reviews of the second book, I honestly have no interest in reading the next books, which is such a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't care at all about characters or story","review":"A good story should have characters and a setting that I care about; that draw you in and force you to read more.Problem is that I'm half done and I could care less about anyone in the story. The bad guys, good guys, whatever, they're all the same and protrayed with no emotion, drive, character, or anything. It reads like a bad sitcom script or something with all the usual fantasy cliches thrown in and forced \\"action\\" in an attempt to keep things moving. Unfortunately it's just really slow.I'm not particularly interested in the Robin Hood myth, but I was intrigued by this book enough to give it a shot. Unfortunately it has turned out to be a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hood\\" by Stephen R, Lawhead","review":"Not the Robin Hood you'd read to your kids, but truly classic Lawhead.As with most Lawhead books, you need to wade through the first third of the book getting through background information, but once he begins to tie the story together it becomes spellbinding.I can't wait for the second installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT read!","review":"Bought this book for my 14 year old son for Christmas. He couldn't put it down and when he was done,handed it to me and told me I HAD to read it. I started reading it in a long car ride and also couldn't put it down. Lawhead does such a great job with character development. It IS a different Robin Hood story than most of us have ever read or heard, but his take is extremely compelling. I immediately bought the next one in the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"Good narrative style & compelling story line with engaging characters.

The most contentious idea is Margarite as a nun. I don't think it works for obvious reasons. But what a lot of life Russell breathes into this dusty corpse. It isn't Eurotrash. It brings ballet into the action itself instead of being relegated to the final act. Indeed I was really surprised Russell didn't include the Walpurgis Night which would have given flight to all his excesses. Oh well. The singing and conducting are up to par. At this time any ordinary production of Faust would be sleep inducing. Hooray for Russell. Hope his film fans find and enjoy this DVD - they may be seduced by him into opera as I was seduced years ago into Tommy and Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"The famous ballet scene was omitted. They made Margeurite a nun which she never was, and it just doesn't work. Worst of all, they altered the original ending which depicted forgiveness and salvation (visually and in words and music)into a visually ghastly, gruesome scene totally inconsistent with the celestial music. Such changes to a masterpiece, whether it be a famous opera, as here, or to a Rembrandt cannot be justified, whether under a banner of \\"creativity\\" or any other."},{"rating":"1","title":"It makes a great CD.","review":"Great listening, but the production is so poorly conceived and gimicky that it is impossible to watch.

Instead it also gives you about 5-7 alternate paths per level.(Each path being harder or easier than others) Arcade-game junkies can also indulge in different difficulty levels. If you love arcade-shooters or just Shooters in general, you will love this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good quality....disjointed and not very entertaining either","review":"I would not recommend this dvd (or its sister one either). The quality is average at best, and the song selection leaves a lot to be desired. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Just not very good, to be honest.

You think they would try to re-master the recordings...nope, not here. They just put a bunch of old 78 sounding vinyl tracks onto a CD. Nothing more. Then they dress it up with a \\"Platinum Collection\\" title. With two discs you think you would get something nicer than that. Let's put it this way, these aren't definitive recordings. This CD is by some knock-off company which is apparently based out of London, England. Not only are the CDs bad, but there is a terrible write up about him. Just atrocious how the writer depicts Porter. Also, there are a ton of misspellings and some of the tracks aren't even right. For example the song \\"Just One of Those Things\\" is on the album credited as Frank Sinatra. The recording is definitely not Sinatra. It is a woman. So, bad quality recordings, bad quality write up= take a pass. I shouldn't even be giving this two stars, but Porter's song-writing is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"These oversized disgusting vitamins are not worth the agony of trying to swallow.

Her psychoanalyst husband (Richard Conte) battles to figure it out. 20th Century Fox gave this film first class treatment and it shows. With Otto Preminger directing from a Ben Hecht script and Tierney's clothes designed by then husband Oleg Cassini, this noir drama has a certain high gloss look. And the DVD print is near flawless with the b&w contrasts very sharp. Tierney is lovely and properly distressed but Ferrer is fantastic as Korvo the hypnotist. Watching his performance is an acting course unto itself. Worth watching for film buffs and noir fans. Kudos to Fox for bringing these forgotten films their due."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Whirlpool was a wash - sub par Fox Noir","review":"This to me was lacking, it just wasnt a magical atmospheric film noir like the others Fox has released.It didn't quick click despite the cast. Gene Tierney had a very bad haircut,and this time around she wasn't good in the acting department. Richard Conte didn't seem convincing to me as a psychotherapist and Jose Ferrer had a sleazy role but hypnotizing himself while he was sick so he could commit murder was a stretch for me. It is a murder mystery of sorts, but it is just lacking - it just didnt have the power films like Laura and I wake up screaming had Whirlpool really did not come across as a classic Noir..its not the worst but certainly not a great one either. Gene wasn't very good to look at and the movie wasnt very good to watch. See Laura instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warmed Up Laura","review":"\\"Whirlpool\\" is a warmed-over version of \\"Laura.\\" The movie \\"Laura\\" is an A+ movie.

Enjoy this little-seen gem","review":"Let's be honest, the two best reasons to sit through Whirlpool are 1) to see Gene Tierney at the peak of her luminous beauty, and 2) to enjoy Jose Ferrer at the peak of his ingratiating, oily charm. Slow? Is it slow? Yes, but a brisk wisecracking script about hypnosis, infidelity, and seduction would have been -- jarring. Another way of saying \\"slow\\" could be \\"building suspense\\". Charles Coburn is great as a crusty cop with a poignant backstory. Richard Conte is less convincing as a psychiatrist. Something to contemplate: What if Ferrer had played the Waldo Lydecker role in Laura?

Of the 3 \\"students\\", only one was worth looking at. I liked the scene in the locker room where they were jumping up and down naked with pom-poms.....pretending to be practicing for cheerleader tryouts, but that was only a few minutes of bouncing breasts (and one of the 3 \\"students\\" has fake breasts).

They open the mind to the realms of poetry, of religion and mythology, of literature and philosophy, of art. This magic is quite destroyed by this book's massive erudition. It is like a too ambitious teacher of literature who destroys poetry by analysing and disecting it. The illustrations are meager, they are after all of secondary importance - the only satisfying one is on the front cover. This book is recommended for all those who are not interested in the magic of its subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorganized and outdated","review":"This book has some good points, but it is poorly organized.

What we received was a stroller which had EXTREMELY wobbly wheels that feel like they are going to fall off at any moment. We looked for a way to tighten them, could not find any. Are they all like this? I hope not, perhaps this is a fluke, but I wanted to have this review up for others so they might think twice about placing trust in this \\"Made in Germany\\" product, which was a huge selling point for us.

The history is shallow and doesn't tie at all into the author's tales of her childhood. There is just this abrupt shift from history to personal life story with no linkage whatsoever. Wierd! Her descriptions of life growing up in Hawaii are even more shallow than her historical chapters. She gets facts wrong. (Okolehao is brewed from the ti plant, not pineapple, for example.)Moore exhibits limited knowledge of the islands and their people. Maybe she suffers from failing memory, given that she moved away from Hawaii so long ago. However, I suspect she wasn't really paying attention as she was growing up. (One of my friends tells me she was focused on being one of the cool kids in school.) I say all this as a life-long resident of Hawaii who grew up in Hawaii at about the same time she did. On top of everything else Moore's writing is contrived. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would get a C-minus in 10th grade world history.","review":"Perhaps I had the wrong expectation. The brief amount I heard on NPR made me feel I was going to learn about Hawaiian culture and maybe hear stories. This book was written in the time-honored tradition of one American explaining why other Americans should feel bad about being American. Not that she is wrong or has any of her facts misplaced. But Susanna has written a disjointed, self-serving, whining account of Hawai'i. Maybe she is lamenting the loss of a childhood that she may or may not have ever had. But each chapter is kind of summed up the same way: the noble Hawai'ian, raped literally or figuratively by the Westerner in the name of progress or profit. I am hoping that she has a chance to spend time with her therapist (since she has found reason now to live in New York)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawaiian Insight.","review":"I Myself Have Seen It is more than just a travel book. Susanna Moore gives insightful impressions of the Hawaii she grew up in.

But I did not learn much of anything new from this book. I was already familiar with finite element theory and also took the intro to ansys course offered by ANSYS. I had hoped that this book would go beyond what was offered by these two sources, but sadly it does not. Still, for the beginner who knows next to nothing of f.e. methods and ANSYS this is probably helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for begninners in FE.","review":"The book presents the \\"black box\\" behind the GUI. The author wrote the book especially for FE beginners. Ansys users will get the maximum benefit out of it. The book starts by explaining the various formulations applied in FEM. Then, 1D, 2D and 3D elements are presented, followed by simple and clear analytical applications in the field of structural, thermal and fluids. In the second half, the book introduces Ansys and then put it at work through a number of examples. The book/author has the merit of keeping the theory and examples simple and to the point. It is probably the only of its kind. This book is a must for beginners in the FEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't follow through","review":"This book should be great. It has great potential but it does not deliver. It tries to be half theory and half practical and does neither very well. The theory is confusing and not presented well or logically. The practical Ansys tutorials are certainly useful if you are trying to learn Ansys (and if you don't have access to any other tutorials then this book is defintely worth getting), however, there is no attempt to explain what the tutorial is trying to achieve or what it is doing. With a little more thought and organisation this could have been a good book. In its current form I would not reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever!!!","review":"We are at chapter 13 now and I now know that the book do not provide good fundamentals nor details to understand what FEA is all about.

The author has met the (unstated) goal of determining what of the material can practically be put on a test, and he concentrates on that material. The sample (CDROM) exam is a great way to become familar with the test format and to review. You would be silly to think that any of those questions are the same on the exam, though. Plus, the range of subjects covered on the new 2.7 exam has been changed slightly. Some have been moved to the part II exam, though it's no fault of the author. This book will be valuable to anyone taking the exam, and as a handy refence to Solaris. There is no book like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to prepare!","review":"A very good book through which to prepare. The chapters are laid out as per syllabus, concise but precise and well-explained. However, there are printing errors and in rare cases author points out difficult facts without going into an explanation. However, the basic materials are all very well contained. I would suggest reading Curt Freeland's book as a terrific supplement to understand some points made. The CD contains exam material which I found to be vry simple.

Much thinner than a swivel/basket holder, and no getting caught in the seatbelt like a swivel/basket. A little tricky to adjust the radio width part, it's basically just a free-floating loop with velcro that in entails taking the holder off of your belt and removing the loop to adjust it.

It is 8khz, 8bit recording.- Most of the rings or audio playbacks ends with pop or click which means the end of file wasn't faded out properly or not cut at proper zero crossing point.- Not loud enoughIt was quality of audio that made me return this product.I hooked it up to good external speakers that actually made the noise in audio (you get noise when you have such low quality recording) stands out even more. and it made the pop or click at the end also more noticeable.I would not recommend this to people who think they may get quality audio playback or have a large home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the whole family ALL year!","review":"This doorbell is so much fun. We are getting a kick out of the MANY different pre-programmed song choices. The sound isn't as deep and chimey as a true \\"bell\\" sound - but the novelty and fun of this doorbell is making our house the hit of the block."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"You can select a theme for the doorbell tunes and it plays each sequentially as the button is pushed.You can also create your own door bell tune.Best available that I found.With Amazon's free shipping, the product always arrives ahead of schedule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Less Than We Had Hoped","review":"This doorbell/door chime arrived well packaged. The installation instructions were poor; a picture of the actual positioning of the terminals would have been better than the schematic given. After fiddling/rewiring the wires, doorbell, diode, etc., I finally got the appropriate sounds from it. However, there are several things that need improvement. The female voice that tells what group of tunes is selected reminds me of what would pass for a drill sergeant, certainly not soft and/or pleasant. The volume control should be labled \\"loud\\", \\"louder\\", \\"loudest\\", and \\"wake the neighbors\\". Finally, the sounds that the chime makes are very mechanical; not melodic at all. I wish I had bought another Heath/Zenith Hardwired Multi-Tune Chime; even though that failed and I was replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD QUALITY, POOR WARRANTY","review":"Bought this stroller two months ago and already lost a pair of front wheels, call MacLauren, and they charged me $35 for the replacement and didn't take responsability for the poor manufacturing, the only good feature is its light weight. The wheels touch the sun cover when you fold it, therefore it's always dirty. For the amount of money that it costs you expect more and a better customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive stroller","review":"I just bought a EuroTrend Sport stroller (by Baby Trend, which is an exclusive Toys R Us/ Babies R Us brand), and it is IDENTICAL to the Maclaren, at almost a third the price ($50). Honestly, why would you pay for the Maclaren with that kind of competition? Great European engineering... great American pricing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAMBO SANGRIA","review":"This is one of the best in Cal Tjader. This Combination of two LPs into one CD produces back to back relaxing music for those who are fans of Latin Jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigup for this one","review":"Take out the skits and its one of the greatest dancehall records ever. This is the type of album that gets hip hop fans into reggae. Deport Them is excellent, so is Check it Deeply, both the songs with Mr. Vegas, and Infiltrate on that Who Am I? rhythm. Alos listen to Faded. That being said the best song outside of Deport Them on the record is No Bligh, which is straight head rockin dancehall, if you like music get it. I like it so much i bought it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is HOT!!!!!","review":"I LOVE this CD!!! It's a good record all round. I love dancehall and this CD (aside from the corny skits which I hope aren't on the next record)is one you could just pop in and let it play. Infiltrate, She Want it and No Bligh are the hottest cuts on the album. I recommend this to everybody who loves to dance and loves dancehall. If you don't cop this one, you've definitely missed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuff Respect Mon!!!!!!!!!","review":"Meh luv dem tunes still ya know, yah tight brethen, big up only less skits.
