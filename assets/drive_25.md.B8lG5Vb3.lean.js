It runs pretty quietly on the low and medium settings but can get a little loud on high (which is kind of expected).Overall, this is a purchase I have not regretted.

I bought my first one 5 years ago and it ran 24/7 365 days a year. It took 5 years of continuous use before one of the ball bearings wore out. FIVE YEARS of 24/7/365 use! This is a superb fan!This fan is very well balanced. It never wobbles or shakes.This fan is not a quiet as I'd like, but then again, I want perfection and that's not going to happen. It is quiet enough on the slow setting, and making a fan spin faster does nothing to move air faster (believe it or don't, this is pure physics).Cleaning of this fan is very easy. Simply remove the grill screws, then remove the grills. Then unscrew the blade holder, and pull the blades off the spindle. Wash in hot, soapy water.

The three modes are not particularly 'whisper quiet', as I've heard other box fans quieter and less powerful.There's a knob on the top with three speeds and two plastic feet to help keep it from falling over.That's all.Which is exactly what I needed, for about the cheapest price I could find here on Amazon.It's just not really what the description notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big and powerful!","review":"It's a nice fan to have when the hot is here.It's big enough, and moves nicely the air around.

I can turn up my thermostat in the summer and still stay cool and comfy, in the winter it helps circulate the warm air in the house. I have a teenage son at home and when he has friends who sleep over they can be a bit noisy sometimes. However, with my Lasko fan turned on the number 2 setting I don't hear them and my son's bedroom is right across the hall from mine. This being said, if you are looking for a quiet fan then I suggest you buy another brand. However, if you want to lower your electric bill and block out noise then this is the one to buy.

I am even worried the neighbors can hear it at night.The noise is awful -- and a bad surprise when you need to use it. My parents always had a couple of these box fans around and they never made anywhere near this kind of noise. The construction is all plastic.

I fixed it myself because I didn't want to return it, by bending it back into shape (it's sort of flimsy, so it wasn't hard). But, it's too loud for the bedroom even on low. And, it smells of an oil/electrical smell when it is turned on, yuck. I have it turned on outside to try to work out the smell (no, it's not rubbing or smoking or anything).I'm trying to replace a Holmes box fan that burnt out after years of use. The Holmes was extremely quiet on low, and had the added benefit of a rotatable angled vent that could blow diagonally from the window into the room at the side. Sadly I can't find a direct replacement for my old fan, and this one isn't going to fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken on arivel","review":"it was broken, from no packing materiel.found the same fan for $11 cheaper local & no shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing & Broken","review":"The quality of this product was very dissapointing compared to previous fans that we have owned for a similar price.

It does exactly what I expected, and that is to blow air and get circulation.Although, I do have complaints with the way that the fan was shipped to me. There was damage on the front panel that keeps you from touching the blades. There was also a good sized dent on one the corners from where the box had been dropped. Either they need to make the box bigger and more protective around the fan, or perhaps Amazon could put Fragile stickers on a box like this. I have done shipping with UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc... many time and \\"fragile\\" sticker really does make a world of a difference with how they handle product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does The Job","review":"I was looking for a box fan to cool down my apartment; quite simply, this guy does the job. Having used older 'passed down' box fans in the past, I've never actually purchased one before. The ones I've had in the past were quite old, rusted, and flimsy - I've been in the need of an upgrade. So far, I've been very pleased with this model. I immediately noticed the improved quality of the frame and fan efficiency. Come fall, I usually place these on the interior window sill to bring in cooler air - thus saving money on air conditioning. My only complaint would be that sometimes it falls over - this is easily resolved by carefully positioning the fan and/or moving to a different surface (e.g. it tends to fall over more easily on carpet than wood). Said and done, this guy is powerful and worth the money; so far I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"This fan was... sort of acceptable? I'm a student in New York and I lived on the sixth floor of a pre-war dorm building, where it got so hot that sitting in the room was unbearable without a fan. I bought this fan to help cool down, but it honestly did little to nothing to cool my little shoebox of a room. I suppose I can't blame a $20 fan for being weak, but I will say that after only about a month of use (two weeks in the beginning of September, and two weeks in May), one of the blades just fell off. I have no idea what happened, it just dropped off as if someone had sliced it off with a knife. I unscrewed the whole casing and managed to reattach the blade with crazy glue and copious amounts of tape, but I have to say it's a pretty shoddy fan if you have to McGyver it after only a few weeks of use. I'll give it two stars because perhaps the blade thing was a fluke. All in all, it doesn't cool very effectively and it broke very quickly; perhaps invest in something a little bit more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly caught fire.","review":"I had bought mine locally and had run it for a few days. Tonight it started to stink. I found it was hot around the switch and motor. Both points smelled of smoldering plastic.

The fan was purchased in 2007 at Lowes and it went out in 2009. From this quality manufacturer, by the feel and look of this Lasko Model 3733 fan I would expect more than 2 years from this product.

There is no chance of anything having been spilled on (nor in) my drive. The only thing I can think of is that the glue from the label heated up, label shifted and adhesive oozed. And it's entirely possible every disc I use now will end up with gobs of glue on it that rubbing alcohol won't even remove.

NOT EVEN CLOSE FOLKS! and I know why...my brand new HP Printer does a burnout on the slick backing of the template paper. Meaning my printer is already printing before the template ever gets there.

The theme of following your dreams instead of following the crowd is particularly relevant. \\"Breaking Free\\" is especially good and does really soar. \\"Getcha Head in the Game\\" is a great precursor to any sports game or exercise routine.

I know I already wrote a review for \\"Blessed Are The Sick\\", where I said that was their best, well I take that back! I din't know about this album at the time, that's why. This kind of reminds me of 80s Sepultura and 80s Slayer, just w/ a little more growling in the vocals. The best tracks are \\"Immortal Rites\\", \\"Suffacation\\", \\"Visions From The Dark Side\\", \\"Maze Of Torment\\", \\"Chapel Of Ghouls\\", and \\"Bleed For The Devil\\". There's no shortage of great guitar playing either."},{"rating":"2","title":"HORRIBLE MY LEFT FOOT THIS CD IS EXCELLENT","review":"one of the finest death metal works ever and great tracks chapel of the ghouls bites its that good .they are the best satanic death metal band ever to walk this earth and will always be the best do get this its a morbid angel classic and by far their finest albums to date thanks cya"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its their first album get it!","review":"Morbid Angel are in my opinion the best band in the genre. Most of these songs can be found on the Demo from 86' Abominations of Desolation. Thats right this band has been around for a while. This album's production is very raw but still better than the demo. Almost every song on the disc is a classic. When I first heard this band I was tripped out by the sheer sonic intensity. If you want heavier you can try Deicide but Glen Bentton is still using the same exact vocal rhythms on all their albums. You will not get any closer to chaos than the leads found on this and Blessed are the Sick. I own A-F and have seen this band 5 times. The album titles progress alphabeticly. There is no Death Metal more down to earth and gifted as this band Arguments welcome. Check out the samples if you think I'm all hype thats what the're there for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of an era.","review":"I've decided that I'm going to write a short review for each of the Morbid Angel albums because I consider MA to be the best pure death metal band on the planet. It all started with Altars of Madness, the album brought death metal into it's own. This was no longer the proto-death thrash established by the(great) Death... This was evil stuff... Blasphemous lyrics, deep, dark growls, agonized screaming, speaking in tongues, evil chanting... You know, death metal. Many people claim that this is the best death metal album ever released... For the most part, I tend to agree with that. Every song on here is great and there is absolutely no filler.Favorite Songs:1. Suffocation2. Lord of All Fevers & Plagues3. Chapel of Ghouls"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaotic Madness","review":"The guitars were really being pushed to their wildest, most chaotic madness here. Yet without destroying the song structures. Backing up the the guitars are the drums, the drummer knowing just when to blast beat and when not to. This is a classic well worth its weight in gold. Time changes and technical guitar work are responsible for this wonderful sound. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY overrated","review":"Seen a lot of people hailing this one as classic - well don't believe the hype my friends. The production is shoddy and the songs, as with most Morbid Angel albums, aren't bad but they aren't that great either.This is a mediocre death metal band, they have yet to put forth a truly good record. To avoid disappointment, seriously consider borrowing a friend's copy or something before you buy. I cannot recommend buying this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I've seen a lot of people hail this one as a classic death metal record. Maybe I just don't get it. It far from [stinks] but it just isn't that heavy.Here's my reasoning: The vocalist is weak for a death metal singer and there's some kind of echo effect on the voice. The guitar riffs are fast sure, but they just don't have really heavy hooks. The song writing is mediocre, nothing really catchy. The drums are fast but monotonous. In fact, the whole record just kind of fades into a montone blur - not very heavy at all.Bottomline - average disk. Nothing spectacular. Good death metal records I can recommend from the same time period are: Death - Leprosy, Entombed - Clandestine, Sepultura - Beneath the Remains, Pestilence - Consuming Impulse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds mediocre to me.","review":"Boring and repetive with stupid lirycs and not even heavy or fast. Morbid angel is the worse deathmetal act todate and they will always be that! Terrible isn't close to what m.a. sounds like... I mean, where's the talent? Where's the love for deathmetal here ? Its no where to be found! Im some one with an open minded mind and i did give every single morbid angel cd a listing and not one song sounded good and coming close to being even decent or even fast and heavy. For good and brutal deathmetal look for \\"deicide\\" ,\\" decapitated\\",\\"scar culture\\",\\"cannibal corpse\\" , \\"deeds of flesh\\" , \\"skinless\\" ,\\"gorerote\\",\\"grave\\" , \\"obituary\\" , early, \\"napalmdeath\\", & early \\"cryptopsy\\" albums like none so vile & whisper supremacy--- well, cryptopsy is more like grind/death and some times hardcore... But still brutally as ever---more then weak morbid angel will ever be in their whole sorry and mediocre career."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning","review":"A perfect introduction to the world of Morbid Angel, their classic debut album \\"Altars of Madness\\" is one of the best and most revered death metal albums of all time. Technically profound and surprisingly well produced for it's time, this is the Morbid Angel that fans have become familiar with over the years: aggressive, intense, brutal, and full of pure unadulturated evil, this is death metal at it's best. Standout cuts like \\"Immortal Rites\\", \\"Visions From the Darkside\\", \\"Maze of Torment\\", \\"Bleed For the Devil\\", \\"Damnation\\", and \\"Blasphemy\\" are classic Morbid Angel and are concert staples to this day.

Did it reach the expectations? heck, yeah. Morbid Angel never kicked so much ass. This is as good as \\"Blessed...\\"/\\"Covenant\\"...even better! \\"Altars\\" contains some of my favorite metal tunes. Maze of Torment and Chapel of Ghouls are masterpieces. Period. AoM is pure genius. This record contains riffs that influenced a hundred bands and spawned a new generation of metal. While the production could've been better, this one of the best metal albums in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Blessed or Covenant","review":"This album sounds as good to me today as it did when I first heard it about 15 years ago. Listening to it, I am reminded how far Death Metal has come.

While \\"You Should Be Dancing\\" \\"Love So Right\\" and \\"Boogie Child\\" are fun, the best songs on this collection are \\"Subway,\\" with its driving beat and haunting melody and the passionate beauty of \\"The Way It Was.\\" So, if you have this CD, go back and check out these gems; if you don't have it and you're a new Bee Gees fan, buy this for a good example of why they were so popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Version","review":"The same 10 tracks of US versions of 90s.

Sensible use of synthesizers and a steady, flowing feel to the song make it one of their best. It's a hidden treasure.

After reading the book, I am better equipped to identify my own soft addictions and to see how they keep me from living the life I say I want.

Judith Wright's book has given me MORE! More compassion for myself and my soft addictions AND actual strategies for doing something about them.

I have to say that as I look at most of the reviews of this book, they all look and read about the same---Almost as if they were created by the same person or person(s) working for a PR firm or marketing company or publisher trying to hype the book.When you read 37 REAL reviews of a book or CD, that is a large enough sample where you will see different points of view, different writing/grammar styles, etc. However, the reviews of this book all are sooo suspiciously similar and positive that it begs credibility to believe they are all from actual individual readers.Let's not be naive enough to think that book publishers aren't savvy enough to know how to use free and powerful point-of-sale media like this to promote their product.Read the reviews yourself and let me know if it doesn't smell to you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is based on Christian values","review":"There are some interesting ideas presented here. However it isn't a book for everyone: it is written from a devout Christian point of view.If the authors were more clear about that on the cover and in the description, then that would be fine. But there weren't any clues until I started reading the text.Here's an example from page 139: \\"We are meant to be addicted to God, but we develop secondary addictions that temporarily appear to fix our problem.\\"Search for \\"God\\" and you get 26 hits. Again, I just think the cover should have been more transparent about that because it is a core frame for the book. This isn't \\"a book written by someone who happens to be Christian,\\" it's more like a Christian book.As an alternative, I'd suggest an awareness practice; there are several out there. They tend to be based on the same core material, and can work hand-in-hand with any set of spiritual beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Civil Rights Film","review":"The story of Malcolm X (El Hajj Malik El Shabazz) was dramtically and fantastically brought to life by Denzel Washington and director Spike Lee.

His struggles and achievements are displayed in the most truthful of fashions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"MALCOLM X is a powerful and compelling biography, chronicling the struggle, the rise and the tragic fall of a great American individual. Denzel Washington SHOULD have received his Oscar for this performance. It wasn't anything racist because the Academy normally bestows Oscars to actors for the WRONG performances (Al Pacino for SCENT OF A WOMAN? Paul Newman for THE COLOR OF MONEY? Forget about it!).The only real problem I had was with the way Spike Lee chose to end the film.He spends three hours telling the very raw human story of how Malcolm X lived and died--and then tacks on what feels like a recruitment film that worships the image of the man, the kind of deification that might have made Malcolm uneasy. And made me think the filmmakers may have missed the point.Still, a great biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malcolm x makes good viewing","review":"For what Spike Lee is doing in this film i think he captured alot of it reasonably well, but it's got to be hard to make a film on one of the defining people in history. Malcolm x is a long film which is a good film but if you watch this excpecting it to be around 2 hours you should be warned in advance (it clocks in at around about 3. The film portrays many important issues that we live with today mainly that you should not judge a person by his past and that people really can change even against all odds. Though Malcolm x is not the most lucid of films it still makes good viewing and Denzel Washington himself makes a very admiral and well acted performace. This is one of the better historical films around."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't think, buy it!","review":"Malcom is part of our countries history just like Abe Lincoln or Martin Luther King or JFK.

Now, who's gonna play MARTIN LUTHER KING in the near future:WESLEY SNIPES OR SAMUEL L.

I give Spike Lee his props for making a movie during tuff times. But I would have rather Spike Lee give over the rights to use the X to Dr. Betty Shabazz when she was alive. That's why it's crucial to own your own name. So BEWARE of any filmmaker even the ones who are African/African-American who want to reap the cashflow from your biographical life story or any screenplay you submit to their production companies.Ernest Dickerson did a wonderful job with the cinematography. Denzel's acting was superb along with Delroy Lindo and many others in the film.The sound in the movie was all that. The sets were outstanding for the location scenes.A MUST SEE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Xceptional","review":"Why did Denzel miss out on an acadamy award for this film is one great mystery to me. His mannerisms, speech and passion is pure Malcolm. And his likeness to Malcolm is uncanny.A gripping film which is inspirational and confronts all Americans to the reality of racism during those turbulent times. A special visit by none other than Nelson Mandella at the end was surprising and very fitting.This is a classic drama which you will surely love as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another aamzing performance from Denzel!","review":"Purchased this along with Glory. What can I say but the man is amazing. The way he personafies Malcom in this movie is incredible. Denzel and Spike, you've outdone yourselves with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was undeniably excellent.","review":"This is probably one of the best coming of age black movies ever. (Or should I say Black History movies ever).This movie has a stunning appearance by Denzel Washington. The first half of the movie is about how he was a pimp and gangster, and how when he went to jail, he found his senses. I remmeber when I was at the theater in 1992, I clapped at the end for like five minutes.Let me tell yall this. Any kid doing a project on Malcolm X, BUY THIS MOVIE. I repeat, BUY THIS MOVIE. Don't get that 1972 biography documentary. Buy this 1992 spike lee joint. I think it is the second best movie Spike Lee made. Denzel's appearance is comparable to Jamie Foxx's in RAY (2004) and Will Smith's in ALI (2001). (Note: THey need to make movies on MArtin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mendela, and Ghandi, all being wonderful black leaders.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must view by all","review":"this is history very well done picture.denzell was solid and the pacing of the film was brillant.the oscars don't care about black hollywood.it's no secret.but in the hearts of the many that saw this picture it was worthy of the highest awards and what have you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One DVD came in the package...","review":"I am very disappointed...I order this DVD, only 1 DVD came in the package, this is a 2 disc DVD and the movie is Stretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality was below par","review":"I liked the movie a lot, but the streaming was choppy, and we didn't receive HD quality for the majority of the movie.

The overall portrayal of Malcolm X from class president to street hustler to convict to political leader is as good as it gets. You cannot truly understand or appreciate the man until you understand his evolution. And director Spike Lee delivers massively here! There are many things to learn here: the charisma, the fiery rhetoric and the sacrifices.Don't walk to buy the Blu-Ray edition movie. Run! It's really that good. The documentaries on the disc are an added bonus as well. Very educational"},{"rating":"2","title":"Me myself and Malcolm","review":"This movie not bad but brothers jus cain't accept the fact Malcomlm not everythang he cracked up to be. This is proven partly because he probly even sell crack as the film point out. He be ailing and this movie prove the point to a tea. Spike Lee jus doing his job but this ceck out the facts of his life in the film and don't often match the book of the same name. Malcolm have a weakness for white women and the movie does at least make that clear from the get go. He neglect his own black woman because she tell him, \\"Why, just because I don't [put out.\\" This is the way it truly go down by the book to. Movie Malcom not the real deal. So Spike, don't make this felllow a hero. This is your opinion or just to make some profit from the people?

They remind me of my family, especially since they are all girls and their parents are wonderful. What surprises me is how they conveniently removed the part about how Malcolm went to Africa. There are two discs of this film: part 1 and part 2. Frankly, I only care for part 2 because it has the 1972 documentary. This is the only reason I kept the second disc. How could they do this? They don't owe us anything, so I discarded the first disc. It's not okay to marginalize Africa, so the four stars goes to the 1972 documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar-worthy performance by Denzel Washington","review":"I admit that I never thought much of Denzel Washington until I saw him in \\"Training Day\\". In that movie, I was very impressed with his ability to play a very confident, smart, and super-cool character. He deserved that Oscar. Now, watching \\"Malcom X\\", a movie made by Spike Lee in 1992, I realize that he has always been that kind of actor. His portrayal of Malcolm is full of power and subtlety. I've never had that much interest in Spike Lee's films, but I have to say that this one is very well done, and very interesting, no matter where you fall on the political spectrum."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product","review":"Bought this years ago from an info-mercial on TV.

There seems to a be a particular influence from The Rentals' album Seven More Minutes on a few tracks, most notably the profanity laden single It's A Brother Sister Thing. The album even uses samples, something I normally can't abide, to great effect, most notably on Cool It Now. It can't be overstated how adept or at least well produced the two main vocalists sound, Marc's hoarse semi-spoken style perfectly complimented by Sharon's girly croon. The lyrics perhaps remind you a few too many times that Len is a party band, but on The Royal Screwjob Marc offers some socially conscious affirmation of self-belief in pursuing your own vision \\"be lost, be strange, be what those other people won't do, you know you're right.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The latest LEN album","review":"Diary Of The Madmen contain a lot of very good LEN songs and a few interesting colorful songs (Kookoo Docks).

Unfortunately, the album does not include Bobby, We Rock The Mike, King Of The Block, and Saturday which were some of the best songs on their album advance We Be Who We Be.

In general I did like the book. Both the narrative and the photos/illustrations were quite nice. I would have like to seen better reproductions of the maps. Having grown up in Chicago and attending the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana in the 1960s I got to be quite familiar with the passenger trains that connected those two cities. I think on balance the author was fair in his attention to the various geographic regions that this line served. Were he have gone into a lot more depth this book could easily have been 4 to 10 times as long. But then it wouldn't have been the easy read that it was.

He fails at everything and relies on others to get him out of difficulties. The other primary character, Ernest's godfather (another \\"voice\\" for the author) spends his time despising Ernest's parents and saving Ernest. Yet, since this is an autobiographical novel, the author would have you believe that Ernest is actually a brilliant iconoclast whose writings disturb Victorian society. Humbug! Butler demonizes his parents so heavyhandedly (all the characters are cardboard, etched with bile) and is so smug about it, that he, not they, comes across as the Monster. Of Human Bondage, by H. S.

I read the reviews on this product before I purchased it and do disagree with a few of them. Although the can opener works great I have yet to have it completely detach the lid from the can.

We were very happy with it until about a month ago (so after 4.5 months). Even before that i had noticed that a slight, brown rust spot was starting to develop where the cutting blade holder is welded to the bottom of the lower arm. I figured it was not hurting anything functionality wise. But about a month ago we pulled it out of the drawer and the gears would not turn no matter how hard we turned the knob. After inspecting it, it turned out that the top gear would not move at all. It does not look rusted but I suspect that perhaps some water went inside and rusted the mechanism shut. Now it's just in a drawer until we toss it. About a month ago I got the \\"Amco Swing-A-Way 407WH Portable Can Opener, White\\" from Amazon at a lower cost to replace it, which functionally is working just as well for us as the Oxo did; hopefully the durability will be much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd purchased it earlier","review":"This opener deserves all the praise it has received from other reviewersI have arthritis in my hands and although I rarely use canned items, I do need one to open dog food and this opener is so very easy to use that I wish I had more cans to open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not dishwasher-safe","review":"This may be a very good opener; but the description of it being dishwasher-safe is false.

After 2 months the twist-handle stripped and the unit became worthless. My OXO does not look like the OXO in the pic---I probably got some Chinese garbage knock-off--who knows?

Again I researched can openers on Amazon and clicked on smooth edge can openers and this one popped up on the page. No where in the description did it mention that it was not a smooth edge can opener. Another fault is that it is billed as being dishwasher safe, yet on the product label it clearly states \\"hand wash only\\".I expected better from Amazon and I am really disappointed Amazon didn't do a better job describing this product.

In reality, this hand held one is no better than the electric one that you can buy at walmart for less than $10.

After reading the reviews, I have decided to put this one down. What I found so interesting is that most of the negative reviewers had only rated this or maybe one other book.

The protaganist of the book, Lee, is generally very unlikeable. She is whiney and often rude, and completely unmotovated to do anything. Half of the book she barely even has friends. She is surrounded by characters who are shallow and very two dimentional to make things even better.Besides the characters, the basis for the book bothered me a lot as well. The fact that people might think this is an acurate portrayal of a prestigious boarding school is horrifying to think about. Sittenfeld does not include a single believable character in the story and clearly draws on some bad experience she had in her life. Her characters are uninteresting and her idea of boarding school life is completely off. I would never recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prep","review":"I'm amazed at the number of highly rated reviews for this book. It was poorly written, repetitive, and boring. The protagonist was an extremely unlikeable character - snobbish to the extreme. She never grew or became more self-aware as the book progressed. There was no resolution; the book just ended. Check it out from the library if you must; don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my life!","review":"This is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. It was the most useless, horrible story ever. It highlights the worst in teenagers, makes the main character nothing but a one dimensional stereotype, and makes all the other characters one dimensional sterotypes. There is no depth to anything, there is no resolution, there is no attachment to any characters. I did not emphatize with the main character, I wanted to smack her! Don't waste your time!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I was listening to the audio version of this book, and I had to turn it off about halfway through because I realized that I hated the main character. I found her simpering, annoying, whiny, and--worst of all--stupid. I hoped that she would become more likeable, but it just got worse and worse as the narration inched along. (I actually found myself rooting against Lee Fiore.)Awful, truly awful.(Sadly, this is only one of two books that I can truly say I dislike; the other is \\"The Golden Bowl\\" by Henry James...however, I read that through to the bitter end, which gives it a leg up on Curtis Sittenfeld's novel.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like reality","review":"I was a white girl on full scholarship for four years at a boarding school in CT in the late 70's early 80's and this book is absolutely NOTHING like what I experienced. The only things that even remotely rung true were the daily school meetings and the funny little traditions that these schools have. I bought the book because I thought it would bring back some great memories and I found I couldn't relate at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unlikable character. . .","review":"I couldn't connect with Lee Fiora on any level- she would have been sympathetic if she had any likable characteristics what-so-ever. She never had any moments of growth and all her personal reflection (ad naseum) did nothing but contribute to her lack of self-esteem. While the book was extremely readable, I never found myself rooting for her, it was more like I was extremely embarrassed for her. It was kind of like looking through someone's dirty laundry hamper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and compelling","review":"She hits the nail on the head -- that is if you are interested in this partcular nail -- and the world of this novel is not something universally relatable to. That said, it's a book that reflects a lot of work, great style and a formidable glimpse into the world of super wealthy schools and the families they attract: from the outsider's point of view, too (much to it's credit!) Good job. And we should know.

She can't be serious can she?First of, this book is hardly a story. It has no plot line, before anybody gets on my back about how this is contemporary novel, blah de dah, I'm just saying what I feel. This book, to me, is like a diary that has been stolen from a depressed girl that has to make up fantasies to cheer herself up.After reading this book twice (to make sure I've actually read the book correctly) I'm still wondering if the book was a fake. I wondered if someone had taken out the actual book contents and then replaced it with their own, badly written version instead.I actually hated the writer after I read this book, because I felt that she had wasted my time and money. What was the point of this book, can anybody tell me? Now I know why this book was stuffed in the smallest corner of the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable Characters, weak story","review":"This book was hard to read because I never developed a liking for the characters. The main character was as awkward when she graduated as when she was a freshman. The story read like one humiliating and uncomfortable scene after another, with no real closure or progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Funny, Poignant, and Painful","review":"Although I am an avid reader, I rarely write book reviews. After reading the book, Prep, I feel obliged to share my opinion. This book is excellent. As the other reviewers wrote, Prep is an honest look at the tumultuous teenage years. At times I laughed out loud, whereas other times I cried. Throughout, I was totally engaged in this page-turner. Although most readers will not be able to relate to Lee's experience at a prep school, everyone will be able to relate to some aspect relating to her emotions, her confusions, her insecurities, her joys, her obsessions, and her pain. Be warned, as I was reading Prep, I found myself remembering events from my adolescence that I had forgotten-this was not always pleasant. Sittenfeld accomplished what many of the best authors strive for: she created a character that is fully human, painfully honest, and easily recognizable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I thought this book would detail Lee's growth through from an insecure freshman to a self-confident and self-respecting young woman by the time she graduates. Unfortunately, the main character remains a shallow, insipid shell of a human being to the very last page. There is no personal growth nor a resolution to her maddening self-confidence issues, and the book drags to a conclusion. It is wrought with stereotypes without containing any meaningful commentary; the reader is simply supposed to accept that the one black girl in the story steals, and that the main character would have been afraid to talk to a certain beautiful (Hispanic) classmate \\"if she had been white\\". Reading the interactions between the main character and a boy she's involved with are nothing short of painful, as the sex scenes are degrading to the point of being revolting. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and regret the time I took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self loathing at its lowest...","review":"At first I loved this novel, expecting the main character to really develop and blossom and to learn more about what is actually happening in her life rather than the inane thoughts that run through her head. The story was rather boring and I found myself wanting to learn more about the other characters than about her, I wish the writer had done this book from the perspective of anyone else but the person she actually chose. This girl made herself awkward and brought herself down more than any other character. I also agree with the person who pointed out how the author attempted to promote every given stereotype, the Jewish girl who has to get a nose job, the token black that does the Uncle Tom skit, the Asian girl with the \\"weird\\" food and the Hispanic girls with bad makeup and clothes. A true waste of potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prep is an engaging and engrossing first novel!","review":"Lee Fiora, an outstanding grammar school student in South Bend, Indiana, receives a scholarship to attend the prominent Ault School, a boarding school in Massachusetts. For the majority of students at Ault money is not an issue. As Lee learns, it is an issue that is simply not discussed among her fellow students. Lee is unsettled by the fact that she is no longer the outstanding student she was in Indiana. Prep is written in such an intimate style that you feel what Lee feels during her four years at Ault. Chapters are semester length so you get an in-depth view of Lee, her friends, and boarding school culture. Lee's struggles never end in trying to become comfortable at Ault, finding friends, maintaining her grades and seeking a boyfriend. Lee does give you a glimpse of their lives into the future. This novel gives us all something to relate to, the people and feelings we have known throughout our lives"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but dull","review":"This book is undeniably well-written. But a novel also needs interesting characters and intriguing plot development. I found that \\"Prep\\" lacked both. There are literally places in the book where you can skip several pages and not miss a single important story point. Above in one of the editorial reviews it is noted that the narrator, Lee, \\"sees herself as 'one of the mild, boring, peripheral girls' among her privileged classmates.\\" She is indeed that. I don't read novels to read about mild, boring, peripheral characters. With all the undeserved comparisons to Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" being made, I'd suggest reading that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version too expensive!!!!!!!","review":"I wanted to read this on my Kindle but why would I pay $11.99 to read it on my Kindle when I can buy the book on Prime for $9.73/Paperback and $3.50/hardcover + free shipping? Why are Kindle books so high? Without the cost of publishing, they should be way cheaper. And this book is 7 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I did make it through the whole book...","review":"Well, I did manage to be interested enough to read the entire book, but when I was finished I wished that I would not have bothered. I was mad at the author, mad at the main character, mad at the people who gave this book good reviews, and mad in general. I wanted my 3 hours back. I'm over that anger now, but frustrated about stereotypes of the Midwest and the Northeast were prevalent in the book. I think that I would have rather read a fluffier book about a shallow, happy girl who learned something than this psuedo-philosophic girl. Save your time for something truly worth reading (like The Heart is a Lonely Hunter or The Secret Life of Bees.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This book was absolutely horrible. What did the author try to describe in this book? Was this book written to give a perspective of how minorities are treated in prep school? Or to simply entertain, giving readers things to relate to the main character? If it was the first reason, the author has completely messed up, and has written it without thought or reasearch. If it was the later, this book wasn't meant to be praised by so many readers.Personally, another reason why I hated this book so much was that it was impossible to track what time period this book was set in. How many teenagers listen to Bob Dylan these days? Do you actually think someone who owns shoe factories (I would have understood if it was a computer parts factory or a car manufacturing company) in Korea would be rich these days? What is this? The 70's?Not only that, but the book was slow moving as well. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mess","review":"What a disappointment. This book was a mishmash of prep school cliches. The plot was thin, the main character not at all sypathetic or even interesting. Who wants to read about a high school girl who has so little self regard that she would allow the boy she \\"loves\\" to use her for sex while forbidding him to acknowledge her in public, and who cheats on exams to stay in school, with no repercussions? There were multiple mixed messages but it all boiled down to BORING and TRITE. I expected more from an author with the credentials of Ms. Sittenfeld but was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a COMPLETE waste of time","review":"This book is a great example of an over-hyped mess. Kept me somewhat entertained, waiting for something to happen, but it never did and I completely forgot everything about the book within about an hour of finishing it. If you want to care for or feel empathy for the main character, skip Prep and try The Wonder Spot by Melissa Bank instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever partially read!!","review":"Prep is single handedly the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of partially reading. I did not even get to page 50 and I threw it in the garbage! I don't know how people managed to finish this book! The protagonist is a huge bore from whom there is nothing to learn or be inspired from. From the other negative reviews I have read on here, it seems that she is that way to the end! I actually resent the author for creating her.I am positively shocked that there are other reviews comparing Lee to Holder Caulfeld!! Lee is to Holden Caulfeld as Faster Pussycat is to Bach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"\\"Prep\\" is a book that is too long, unexpectedly far too graphic, and extremely depressing. Lee doesn't fit in, feels lower than her peers, gets subpar grades, never has a boybriend, gets into a lousy college, and ends up having sex with a jerk who doesn't even care about her. At the end of the story, she looks back and realizes that she didn't enjoy herself and then rarely talks to her former best friend. IF I WANTED TO BE THIS DEPRESSED, I WOULD'VE READ THE NEWS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated the main character, and not in a good way.","review":"There are definitely moments of cleverness and rich evocation: the names of Lee's fellow students, for one, are funny and spot-on. And the main character's best (only) friendship does effectively evoke the nuances of young female friendships. BUT: a well-drawn character who is troubled and awkward should make you want to hug them, not smack them. Lee messes up and self-sabotages so consistently -- and not in an endearing teen-angst way -- that she just gets more and more painfully irritating, willfully un-self-aware, and, frankly, pathetic, and therefore, less and less worth rooting for. In a really good book, she'd Grow and Learn From Her Experiences in subtle and unpredictable ways. In a mediocre (and way too long) book, however, she just gets buffeted about by a series of moderately skillful descriptions. I was drawn along by a few compelling plot turns (Assassin, the math test) but ultimately disappointed -- and frustrated by the excessive hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feelings, nothing more","review":"Nothing in this novel is profound. Nothing in this novel is redeeming. Nothing in this novel inspires, puzzles, or educates. It is the ramblings of nothingness. Where feelings of the moment have a higher priority than values, morals, standards, virtues or ethics which, by the way, were nowhere to be found in the main character's daily struggles as an individual growing up -- only feelings.There was a little trace of regret, and only then because of its inconvenience to Lee herself, but there was no trace of shame or guilt in Lee.\\"Where these is yet shame, there may in time be virtue\\" Dr. Johnson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written!","review":"Am I the only reader who found the prose ponderous, the dialogue stilted, and the whole thing badly in need of editing? I am amazed at the status this book has achieved, and doubly amazed that anyone would utter Salinger and Sittenfeld in the same breath. Read the prose out loud to yourself: are these long, wordy, rhythm-less sentences pleasing to the ear? Read the dialogue out loud to yourself: does anyone really talk like that, and do we need to have every single tedious, expository word in every conversation? At the end of Chapter 2, where was an editor to cut out the second half of the last sentence? (We get it!)Really, why is such schlock getting such praise?"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to believe","review":"The \\"Sugarman\\" crush is the only theme that runs through the whole book, all others such as \\"assassin\\", \\"teaching bike riding\\", \\"theft\\", \\"hair cutting\\" etc. are not. If you think the \\"hair cutting\\" is far-fetched, the \\"hooking up\\" with sugarman toward the end is even more so. Why all of sudden, the boy decided to hook up with Lee in their last year? What has made her different in Sugarman's eyes after being classmates for three years? This part and the last chapter (after colleges) are so \\"Hollywood\\" and are the worse parts of the already flat plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down...","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Though it sometimes seemed that there wasn't much of a story in there, it was more of an experience and I got really hooked on the book. I think the book is intended for teens, but I picked it up at the airport at age 25 and it seem like it would be appropriate for any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not get through this book","review":"This book dragged and dragged and dragged. I could not finish it. Filled with one tedious scene after another, I honestly don't know how this book ever got published. It had no interesting plot, characters, or storyline. I found myself yawning as I read it. Usually, I force myself to finish all books I start. But I finally had to give up on this one. I didn't want to waste one more minute of my precious life."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying and boring","review":"This book is awful. Such a waste of money. Lee is extremely insecure and can't even have a normal conversation with anyone. For four years, all she does is sit in her room and do absolutely nothing other than think about and judge her classmates. She somehow forgets she's at a boarding school and needs to study and makes awful grades. She has a huge crush on the most popular guy in her grade and one night he magically appears in her room which starts a series of hook-ups. She basically lets him use her. Seriously, save your money and don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead Character Annoying","review":"I find it hard to stay interested in a book where you can't identify with the main character in anyway. And this was the case in this book. All I could think the entire time was that teenage angst was way overdone. The story of trying to fit into the popular crowd is one that has been done many times before, and in a more entertaining way. Not one of my favorite reads, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four hours I can never get back","review":"As another reviewer said this is a \\"train wreck\\" of a book. Disjointed. Poorly developed characters. Weak, phlegmatic female character. I can't believe it took Sittenfeld three years to write this mess. I could have done it in a week. And so formulaic. I'm just angry that I picked the book up at a garage sale and wasted my time on it. \\"Fish\\" versus \\"cheese\\"? - puhleeze. St. Albans should be ashamed for housing Sittenfeld as a \\"writer in residence\\" while writing this \\"novel\\". No way I would recommend it to any child, adolescent or young adult. Pure trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine whine whine","review":"The main character does nothing but whine throughout the whole book, it is irritating. The narrative drifts in and out from the topic at hand which would be fine if there was some relevance I literally skipped over paragraphs of unimportant drivel. Save yourself some time hang out at the mall if you want to hear real high school angst or whining this was just self absorbed dull wannabe teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read random blogs better than this","review":"The narrator/heroine/protagonist - and I'm stretching it by applying the latter two terms to Lee Fiora - is an overwhelmingly one-note character. Over four years, she manages not to evolve or change in any way, good or bad. Her detached insecurity is annoying rather than endearing. She observes people rather than interacts with them, which is just as well, because the other characters in the book are pretty boring and one-note as well. I can't think of any redeeming qualities for Lee - she lacks ambition, is jealous of her friends, and [spoiler alert!] can't find the courage to initiate a daytime conversation with the young man who climbs into her bed and has sex with her at night. (Don't get excited - you have to wade through the first 3/4 of the book to get to anything that remotely interesting.) Most of the scenes begin with such gripping openings as \\"The night of the fire drill ... \\" Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spot-on Characterizations!","review":"As someone who attended an elite northeastern prep school, I have to say that the characterization was extremely accurate. In fact, at times I thought that she might be writing about my school (i'm still not sure that she wasn't). In addition, although socially I was the antithesis of Lee, the parallels between what went on in her head and mine were, at times, freaky. Overall, this novel was a great read, the characters were plausible, and the writing style was top notch. I am looking forward to her second novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos to Sittenfeld","review":"Is the writing fabulous? Yes. Is the story very ordinary? Yes. However, what makes this book worth reading is the depth of Lee Fiora, as explained by Sittenfeld. There were times when I loved Lee and was rooting for her, but there are also parts of the novel were I was disgusted with her behavior. However, Lee Fiora is very human and thats what I like most about it. Sure, there are parts of the book that are for lack of a better word, bubblegum. The comparisons to Holden Caufield, I think are without merit, but overall its very enjoyable. The writing is quite impressive for a debut novel. I am very much looking forward to Sittenfeld's next work and am hoping the sophomore effort does not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOUNG ADULT FICTION","review":"What does it say about the state of American literature that this book is hailed as adult literary fiction? I mean come on, this is a Young Adult book, a good YA book but not for grownups. NO WAY. I started this book with great hope, but halfway through--when the embarassing juvenile sex scenes started--I got really bored, (is this her diary from prep school?) and realized that nothing meaningful or interesting was going to happen. The realization that prep school is full of preppy--get it, prep-py people is no surprise, and neither is the fact that there are differences between rich people and middle class people!!! If you are a teenager, read this book, if you are an adult looking for a high school graduation present, buy this book. Otherwise, pass it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good, fun read!","review":"This book is fun to read. It's the story about this midwestern girl who goes to a boarding school in the East Coast. It could have easily been a bad book with lots of cliches and stereotypes, but the author manages to make the characters and situations seem real.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible book","review":"I thought \\"Prep\\" did not give an accurate description of what boarding school life is about. It made boarding school seem overly cliche, and a place where only the rich and the elitest are schooled. The boarding school that Sittenfield created is one that is seen in movies, not real life. If Sittenfield spent more time at boarding schools today, she would realize that her description of boarding school is inaccurate, and poor kids who are sent to boarding schools do not automatically become outcasts. A reader might enjoy this book if he/she has never been to or heard of a boarding school; if the reader has, he/she will find it ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Many other reviewers have already mentioned my chief problems with this book: #1, that the main character/narrator was a neurotic and completely unlikable cipher; and #2, that none of the other characters are really well developed. Ms. Sittenfeld was fairly accurate in her depiction of prep-school life -- I'll give her that. But for a much more interesting look at prep school, and getting inside the mind of a messed-up prep-school student, read Sean Wilsey's memoir, \\"Oh the Glory of it All.\\" (And Wilsey's book is a fabulous read for other reasons, too.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I heard and read so much about this book. But that's not why I hated it. I hated it because it was absolutely awful. This is the worst first person narrative I've ever read. And I've read a lot, trust me. The narrator and plot are flat, flat, flat. My feeling about this novel and the narrator was who cares? If you want to read about adolescent angst don't waste your time with this - read or reread \\"Catcher on the Rye.\\" The few times Holden rants about prep school will tell you all you need to know. What a waste of money! This was such a dull read I don't even want to torture anyone by giving it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for at all!","review":"I really like the teen books, but this was a disappointment. I didn't get very far before I felt that there were things that I didn't want to read about. There were too many mentions of things that I didn't want to be hearing about, sex, and names of things that I just didn't want in a book. I read for entertainment, not education. If I had kids, I would not want them reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and tedious","review":"From reading the back of the book, I was very excited to dive right into it. As I did so, I grew tired of how Lee prejudged everyone and everything and was nieve to the world around her. Yes, she was supposed to be 13 when she went to school, but the character should have matured slightly over the 4 years.The plot was slow and dragging although the writing was on target with what I expected.In the end, I was disappointed because I had begun reading this book with such high hopes, but by the end of the first chapter, I was bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prep","review":"oh.my.god. I can't believe I finished this book when I fould it incredibly cloying almost right away. The character Lee Fiora is a black hole of need and neurosis. I listened to the audiobook and found myself saying out loud \\"shuuuuut up\\" over and over. I'm annoyed I wasted my time with this painful freakin' book. Save yourself!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the NYT thinking?!","review":"The only reason I am giving this book 2 stars is because I think the author did a great job of portraying prep school life with all it's bizzare traditions (the green jacket, etc). However, that was probably the only good thing about this book. It got off to a good start, but half way through I was asking myself what I had done. Lee Fiora came across as a total snot. I tried in desperation to like her, but I could not. From her general \\"whatever\\" attitude about life, to the way she treated her parents, she came across as a very shallow human being.I though the sex scenes were gratuitous. Were they really necessary? This book was terribly formulaic. Awkward, shy girl wins over the handsome, sexy popular boy. Real life could not be further from the truth. Give me a break. Bottom line, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insider gets inside reviews","review":"If someone without connections had written this book, it would not have been published let alone lauded by all the critics. This is clearly a derivative, dull, prep school girl's memoirs. I don't care if she did come from Indiana, she's another prep school girl, in love with the rich despite disclaiming it. It is so overwritten, it's practically unreadable. Shame on the critics who fell for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book ...","review":"... and I wanted to root for the protagonist, but I just couldn't get behind her or any of the characters. Nobody was very likable, particularly Lee. Also, I had a hard time getting past some of the characters' unusual names--Gates, Hunter, Devin, Dede, Darden, Cross, Aspeth, Aubrey, Little, Horton, etc. I suspect these choices were deliberate on the author's part and that they might reflect the kinds of names you'd find in an East Coast boarding school, but I found them distracting.The last chapter was depressing, and I was glad when it was all over. Still, Sittenfeld is a great writer and I'd be willing to give her a chance again."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i'd watched tv","review":"Another reviewer mentioned how unlikable the main character is. I agree. Also, the navel-gazing, woe-is-I tone gets old well before the story ends. A forgettable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read but not sure why it was listed at top 10 book","review":"This was not my favorite book but it gave an interesting perspective. It is probably a worthwhile read for parents of tweens and teenagers who want to get a better idea of what is going through their kid's minds.It was hard for me to get past the maturity that the main character Lee Fiora had for certain people skills which seemed well beyond her age which made the story somewhat unrealistic. For example, in her thoughts about when Martha was telling her something she didn't agree with she would say to herself I didn't say anything because that would mean that Martha would stop being so honest with me. It is hard for me to imagine that Lee is so mature in this perspective when she is so immature (as most teenagers are) in other regards.I think there are much better books out there that I would recommend like The Kite Runner, The Poisonwood Bible, and The Time Traveller's Wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spread the word","review":"DUMBEST BOOK I READ ALL YEARThis book was boring. The writing was bad and the author insults anyone from South Bend Indiana."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wasted a week of my life reading this.","review":"If you are interested in reading 400+ pages waiting for a plot to form, you might like this book. Overall, this is a book (I couldn't even say \\"story\\") about an insecure adolescent who thinks absurdly too much and says/does absolutely nothing. I would guesstimate that if you were to combine all conversations the main character, Lee, spoke in the book, it would not total 3 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUDE AUTHOR","review":"I am from South Bend, Indiana and am completely offended by this novel. Obviously, you never heard of the Trinity School nor think we have homes on Jefferson. I graduated from a prestigious university in South Bend you all heard of and am disappointed a publisher would let this book even make it to a galley print. I have already returned my copy and pointed out to both Barnes and Noble and Borders in South Bend that this book reflects a negative view of South Bend and was told both stores returned copies back to the publishers for that reason alone. I work in publishing in NY and I think no one should buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shampoo Bottle Is More Interesting Than This","review":"I was soooooooo disgusted with this piece of so a called literature. I would suggest the author Curtis Sittenfield find herself a name that matches her gender. Them I would suggest she invest in a bottle of shampoo and get some advice from that. You could also bring a bottle of your favorite shampoo and read that in the bathroom instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! It's written by a male","review":"Not since \\"She's Come Undone\\" has a male done such an amazing job of getting into a female's head."},{"rating":"2","title":"This happened to me","review":"This book was fantastic. It was well-written, and just barely enough over the line of realism for the uncomfortable parts of the book to be tolerable. Lee's relationship with her parents, more than with Conchita or anyone else, was painful for me. It was so colored by her youth.Her relationship with Cross, well, let's just say that it was realistic. I had a very similar relationship to that in boarding school and had to put the book down and take some deep breaths to get through it. This is not a literary masterpiece, but it is a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING","review":"i can't believe i read this whole book. it started out promisingly enough, but soon devolved into navel-gazing blather. this is a writer who loves the sound of her own voice too much. she needs to concentrate on these little things we like to call character development and story. what a huge bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom of teenagers","review":"My daughters brought me to hear a reading by Curtis Sittenfeld at our local bookstore. If anyone has an opportunity to hear her talk and read it is well worth the trip/ time. The book is well written although a bit disturbing at times. After reading the book I was glad my girls go to day school but they do share some of the same issues. I was pleased to have the chance to discuss the book with my girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a disappointment","review":"Like most of the others, I read this because of all the hype, and because the author was coming to speak at my school's bookstore. Lee, the main character, got obnoxious after the first hundred pages or so, and there were so many incidental characters that I couldn't keep track of their importance. I read the whole book, including the last half excitedly, because I thought that certainly Lee would undergo some major change that would make her see how wrong about everything she was. I was disappointed at the end that nothing occurred. I read the last page three times to see if I'd missed something, but I don't think I did. It's ok, but the static character and the racism and stereotypes means I won't be recommending this book to anyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book captures the teenage years and prep school life.","review":"I am a teacher at a prep school, and I thought that this book captured both the teenage years and prep school life as well as any book I have read. It was a well written, enjoyable read, and one that rang true with authenticity all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine writing but not the finest ever","review":"I stayed up all night reading this book, but not because it was so wonderful I couldn't put it down. Rather, I kept waiting for the wonderfulness I'd heard about from critics to show up.This is not to say I didn't enjoy the book. The author's portrayal of the angsty loner teen was spot on, and I recognized myself and others I knew in the characters. The sex-not-love relationship was particularly poignant. This is an above average book, and I thought about it a long time after reading it.But some of the passages entering Lee's thought process were overwrought, overlong and overcomplicated, and I think the book could've been a good 50 to 100 pages shorter. By the last fourth of the book, I was ready to see some development and change in Lee that never came.I still recommend anyone read this book, but don't go in expecting the greatest novel of our time, like many of the critics make it sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prep: A Stereotype of Minorities","review":"Sittenfeld used EVERY racial stereotyped character she could create: the black girl who was caught stealing, then thrown out of school; the \\"cool\\" black guy whose only mentioned accomplishment is playing--you guessed it--basketball; the Asian girl who speaks broken English, and stentches up the dorm room with exotic Asian foods; the Latino girl who is pretty but not intimidating to the main character because the latino girl is not white? It's relentless, and highly offensive to those of us who know real prep schools where the \\"minority\\" students are not living stereotypes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally get it","review":"Being 19 years old, and just graduating high school a year earlier than I read this book, I feel as if a part of Lee lived in me. All those awkward moments with her high school crush, whom she thought didn't even notice her. Not being the wealthiest most popular girl in school. The extra poundage she had compared to most skinny girls. I went through it all.I enjoyed this book immensely, and recommend it to anyone who went through the tough time of adolescents. Which would be EVERYONE. I don't think there is one person who can't just familiarize themself with at least one character trait Lee possesses.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the book ended, but not the way I wanted it to. For some reason I wanted something astonishing to happen to Lee. I mean come on it is a fiction novel. Things worked out the way they would in real life, I guess I wanted some fairy-tale ending for Lee. Oh well, now on to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Read","review":"While Sittenfeld is a commendable author whose writing is heartfelt and convincing, her protagonist Lee Fiora is so frustratingly pathetic and misguided that it is a difficult read. Fiora is a character that at first you sympathize with because she is an awkward outsider, but then you grow to hate Fiora because she learns nothing from her past experiences and continues to make that same mistakes over and over again. Her repeated gaffes make you cringe throughout the book, and at the end you are thankful to be rid of Fiora and her annoyingly analytical and aggravating ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless, with 1-dimensional characters...","review":"I'll admit right here that I couldn't even get through the book. I simply couldn't deal with Lee's snobbishness and isolation. The entire book appeared to be an inner-monologue of angst. It was painful to see Lee brush off friendly overtures again and again, and then to blame those who made them for being too stand-offish.I don't know if Grotton has changed any since the author went there; as a (boarding) prep school student on half-scholarship myself, I can say that I've never encountered the level of self-absorbed angst Lee exhibits through all four years. A girl who doesn't manage to change in four years should never have won that scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like time traveling to high school","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld does an amazing job of getting inside a teenager's head. All the musings, anxieties and personal declarations are forever swirling in there. Our heroine is charmingly contemplative and the story is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"'I Am Charlotte Simmons' redux","review":"Perhaps I would have liked this book if I hadn't read \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" so recently (last year). I didn't much care for \\"Simmons,\\" but I pushed through it, determined to finish. 50 pages into \\"Prep\\" I felt like I was reading \\"Simmons\\" part 2 and couldn't go on. It is very similar in tone and writing style as well as plot. If you loved \\"Simmons\\" then you'll probably love \\"Prep,\\" too. If you didn't care for the former, however, I suggest skipping the later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos to Sittenfeld","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Prep. For awhile, I kept waiting for something really big to happen...a cataclysmic event. But then I realized the cataclysmic event was being a teenager. I'm 52 yrs. old, and Sittenfeld enabled me to relive my teen years as if it were yesterday. Thank you for that, Curtis. Also, I give kudos to the author for realizing her book is nothing like Catcher in the Rye which I have read many times and as an English teacher have taught for many years. Two completely different stories; neither negates the other. Lastly, I recommend Prep to any 8th grade female and older. For adults it's a trip to the past...for a teen it could be the present or the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The NY Times was wrong","review":"As you've already read, Lee Fiora was entirely unlikable with zero redeeming qualities. I'm completely alright with hating the protagonist, (Bella from Twilight anyone? Ugh.) But Lee is just too much. I can't say anything interesting happened to herin the 4 years, because she was too boring and afraid to interact with anyone.The other characters were so poorly developed that the only way you could keep track of them was because they had stupid names like \\"Cross\\" \\"Aspeth\\" \\"Horton\\" \\"Darden\\" \\"Dede\\"It makes you wonder about the author...All that education, and still uses ignorant stereotypes and sophmoric writing. No thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many books, so little time","review":"Sorry to say I got only about 100 pages into this book before I abandoned it. I really wanted to like it because the premise was intriguing --- ordinary girl from Indiana gets scholarship to an elite boarding school on the East Coast, but unfortunately the characters never sprang to life. The writing itself was pretty good, but I had to keep reminding myself that this was supposed to be about kids in high-school, not college, since the characters spoke and acted more like 18 than 14. This had bothered me all the way through, but when the main character Lee said something about someone \\"sporting a mustache\\", I gave up. So many books, so little time."},{"rating":"1","title":"indescribable","review":"The writing in this book is atrocious, proving again that publishers will print anything they think they can promote. Also there appears to be no plot. And it is repetitive in the extreme, extreme, extreme, and so forth. I relied on a NYT review. Never again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute book","review":"I loved Prep. One thing that I adored about the book was how well i got to know the main character, Lee. The book takes you through all four years of her College Prepatory Catholic High School experience. It starts off slow, but halfway through you'll never want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I consider myself to be good with details and having a pretty good memory. Prep, however, fell into the oblivion of my mind. It was so utterly forgettable that the only things I can remember are: a bording school, a girl named Lee, and the fact that it was even worse than I Am Charlotte Simmons. The characters are trite and typically high school, the plot is insignificant, and overall, the book is, as I said, utterly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh god. high school at a prep school?","review":"Not only was this book poorly written, but it also contained no character development on a character i believed to be despicable. I have heard similar comments from other friends and family who have read the book. It was possibly one of the worst books i have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Climax?","review":"This book was rather engrossing initially. The author gives good details on the characters and you can almost picture them--with the exception of the main character, Lee Fiore. Lee's physical appearance is unknown, but her personality is bland, and her character weak.I kept waiting for the story to build to a climax, but it never left the ground. It was pointless--Lee went to school, and left school.Utterly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, this is not the new \\"Catcher in the Rye\\"","review":"The review I originally saw for this book made that comparison, and based on that, I was delighted to get a copy. But what unfolded was so disappointing. It wasn't catty enough to really give a peek at life in a prep school, (or maybe I just went to a similar public HS socio/economically)? Lee Fiora is possibly the most annoying character I can recall spending time with. If I were dealing with her in person, I'd have pushed her out the door. How her relationships, particularly with the object of her devotion play out (no further details here in order not to spoil the book for others), seem highly improbable to me. Unlike another reviewer here who sited Mr. Fiora as most tolerable character, I'd have to give that accolade to Lee's roommate, Martha, for putting up with her for 3 years. It's a dilemma to me how this girl was ever accepted in this school. But I believe this author has promise, and hope she'll try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"extremely untrue. Don't expect to gain insight about boarding school from this novel. I currently attend a boarding school in CT, and find this novel to be extremely biased, untruthful, and obnoxious. All of my friends who read it hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a girl who also was once involved with the \\"priveledge\\" society...","review":"I can totally relate with the novel PREP. I use to go to a really, really expensive summer camp when I was little and the only way I went was on schloarship. I was an outsider I only had a few friends and usually just one or a kind camp counselour. It was a totally different world and the ideas of society were vastly different too. I really do love this book because I can relate to it and understand the character! I would recommend this book to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Sittenfield writes about the age old story of an outsider entering the cliquish world of affluent teenagers at a private boarding school in New England. This book follows the story of Lee, the outsider, through her 4 years at \\"Ault\\". However, Lee never grows as a person or a character; she remains shallow and immature throughout the novel. This book, like the main character, lacks depth and meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reaffirming YA read and nothing more","review":"Before starting this book, I finished Oh The Glory of It All by Sean Wilsey. I read Oh the Glory because of Curtis Sittenfeld's recommendation on NPR.Oh the Glory is probably the best thing I got out of Sittenfeld. Please read that book.Sittenfeld has a knack for putting into the words the simple things humans feel and think but don't realize they think and feel. She's not a writer devoid of observation, but Prep has no redeeming qualities.It's true that Lee Fiora is awkward and self-concious like most teens are. But who the hell wants to re-live those painfully awkward and overly self-judgemental times of their lives? Especially when there is no pay-off in sight.Prep should be in the Young Adult section and I'm not sure why it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Silly Book","review":"I had hoped to find a book that would somehow continue the serious social criticism and art of Tom Wolfe's \\"I am charlotte Simmons\\". Instead I found this superficial, politically correct fluffed up fantasy version of pseudo elite culture, equivilent to a true romance type genre...shallowly written for those who don't want to think...nothing wrong with that I have my own favorite fluff novels...but let us not pretend that this book is anything more than continuation of a superficial version of angst for those who write professional reviews. You can do as well reading a magazine, watching some tv show or the like. This is not a book for a reader looking for literature, art or challenge. Why do the professional reviewers beat the drum for this drivel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"the least likeable character i've ever read about","review":"don't waste your time with this terribly boring, pedantic and tedious book. barely anything happens and it takes 400 pages for that nothing to happen. if you want to read a good book about a young teen trying to fit in, making mistakes and learning from it, try \\"I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS\\" BY TOM WOLFE. Don't waste your time with Prep."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGGGGGGGGH!","review":"This Book was horrible! I heard really great things about it and so i figured i should read it. The main character is really boring and shallow and i didn't like her at all. And for her to allow a boy to just take over her life even though she knows he doesn't love her is simply ridiculous! I don't know i thought that this book was kind of boring and i just didn't like it that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"talented but terrible","review":"To be perfectly honest, I had expected a far better book than that of the one I read. While Ms. Sittenfeld clearly has talent, I did not enjoy her book. It was slow, even over exagerated. I, being in high school, know exactly what it's like. And no, it is NOT that bad all the time. And the character, Lee, was just poorly outlined. Especially by falling for Cross. I also hated the in depth portrayal of intimacies. For pity's sake, leave me with a somewhat purer mind than that. So, in conclusion, I did not enjoy this book, nor would I recommend it to anyone. I do not mean to insult Ms. Sittenfeld, however, I do believe that she could do better, and I wish her the best of luck. I hope this helped whoever reads this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting","review":"I REALLY didn't like this book - mainly because the main character was just not interesting enough to care about for 406 pages - it had moments, the self-reflecting moments, that made me keep reading on (and I don't like \\"not finishing\\" a book that I've started) but they were few and far between - I would not recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"completely inaccurate portrayal of prep school.

Oh, I suppose the book has one single appeal - the belt on the cover is cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"grown man writes coming of age story of young girl","review":"I read this book, beginning with relish and ending with annoyance. It felt, overall, like Curtis imagined in his head what a NE prep school might be like without ever having visited one and then imagined what it might be like to be a young woman without ever having been one of those either. His characters are distorted cariactures with no depth and no sympathetic interest. If YOU have a high school education, I suspect this book is not for you. However, if you like insipid pop-fiction, and don't mind obvious imagery and blandly overdone comic characters, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted it to be good, but it wasn't.","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it didn't live up to even mediocre standards. It plods along steadily but follows no path. I felt like I was just waiting for something to happen. A few things happen at the very end, but they just sort of come out of nowhere. The main character is really unlikeable because she is SO anti-social and socially lame, yet blames everyone else for all her problems. If she at least developed as a character and realized what a lame dweeb she is, it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich kid creates a wannabe","review":"Very disturbing. Basically a rich kid's idea of what a \\"scholarship\\" kid's inner life might be like....Sittenfeld's projections into an unlikeable wannabe.No wonder we are in trouble in this country when the privileged see \\"LCMs\\" (the lower middle class) as lying around passively waiting to be screwed.

Although I more or less enjoyed gaining that knowledge, I didn't really care about the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good! So real!","review":"Lee, the prep school protagonist, is definitely a well-rounded, realistic character. Sometimes she was so frustrating I wanted to reach into the book, grab her by the shoulders, and shake her. She's so passive, such an observer, and so frequently judgmental (and often wrong). But her thoughts about how high school boys relate and flirt, how people of different classes interact, how adolescent girls often feel, are spot-on. And the other characters in the book seem so real, as well! Everyone in the book is a complete, full person. I buy all of it; nothing pulled me out of the story and said \\"this is a book, a work of fiction.\\"I wrote more about it (and other books) at my blog: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"While in the hospital I had a choice of this book (left behind by someone) or watching The Price Is Right. I should have watched Price. The book's character (the author) is so unlikeable that I kept reading hoping there would be some resolution to her personality. Some change. Never came. She started out awful and ended up awful. I dumped the book to spare the next patient who might have the same decision to make -Price of Prep. I also decided to check out the reviews. What did interest me was the number of people who identified with the book's character. Now that is really awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable (unlistenable)","review":"Somebody recommended this book to me. I didn't realize it was a teenager book.

Lee Fiora is joyless. Her constant angst was depressing - she was on the outside because she chose to be, and lamented the fact for 406 pages. The other characters were one-dimensional, except for Martha. I would have enjoyed the book more if it had been about Martha - special and ordinary in Lee's words. Her \\"hook-up\\" with Cross Sugarman was not believable, and by that time I wondered why he would bother with someone so uninteresting, so unremarkable, so nothing. She excelled at nothing, because she made no attempt to be anything but an outsider. How could she have been so special at home? The book was awful. If I see the author's name again, I will run."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expectations, but disappointed","review":"I had heard good things about this book and it looked to be an interesting novel of teen self-discovery. The main character, however, was rarely redeemable in any situation in the book. Slavish to men, to authority, to the wills and wiles of her peers, Lee Fiora was neither complex nor very interesting. Overthinking every situation was one of her specialities, a characteristic that Ms. Sittenfeld played up so much that it became hard to endure. I think perhaps worst of all, was the fact that Lee seemed to never learn from her mistakes. Every so often, she would discuss how she would later react to a similar situation in the future and oftentimes, it was not that different from her teen self, especially situations involving men. I find this disheartening and not true to the fact that the author seemed to think Lee was actually learning something from her surroundings. It was a lesson in what a dismal, self-fulfilling prophecy life can be if you let it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book","review":"This is the perfect summer book. The characters are well developed but the plot isn't too heavy. I love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prep-are Yourself For Mind Numbing Schlock","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I thought it was long, drawn out, and not particularly well written. I slogged through it, simply because I feel guilty if I start a book and fail to finish it. It was melodramatic, a very poorly disguised autobiographical tale. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is the hype about?","review":"ok- so where are the great parts of this book? I didn't read any.. I met this author at a book signing.. she seemed to be way too over-excited to talk about \\"her\\" life. Her voice was high pitched and she sounds like a child trapped in a lesbo body. This story was just dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prep: A bore","review":"The characters are dull and one-dimensional. The story is bland and as the parent of a child who attends a prep school down the road from the one Ms. Sittenfeld teaches at, I'd say she got the details and the point of view all wrong. There's a lot to be said (both good and bad) about the kids who go to these types of schools (and the parents who send their kids there.) Unfortunately, Ms. Sittenfeld's weak prose doesn't begin to represent pathos of this particular slice of society."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time!!","review":"I had high hopes for this book. Seemed like it would be a good story yet the author never fully develops Lee. You never really get a clear understanding of who she was before she went to Ault-that makes it very difficult to understand why she is so emotionally crippled during her time there. I ended up getting so bored with the entire book - your empathy for Lee quickly fades once you realize how lethargic and unmotivated she is.

MANY OF MY FRIENDS FEEL THE SAME WAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing stereotypes","review":"I found the main character, Lee, to be boring and much too concerned with what everyone she encountered thought or did. However, what turned me off the most were the archaic stereotypes all through the book. I can't help but think that the author herself is a very prejudiced person and used Lee as her spokesperson.I was offended by the fact that (naturally) it was the inner-city black girl who stole from the dorm rooms. How about the Hispanic girls who (of course) wore too much makeup and loud clothing? Several comments the main character made about Jews also seemed to come out of left field and were completely offensive.You can use the excuse that it was just the \\"character\\" talking but it really made me dislike her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This Book","review":"This book has got to be one of the worst I've ever read. The main character Lee is from a middle class family and is attending a boarding school where all of her peers are wealthy. Lee overthinks EVERYTHING and it gets annoying really fast, she can't do anything for herself and you'll be screaming at the book telling her what to do. She's so self-involved and if the book were funny it would be okay but it seems as if the book is supposed to be serious. I got tricked by an adorable cover and a cute story but the author just didn't bring this story to life for me. For God sakes you don't even know what year it takes place but you know everything about every person attending Lee's school, Ault, their first and last names, what their parents do, how many siblings, these are all people Lee has never even talked to. Boring book and really hard to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book...easy read...recommended","review":"This book is NOT legendary but it is a well written, interesting, decent book. It kept moving, I kept reading. It is an easy read and doesn't take much thought to read it. A good story line, interesting characters and a great writing style make it a good book. I recommend it. It reads a lot like \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" by Tom Wolfe(also a good book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get what all the hype is about","review":"I was very dissappointed with this book. Very slow going. While reading I kept thinking that this book would appeal to my 15 year old daughter. However, the graphic sex in the last chapter changed my mind about that. Not sure what type of reader she was looking to attract. The subject matter was too juevenile to keep my interest piqued. If she left out the last chapter this book would certainly be shelved in the Young Adult section. A real dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this really what teenage life is about?","review":"I think that after reading this book and many other so called teenage life books, i relized that this is not really what life is for me. yes there are a few incidents when i want a boy friend, or i kiss a guy, but it is not always the most interesting thing to read over and over again in every \\"teen\\" book. Prep is kind of like that. Highschools are not all perfect, they have their flaws to them. Like crime or racists. Every teen book so far has been about the better off people, how about writing one about some people on the streets or the hood. They have stories too. they aren't just people reading stories, they probably want to read one that relates to them. Again if you want another pathetic teen book, read prep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Relateabel","review":"As a former student at a pseudo-prep school, I was able to relate to Lee Fiora. While my school wasn't a boarding school, it was a NYC private school made up of mostly affluent kids who were headed to Ivy League Schools. Like Lee, I, was a middle class, somewhat mediocre student of non-desctip popularity in that environment. There were so many anecdotes in this book that I found so relateable, that I have to commend the author for being so right on. However, much of it was a bit extreme - particularly Lee's extreme lack of self esteem (despite it all, I did enjoy high school - i can't imagine I would have stuck with an experience as miserable as Lee's).While overall accurate and enjoyable, there were times when it dragged a bit. It also got a little depressing, I could have handled a few positive story lines. But, overall, an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was terrible. Just because this book is set at a boarding school does not put it into the ranks of J.D. Salinger and Knowles as the cover eludes. The main character is annoying and I found my self waiting for action to begin. No intelligent internal dialogue. This book does not even begin to touch issues such as those in Catcher or A Separate Peace. I found myself quitting it when I was 3/4 of the way through wondering when the main character would get a self-esteem so I wouldn't have to read descriptions of sexual acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfish Brat Boards and Bores","review":"Lee, the narrator and protagonist of Prep, is one of the most unlikeable main characters that I've encountered. Her tedious self-consciousness gets old by the time she's a sophomore. The endless introspection and judgments of others seem to be way beyond what a teenager would actually think or be able to articulate. The author's adult perspective is too apparent in many of Lee's riffs on her classmates, teachers, parents, etc.The story is absorbing enough; the settings seem authentic. It makes for a decent read, but Lee comes off as a selfish, self-absorbed and ungrateful snob-in-reverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a slush-filled New England Winter","review":"This novel -- promoted as a \\"coming-of-age\\" story of a midwestern girl in an east coast boarding school -- could have been fabulous. It's obvious that the author can write, and she has some great insights into human nature of the teenage kind. But the overall storyline was disjointed, the main character wishy-washy and unappealing, and the sex gratuitous. Too much started to go on while nothing of any real substance happened. Lots of observations about the school and students, but the main character, Lee, was somehow unable to turn that same insight to herself. I found her unbelievable, and, frankly, unlikeable. A dull read -- like slogging through a slush-filled New England February."},{"rating":"2","title":"I re-read this one","review":"I read this novel over and over again. I know it's not the best thing out there but for me it really resonates. I do think the belt on the cover makes it look dated. They should not have done that. I think this book is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sittenfeld is a Genius","review":"Prep was the first book I read by the author and was immediately taken with her writing. The thoughts of her characters, their actions..so realistic. This book is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished for more","review":"The book is easy to read and flows well but there isn't a lot of substance to keep you interested. The author covers four years of high school but relates little of what the main character actually does in school or how she changes and evolves. More action and more development of the other characters would help pull the reader in more and make a more interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this book... I REALLY did...","review":"Maybe I was too close to the story and setting of this book (I too was the outsider middle class girl who attended a rich girl school)... but I did not find anything likeable about the protagonist of this story, Lee Fiora, and at the end of the book I felt as if nothing had changed. Is it even possible to leave high school the exact way you enter?As the novel progressed and she moved through her high school years I kept waiting for her to grow up, come into her own, do SOMETHING besides mope through every day as an uninteresting, unenthused brat. I kept trying to relate to her on some level-- to have a reason to like her, have sympathy for her, ANYTHING! But it just never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I didn't know what to expect","review":"But I wasn't expecting this. Prep was a little too creepy for me - creepy being the only word I can think of. Lee was so unlikeable I almost wished they'd kick her out of school so I could stop reading. But I did finish the book, it just wasn't something I'd want to read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREPare to be disappointed","review":"Although I generally find this difficult to do, I could not finish this book. Although it reads fairly well, the content is peppered with page after page of Lee being insecure/uncomfortable/self-loathing/etc. We get the point. Go on. Lacks any real substance other than the internal conversations Lee has with herself, beating herself up, an on.If you are going to read this book, you might think it's ok for the first 60-70 pages then it dawns on you that it doesn't get better. There's no evolution. I made it to about page 160, spending around 100 pages oscillating between \\"sticking it out\\" or \\"waste no more time\\". Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE COVER!","review":"I first picked up this book because of all the rave reviews and the enticing cover, but I was sorely disappointed when I discovered that the novel was nothing more than the annoying whining of a self-absorbed, low self-esteemed loser.The protagonist's lack of both personality and confidence is so disturbing and frustrating, that I could not even finish the second half of the book. Please know that I never stop reading a book smack in the middle.Not only is the main character unengaging, but the other characters simply fly in and out of her life. I don't believe I could identify any form of character or plot development. I personally don't believe it was well-written either.I didn't go to prep school, but I really don't think that has much to do with anything. I am not a wizard that plays Quidditch, and I still loved Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boreing","review":"She is over analyzing everything she sees thinks or does, And too much detail makes the story boring.

I found this character to be so incredibly frustrating and pathetic. Maybe it was because I could not relate to what she was going through - but is it really true that all those who feel like outsiders are so completely passive about improving their experiences? Lee was SO ANNOYING! I also thought that the book REALLY rambled at times and I found these parts to be rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What book were the others reading?","review":"This book had the potential to be so so so much more than it was. An Indiana teen-age girl on scholarship at an elite New England prep school. It received wonderful reviews and the write ups I read in magazines had me wanting to read it. And after I finished it, all I could ask was, \\"What book were they all reading?\\"This main character is boring, mindless, and self-involved. She's a brat, to put it mildly. And none of the other characters were developed enough throughout the course of the book to make me give it a better rating. This story line could have been so much better, but because Lee herself is nothing, so was the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Surprise!!!!

I expected in a way I might be able to relate to this girls situation. I am an outsider at a jewish prep day school, and in no way am I able to identify myself into the groups of society. I didn't enjoy reading about this girls angst, when she was the one who needed to step up herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"suckage","review":"ok so.....when i first started reading this book, i couldnt put it down. but i soon tired of lee and all her insecurities. also, the last chapter was rather explicit and i felt totally unprepared for it. there was no indication anywhere that that was coming up, and i found all the details rather disturbing. the author could have simply said \\"we fooled around\\" or \\"we slept together\\" but she went into great detail describing sex acts. it wasnt a very good book overall and i think i should have chosen something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Contains information caregivers need to know\\"","review":"\\"HOME CARE PROVIDERS may be interested in a new publication The Comfort of Home: An Illustrated Step-by-Step Guide for Caregivers written by Maria M.

It offers an unusual, more casual view of the Playmates as they prepare to appear in a fashion show. They are friends with each other; play jokes and tease; and are shown in a much more natural setting than is used in most other Playboy videos. It is a behind-the-scenes setting with candid scenes rather than a scripted production. If you ever wondered what Playmates are like in real life, this is a good place to get an idea.

He plays with these constantly. Not only does he build things from the book that's included but he comes up with many unique designs on his own.The overall quality of the set is great. Some of the longer pieces may snap in two if they aren't undone by holding them close enough to the connected area. The storage tub has ample room to allow for adding more Knex to the set.

When I received them one of the lids where missing and I contacted Amazon and Amazon promptly replaced it. Amazon is awesome! The canisters on the other hand are poor copies manufactured in China. The colors are off a bit and there are defects in the glaze. The bottoms are ruff on my granite countertop and the lids don't fit correctly. I will never order another piece of Villeroy & Bosh online, or anything manufactured in China; I will wait to purchase Villeroy & Bosh products until my next trip to Europe where they take pride in their workmanship. !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for Natalie Merchant fans.","review":"This video will certainly please diehard Natalie Merchant fans, but probably won't convert any casual fans. The video was shot during Natalie's series of shows on Broadway last June and contains a mix of originals and covers. Highlights include Natalie's beautiful performance of Katell Keineg's \\"The Gulf of Araby,\\" and a spontaneous rendition of \\"Senor Don Gato,\\" which perfectly captures the spirit of a Natalie Merchant concert. Also included are a cover of David Bowie's \\"Space Oddity,\\" an extended version of the 10,000 Maniacs hit \\"These Are Days,\\" and several songs from her Tigerlily album. The most disappointing thing about the video is the omission of some of Natalie's most outstanding songs, such as \\"My Skin\\" and \\"Seven Years.\\" Maybe we will have to wait for Natalie Merchant Live in Concert--Volume 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed Natalie fan","review":"The video and audio quality of this production was very poor compared to other DVD music videos I've seen. It seemed like a poor VHS production rather than DVD! A great talent deserves a better quality production than this. Also, extra footage was very disappointing. Pre and post concert interviews were fan comments outside of the concert hall and a brief video of Natalie signing autographs. No in depth interview with Natalie Merchant or other interesting back stage video. Other DVD Music Concerts I've seen offer much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was a a very big fan of 10,000 Maniacs when Natalie was the lead singer and because of that I purchased Natalie's debut solo lp. It was very good. \\"Ophelia\\" IMO was not as good. Too many slow and dreary songs. I found many of the songs on the DVD boring and it wasn't helped by the sub-par audio recording. I never liked the song \\"Ophelia\\" and found it to be a poor choice for the opening song. Her version of \\"Wonder\\" was, you guessed it, boring. There were definitely better songs she could have included, live, such as \\"Life is Sweet\\" instead of a partial recording of it. Also, what about the single \\"Kind and Generous\\". The CD of the concert with different song selections was much better and not boring. I probably am more of a fan of 10,000 Maniacs than Natalie's solo CD's. The so-called documentary (if you can call it that) was mis-leading as it was less than 5 minutes and not really a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the Maniacs","review":"I'm a big Natalie fan, but not a fanatic. The DVD didn't do much for me. i bought it after listening to the Live CD, but was disappointed that the playlist didn't include anything more of substance. The documentry consisted of all of 5 minutes of people in line for the show. Life is sweet was audio only, Waterbound, Senor don gato were awful, and anyone who was a 10000 manics fan would not enjoy her drawn out these are days.Stick with the **** MTV Unplugged - 10k maniacs video...a far better value.The whole setlist:List is sweet(partial), Opheilia, wonder, san andres fault, beloved wife, senor don gato, space oddity, carnival, break your heart, these are days, gulf of araby, waterbound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"Just bought the DVD yesterday. Audio is very good, but visuals are bleak. Totally agree with the previous reviewer - this concert would benefit greatly if 2-3 songs were added. Had a funny feeling listening to the Russian phrases in Ophelia - they were intended as the World Music-style weird-language gibberish but I understood. All these interviews before the concert are a bit embarassing. You can not help noticing these people are not attractive physically and must be lonely and this must be the source of their DEEP ATTACHMENT to Ms.Merchant art. It's sad. Am I right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid the live DVD, buy the studio recordings","review":"I was very disappointed in this DVD, so much so that I returned it. The audio quality is poor, with enough audible distortion that I found it unlistenable, and I am not an audiophile, just a mainstream consumer. The video quality is marginal, about on par with a second-generation VHS copy. The direction is poor, with many shots of the back of musicians' heads. The extras, interviews, etc. are either brief or non-existent. Compare this DVD with Diana Krall: Live in Paris in terms of audio/video quality, direction, extras, etc., and they are as night and day. I recommend avoiding this DVD and enjoying Natalie's studio recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful, hypnotic, transient - an essential music DVD","review":"A new fan of Miss Merchant and her spellbinding voice, I find myself putting the \\"Natalie Merchant Live in Concert\\" disc in my player more than any other concert in my extensive music DVD collection.

There is a lot of fast-paced dialogue and often bickering going on in his stories. These characters were not likeable. In fact, they were both pretty rude people. This business of Richard Dreyfuss coming home one day after he had gotten the black eye, suddenly being madly in love with Marsha Mason was totally unbelievable crap.

Both have put paid to such questions as \\"if there were Communists in the State Department.\\" Arthur Herman's book \\"Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator\\" --using the revelations and documents from the former Soviet Union-- clarified these issues once and for all. McCarthy may have been an eccentric demogogue and an alcoholic (so what makes him different from many other politicians?) but history shows that he got it essentially right. Diehard communists, progressive communist sympathizers and all those misguided souls that believed and still believe that it was a \\"noble\\" cause-- will never forgive him for getting it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the Facts","review":"Richard Rovere should consider himself a comedian.

I am a murder mystery fan, and I love Maine and old houses so I figured this book couldn't miss for some light summer reading. I was wrong. The plot is improbable and the pace is slow; the books lumbers along. Characters are undeveloped, and, as another reviewer said, not particularly likeable--even the main character.

However in my case I bought the Bedsaver to fit on a Husky 16K hitch and the bolt patterns on the Bedsaver do not match holes on the hitch and it could not be installed. The advertising is written to imply that the hitch will fit a Husky 16K or 16K slider and that may be the problem. There needs to be a clearer understanding of just what the Bedsaver will match. It also adds about 35 lbs to the weight of the hitch so add in to your GRWW.

There were sections covering what to look for in the foal several days following the birth so that if the foal was in trouble very little time would be wasted in calling the vet.

At the last minute, when I am hurrying to get all my dishes finished at the same time, I might put forget to add hot liquid to flour or cornstarch, for thickening, and instead add the dry ingredient directly to the gravy or sauce. Then I end up with a lumpy mess unless I have a strainer (or cheesecloth) on hand. This OXO strainer is 6 inches across, so it is large enough to strain a pan of gravy without overflowing. The mesh is a fine gauge, so the gravy will end up smooth. This strainer also works well for removing seeds and lumps from fruit sauces, even after pureeing them in a food mill, or electric mini-prep or blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting","review":"When I first saw this video on youtube [...] I thought that learning about Vedic mathematics would promote a further interest in geometry.

We traveled with it recently and the only issue we had with it wasn't product related. One issue we had was that the hotel didn't have an appropriate chair to secure it to. There are straps going both directions to put it on the chair, so there needs to be a gap to run the strap through the back of the chair. We are currently using it at home at our table and allowing our toddler to choose between sitting in it or the high chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"this product is a joke","review":"First of all, I thought it was going to be a great asset to have on the go for our daughter, but it proved to be rather ineffective for a toddler and for travel.

Do not see a point to have this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect travel chair","review":"I almost didn't buy this chair because the price was so good I thought there must be something wrong with it. I'm so glad I purchased this over a bulky plastic booster seat. Even the fabric \\"my little seat\\" only works over specific types of chairs. The Regalo portable chair is lightweight, and folds up small so it hardly takes up any room in a suitcase. It's also great for the beach, the park, and at home. It comes with a fabric cover and is able to strap securely to a chair to hold it in place. You can also buckle up your child in if you have a wiggle worm like me. I bought it for our 15 month old who's now 2 and we still use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel chair.","review":"This chari is VERY convenient for carrying around. It fold and is light weight. Also, it ties securely to every seat we have used.

Putting a towel under our daughter has helped prop her up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and Portable","review":"I love this chair. It is easy to carry and take with you to restaurants and other places that your child needs a little extra height. It makes them feel like a big kid instead of a baby at the table.

I even use it at home when we needed an extra seat for a visiting child or when we to Grandma's house.It folds up easily and wipes off too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Chair, but doesn't hold up","review":"I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant. I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat, watch TV, or drink his sippy cup. This chair was the perfect height, design, and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky. The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip. The fault is in a joint. I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed. But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two. That joint is really weak. Too bad!

(They are not heavy kids, they weight about 20 pounds)The seat has a seat cover secured by a Velcro, which is a wonderful idea. The only problem is that this Velcro is stronger than the sewing or the fabric itself.

The only problem I would have is probably not as much with the chair as with my table. If you have a trim on your table like I do then this chair doesn't work very well. There is no room for their little legs to go under the table. Other than that the chair is great. I will use it with my fold out table when the kids are here and alone as just a little chair for them to sit in. It seems well made and I like that you can remove the seat to wash it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechanical failure","review":"I normally love OXO products. Amongst other things, I own an OXO can opener, a few OXO knives, an OXO ladle, a plastic OXO spoon.The lever on this ice cream scoop broke after only two months (on its third use). We sent it back to the company several months ago, but have not heard any response.Also, it's a particularly lightweight scoop, so if your ice cream is as frozen as that from the average New York Deli, you'd be better off finding a heavier one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to clean","review":"This ice cream scoop was okay at getting the ice cream out with the lever, but like other reviews said, it was hit and miss. The worst part about this scoop was that it wouldn't come clean in our dishwasher. The lever would trap food and other debris on the bottom lip of the scoop (on the edge of the hole at the bottom of the scoop). We tried rinsing the scoop well before putting it in the dishwasher but that wasn't successful either. The only solution we were able to come up with was wrapping a rubber band around the level to hold it open while being washed. Definitely didn't want to do that every time we had ice cream so we are buying a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, works better with a bit of water","review":"My father worked as a \\"soda jerk\\" when he was in high school and he taught me the trick of dipping the scooper in a glass of water so that the ice scoops fall out more easily.I find this one works well but after the first scoop, the other ones tend to stick and the the little push from the lever isn't enough to get the ice cream free.It's comfortable, easy to use, and makes nicely shaped scoops. If you were looking to buy it just because of the lever you might be able to get do with a glass of water when you scoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scoop","review":"Strong with a sharp edge to get into the ice cream.

This scoop simply pushed out the ice cream without causing wrist pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Handle, So-So Scoop","review":"I love the handle as it gives you something to really apply some pressure to when the ice cream is hard. The bad news is that the scoop part doesn't eject the ice cream very well. I usually end up using another spoon to get it out of the scoop. The ejector just doesn't move far enough to be effective. I'm not used to being disappointed from an Oxo product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent design, and at a great price","review":"Oh, how I LOVE this ice cream scooper!! It's ergonomically designed to give you all the strength you need to scoop out any type of ice cream, made easier by it's non-slip rubber handle and sturdy steel construction. I really like the thumb release. Just one press, and whatever is in there pops right out!! If your looking for an ice cream scooper that gives you more bang for your buck, this OXO Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scooper will give you that ... and then some!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lever does NOT routinely eject the ice cream","review":"If ever I was tempted to believe (which is surely true!) that companies hire people to post rave reviews, this is probably my best example for suspicion. I mean, people buy this scoop because of the handy-looking ejection lever--so if it doesn't work, why the rave reviews? You've just got to question the one(s) that essentially sound like perfect commercial copy.As another reviewer also said, the ice cream does NOT routinely eject using the cute little ejection lever. You still have to use a spoon to scrape out the scoop of ice cream that won't eject. I had 7 dinner guests last night (the day I bought this scoop), and I needed a scoop of ice cream on 7 dessert dishes. Only twice did the ice cream fall free of the scoop by using the lever. The other 5 times, I had to use a spoon to help it along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After buying Mrs Crowe's Blue Waltz and Guitar for Mortals, I was hooked...was.

I do. Perhaps I am not as musically sophisticated as some of their fans, but their latest has improved on all of the elements that I have always appreciated about their music: catchy melodies, lovely harmonies, and beautiful songs full of the wonder of love and life. I listen to different music for different reasons. I listen to Prefab Sprout to be reminded of how good it is to be alive and in love. Andromeda Heights did not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs, so-so production","review":"I think most of the songwriting on this album is on par with their (or really his) earlier albums. The production is rather glossy in a From Langley Park kind of way and that is alright with me. The real problem is that most instruments (perhaps even all) comes from samplers and such in Paddy's home studio. You can here when guitars, strings and drums are programmed rather than played and I feel that the album would had been a lot better if recorded with musicians. If you don't listen too close to the sounds, it's still very good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I agree with my fellow Glass City Sprouts fan. If Paddy McAloon set out to make an album full of simple melodies and lyrics, he succeeded. I don't, however, listen to Prefab Sprout to hear such music. This album, front to back was a profound disappointment, even compared with the usual pop drivel out there. Compared with earlier Sprouts efforts, it was a tragic disappointment. There is very little musical or lyrical depth and substance on this record. It is simply uninteresting.Don't waste your money. If you haven't heard any albums from the band, check out Two Wheels Good, Swoon and Jordan. If you have, be extremely wary before buying Andromeda, and find a record shop that will let you listen to it before purchasing. On a positive note, I look forward to seeing what follows Andromeda. I'm confident that Paddy has some more platinum in the vault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after such a long wait","review":"There is a thin line between sensibility and downright cheesiness. While I still admire Paddy McAloon, I have to say that he went overboard on this one. Songs such as \\"The Fifth Horseman\\" exemplify the Sprouts' sometimes risible music in this album. You can still get a glimpse of this very fine band's genius in other songs such as \\"Weightless\\", \\"Andromeda Heights\\", and \\"Electric Guitars\\". However, I have listened to this album for several months hoping that it would grow on me to no avail. In case you're new to the Sprouts, try \\"Swoon\\". It is one of the best pop albums ever made. It will challenge you at first with its musical and lyrical whim, but it will definitely grow on you. Also, \\"Two Wheels Good\\" is an absolute classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment after 6 years and 2 masterpieces.","review":"Paddy McAloon and Prefab Sprout had 6 years and enough brilliance to create some of the best alternative music of all time in the 80s, it is such a disappointment that he and the band has fallen into such simple melodies and melodramatic topics.

The cover over the blade is supposed to keep the peelings from flying up, and it does that. But instead, they get caught under the cover and slow down the works. It's broad and obscures your view of the blade. I'm a fast peeler -- thanks to all of those potato peeling contests my mother used to have her children do -- and I did not like getting slowed down because I couldn't see exactly where the blade was going, or getting peelings caught under the blade cover. In addition, the sharp end for gouging out potato eyes is kind of rounded. On my old peeler it's pointed, and works much better. I'll keep looking for the older style, so I can get my peeling done faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it","review":"I have been buying OXO peelers for years.

Afterwards you get a hum-drum performance with a rather mediocre orchestra, tiny sound and not much of a concept. But what is really annoying about this disc?

At least one sketch (Discussion Show) was reprised from \\"At Last the 1948 Show,\\" which Cleese, Chapman and Brooke-Taylor had done (with Marty Feldman) the year before.As a glimpse of the Pythons just before they became Pythons, it is moderately interesting. As a piece of entertainment, it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super - but don't fall off your chairs watching it","review":"British comedy is always appreciated by non-Americans. And this is one of the best!While watching it, I almost fell off my chair from continuous laughing. Stories are very cleverly done, and most people can relate to them. For e.g., there is one episode where John Cleese was irritating his date on purpose, by asking her silly questions constantly, and suggesting that she hated everything about the date; the irritating efforts finally drove her mad, and after she left angrily, John Cleese said, \\"thank goodness, I thought she'd never leave\\".And after watching it, I played one of the tricks on a friend of mine, and it works!!!!

However, i was quite disappointed to find that the blade barely bent under pressure from my hand and was not nearly flexible enough to gently slide under the first piece of pie. RSVP makes a much better flexible pie server."},{"rating":"1","title":"utencil useless","review":"I've always found the \\"Pie Server\\" utensil useless, especially if you don't have room for kitchen cabinets to store all the utensils. You can get by just by using a fork and a regular butter knife or a turner, a flipper or spatula.That is what I tend to use. You do have a higher Pie drop ratio with a fork and a butter knife or spatula but it won't matter unless you're in a social setting where a \\"Pie Server\\" utensil is deemed absolutely necessary. And then, you'll probably be eating caviar with snob Pie anyways. Sometimes I even use my dirty hand or just use a dirty spoon to eat Pie out of the tin.Now, I just use the Oxo SteeL Pie Server as a Masonry trowel for spreading mortar on bricks or concrete blocks with a technique called \\"buttering\\". It isn't \\"heavy duty\\" but for touch up jobs, it's acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pie server","review":"Very functional. The item is durable enough to use for all food serving purposes -- cakes, pies, even lasagna, etc. However, the wedge itself is fairly sizeable so small(er) slices may be more difficult to dole out of cakes/pies/etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough, sturdy pie server","review":"Love this - just what I was looking for. It cuts well (the edges are serrated), and it has the weight & rigidity you want when dishing out a slice of pie.

Along the way the plot goes downhill after a semi-gripping opening assassination, the action becomes ridiculous, and the relationship between Bel and the hit man that starts out creepy becomes predictable and annoying. Rankin's writing equals the triteness of his story.Rankin's Rebus series is mostly excellent, but this book is garbage compared to those novels. Did Rankin feel like he wanted to try writing something different, something edgy? Whatever the reason, this books is a failure. I only finished reading it so I can reach 100 books read this year (2011) as December ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent starting place","review":"I found the style and content to be very easy to follow.

Published by Time-Life books in the 1960s, this series portrays the many aspects of the natural world. Though obviously dated (it was written before the coining of the term plate tectonics), The Earth is still a good, basic introduction to geology. Topics covered include the Earth in space, internal structure of the Earth, the atmosphere, earthquakes, erosion, fossils, types of rocks, geologic history, and the future of the Earth. The book also describes theories which attempt to explain natural climate change. I did like this book, but at times I felt as if I was reading one of my geology textbooks from college. Nevertheless, The Earth is an ideal book for one who desires a basic introduction to the many facets of our fascinating planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"As a clinical social worker with institute training and who suprvises extensively beginning therapits, this book was a major disappointment.

Painter 1.01 is not compatible with OSX. In contrast to customer reviews, Photoshop Elements 2.0 has NEVER been bundled with this model. If you want the more current software Wacom offers with the 6X8 tablet (which DOES include Photoshop Elements 2.0 and a newer version of Painter, which is OSX compatible) then buy the newer model (XD68USBPLAT). It is gray. I was told by a Wacom rep that the only difference between the two tablets is the color. The tablet itself seems to be a great product.

On a few more listens, I found a little bit to like, but not much. The songs all pretty much sound the same, and only a couple have some interesting things going on (Shreds of Sanity, Profane Creation). Basically, death metal, and hardly memorable. The guy sings in a hoarse monotone the whole way through and the drumming is by the numbers. There are pretty pictures of cybernetic penis-guns in the booklet, but other than that... well, lets just say that I don't plan on keeping this one in my stereo in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"the 4th crusade's twin","review":"i love bolt thrower. when you hear them for the first time, they might sound like a boring, run-of-the-mill death band, but at further inspection you'll find that they sound like no one but bolt thrower. it might seem boring, because these days death metal has become much more ferocious and brutal than it was 11 years ago when bolt was in their prime. their style is disciplined, sustained, and full bodied. the solos are a little insane, but the motion of the songs are forceful and deliberate. \\"warmaster\\" is not as raw as \\"realm of chaos\\" but it is second only to their masterpiece \\"the 4th crusade\\" which warmaster emulates on a song to song basis. and i see nothing wrong with that... stay true to your roots and your fans will love you for it. this is great, early 90's death metal. i recommend buying warmaster first, just so you will be in complete awe when you buy the 4th crusade and hear it's beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music to kill your parents to","review":"seriously.my favorite bolt thrower album, or possibly metal album of all time. so grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.cookie monster'd be jealous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any old thrash/speed/death metal collection","review":"CD includes one additional track not originally on the cassette release.

Natalie Wood was sweet and almost incredibly beautiful, but I never liked Warren Beatty--he wasn't worth it, Honey!This movie made me sad and angry--I would much more recommend something with a happy ending and better love chemistry between the players--like Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen (hubba, hubba!) in \\"Love with the Proper Stranger.\\" McQueen turns out to be a gentleman (a REAL man!), not the cad Beatty is!If you don't have enough to cry about in your own life, rent this movie, but don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC LOVE STORY!!!!!","review":"WHAT A MOVIE.

Kazan manages to bring yet another masterpiece to the silver screen. a potentially great romance turns tragic due to the constant meddling of legalistic parents. many lessons are learned from this classic tale of tragic love. perhaps the most valuable is by the lovers themselves. that lesson is 'unrestrained sexual urges can lead to irreconcilable damage and ultimately destroy all parties concerned'. don't miss this one!!! a true classic.as for the DVD, artifacts are present throughout but overall fairly good transfer. sound is fine. no real special features. worth adding to your DVD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever","review":"Forever etched in time is this William Inge tale of lost love and unfullfilled footnotes of the past.Its almost surreal to see Natalie Wood running across that dam.

Must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kazan falters","review":"Natalie Wood is a fresh, young and attractive actress who is reasonably effective in the lead role, but the film left me dissatisfied on several counts. First, it does not convey anything of the mentality of the American mid-west in the 1920s, when it is set. You can buy the wardrobe and the old cars; that's not enough. This film was made in the 1960s and reeks of the 60s. Secondly, the story is paper thin: girl and boy, in love at school, cannot sexually consummate the relationship because of family and social mores; girl goes off her head and boy marries someone else. It is neither splendid nor green -- but worn and arid. The story meanders through its telling; a key character -- Bud's sister -- brings it to life briefly, then she suddenly disappears out of the plot, as aimlessly as she entered. Elia Kazan has made some great films, with well-focused ideas. Not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken's Op","review":"The 1961 film, Splendor in the Grass, stars Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty has a running time of 134 minutes. Elia Kazan directed this Warner Studios film portraying high school sweethearts frustrated with kissing and heavy petting while struggling with efforts to refrain from having sex. The story takes place just before the Great Depression in Kansas during a time when people were very sexually repressed. Natalie Wood plays the part of a \\"good\\" girl who temporarily goes insane and attempts suicide because her boyfriend (Beatty) follows his fathers advice and has sex with \\"a different type of girl\\". Life changes so much for both of them after school, and the film eloquently portrays that it isn't always fair. Although the film is in black and white, it soon becomes unnoticeable because the engaging performances of Wood and Beatty and a very interesting story, which is why I give it four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"late","review":"late, late , late , oh did i say late ...paid for next day , did not leave for 5 days AFTER i got a confirm email ..not happy at all ....movie was perfect , but too late guests gone"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Whitley Album","review":"Dirt Floor is the best whitley album....Amazing songs, excellent performance...This cd is timeless.

This is just a souped up audio version of the CD we all have.Who knew they have DVD's without video? This is for audiophiles. Not for people looking to watch him perform his songs.Love Chris Whitley, DVD-audios, not so much. Yeah, \\"Dirt Floor\\" CD is a 5 star CD.

The purity of sound, the intensity and honesty of the lyrics in every song, is astoundingly, achingly beautiful. His talent for song-writing is at the forefront, with songs like Scrapyard Lullaby, Indian Summer, Wild Country, and Dirt Floor leading the way. The jazz undertones of From One Island to Another give but a small hint of the range that Chris Whitley is capable of ... this album whets my appetite for his next endeavor! This is easily the best new album I've heard all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Whitley exhibits raw acoustic power on \\"Dirt Floor.\\"","review":"As one who has never tired of listening to anything that Chris Whitley has done, (even the less \\"well-received\\" works), I believe that \\"Dirt Floor\\" is his best yet.Comparing this album to \\"Living With the Law\\" is a real underestimation of his growth as an artist. It is as powerful as that debut, but the simplicity of \\"Dirt Floor\\" lends an eloquence to this recording that is nothing less than gripping.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guy, a guitar, and a barn...","review":"Whitley's voice and guitar blend together perfectly to deliver am album to fit any mood. His foot tapping and thumb work keeps rhythm pushing and flowing just enough to take your breath away. Pretty amazing for a guy in a barn. Also, he recorded it in like 3 days total!!! He's an amazing musician and songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly stunning acoustic recording","review":"If there was a better piece of music released in 1998 I certainly haven't been able to locate it. _Dirt Floor_ in many ways defines what a truly \\"acoustic\\" recording should be. One musician, a few guitars, a foot stomp keeping the beat, and some recording equipment all piled into an old barn. It's sparse, soulful, and eerily compelling--the interplay between Whitley's impressively understated guitar work and the gentle yet gravel-like tone of his voice gives this CD a very earthy, geniune feel. The production of the CD would for practically any other recording be considered to be absolutely awful, but the low-fi and sparse sound makes _Dirt Floor_ even more compelling and powerful. In a musical age dominated by electronica, pre-processed pop stars, and nigh-symphonic overproduction, it's refreshing to find a musician who cares nothing for glitz, glamour, or polish, and instead just wants to create great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"lightning","review":"Only very rarely the first encounter with a record may struck you as lightning. The experience that you have always known this music, yet nothing will remain the same anymore. For me this was the case with Joy Division, Nick Drake's Pink Moon, Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska and now Dirt Floor. Stripped to the bare essence: just Chris Whitley's voice and his dobro. This music makes you uneasy but is comforting too.Very sad he had to die so young. He seems to have played a lot in Holland, during the years he lived in Germany. Had I known him before, I would certainly have gone to see him as often as I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like kiss you will like this album","review":"if you know about this band, then you know what you are getting. they are a better than average rock band, w/an excelent fireworks display and theatrics blended in w/the music to provide great live shows. the albums they put out as well and this type (a greatest hits version), you can really imagine being at any/all of their concerts. they never short cut the music, and you can tell that when you hear it. and they keep playing for the simple fact of the fans just loving them and return KISS loves the fans. it is because ofthat mutual respect why KISS always gives their best! you will always get your money's worth w/them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remote is too sensitive","review":"Great idea - but the remote is way to sensitive.

The acting is abominable. I made some of my friends watch it and we laughed most of the way through it. It is NOT scary. Don't buy/watch this unless its for laughs only.

The only thing missing from this horribly trite movie is the tall Midwestern blonde as Crystal's love object. Rent The Heartbreak Kid (1972) starring Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd, to see a somewhat similar theme but better in every way, writing, directing, acting, character players.For me, the only redeeming feature of this movie was the luminous Debra Winger. Ms. Winger, many years after her brilliant performance in An Officer and a Gentleman is still a delight to watch.This movie is neither romance nor comedy. It is truly forgettable and my guess is that in a few more years it will be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"A story of a couple who met in Paris, fell in love, then got married happily after...... No sorry, they didn't, not immediately.They fell in love at first, then were faced with reality that started diminshing their love gradually. They started having fights and conflicts, then eventually they got back together and were happily in love ever after.I found the film to be boring. Its quite long, full of unnecessary details, typical early 90s movie! It wasn't funny, wasn't even romantic. We didn't even get much of France or the French culture except in the begining. Even the name Forget Paris doesn't make sense because we don't get much of France. They meant by the name to forget the lovely times both couples had in Paris.A movie about a regular couple having regular experiences.

The Pilates section wasn't inspired, and had several variations on the complete roll up that aren't doable, and are even dangerous for a beginner. But in her defense, they describe the Pilates section as intermediate/advanced.The second section though is fun. It combines a dance work out (not an aerobics work out) with weights. I used to take dance at a Hanya Holm style dance school, and it makes me really miss the classes I took there.The yoga section had a lot of good stretches. It seemed like what it really was though, part of a dancer's warm up. If what you want is the intense stretching yoga can provide, this is for you. But if you are looking for the deep relaxation of yoga, this section goes by far too quickly for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unght. Not for me at all.","review":"Jennifer Kries certainly shouldn't have called her DVD \\"Pilates Method\\", as it has very little in common with pilates - and a great deal in common with Jane Fonda.

The NYC Ballet Workout is a much better adaptation of pilates related techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy quality","review":"This has very little to do with Pilates and the quality really [is bad]. It was a real disappointment. The best DVD I have seen was Pilates for Dummies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like home made video...","review":"I recently purchased this DVD and I'm not happy about it. There is very little variety of exercises. The 3 different programs (4 actually but one of them is a silent repeat of the cardio program) don't give you enough time to work out. You don't sweat at all. It would have been an \\"ok\\" beginners stretching program if the quality of video wouldn't be so bad. I wouldn't call it \\"yoga\\" either. I felt like I was watching poor cable work out. The cover actually is much prettier than what's behind it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new...","review":"J. Kries and the Method fans, everything you see in the New Method Series (all 3 tapes) are in other Method tapes already.

I found all the sections challenging but doable, and I especially like that you get some cardio work too. I don't agree with some of the other reviews that say it's not a good explanation of how to do it. How much explanation do you need? I also don't agree that beginners can't do it. I'm just a mom at home who works out to videos, and I could do everything the first time through, although it is challenging and interesting enough. After using it twice a week for about a month, I can already tell the difference in my abs.

Not good for beginners, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"pilates method perfect mix","review":"I bought this tape because of the rave reviews. I wish I hadn't. The first workout was just sit-ups. I can do those without a tape. (in fact, I teach a 1/2 hour class of abs) The second workout \\"Metabolic Booster\\" was an absolute joke. Nothing cardio about it. Finally, the last workout. It was all about breathing properly. I know this is hard for some people to do, at first. This was just ridiculous.

I enjoy exercise videos but this is one of the worst. The instructor doesn't stop talking. It's nice to be guided through postures but she doesn't shut up. She also takes atleast five minutes of each segment and tells you how to breathe. It felt like a Lamaze class. The first segment is Core Conditioning. It concentrates on your abs and lower spine. It's not half bad and she does explain things nicely, which is good if you've never done Pilates.The second segment, Metabolic Booster, is ridiculous. She's jumping and dancing all over the place. You'd have to watch it quite a few times to get the moves down. The last segment, Rejuvination, is based on yoga. Again, she babbles on for about five minutes then finally takes you through a few common postures. Thankfully I only rented this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be carefull I broke two allready","review":"This product is junk. I like most oxo products but this one is poorly designed.

However, it is apparent that RCA has run out of quality unreleased material and are milking it for what it is worth. Except for the gospel numbers,who wants to listen to Elvis singing to the prerecorded backing tracks of Suppose and Indescribably Blue? Tenn. Waltz is not worth programming into your player.The one or two lines that were released on the 60's box is good enough.The overall sound quality is better that I expected but if you feel the need to listen to this then find some shmuck who actually paid for this and ask to borrow it.One listen will do 'ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Talent !","review":"It is clear from listening to these recording,especially the ones made in the sixties,how astray Elvis' vision of who he was in the recording studio, had gone. Only in his gospel work do we hear the close harmonies that are evident on a lot of the songs recorded here (again,most dramatically from the 60's). Judging by what he recorded at home, and what he recorded for public consumption, the damage done to his career by the B movies becomes much clearer.For example,\\"Tumblin' Tumbleweeds\\",of all things, has a grace and beauty to it that Elvis rarely bothered to try to achieve at this time in the studio. If Elvis would have been truer to his musical roots, and adamant about recording what he loved, he would have never needed a \\"68 Comeback\\", because he would have never left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis at Home!","review":"Having just read Peter Guralnick's Careless Love, this new release intrigues me, but I wish I had more information. When were these recordings made? Are these all from the 1970's? How bad is the sound? Is the King's voice already shot? How does it compare to, say, the \\"Million Dollar Quartet\\" disc?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red and Sonny Unplugged!","review":"Do not, under any circumstances, be tempted to purchase this CD. I expected the sound quality to be poor, and it certainly is, but what's most disappointing about this CD is Elvis is drowned out on many tracks by the flat voices of his buddies, Sonny and Red. If you are a fan of Elvis' bodyguards for some reason, I suppose this might be of some interest, but otherwise, this is for completists only.These recordings were mostly made in the 1970's in the Jungle Room at Graceland on a small, home reel to reel machine. Voices go on and off mic, there are strange thumps and noises in the background, and various other annoyances that one might expect of a \\"historical recording.\\" Really, the best thing about this CD is the picture of Elvis in uniform on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching home movies","review":"Elvis at his most \\"unplugged\\". This is Elvis playing and singing with friends. Very informal and not very pleasant to listen to. I suppose if you are an Elvis fan and a completist, you would probably buy this.

I wasn't expecting great sound quality, but I did expect something better than this. There is too much laughing and constant chatter on this CD.

New Orleans clarinetist Louis Cottrell favors the Albert system of playing (lots of playing in the instrument's lower register), and his interpretations of the songs included here are masterful and truly captivating. Accompanied by only Emanuel Sayles's guitar (or banjo) and McNeal Breaux's bass, there is an intimacy to his playing that is amazing. Whether playing New Orleans classics like PERDIDO, BOURBON STREET PARADE, or THE SHEIK OF ARABY, or more popular gems like THREE LITTLE WORDS or ROSE ROOM (Cottrell's version of the latter is one of the best on record), Louis Cottrell has produced a minor masterpiece in this release.

Even with Royal Airmail shipping, the cost is in the neighborhood of $16--way cheaper than it's ever been offered on the U.S. Amazon. While you're there, you can shop around for other UK-centric music you might be interested in, like the deluxe reissues of ABC's Lexicon of Love, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions' Rattlesnakes and Manic Street Preachers' Everything Must Go, to name but a few.

We would all do exactly the same things the old man did to save the children, so there develops a great sympathy for him during the course of the reading.

In the position pictured, the ring will not fit at all in any size piercing because the tag is actually curved and bows out.

The replacement was not free and required a contract extension. It's nice looking, small functions reasonably intuitively, and the bluetooth earpiece is nice, but it's a pretty fussy little thing. When I use it, I find I can't hear the caller it unless I have it positioned at just the right angle to my ear and I spend half the conversation looking for that sweet spot and asking people to repeat things. Also, some of the screen pixels seem to go sort of semi dead so that they look a bit greyed out at certain angles.

There is no way to get my music collection to and from my computer other than transfering this type card between my PC and the V3.

However, I have been able to pick up the specifics and choose what options I wish (e.g., answering the phone by simply opening it). I was able to change ringer tones handily; it was easy to program voice mail; it was simple to access the web through the phone.I was even able to send my first text message (yes, I know, primitive).All in all, I'm pretty happy with this.

It is a cheap ocean setting, with basically a blue shaded screen with a few sunshine rays streaming through, and several fish types traveling accross the screen both ways. No kelp, no bubbles, no random movements. No up, down or diagonal.

It incorporates the wieght of an angry earth, the confusion of a manand the eerie calmness of a hurricane. The fact that they have been burried as an event in music is not without merit...they deserve that place, they exist somewhere inside of things, atomic-like.The music of Godflesh is a small man in a headlock who explodes out and grins at the enemy, it deserves better words than heavy or extreme, it deserves to share descriptions with the teutonic plates moving down there.

I can't imagine any kitchen activity that this spoon wouldn't be up to.

The only thing that surprised me a bit about this spoon is its length: it is just over 11 inches long, which is somewhat shorter than many competing serving spoons. In my kitchen, this hasn't been a problem, but for some people with extremely deep pots it could come up a bit short.The highlight of this spoon is unquestionably the handle: it is made largely of stainless for strength and durability, but has wonderful rubberized fins on the sides of the handle to provide for excellent grip.

Yes, I can scour out the blemishes, but hello, that's down around #231 on my list of things to do with my time. More importantly, I find the handle awfully short in proportion to the spoon-ish part. With such a deep bowl to it, I'm not sure what the spoon's function is actually intended to be. It kind of wants to be a ladle but is relegated to subbing for a wooden spoon.

The author did an excellent job of holding my interest in a morbid subject, I'll admit I'm hooked on true crime, but this is surprisingly good. Some tc books are dull dry, and boring but not this one. It's more like a fictional thriller but the sad fact is it's true. It was published in 1990, and I got on the 'net to see what happened to this innocent faced young man who harbored a horrible compulsion to mutilate children before he graduated to murder. It's been almost 20 years since he committed his gruesome crimes and I won't tell you the ending but I highly reccomend it to true crime buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gift!","review":"This book was a great gift for my sister-in-law!

I listened to the snippets on [...] and if that is any indication, this album will be a total flop. How can reviewers call this music R&B;? First of all, the song selections are terrible. Natalie either chose songs that were too recent to cover (i.e. Fiona Apple's \\"Criminal\\", Sting's \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\\" or Des'ree's \\"You Gotta Be\\") or songs that will be forever labeled as belonging to the original recording artist (Neil Young - \\"Old Man\\" and Bonnie Raitt \\"Love Letter\\"). I don't know what drew Natalie to choose these songs but whatever the reason, her interpretations don't come across as sincere. Listening to the samples left me empty.I prefer Natalie's jazz albums. That genre of music better suits her voice, particularly as she gets older. This is a poor attempt at a pop music comeback and will likely go down as one of the stinkers in 2006."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Offering","review":"While there a couple of good tracks most are poor covers, if you want to hear a great version of Old Man buy Liz Wright version & the same goes for Desiree 'Gotta Be'.Having seen Natalie Cole in concert performing a lack lusted show of some of her new album in London (concert lasted 75mins), it made me want to delete her albums from my ipod.

He plays good harp, too. Anson is hipper than ever -- sharp and tasty on guitar and a very good rhythm guitarist. (He's got to be one of the best blues guitarists playing today.

The recording quality itself is poor; muddy, distorted, inarticulate, sometimes distant, and poorly balanced. I'm sorry to sound so overwhelmingly negative, but the truth is that most of the CD sounds like it was recorded by an amateur with lousy equipment and needles pushing red all over the place.

I was really disgusted by all of the dirt & dog hair that my previous vacuum cleaner was obviously not picking up. Little unit has great suction and cleaning power. At first I was disappointed by the small vacuuming path but this vacuum easily fits between my furniture, the walls and my table and chair legs. The only drawback is that the front of the unit is a little bulky and the vacuum will not reach very far under chairs, beds or other low furniture. Compact size is very easy to store. This will be a great, inexpensive vacuum if it holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nightmare!","review":"This was the first thing I ever bought after researching on the web and boy was I disappointed. The size and weight of this are nice but after one year both wheels have broken off and cannot be fixed. And the filter is one big pain in the neck! Every time you run the vacuum you have to clean out the filter and the most effective way I have found is to carefully pick out the lint with a toothpick which takes some time. My husband and I have a running joke whenever one of us is cleaning out the filter the other says oh thank goodness we don't have to deal with bags anymore-bags!- you put in, you replace- but you never have to sit there cleaning out filters filled with dust and lint with toothpicks every time! I can't wait to buy a vacuum with bags again! The price of these filters is also not delightful-between 10-15 dollars and should be replaced fairly often. I'm still surprised at the high ratings I found on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka! Big results - small price","review":"This vacuum cleans as well as a larger more expensive one. There are no bags to buy, and I especially like the fact that I can see what I am vacuuming up. This way you can tell when the rug is really clean with no guess work.Some people might not like having to dump the dirt out, and you do need to vacuum the filter (they give you two)but for me the results are worth the handling. There is a certain amount of \\"mechanical\\" ability needed to put the filter back in place etc. but once you know or are shown what to do, it is easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much trouble and maintenance","review":"The filter is a royal pain, hard to find, and expensive. Blows away dust before you vacuum it. Super loud, you will need ear plugs while using it. Cord is so short, you will need an extension cord. It finally broke, but I'm unsure as to what broke - it simply stopped functioning. Don't believe the positive reviews; this is a bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it for bare floors.","review":"If you need a vacuum to use both on carpet AND hardwoods don't buy this vacuum! It does ok on carpet but it has ( in my opinion ) a major design flaw....that the exhaust blows directly out the lower front of the vacuum. It blows the dust, dirt and hair into the air before you can vacuum it up. It actually blew my granddaughters pictures off the fridge! You vacuum one side and when you go to the other side it blows the dirt and hair back onto the side you just vacuumed! When I was finished I had to wipe down every surface in my kitchen ,including my stove, because there was hair and dirt all over it. More work. No thanks. Back it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a couple of months","review":"I had to return my first one in about 2 months because it stopped doing its job. Since it was under manufactors warrenty, I got a new one - identical. About 7 or so months later, the motor broke. This was under an extended warranty and was replaced with another make and model.Pros - it is not very expensive and works well for awhile.Cons - Dont plan on keeping it long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Suction, Lightweight, but Wheels will fall off permanently!!","review":"Bought it because it was the lightest among the uprights. It has excellent suction for the money ($70 retail). However, it does clog quickly at the filter. Emptying the filter is not a simple open and pour out into your trash can. You have to use your hands to remove the dust buildup off of the filter. Kind of like when you remove the lint from the dryer, except much messier.If you can learn to live with that, which I did, it all doesn't matter, once the PLASTIC wheels permanently fall off. Over time (about 9 months), the wheels start to get loose and then eventually fall off permanently, without the recourse of replacing them.Any suggestions are welcome...I am now looking for another vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"good little vacuum","review":"I would give 4 stars if i could.It works fine, sucks like crazy!I must empty the dirt cup after each use andbang out the filter. There is no need to go crazycleaning the filter. It will be messy two secs after youturn it on again.The attachments work well. the only gripe i have is the attachmentsattach to the unit so low its very difficult to use them foranything at eye level or above. Ive tried putting the uniton a chair to raise it but this scares me as an accident waiting to happen but otherwise a fine purchase. And ive had it several months and it still works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!!","review":"This is a cute Vacuum, and that's about it. The filter clogs, and they are next to impossible to find. The Canister is a pain to empty. The biggest problem I found was there was no height adjustment. If you have thick carpet, you just need to forget about this vacuum. What A nightmare to push and pull this stupid thing. Mine has gone to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bagless-convenience but inconvenient because of the dust cup filter","review":"Pros: Inexpensive & you don't have to buy bagsCons: You do have to replace the dust cup filter, which is more inconvenient then replacing a vacuum cleaning bag. The dirt tends to stick to the filter so cleaning out the canister and removing the dirt from the filter is time-consuming and creates so much dust around that you would need a dust mask.In short, I wouldn't buy a bagless vacuum cleaner again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Floor Suction - Nice Color Though","review":"This vacuum has a lot of suction from its hose attachment but almost none through the floor suction. I believe I must have gotten a defective model, but got no help on my first call to Eureka's customer service.My dilemma is whether to live for a while with a product that's barely working or to struggle through the cost/time/effort to get it repaired-especially when considering the low purchase price. (Ah, our throw-away society!)Even if it was working well, the fact that the exhaust blows out the front, chasing the dirt away from you, makes this unit's design questionable.I do love that great spring green color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent light-weight...","review":"This lightweight vacuum with the big motor capacity is great for the elderly (me)or anyone who cannot handle a heavy duty machine. It carries up and down stairs easily. It does an excellent job on the bare kitchen and bathroom floors and the low to medium carpets in my house. It works at its best if it is dumped and the filter brushed out after each use. Switching to the hose and brush for corners, shelves, etc., is quick and easy. This product can't be beat for the nominal price. I bought this cleaner after using one in my son's home so it was a well tested product before I actually purchased my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"it blows your dust first","review":"I seriously hope this is the review that sends this vacuum back to the drawing board. I saw some other post about the exhaust blowing debris in front of the vacuum but OMG!!! I live in NYC, I admit that I have dust bunnies, they love to hang out in the corners. When I approach them the exhaust from the vacuum creates a nice little whirlwind right before I get to them and causes them to blow up into the air.Terrible design really! Eureka and potential buyers. this Vacuum would be a 5 star success but the dumb position of the exhaust destroys any hope. not sure if this vacuum sucks more or just blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely lost suction","review":"I bought this vacuum about a year ago and at first it worked pretty well. Not a lot of power, but it was small, and I have a small place, so I was willing to deal. However, after the first couple of months, the vacuum began to gradually become less effective at picking up dirt off the hard wood and tile floors, to the point that, a year later, it barely picks up anything at all. It mostly just moves dirt around. I am in the market for a new vacuum, and it will NOT be another Eureka Optima."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright... at first.","review":"This vacuum works fine for hardwood floors AT FIRST. After only a year or so (with pretty infrequent use, might I add), this thing totally conked out and became pretty worthless. Cleaning the floors with damp paper towels was less work and more efficient than pushing this thing around. I live in NYC and see these on the curb as trash ALL the time. Judging from this, I'd venture to guess that I'm not the only dissatisfied owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you have pet birds","review":"I had one of these vacuums for a year and it worked great on both bare and carpeted floors. Then the wheel broke off so I got this one. Well this one is a little bit different in design because whereas the old one was great at cleaning up seed off my hardwood floors, this one just blows the seed around. It works great on rugs but horribly on bare floors. Huge disappointment. Time to shop for a new vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Little Vacuum for the Money - A real Sucker","review":"I owned an Oreck Hepa filter vacuum and this little $60.00 gizmo. With 5 cats in the house, I had to find a way to suck up cat fur and dust bunnies. Well let me tell you, this little guy is amazing.I have a cleaning lady and she didn't believe me--one use and she became a believe and has recommended it to her clients as well. The vacuum is light, stylish and really works.For all of it's downfalls (hair and dust getting caught around the filter at the top and the air that blows out the front) the vacuum is a gem.It is cheap enough that if it busts, I'll replace it with the same thing.I love it! It works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality!","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner (not from Amazon) about 2+ weeks ago and it just died on me. The motor went bust for no reason in particular. I was in the middle of vacuuming my carpet and it just died. I hardly even got to use it 5 times since I bought it.I had read the other reviews that it's got poor build quality and was prone to breakdowns etc but I was reluctant to believe them. I guess I learned the hard way. Avoid buying this vacuum cleaner if you can. For the price I paid, I deserve far better quality than what I got, and you should too.Needless to say, I'm absolutely disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until the wheels fall off....","review":"This vacuum works great until the plastic molded wheels fall off. The wheel design is poor (cheap), and after less than a year of normal use on my vacuum a wheel came off. Unfortunately once this happens you are done.Due to this design flaw I don't recommend this vacuum unless you plan to buy a new one each year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 months","review":"This seemed handy but it broke after 6 months even though I religiously cleaned the filter and emptied the canister. Eureka refused to fix or replace the vacuum because I didn't have my receipt and was quite rude about it too. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"major design flaw","review":"This vacuum has a major design flaw in that the exhaust vent is in the front, which blows all the dirt or hair away from the vacuum! This is a huge problem with hard floors. I get my cardio excersize in while vacuuming, trying to outrun the dust bunnies, only to be stopped dead by the too short cord!I must say the suction is great & it's wonderful on rugs or carpet, but useless on hard floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR problems","review":"This vacuum has 2 MAJOR problems:1. The cord is far too short! I can't even vacuum my average sized bedroom without switching to another wall plug. I could probably live with this, given the great suction, BUT,2. This thing blows dust bunnies in the air before you can get to them! We have a corner of our bedroom where dust bunnies like to live, and they were flying in the air as I tried to suck them up! Now I have to get out my dusting supplies and clean all the junk that landed on my dresser.I pictured myself like a warrior, holding the vacuum over my head, sucking dust and cat hair out of the air, and quickly returned this monster for a refund. I guess it would be fine for carpets, but beware if you have hardwoods or tile - you'll be online for either an air cleaner or allergy meds."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great So Far!","review":"I just got this last week and I'm really enjoying it so far. It cleans the carpets and manuvers well. I was a little worried when I tried to use the hose for the steps and there was no suction but with this vacuum, there is a mechanicsm to change from floor to hose. Once I found it and turned it to the correct setting I was good to go. It stores well and it is lightweight which is great for doing stairs. The cleaning path is not as wide as my old one nor the hose as long but I do like it but in is a lot better in a lot of other ways. Maybe not a good choice for someone with a large house but great for me! It was a great deal for $55 delivered right to my door."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BAD FOR THE JOB","review":"THE FRONT WHEELS OF THE VACUUM CLEANER ARE VERY SMALL WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY GET CAUGHT IN THE CARPET AND ONE HAS TO PUSH REALLY VERY HARD TO GET THE JOB DONE.

The first one they shipped died in less than a week. The $10 filters that you HAVE to change every 3-4 times you use it can't be cleaned. You must buy them which means you will spend $10 every few times you want to vacuum. I have all hard wood floors accept for a few area rugs. We have one cat, one kid and a wood stove. We don't make huge messes. I wish I could post a video of this crappy vacuum NOT being able to pick up a Cheerio because you'd laugh!. I'm writing this review because I just changed the filter on the replacement they sent and and tried cleaning some sawdust from around the wood stove and the motor died AGAIN.I really wanted a Regina Carpet Sweeper but they don't make them anymore. :o(DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only okay","review":"I bought this vacuum about a year ago - it was on sale for under $30 and it is not worth much over that. The filter needs to be changed every few times using it (even after cleaning it out!) and the new filters are over $10 each!The suction is only okay. The machine is LOUD! and dust comes out of it from day one.I recommend looking elsewhere for a vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Recommend","review":"If I had only used this vacuum once, I would concluded that it was incredible because of the great suction and effective cleaning. It's lightweight, which makes vacuuming stairs super easy.However, there are some major problems with it:1. Short cord--be prepared to plug and unplug multiple times.2. Expensive filter that clogs with each use. Had to vacuum the filter with my old vacuum to extend the filter's use.3. Messy to empty the canister. Will never buy a bagless vacuum again.4. Cheap construction. The plastic wheel snapped off and can't be replaced, so after just three years of use, this vacuum is no longer usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great vacuum!","review":"The vacuum is great. It was easy to put together and for the price, it was a great value. The only think I didn't like was the amount of noise it makes when it's on. I live in a small apt. so you can hear it so much more. But other then that, it cleans good and is compact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canister and Filter are Messy to Empty!","review":"Do not buy this vacuum if you have a pet. Cleaning out the canister is a very MESSY job and the dirt and pet hair stick all over the filter. Replacement filters are difficult to find and must be ordered on-line. I've put up with this vacuum for a year and I'm now buying a new BAGGED vacuum. I've put up with it this long because it is very lightweight, it has a nice retractable handle, and you can set it to \\"suction only\\" and use it on bare floors. But cleaning out the dirt and pet hair is messy, messy, messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wheels came off","review":"This vacuum is a lightweight vacuum that functions reasonably well for almost a year.

I researched many different types of vacuums (to bag or not to bag, upright or not, etc.) and decided on this model after reading a number of reviews on the product that were positive, if not glowing. For its price, it does a remarkable job. I have four constantly shedding pets and some bright green carpet that shows everything and this number easily took care of it all. I do have to empty out the canister a couple of times if I'm vacuuming the whole house, but see my pet conundrum above. It's very lightweight, easy to maneuver and was assembled in under five minutes (and that was without instructions, so imagine how easy it is if you read them). Aesthetically speaking, it's fun. After all, it's green and glittery.Overall, I think this Eureka does a fantastic job and I ask a lot of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this vaccum","review":"It's light, but the Hepa filter fills up so often as to make me prefer a broom... okay, I've got two cats, so I've learned to set up a chair by a waste basket and clean the filter with a plastic fork two or three times each time I clean the living room.There must be a better product out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that ..........","review":"This is not your everyday vacuum .

Anyone who cares to read will see that both the comic and anime are for teens though the story is generally light hearted.

Before I bought this album I was basically unfamiliar with the velvets besides having heard Heroin on the Doors soundtrack album. That song impressed me so much I decided to buy the album it originated from. Within a couple weeks I bought all their albums. This is an incredible album and this is an incredible band. Every song on this album is a masterpiece so listing highlights is virtually pointless. The album should be enjoyed as a whole. In the pantheon of rock and roll I rank this as my second favorite album, right in between Electric Ladyland and Seargant Pepper. This is a great album. Do yourself a favor and buy it.

I was 19 in 1971 when I heard this album for the first time, and it simply blew me away. I was into what I thought for the time \\"alternative\\" music: Doors, Iggy, MC5; and then out of the mainstream stuff: Blind Faith after Cream, Spooky Tooth, Jimi. When I heard this album for this time, it was like the gods slapping me out of a trance. I couldn't believe, that in the age of dysfunctional and psychedelic love, a band had the guts to write and play brilliant music about the decadent side of life. How does an album affect you? Does it kick you in the stomach and force you to see things in a different way? Does it make you reflect and reorganize? That's what this album did to me. Lou and the Velvets may have influenced the last 30 years of rock's punk, alternative, and whatever else. All I know is that they influenced me. And that's much more powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, overused Bang and Olufson production technique.","review":"The recording and production is fantastic but its time to move on from this sound.These \\"teen idol\\" pop rock 'n' roll songs will last forever in music though."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple review","review":"i'm not going to get into the nonsense a lot of the reviewers do. the cd shows you can play simple music and simple chords and make it sound unique and beautiful. simple music doesnt have to be the garbage punk or yelling music we here today or the dumb pop. it can still be beutiful and simple yet complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"i've been into the velvet undeground since i was a kid.i would hear them around the house,every time my older brother would play the velvet underground and nico.as i grew older i grew more obsessed with the velvets.i couldn't get enough.i still can't.and this album just hasn't gotten old.every time i play it,it just sounds new.everything about this album is perfect,even though it is about depression issues,it isn't a downer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Very Dark","review":"This album has Lou Reed's great lyrics and also great music, which I appreciate. But at times it can be very dark. I liked it overall and found the selection of music to be quite varied over the entire course of the album. I bought it because it is listed as one Amazon.com's essential alternative albums, but the sound it has is not very similar to many other alternative albums. In many ways it just sounds older, more like the classic rock of the 60's and 70's than the alternative rock of Nirvana and the ilk. That is not a complaint though and overall it's a very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has a sixties LSD sound that I really love. Its great.","review":"The velvet underground and Nico is one of the best rock bands of the sixties. The music has an LSD, kind of unique sound.

Trust me on this one, you'll end up buying all of their stuff anyway, might as well get it all in one shot. Get the box set, then get the two 1969 live recordings, and then, if you still need some more Velvets get the Robert Quine three CD set (which sonically is not as good as the 1969 recordings, but the performances are outstanding. So there you go, first the box set, then the two live 1969 cd's, and then the Robert Quine box set.

Hippies were NOT what they wanted to be Thank God. That is why they were so GOOD. My apologies Nico and Andy, as you rest, and to Lou Reed, I apologize that we have such a narrow-minded audience that does not \\"appreciate\\" what we as human beings have been given.

This is true for any art form: the dramatist needs to know Sophocles and Shakespeare, the poet Shelley and Keats; the filmmaker Hitchcock and Kubrick, etc. etc.To that end, this record is essential listening because of the creative and experimental ideas employed in it and because of the influence it had on the art form. No artist from the sixties outside of the Beatles and Bob Dylan had more of an impact on rock music than V.U., and this album serves as a perfect entree of their creative sensibilities and musical ideas. Supremely recommended to anyone who considers himself or herself a fan of rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the hype and simply enjoy this masterpiece","review":"Sure, there are idiotic hipsters who will buy and listen to this because it was raved about by their favorite indie band, or they read about it on some lame 'classic albums' list which placed it next to 'Abbey Road' and 'Astral Weeks'.... but that doesn't detract from the glory of this recording. This is a unique, amazing set of songs that seem to never grow old. The performers, especially John Cale on viola, ooze creativity.

Next, the vinyl (though not mentioned) is 180 gram and in all original packaging...that's right, you WILL have an authentic banana sticker to peel!Now besides from the high quality of the vinyl/packaging, the music is just absolute art. If you have not heard the Velvet Underground then I highly suggest you do! Arguably, they are the best and most influential band that America has seen yet. The genres that it has influenced range from shoegaze to garage to art rock.Overall, I would suggest this album to all my friends--especially this 60th anniversary edition, and would buy it again if I had not already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This album is awesome. Please, please, please don't pay attention to the lame review by the idiot who suggested Beyonce or Ashanti (who, by the way, weren't even around until waaaay after The Velvet Underground disbanded!!) as singers instead of Nico. The band is great, Nico's great, the songs are awesome. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concrete hard","review":"I generally will not review a product on Amazon unless the previous review is thin.The city ain't Eden, so one shouldn't project that expectation on it or its inhabitants. Humans went urban for money, convenience, and (ironically) safety, not to hear smog covered birds sing while we milk metal cows; hope that fact's not too cynical. Another fact: the Velvets cynicism isn't a pose; it's as hard and real as New York pavement. And art as reaction - especially that which is a reaction to bubbleheaded West Coast flower power - can easily surpass its \\"target\\" as art.To quote the Bard of Duluth\\"The city's just a jungle full of games to play/Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away./I was raised in the country, I've been working in the town/I've been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.\\"Or even Eddie Arnold: \\"Take Manhattan, give me that countryside.\\"The city isn't for the meek. Neither are the Velvets."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my alltime favorites","review":"Love the sharp and hazzy sound of this album! Theres no fillers on this one but \\"Heroin\\" and \\"I Waiting for my Man\\" are the best...No, actually \\"European son\\" are even better, its such a vild rushing, mind piercing, jam masterpiece.

They became a great band AFTER this mess was recorded. I try listening to it once in a while to see if it has anything to offer and I come up empty. The singer Nico does a decent Marianne Faithfull impression when she's not sounding like she's about to drift into a heroin coma."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS REISSUE","review":"This is a terrible reissue of one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Instead of messing around with why the album itself is good or bad, I will just go right in to why the REISSUE is anything but essential.The reissue starts with the album in stereo. After that, there are a few NICO solo tracks. NICO is great, and I love NICO, but her work needs to be appriciated on its own. This would be like reissuing an album by the Who and adding Pete Townsend solo tracks.After the NICO tracks, the Mono Singles begin. After the mono singles, the mono album composes the second disc. Listening to the album in mono is kind of neat, but why put the singles on there if they are already on the album in the mono mix.In the end this is a waste of time and money. Rather than spend thirty dollars on this pitiful two disc set, I would suggest buying the original version of the album and a NICO album. This would cost roughly the Same amount of money but more worth the listeners while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I just don't get it","review":"I know this is going to be heresy. I first heard this band's record over thirty years ago. The rock press was fallin' all over themselves with praise about how important this band was. They were mentioned in the same sense as the Beatles, Stones, Byrds .ect as major rock influences. I bought this album in the mid sixties, I listened many times, trying to like it and wondering what I was missing. Most garage bands I knew could play and make up better songs. The songs are one or two cords (oK sometimes three), the singers drone on and on, I'm never sure what they are going on about and the whole thing was recorded in a substandart fashion, which makes it unlistenable. I was recently making a late sixties mix and bought the album, I am leaving them off! Sorry, not the Beatles, not even the Iron Butterfly or even Blue Cheer.. Skip this one, if you want a better picture of the sixties and it's wierdness, get the Nuggets box set instead: Relics From the Psychedelic Era.."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most over-rated rock albums of all time","review":"Lou Reed can't sing, or play, and if you combine that with a penchant for writing songs that are unpleasant to listen to, then you can call it avante garde , and it can somehow justify this foursome of nobodies having a record deal when many other bands with talent went hungry. Influential? You bet. Punk rock would not exist without this album. Interesting? Sure. It's different; that's for sure. Fun to listen to? Only if your tastes run the gamut from the frog-voiced fashion model Nico to the psycho rantings of Lou Reed about Heroin, sadomasochism, and other \\"fun\\" topics. John Cale's violin screeches offer the final proof that this is one album you cannot listen to for pleasure.If you like this album, you deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Brazil","review":"Andy Warhol,e apenas ele,poderia ser o mentor desse marco do rock.Influente,e,claro,muito à frente de seu tempo,esse disco é certamente o primeiro registro do punk,em fantásticas canes ,como 'Sunday Morning','Femme Fatale','Heroin' e a genial 'All Tomorrows's Parties'.No deixe de t-lo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you like a fungus...","review":"I hated this album at first, with its screeching guitars and Nico's bland, off-key singing, but then, after repeated listening, found it funny, then hypnotic. Still sounds incredibly modern for a 40 year old album."},{"rating":"2","title":"HERE IS THE TRUTH IN -200 WORDS","review":"I am 19 years old. I have grown up listening to the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, and a bunch of other stuff out of the Sixties and Seventies, and I think any true audiophile will admit the majority of stuff on the radio is predictable, cliched, and uninteresting.The banana album by the Velvets is in my top 10 for several reasons. It's original. It shoots for mood and groove. Not as melodic as the Beatles, but substantially more than 95% of the modern garbage there is out there. It's low fi (very) but if you have an interest in finding out why good music doesn't depend on production, buy this. It's basically what would happen if the White Stripes, Beatles, and Pink Floyd had a love child. That and it's really REALLY good."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Want To Hear It Two Times In A Row Anyway...","review":"All agree that listening to the mono and stereo sides are a completely different experience..also, the Nico tracks are fine,as is her entire Chelsea Girl album...the 45's are a great bonus and the booklet with lyrics and overall packaging (slick lamination harking back to those European import albums of long ago) peel-able banana is good and a total anachronistic trip faithful to the original.The anti-elitists Elitists 1st offering.You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best music you've never heard.","review":"The Velvet Underground are that band from the late 60's that few people have ever heard--at least directly. While they never achieved great popularity (this box set has sold more than all their albums have sold combined), the Velvets influenced music like NO other artists ever have. Their music has been so subsumed into the sound of modern rock music that their great originality hardly seems that astonishing anymore. Bands like R.E.M., Nirvana, the Violent Femmes, and many other greats have taken the Velvet sound to new levels, but it all started with this quartet headed by Lou Reed. Buy this set. Every note on every album matters, and you'll never forget the experience of \\"Sister Ray\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"This album is one of those records that is bought by sophomores in college who want to look cool. It is soooo avante-garde and so hip to buy an album all the other cool people say that you should have. But upon listening to this record years later, I do have to say that it is really boring! The chord progressions are trite and simple. The production quality is lousy. The lyrics are about uninteresting people who have no socially redeeming qualities. The singing hurts my ears. Lou Reed is a terrible lead guitarist, and when he attempts to play \\"fast\\" he is about as lousy as they get. Sell this CD at a used record store and get a life! Spend your money on something else. You'll regret buying this boring piece of music in about 5 years. Trust me. Or else buy \\"Rock and Roll Animal.\\" It's a somewhat better album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious '60s garbage","review":"Pretentious lyrics, painful melodies, mediocre musicianship, a guest appearance from the enigmatic \\"Nico,\\" and an album cover that Andy Warhol spent five minutes designing. What's not to love? Well, everything. But this record has always been a critical favorite. Why? Because critics love music that no one else does, especially pretentious music. That's what separates music critics from the proletariat. So who do you believe, the critics, or your lying ears?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh??","review":"I've been hearing about this band forever. People really like them. That's awesome. However, these guys dont even mask ripping off other artists. There She Goes Again, IS, Hitch Hike from the Rolling Stones.

Not by this band however."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard in my life; the singing is horrible and the lyrics are insipid..,no amount of drug referecesare going to save tuneless concoctions such as \\"waiting for the man\\" and \\"Run Run Run.\\" Nico is a true horror, her...voice makes unlistenable material \\"Femme Fatale etc.\\" even worse. Lou Reed was (and still is) a writer of unmelodic and uninteresting song rendered listenable only by the occasional collaboration with a brilliant producer. The only thing that makes this album tolerable is John Cale, whose viola renders certain song (Heroin, Venus in Furs) and listenable and sometimes even beautiful. The ominous shrieks actually provide a line of melody where previously there would have been none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intense scythe","review":"Although this album is not a heavy listening experience, in that there are no heavy metal type of sounds, there are screeching violins that are just as disturbing. The song Heroin is an attempt to reconstruct the musical feeling of taking heroin and the attitude towards it, the most scything feeling on the entire album. Sometimes they sound like the Byrds and sometimes they sound like the Stones but the sound is original in its energetic impact. Seems as if there were so many modern musical masterpieces released in 1967...yes this is one of them and worth its place on anybody's must listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect band for a boxed set","review":"I love the Velevet Underground.I'm a huge fan of their work, their legacy, Lou Reed, John Cale, Mo Tucker, Andy Warhol, etc.This is a band that hardly made a dent when they were together but then was more greatly appreciated in their aftermath. They were together for a brief period of time, each record sounded different, their B-sides and outtakes are relevant and some of the stuff ended up being prominently featured as Lou Reed solo work.This doesn't represent a compilation of the band but, rather, encapsules all of their works. You have everything that one of the most seminal and influential bands have ever done in a well organized, well annotated, box set.This is fantastic but this is for the Velvet completist and not for the curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"This box is the right way to hear VU (if you dare)","review":"The Velvet Underground/ Peel slowly and see: If you are not familiar with the Velvet Underground, you should listen to some various tracks before buying this box set as the VU is one of those bands that people seem to either love or hate. For those who love the VU (or are fascinated by their place in rock history) this box is a revelation. It contains all the important VU studio albums plus a large number of demos and alternative takes. The VU had their origins in Folk traditions but they clearly did not remain there, and their albums are quite unique and uncategorizable. When you are in the right mood, these recordings are magical. When you are not in the mood for dark and sullen, nothing could more irritating than VU. In short, handle with care."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Look Into VU During The Reed Years","review":"Simply, this boxed set is the way artists should be represented in these \\"definitive\\" compilations on their careers.From the packaging, incredible booklet and wealth of rare material, The Velvet Underground is given the type of treatment that enhances the legacy that was paved during the \\"Lou Reed years\\" of 1965-1970.Early demos, alternate mixes, live cuts, full-length versions of songs and studio tracks from the legendary \\"lost album\\" (due to drama with a record company) make for a story that needs to be heard by fans and those who are interested in this intriguing era of \\"pop\\" music.The only quibble concerns the final VU sudio album, Squeeze, which remains mostly ignored and never released on CD. The inclusion here would have made this boxed set indispensible for collectors.VU receives star treatment and the power of the music propels each of the five discs to extraordinary heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece after the fact","review":"As the 279th review I'm not going to bore you with what songs I think stand out and how stupendously influential this album is now but let me toss this tidbit at you:Released in 1967, it peaked at #171 on the Billboard charts. The hippy dippy world of 1967 was not ready for the Velvets yet. Yes, one of the seminal albums of all-time did not really sell at all well back when it was first released. Hard to believe especially when you think it was 1967 not 1977--an era when US radio avoided anything punk or New Wave and there was a decided reason good stuff didn't sell. This was the '60s when FM radio was open to new sounds yet the Velvets sold squat really in their entire lifetime.Goes to show, eh, maybe the masses just don't \\"get it\\" as they missed one of the greatest albums of all-time in the banana album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I found this book to be very interesting, despite the fact that it seems to be mostly the sayings of his disciples.

Everything is tired, flat, listless, dull. You'll never find a more apt title on anyone's album than \\"Minutes Seem Like Hours, the Hours Seem Like Days\\". So this is for completists only. As the album title itself says \\"I Remember 'Blind Joe Death'\\" - now THAT was a great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read her first 2 books instead","review":"If you have never read any of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez's books, do not start with this one. Her first two books are good reads, with characters that you feel for and like. There isn't one character in this book that I liked. The lead is a superficial, whiny brat with a crush."},{"rating":"1","title":"So -so","review":"I won't say the book was horrible, because it wasn't; nor will I say it was boring, because on the contrary, it kept me interested, but I will say that it had many faults. For one, the writing seemed a bit \\"young\\", similar to junior high and high school writing, and not that there's anything wrong with that, but I was expecting a more elaborate and mature sense of writing style, since the writer has written more than just one book. Also, the dialogue seemed so unreal. Yes, I know, it's a fictional story, but there was nothing to relate to, but also little fantasy to have fun with, and what I mean by that is that the characters were very underdeveloped, and many of the individual story lines seemed incomplete. At the end, I felt that I needed to read more, to feel I read a whole story. By the way, the book had many typos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous chick lit novel isn't completely lighthearted","review":"Set in sultry Miami, this story features an ensemble cast of six women who are connected through their relationships with Latin pop star Ricky Biscayne. This humorous chick lit novel isn't completely lighthearted, as the characters deal with teenage pregnancy, discrimination, drugs, adultery, and more. Not for the faint of heart, the flamboyant Make Him Look Good occasionally goes into explicit detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted to read US Weekly, I would have","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I loved her first two novels and expected much more out of this one. The blatant references to JLo (\\"JSan\\"? Really?) were unoriginal, the characters were weak and boring, the storyline itself was completely transparent. Don't waste your time or money on this book. Check it out from the library if you \\"must\\" read it, or check out one of her first two for a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valdes-Rodriguez Strikes Out","review":"As a fan of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, I had high expectations for \\"Make Him Look Good\\". It turned out to be a sore disappointment. Though it had its interesting moments, this book got to the point of being almost painful to keep reading. The writing was unimpressive, the plot completely over-the-top (even moreso than \\"Dirty Girls\\"), and the author included sexual situations that were crass and unnecessary to the story. Characters were recognizable as parodies of Marc Anthony, Dayanara Torres, Jennifer Lopez, Tommy Matola, and Thalia. I'm not sure what Rodriguez has against these celebs, but wow. You know, on second hand, maybe you should read this book, just to see what I'm talking about. Piece of advice though: borrow it from a friend or the library. It's truly not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I was so surprised, and not in a good way.I really enjoyed her first book. The second, not so much but still I thought that she was funny, sharp, created characters that were a little more then one diamensional, etc.But this - I was unprepared for the bomb that is this book. I am suprised that her publisher did not shoot this idea/outline down before it turned into a book.I am surprised that someone who showed so much promise with her first book is now seemingly a one trick pony. I expected so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"If you are a fan of Alisa Valdes-Rodriquez, then you know what you are in for. If you haven't read her work, this is a fun, can't put down kind of book. I love that she mixes Spanish in her writing and I am always learning something new everytime I read her books. Read this one and read her other books too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Entertaining","review":"I had a great time with Alisa's book. What I love most about her books is always her effective use of characterization. Each character is well developed. Even if you left out the tags you can tell which character is \\"on stage\\". They come to life as you read. I always feel at the end of Alisa's books that I know these people. I love some (charaters), hate others which means she's pulled me into the story and made me interact. That's always great when an author can do that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A guilty pleasure","review":"This is a cautionary tale. Beware of worshiping a celebrity or someone in your personal life who in reality doesn't measure up to whom you think they are.I think the author was willing to give up a little bit of character development for the sake of raising issues, such as child adoption, divorce, bigotry, and obsession.Basically, I enjoyed the book a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alisa Valdes- Rodriguez","review":"Looking forward to reading Haters- Ms Rodriguez has already stated that Make Him Look Good wasn't her best literary effort yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Star of the Guardians series: The Lost King, Kings Test and King Sacrifice","review":"One of my all time favorite 3 book series. The Lost King, Kings Test and Kings Sacrifice are the books in the Star of the Guardians series. The character development is excellent.

The story is original, although it does seem to have it's roots in Star Wars. The characters are well developed, and Dion's struggle is amazing.

I liked every book, cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fantasy","review":"My my, if Sagan were a real man, who could resist him? What a great bunch of characters Ms Weis has drawn. Interestingly enough, the two who are supposed to be ancilliary charaters (Maigrey and Sagan)steal the show. Dion is simply a nice reason for the book to be written, but the real story is Maigrey and Sagan. I love the little literary touches (Peter Robes=Robespierre from the French revolution, etc)and the poetry and philosophy quotations at chapter heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can I describe that ?","review":"This is the most fantastic book I ever read (even if it was not the original version, but the translation in french...).

It feels like a blatant Star Wars rip off that's poorly executed. My housemates and I passed it around and laughed at how bad it was.I picked it up because I've enjoyed other work by Weis, but I couldn't even finish this one.Folks have different tastes. If you're thinking of buying this book, read the first few pages on the \\"Look Inside\\" feature. Had I taken the time to do that at the bookstore, I'd have saved a quarter. If those pages grab you though, it might be a good bet for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrifying","review":"This book wasn't just bad... it was horrifying.

The characters are not completely developed and the story is so thin there isn't really one. As for the future world she developes I agree is quite good, it is, however, an almost exact copy of Star Wars (you only have to read about the bloodsword or XJ).To make it short, I'll only say, for all of you Weis fans that, like me, absolutely had to read this book: There are librareis, (and may Amazon forgive me.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I can't figure out what book the other reviewers read because I have to disagree with all of them. I found the storyline to be predictible, and the dialogue was simple and uninspired. I didn't think any of the characters in the story were truly developed which made it hard to really care about any of them. There were also some errors in the hockey aspect of the book, such as having an NHL team play three days in a row. I wanted to like this book since I love hockey but I found it hard to get through because it failed hold my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Script.","review":"This independent film is very entertaining, funny, romantic, solid script, good performances.

If you are a reader in the Course in Miracles, you will see a graphic depiction of the \\"ego\\" as outlined in the Course -- and well before the Course's writing. (I've been student of The Course for 30 years, so I might see more in it than others. I'll risk that.)Although for certain the \\"ego\\" really doesn't look like this, nor operate exactly like this, the parallels of the movie are both instructive and powerful as an emotional approach to understanding the human condition. Besides, much spiritual wisdom equates an emotional approach as superior to a logical one. Think of Jesus and the parables. Besides, you get to see Ann Francis again.I am quite surprised that this old (and presumably forgotten) gem is arrayed with other spiriual items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden Planet special edition","review":"This set was very well presented. The Robbie model, DVDs and theatre cards were beautifully packaged. The box alone makes a great collector's item. We enjoyed watching Forbidden Planet again, though were a little disappointed with The Invisible Boy. We were looking forward to seeing another movie that Robbie was in, but it was nowhere near the same class as Forbidden Planet. I guess this was to be expected. Still, it was interesting seeing Robbie in something else. The three documentaries were really fascinating, so sci-fi film buffs would love those. In summary, you'll love this box set if you want the DVD extras and the movie memorabilia. If you just want to see Forbidden Planet, you might be better off just buying the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fifties Sci-Fi Classic","review":"I love it: great cast, great sets, great colour, cod-Shakespeare story spin-off (the Tempest), invisible monsters, flying saucers, robots, unique soundtrack. This really is a must in any sci-fi collection. It's not erudite, or genre making, but just a great piece of entertainment and escapism.When I bought mine, there was no European version (region 2) available, but the region 1 disc is nice (if you have a multi-region player) as it is double-sided with widescreen (16:9) on one side and academy ratio (TV 4:3) on the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film.. with Leslie Neilson in a serious lead...","review":"The Synopsis and video description are false... Not about two killers or a guy getting shot and looking for vengence..This is what it should say...In the year 2200, a spaceship venture to the planet Altair-4 where an earth colony had myteriously vanished years before.... Only by harnessing the technology of an ancient civilization can the psace explorers solve the mystery that plagues this remote planet.I'm a big Robby the Robot fan so I love this film.. That that isn't the only reason.. It's a great film for '58.. ...Also I'd like to add - the Amazon review is off. The robot in this film is Robby, the one and only. The robot in Lost in Space was B9/The Robot. There are big difference between the two robots. Though they are often confused. Robby was. in fact, in two episodes of the 1st season of Lost in Space interacting with B9/The Robot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must!","review":"Haven't you seen this movie yet?

The color is vibrant (but the original was much duller and this makes some scenes seem a bit strange) and the added items on the CD are interesting for someone like myself who believes that this is one of the greatest old science fictions films. The box is very cute but came slightly dented from shipping. The Robbie doll is cute also.My major criticism is that there was no text with the package that described the history or actors, for example. When I noticed that the color seemed brighter I thought that the original might have been in black and white but could not find any info in the package about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"forbidden planet","review":"I am very happy with this collectors edition dvd and cannot fault it in any respect.The package is excellent overall and good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden Planet Bu-Ray - an incremental upgrade","review":"In comparing the 50th Anniversary Edition to this Hi Def release, I would say the Video quality is marginally better, a little more detail is there. The special features are the same here, no more or less. It's the uncompressed Audio that makes the Blu-Ray Disc a must-have for fans.

This was an obvious influence on shows like Star Trek and Lost in Space. Leslie Nielson in his leading man days, the ever beautiful Anne Francis, Walter Pigeon, Jack Kelly (pre-Maverick), a very young Earl Holliman (Police Woman), Richard Anderson (Oscar Goldman on The Six Million Dollar Man and not to be confused with Richard DEAN Anderson of McGyver fame). Then again, who can forget Robbie the Robot, the magnificent Krell machines and a plot based on The Bard's \\"The Tempest\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See Classic Sci Fi Film","review":"If you like older science fiction films than this is a film you must see. I know living in 2010 a science fiction film is supposed to be really advanced as far as special effects but for a film made in the 1950's this isn't bad. It has a good story line too it as well. I give it five stars I used to watch this with my dad growing up and when my dad came to visit me over the holidays I had to rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Sci-Fi Classic!!!","review":"This is one of the best special edition packs yet.

I think fans prefer the original and not these weird over-the-top constructions that have no character.This was never one of my favorite films but Robby always one of the best and 'true-looking' robots ever!!! True style... a great family favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent restoration!","review":"This DVD is a very good restoration of this sci-fi classic!

I like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"While the movie \\"Forbidden Planet\\" is a landmark science fiction movie, and well worth including in anyone's media library, I cannot recommend the DVD version sold here. The widescreen side is distorted, with characters and perspective appearing tall and narrow; and the TV-formatted side is dark, fuzzy, and poorly dubbed. In my opinion, anyone interested in purchasing this movie for their home library should be sure to buy it in a brick-and-mortar store where they can view the version being sold to assure its quality. That would hold true of the VHS version as well as the DVD version, since it is probable that the same distributor who made the DVD version also made the VHS version sold here. I should have paid attention to other reviewers who have had the same disappointing result from purchasing this DVD as I have. I am writing this review so that others won't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"overall the movie was good, I thought this version would have had the interviews with the actors still alive concerning the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Another SciFi classic on Amazon prime. While some may find it a bit clunky and campy , if you are a real Scifi fan and keep it mind that it was made in 1956 I am sure you will see it's merit. The interaction between the quasi-military crew members and sense of a ships routine (or SOP) seem right to me. I have not watched it in a long time and the version on Prime must have been cleaned up some from when I saw it last. The detail of the props and backgrounds are amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"Forbidden Planet was years ahead of its time.

The Blu-ray transfer is by far the best version. I suspect it looks better than most of the prints that originally went through theaters in 1956. They put a lot of effort into making this picture look great.When I'm paying twice the price for a Blu-ray disk than I do for a DVD, I do it to get a better image. And so often this is not the case. But I definitely got my money's worth on Forbidden Planet.As far as the movie itself goes, it's a clever premise and Walter Pidgeon knew how to act. But the other actors are pretty stinko. And the screenwriting is just plain awful. However, it's worth seeing just for the analog special effects that had to have been the best put in any movie of the 1950 decade. And with this excellent transfer the effort behind them really shows.Besides, how can you possibly pass up watching 30-year old Leslie Nielson playing a straight romantic lead in high definition?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say","review":"As everything good has already been said about this grand old film I will only comment on the quality of the video transfer. I never saw this film in the theaters but have been told that it was quite a sight to behold on the wide screen in glorious color. I watched this recent DVD on a 50\\" wide screen plasma HDTV and the wide screen screen color presentation lived up to the reputation of the film. The transfer quality was excellent! Many wonderful extras included with the DVD (see other reviews)."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CORNERSTONE OF MODERN DAY SCI-FI","review":"It would be difficult even in todays hi-tech fx to come even close to this incredible and believable 43 year old masterpiece which also helped to launch at least 5 major actors careers. As I replay this film over and over again. it would be a travesty not to own this great video transfer on DVD. If an attempt to recreate this film is even remotely considered, I would have to say that in thiscase, there should be very little deviation from the original story line. It will take years before people really understand the foresight this flick has had on tomorrows movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive early Sci-Fi","review":"I saw this at a revival showing, in the theater, and it was awesome!

That is not to say, this is only for fans. This is a well made, thoughtful movie with really good special effects. The cast is great to watch.

The influence this movie has had on the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Trek, Star Wars, Alien and Aliens is clearly seen in the visuals, structure and suspense of this ground-breaking motion picture. For newcomers to this classic, compare the poster art (which reflects the sci-fi taste of the time) with the actual movie and you will see how far ahead of its time Forbidden Planet was. I was fortunate enough to have seen this movie during its original release when its special effects were still state-of-the-art. I can still remember hiding my face during some of the scenes while my big sister kept me informed of what was going on. After all of these years it is still a joy to watch. Forbidden Planet is truly timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Film, Even With the Cheesy Parts.","review":"Okay, here's the deal: Forget all the talk about this being a sci-fi version of \\"The Tempest.\\" This film is possibly the pinnacle of sci-fi films of the Atomic Age.This is the film that seemed to have inspired the original Star Trek series, both in theme and style. However, with a larger budget than Star Trek would eventually have, it has much more in the way of bells and whistles.It has a Captain, a fair maiden, a stately scientist, a cadre of astronauts (who really act like WWII Navy men right down to the stereotypically undisciplined \\"cook\\" character,) a mysterious robot with unknown intentions, and a force that that threatens to destroy them all.This is one of the few science fiction films from the Fifties that is both entertaining AND intelligent. It does tend to stray at times in a silly subplot about a love triangle, but don't let that deter you from buying this item. It is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"1999 DVD has 2 sides, Letterbox and Widescreen!","review":"After reading Amazon reviews of all the different DVD releases (how many are there?)

This film would be a great lesson for future film makers in how NOT to make a scary movie.I suppose the ritalin addicted youth market may enjoy this film for its quick cut scenes that play out like a bad cross of a music video and out takes from \\"Jacobs Ladder\\", and they certainly will not have to focus on anything to cerebral here either.

If you want to watch a really scary flick about a family living in a possessed house, rent \\"Poltergeist\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really scary movie!","review":"Now, this movie, is very well made.

The whole story about the young guy killing his family is totally real... but the whole amityville horror is pathetic! I know for a fact that the house isn't haunted.

This is a Shining ripoff!!A family man moves into an elegant home(not an elegant hotel in Colorado but hey they could not rip off the Shining in every detail), we know that some awful murders were committed in the home, the father begins to lose his mind(ALL WORK AND NO PLAY huh Jack?), he is good with an ax, one child has an imaginary friend(Tony I can hear you calling), and a third party is brought into the situation(in the form of priest Rod Steiger---Also a good Exorcist ripoff, oh Max Von Sydow where are you???). Do I need go on? My advice is to avoid this bore and rent or buy the Kubrick masterpiece that is THE SHINING(Which I gladly give 5 stars!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amityvill Horror is right!","review":"This movie is stupid and dull. Not to mention laughable special effects. I have seen more done with less! I especially hated the way we had to fall back on the marrital relations yet again.

Based on a true story is misleading, as you think some events cannot happen, but some events could happen. The movie does have a nice 70's feel to it, but as it being a true story-highly unlikely. It uses \\"remake\\" effects to get scares, and that makes it unbearable. Remake effects meaning showing dead bodies in the room with the characters, something that doesnt happen in the orignal. Stuff guys crave to see, and scares there girl friends. I admit Teaxas Chainsaw Massacre from this guy was a little better because you saw Leatherface more, but this movie is limp and should have stuck to the orignal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercializing A Classic","review":"There seems to be a trend in Hollywood now where classic, psychological, intelligent horror films are dumbed down and made rediculus by giving them this big-budget remake treatment. This film lacks the creepy atmosphere of the original and requires no inteligence of the audiance. Rather than build a mood through true film-making techniques, this film relies upon fake looking computer effects to the point there is nothing to be afraid of because we are shown everything. The actors also seem wooden. The producers of this movie clearly wanted to just cash in on a famous story. I wish there were more original film-makers out there. If you're under 18 and like cheasy, trendy top-40 music and mindless fast paced action movies with no script, then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than the 70's Original, The Grudge, or Ring Two","review":"This is my kind of horror film and guess what? It is rated R for a change, the way these films are meant to be shown. Ryan Reynolds shows a very good range in acting here, pushing himself further away from that \\"Van Wilder\\" role and that is a good thing. My only complaint was that the film was a little short, running just under 90 minutes. They could have shown more family interaction in the scenes that we didn't see from Day 1 to Day 15. It just seemed a little rushed at times, but the scares were there and they did not disappoint. Ignore the critics this time around and just read the reviews here on Amazon from people like you and me (who haven't had are brains burned out from watching 10 movies a week like Roger Ebert). This is one worth checking out on the big screen and I will be buying the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...I actually sat through it","review":"I kept hoping it would get better and it never did. By looking at the box I thought I was going to be scared, so I was sort of hesitant about watching it. Nothing about this movie was scary, in fact it was more like a comedy. I thought that the boy that murdered his family was 20 years old and when you finally see his picture he looked like George's twin, with a beard and everything.Hahahaha. When George slapped Kathy I was hoping she would pick up something from the mantle and hit him over the head with it, but yet again I was let down. The woman selling the house was the only one with any sense. As soon as she got her money, she ran the hell away from that house.This movie perfectly shows what kind of idiot you would have to be to just sit around and wait for danger.Everytime something happened they just sat around scratching their heads.Please don't waste your time or your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't even a matter of opinion!","review":"Empirically, this movie [stinks]. The book itself turned out to be a hoax, but even still, had the movie simply stuck to the book, it would have been all it was ever meant to be -- scary. But there are so many red herrings, so many scenes where something terrifying turns out to be just a spouse walking into the room or the wind blowing, that impatience soon turns to exasperation. People actually thought this movie was frightening? Now THAT'S frightening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This movie wasn't that scary. It had its moments but wasn't that great. I had heard how scary is was but now I know it isn't. This is about a couple and their kids who move into a house that years earlier, had murders commited in it. Their isn't much action and the story is good, but they didn't go far with it. Don't waist your time with this. If you want a good haunted house story, see THE CHANGELING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give 0 if possible...","review":"Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad effects, bad editing, incoherent storyline, completely devoid of anything terrifying, and an anticlimactic ending. What else is there to say. See The Changeling instead if you actually want to be freaked out since this movie is nothing but a freakishly bad waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie actually PROVES the story is a hoax","review":"This is one of those amazing films where NOTHING seems to happen. Scene after scene of James Brolin acting rude and obnoxious, then some doors gets locked, cut to Steiger (a horrible performance) jawing about having the flu, then repeat. Eventually, the family leaves the house...that's it. Boring and relentlessly tepid and unfrightening. It's become common knowledge that the story is untrue, and this movie actually proves it by showing nothing that couldn't be produced by the Lutz's overactive imaginations, their broken heating systems (that's the truth, folks!), and George's need to get some cash. Three years later, this was practically remade as POLTERGEIST, a haunted house flick that deserves your hard-earned money a lot more than this poverty-row snore. Oh by the way, \\"Jodie\\" was actually the neighbor's cat, Evinrude, who liked to climb up trees and look in the windows of adjacent houses."},{"rating":"1","title":"For God's sake...get out of the theather","review":"I saw this movie for free and I want my money back. The screening I saw was filled with laughter at the trite dialog and \\"hand on the shoulder, oh, it's just my husband\\" fake scares. This movie was one of the worst I've seen this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I never saw the orignial Amityville Horror but I made a big mistake by watching the remake. Basically, a family moves into a haunted house and the father starts to become possesed by evil spirts. The evil spirts then slowly make him turn against his family. For me, the story moved at such a slow pace that by the time anything good happens, your watching the last twenty minutes of the movie. Also, it is obvious that something is wrong with the father way before you reach the climax. Any sane person would of left the house before things became critical. Wait a minute, isnt this supposed to be a horror movie? Arent't horror movies scary? The scariest thing about this movie was me realizing that I wasted my money on it. A movie that lacks reason, good acting, and pace should be avoided at all costs. However, if you must see this movie wait until it comes on cable. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Remake How Suprising..............","review":"I think Hollywood has ran out of Ideas that is why they keep doing remakes.I have not seen this movie and do not intend to. 1-You cannot simply cannot compare Texas Chainsaw, The Ring, to this movie I adored the original and that has gone down in History But all this hollywood crap of Horror Movies Really (...).................... 2-I'm sure this movie is predictable and has the same plot like every other remake a chilling little girl from what I read Phony Digital Gaphics and Untalented Actors. 3-The whole legend of the Amityville is extremely exagerrated. 4-I 'm sure that once it's release on dvd people who were so thrilled about when it came out will sell there dvd because they realize that it sucks and it's just like every other stupid modern horror that hollywood comes out with. Amazon will be loaded with and it will sell super cheap because I guarntee that this stupid remake will not go down in history as a Horror Classic........................"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated mumbo jumbo","review":"This film was a big hit back in 1979. Truth be told, it's one of the most overrated films of all time. First of all, the events in the movie did not happen. That's ok, most horror is fiction, but the book upon which the movie was based is so much better than this poorly produced flick, you might as well read the book. The only saving grace is the wonderful, creepy score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy then, and cheesy now","review":"Based on the allegedly non-fiction book (which has been proved a hoax), the Amityville Horror came off as a cheesy Exorcist rip-off back in 1979, and nothing has changed. James Brolin and Margot Kidder star as a couple who, along with their kids, move into a very, very haunted house, and of course, bad things start happening rather quickly. Rod Steiger appears out of nowhere as a priest who (of course) knows what's going on, and (of course) has the best demise in the film. Everything about the Amityville Horror is pure cheese; from the acting to the effects, with no real sense of horror in sight. Other horror flicks of this type, like Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper's original Poltergeist and Robert Wise's original Haunting, are much more worth your time. Amityville Horror was cheesy then, and it's still cheesy now, and the upcoming remake even looks better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic.GET OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I rate this movie Good to Excellent.A few scenes sent chills down my spine and gave me goosebumps,now that's what i call a good horror movie.Never will forget that line that Kidder said 'She Was Shot In The Head'.A very well picked cast and Margot Kidder really a HOT Babe.When i look at James Brolin what comes to mind is Dr.Kiley from Marcus Welby M.D. what a transformation.I recommend this movie if you want some old-fashioned thrills and chills.An American Classic with a cool twin windows title logo,who can forget that."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLU RAY REVIEW - One of the best blu ray titles for a 70's movie yet","review":"Once I purchased this Blu ray and watched it, I had sold my standard dvd version simply because seeing this on a 1080P was stunning in the day scenes. the colors were very bright and vivid, unlike the standard dvd where colors were very dull. most of the film was filmed in the house so it will be mostly dark and not as sharp and colorful but still a HUGE step up from the normal dvd. Id say this is one of the top older horror films that they did a good job on remastering with the blu ray besides my First pick which is Poltergeist which is another review in its own but you have to pick that up too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still gives me shivers","review":"I went to go see this movie in the theaters with my three best friends. I can say this is the only scary movie that scared the living crap out of me. I even cried at one part along with one of my other friends. The part where George Lutz kills the family dog in the boat house. Being an animal lover, I couldn't stand to see an animal being killed, even my friend. I remember coming out of the theater shaking and looking pale. But I could still not get this movie out of my head, IT ROCKED! I cant wait till it comes out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darned Scarey","review":"This is one of the better haunted house tales made in the 70's. I wouldn't bother with the sequels. Kidder and Brolin are cute newlyweds who try to hang on to their sanity as they begin to realize that their new house is evil. The incidents start out as curious and frustrating, growing more demonic as the movie progresses. Steiger as the priest has a no-so-subtle encounter when he first visits the house. His performance is over the top and a treat to watch. The 70's pacing might be too slow for today's audiences. The story was supposed based on fact, but in later years we find that the whole thing was a hoax. When I first saw it at the theatres (and thought there was some truth to it), it seemed a lot more frightening. It is still a good example of effective story-telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to jump.","review":"This is a straight out, no apologies horror film. It features a very strong and central lead performance from Ryan Reynolds but its true purpose is to scare. It does so almost from the beginning. The back story of the house is quite clever, even though it cribs from Poltergeist. Girls will scream, guys will jump and everyone will have a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"What conceivable reason could there be for making this movie? We all basically know the story and we all know that the \\"true story\\" behind it is bogus. Moreover, the movie isn't all that long--about 80 minutes not including the credits. This is basically enough to skim through the story without any real depth or development. The acting is fairly mediocre--the babysitter being the exception--and can't say much for the dialogue either. In the end, not all that frightening, and not really worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An improvement from the original","review":"The newest virsion of the Amityville Horror goes more in depth about the history of why the home is so demonic.

I'm astounded that some reviewers gave this numerous stars. As a horror buff, this is one of the worst films I've encountered. Scary? Nope. So bad it's good? Nope. Just plain bad. Why can't modern directors create mood anymore? While production values are strong -- with some fine camera work -- this mess isn't in the least bit involving. The priest is little more than a cameo, the ending is lame, and while I didn't expect the walls to run blood like in the original, there was nothing comparable. Worst part? Killing the dog.

In the end, nothing happens. Frankly the Simpson's Halloween special parody of this film is better than the original... which leads to the next point, there is very little in this which is original - much of it is taken straight out of other horror films that were made shortly before it. A few moments are lifted as is intact...Plot holes abound... things are introduced which are never resolved, characters are brought in who ultimately serve no purpose... thoroughly disappointing.The title \\"The Amityville Horror\\" is self referential in a quite unintentional way.The dvd transfer is nice enough though should you actually wish to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the clock radio made me do it!!!","review":"re-make of the not so great original has The Lutz Family, husband George Lutz played by Ryan Reynolds (Blade: Trinity, The Alarmist) and Mrs. Lutz played by Melissa George (Tv's Alias, Sugar & Spice). They move in and find out that there was a murder that happened in that house. Soon, things start to boil up as the man of the house, George Lutz hears voices to tell him to kill his family because they are demons. \\"House's dont kill people, people kill people.\\" explains George. Mrs. Lutz thinks something array as she sees her husband is transforming into a monster. Not much fun really, just like the original with some pretty boring blood splattering moments though Reynolds is very confincing in his psycho-possessed performance and some pretty good direction. Also starring Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) as the priest. Michael Bay Produced and he also did Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I have no clue why he produced that and this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Done","review":"Even as an early 80's late 70's movie, this movie is still a very sub par film because it lackes the fear and scare scenes that a lot of this era's movies dish out.

Poorly acted and directed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS a hoax...geez","review":"Okay first and most important, the movie itself isn't all that bad. For the time period when it came out it was, in fact, pretty decent. It is a pretty good ghost-like story (I won't go into details as most people know them).But one thing that bothers me is the hoax vs not a hoax thing.The house is REAL....the murders are REAL....the tale of the haunting is 100% a hoax!

This reimagining is so altered that it has nothing to do with the original true story by Jay Anson (which is way better than both films combined). This movie was absolute torture to sit through, suspensless amatureish direction, laughable canned dialogue, annoying manipulative musical score, cliches, cliches, cliches and more cliches until you just want to bash your head against a wall.

You'll be truly disappointed and will feel that your money has been wasted. If I could've, I'd've given this film no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a classic?","review":"I was really disappointed by this film. It's considered a horror classic, so I felt the need to watch it, but for your sake, don't bother. It's way too long, had sub plots that don't go anywhere, the scariest moments happen in the first 2 minutes, and doesn't have any original ideas that weren't done better BEFORE this film was made. Skip it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary!!","review":"I 1st saw this movie in 1979-1980 and It's still as scary now as it was then. Great plot that follows the book very well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay-I guess","review":"Okay, so the effects weren't as up to date as they are now and maybe the acting did suck. But I thought that this was an okay movie. I heard from other people that the book explains more than the movie does and it goes into greater detail. My little story that goes with this movie was that I was watching the movie with a bunch of my friends. When it got to a really scary part, everyone was so intense that when the lady on the movie said, \\"Hell,\\" the power went out! It was so freaky and everyone laughed afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"who says a remake can't be as good as the first one,this is proof that they can(they both stink)","review":"yet another remake of yet another movie that no one has wanted. wake up hollywood,where is the creative spark you once had. are thing so bad that you have to remake movies insted of coming up with something fresh?you know the plot,you know what's going to happen,and with the exception of ryan reynolds who turns in a fine proformance.other than that this is one lame duck of a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"I have to say that I didn't watch the original \\"Amityville Horror\\" movie, but when I watched this it totally freaked me out. It has a lot of suspense and terrifying scenes.The one complain I have about this movie is that the actor they chose to play George Lutz looks like the other actor they chose to play Ronald DeFeo that appeared in the beginning of the movie a lot! For some seconds I was confused and I thought that Lutz was DeFeo.The special effects are really, really good, and the make up in the actors is very well done, like Jodie's make up when she's already dead, or the scene when Chelsea walks on the house's roof...those are very good and intense scenes.I watched this expecting something and I wasn't dissapointed at all, when I watched it. I can recommend it to everybody who loves horror and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"The acting is good, but it can't make up for a really, really bad script. Shame on Michael Bay. I expected much better of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 cents","review":"I saw the original on TV (so heavily edited). I realy didn't find this movie scary or any of the characters apeallng. I didn't care if they were about to die or whatever. I would have found it more interesting if they did more with the reason what happened, happened(I don't want to give to much away, forgive my vagueness).Michael Bay produced the Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I thought was horrible. If you liked that, you might not like this, not very much gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair to poor","review":"Generally good acting, especially by Rod Steiger, and sexy shots of Margot Kidder, but an uninteresting slow unresolved story about a haunted house with copies of scenes from Poltergeist and The Exorcist."},{"rating":"1","title":"better than the remake,butthat doesn't mean it's good","review":"i swear that the summer i read the novel it rained everyday i would read. the movie,well to be kind,is just no good. at no time was i ever scared like i was reading the book. the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack which is spooky."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because they won't let me give it zero","review":"I never realized the awesome talent that Michael Bay wields. In the span of one picture, he manages to rip off The Shining, The Ring, The Blair Witch Project, Hellraiser . . . oh, yeah, and The Amityville Horror. I now understand why I've always avoided seeing his movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"Personally, I thought this movie was very well done and enjoyed it. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies, specifically ones that are a little scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does \\"The Horror\\" still stand up after 30 years?","review":"The answer is \\"overall\\" is yes! \\"The Amityville Horror (1979)\\" is still a great film exploring the supernatural, and the existence of ghosts and hell itself. Even discounting that, watching James Brolin's acting performance of his dissent in madness is equally still disturbing and yet somehow fun too for us out in the world with a dark sense humor. A title definitely worth owning in the library of all horror aficionados."},{"rating":"1","title":"horror flick","review":"For it's time, it may have been more impressive, but I thought it lacking in plot and without much \\"horror\\" so I'm giving it only two stars. If you must see it, rent, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Version not great","review":"This is one of my all time favorite horror movies. The movie is very suspenseful and has some great scenes. It actually has a plot which is unusual for many horror films back in the 80's. I too agree that this DVD was way too much. I would have liked more extras for the price. Also the music was just wrong. After being terrified by the music in the VHS version it would have been nice to have it on the DVD. The dance music at the beginning was all wrong and took away the scariness of the first scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked!","review":"Genre: HorrorGenre Grade: B+Final Grade: C+This movie had a fair share of \\"jumpy\\" moments and frights, but in the end failed to offer any substantial plot or story. While it was better than the original, it had potential to be much better, but it was not. Ryan Reynolds failed to prove himself as a serious actor (if only because of his sarcastic voice), although Melissa George did a good job playing a freaked out mother and wife.I would, however, recommend this film if you're looking to see an entertaining horror movie. The story might not give you much closure and the best parts of the movie seemed to be ignored for cheaper thrills, but it is still an entertaining horror flick.And it's a good idea to not say \\"Katch 'em, Kill 'em!\\" to your girlfriend in a dark raspy voice after seeing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mild entertainment.","review":"Fans of the original might want to avoid this. Rent \\"Amityville 2: The Possession\\" if you want to see something really scary. It depicts the Defeo family's story (preceding the Lutz's), and includes one of the most frightening scenes I've yet seen in a movie.The story about the evil missionary was sort of interesting. It just wasn't scary, unfortunately. It sounds like it could be an interesting idea for a better filmmaker. Also, I think it would have worked better to not have such an explanation of the presence, unlike the mystery in the first film.The whole film had an unrealistic, fantastical, sci-fi channel quality, which just doesn't work for a supposedly true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Well I wasn't sure what to expect considering it's an old movie and is now on DVD but needless to say I was happily surprised. I was just as scared watching it as I was the first time I watched it. It's very clear and totally worth the buy. The music still gives me chills sometimes haha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was...OKAY","review":"After watching this film the only question I have is...WHY? Why was this film even remade? Nothing changed. The script is bland. The dialogue is boring. Nobody dies....except the family dog. It felt like such a waste of time to watch this. There's some mediocre suspenseful moments, but in spite of the gory images, the film is actually tame. As a director if you have an R rated film, you need to go all out! Don't give us the typical Hollywood happy ending crap. The only good thing about the film is the acting. Everyone did an outstanding job of really becoming their characters. If you happen to be a Ryan Reynolds fan, maybe you'll want to watch the movie. But if you've seen the original Amityville, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"This is the most deepest and scariest horror-movie i have ever seen.

See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"downloaded to show wife","review":"she didn't know about the original movie. she only about the sequeal that came out years later..scared her good.

I'm not dogging the acting or the music score, but the story itself seemed unfinished. Why have sub-stories if your not going to finish them? I love classic horror, and like 90% of the old AIP Pictures, but this one just left me sitting there saying \\"What a Waste\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was reading the reviews for this movie and was wondering if these people watched the same movie that I did. It was one of the worst movies that I've seen. Half way through I wanted to turn it off. It was not scary and it was far off from the orignal. I wasn't feeling the girl ghost Jodie and thought it was better as the demonic pig. The best way they tried to scare you was to have things pop up really quick to make you jump which didn't work. I could barely keep my eyes open. Also in the end he goes crazy kinda like Jack Nicholson in The Shining but a way crappier version. I wish I give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame ain't quite saying it right","review":"I love the original version of \\"The Amityville Horror,\\" and I even have a sneaky fondness for \\"Amityville II,\\" and boy, did I hope this one was going to be great. I figured it had a shot, since the remakes of both \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" turned out well.Uh uh.There is not one single -- NOT ONE SINGLE -- scare in the entire movie. There are lots of attempts, each of them backed by a musical stinger. None of them work.The movie is, at 89 minutes, over before it begins, with no time allotted to immerse the viewer in this house, to make the audience feel what it is like to be in a place that just isn't quite right.The acting is good; that's the best thing I can say. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George do very well, and it's a shame the movie doesn't manage even to meet them halfway.This is a lame, crappy piece a crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie was even worse then the first one. What was it all the actors in it were saying that it was going to be more true to the book? WRONG the only thing that was like the book was the name Jodi, and even that was a lie, none of the Defoe children was named Jodi. That was an insult and the living Defoe family should sue over. the lack of taste the writers and producer had to the memory of this family that lost their lives there. The Lutzes should sue as well. This was far from the book and if the story was true...the book i mean it was not like this at all. No pig--that was what Jodi was...no red room. Nothing at all. This was just a bad horror movie and was so stubid. I'm just glad I was able to download it off the computer and not have spent any money seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly pointless remake of a great movie","review":"I loved the original Amityville Horror , never saw the sequels , but could not have expected a total dasterdly remake of a film so good you want to watch it again and again. Don't see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please...","review":"In this \\"chiller\\" about a family who move into a haunted house (that's basically the entire plot), the only thing that's scary is how bad it is! While it does have a few good scenes, it really doesn't generate too many chills. The so/so effects are sometimes laughable and the acting isn't that good at all. You won't be missing out on much if you skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"WRONG!

Little did I know that I would come out so shocked. Ryan Reynolds was so believable as George Lutz, a man that moves into the Amityville house with his family knowing that it is haunted. Melissa George was alright as a scared and somewhat traumatized mother of three kids. The scariest parts of the movie were when George starts to become possesed and are all scenes that are based aroung him as well. The ending is one of a kind but the fact that I have never seen the orignal led me to the somewhat scary ending. The scenes that will have you jumping the most is the ending scenes in the rain. I would strongly recommend not seeing the original because it will give away the ending of this brilliantly captured horror flick. The film though is definitely different from the original and has a new and fun aspect spun upon it from as I said earlier Ryan Reynolds' performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as fun as watching a fly buzz around your face.","review":"James Brolin and Margot Kidder are newly weds who find out their quaint house is...gasp...haunted! Unbelievably boring movie is packed full of laughably silly moments and revelations that make no sense, and Brolin increasingly appears more and more like Charlie Manson throughout the film! This is as bad as haunted house films get."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD STORY + BAD ACTING = A REALLY BAD FILM","review":"THE AMITYVILLE HORROR in my opinion is an example of how bad a movie can be. JAMES BROLIN and MARGOT KIDDER are awful as the couple that moves into what seems to be a nice house turned nightmare they act like they're bored to death and it shows. The effects are awful in this film too just watch and you'll see what I mean so in my opinion avoid THE AMITYVILLE HORROR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Scary!","review":"This is psychologically, and physically scary film!

Defimnitly in the top 5 of haunted house movies made. And I've seen all of them. The house itself is very creepy and makes this movie.

I think it is a very good horror movie,but it should of been a whole lot better!I just read the book and it is ten times more scary!The movie leaves so much out & don't tell the whole story as it happened.If they would of kept to the book better this film would be an untouchable horror flick!They change a few details for drama, but this took away from the story.forget dramatizing the film,if the book does tell the truth,then what happens in the book is enough to scare you silly! maybe someday they will remake the movie and stick exactly to the book! that would be a dream come true! but anyhow the movie is scary enough to enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine","review":"This film isn't the best in acting but when the characters are scared then they play those scenes pretty well but other times are not the best.If these events are a hoax then why would the family leave their home and never reclaim their stuff?The film was a hit in the time of its release it made more money than Alien did since they came out about the same time Amityville grossed in at about 86 million dollars domestic now that tells you that the people liked it pretty much and the film even earned an Academy Award nomination for best original score by Lalo Schifrin. This is the kind of film to watch on a rainy night."},{"rating":"1","title":"A remake that shouldn't have been done.","review":"This remake was bad!

However, I can tell you this product is drinkable. The flavor, while not yummy by any definition, is not offensive. It tastes like grass or (if you've ever tried it) alfalfa. The mixture was a bit gritty (after shaking it with 8-10 oz of water) but not unpalatable. The other brand that I tried was much grittier, so I would recommend this one to the brave souls interested in powdered green foods. Also, keep in mind i initially tried it with a FruitWater (basically plain water with just a hint of lime flavor and sugar). When i mixed it with pomegranate juice the flavor was barely noticeable, though the grit remained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Vibrance","review":"I have tried several \\"Super Green Food\\" products, but I feel this is one of the very best for the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you glow!

Overall after 2 weeks of consistant use I have experienced no increase in energy or any other benefit.Instead of leaving with a negative review saying how I like other products better without mentioning them like others often do, I will recommend to you NitroGreens by Biotics Research, it is a much better product.

Nevertheless, after a couple of weeks, my navel itched non-stop. I checked myself: same soap, same bubble bath, same laundry detergents, etc. The only new thing in my life was this product. I stopped taking it and the navel stopped itching in less than 48 hours. Several months have passed with no more itching. It could just be me so that's why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1.

Each song offers something different in sound and flavor. Other reviews already spell out all the specifics of who is playing and what they do, so I won't be redundent.

Wonderful, slow bluesy stuff, with the occasional upbeat number.

For her, she doe not need to hold the baby up while she is in the carrier, yes her head bobs a little as she still is just getting past newborn stage, but the baby loves the carrier.

Prior to this- we tried putting our daughter in it from time to time- and while she fell asleep in it once, most of the time she fussed...which is sad b/c my daughter is really even tempered.

With the enthusiasm of a kid who nibbles at the broccoli but can't wait to stuff the potatoes and gravy into his mouth. With this in mind, if you want to look at a similar book (that is much better) I would point you towards the rare \\"King, Queen, Knave\\" by Vladimir Nabokov, or the equally rare, \\"The Temptation Of Eileen Hughes\\" by Brain Moore: both available at amazon.com ....The only \\"good\\" thing about The Good Soldier is that he only blabs on for a little over 200 pages.Go ahead, kill me on your votes now...... honesty on my part is worth it.

Absurd characters wandering through a tedious story about the accomodations that people make in order to be perceived as \\"proper\\" in their social, cultural and religious milieu."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Read","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book as, being an ebook, it comes without the usual blurb on the cover. I had heard it was excellent so decided to read it 'sight unseen'. It turned out to be quite different from what I was expecting, the title being somewhat misleading.I thoroughly enjoyed it though the text was peppered with small typos, eg hime for him and hear for heart. These typos did not ruin my enjoyment of this examination of a tragic love affair set in the early 1900s. It is told in non-chronological order flashback form. The story slowly unfolds and as the characters develop the first impression of them is slowly turned on its head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great literature, I'm told","review":"I did not enjoy the writing style at all. Book club member selected it, fewer than half of us were able to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good Soldier","review":"~I found the book quite puzzling especially the character of the narrator which was cold and lacking in emotion. I wondered about the point of the narrator. The book was like a flow of consciousness and some sections had to be reread to try to get any meaning or sense. Here and there some wry humour, and some of the language was beautfiful though not always rational or clear. At times it all seemed chaotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the read","review":"The structure of the book was an innovation for its time.. and the characters are very real.

If you can deal with this shortcoming, it's just fine. AND the price is right! (free)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor book production","review":"This production of the novel is unreadable. Pages are almost square. Margins are narrow. Each line of type stretches too far from left to right.For readability, the standard rule is 60 characters per line. The lines here are about 85 characters. Short paragraphs are manageable, but there are many long paragraphs in this text. When the paragraphs run ten or twenty lines deep, it is very difficult to move from the end of one line back to the beginning of the next.Also, there is no copyright information or publisher name anywhere in this production. It's just a bunch of words with the author's name. The only hint is a note on the back page: Made in the USA, Lexington, KY, Jan 25, 2012 (two days ago). Obviously, it's a print-on-demand version. But how do I know it's the copyrighted version that the author actually wrote?I'm going to return it and buy a different production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangled Up In Deceit","review":"The Good Soldier is a story of the bizarre relationship between two couples seen through the eyes of an aggrieved husband. Captain Ashburnham's wife seems to control him by enabling his sexual affairs with various younger women. The narrator seems quite naive as he untangeles the deciept of all the parties involved. He seems to respect every one except his own wife. I would recommend taking notes as you read this. The story does notunfold in a chronilogical manner, a fact thenarrator apoligizes for throughout the story. A study in charactor motivation that may leave you scratching your head.This is not an easy read but if you are a Henry James or Grahme Greene fan you will probably like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jews Fight Too, a mid-20th century youth book","review":"I read this book, from my Hebrew school's library, in the early 1960s. Written for teens, as I recall, it details achievements of Jews, as fighters. I particularly remember stories of Jewish American soldiers. It's been a long time, but I remember enjoying the writing.Since the book was written shortly after World War II and the Israeli War for Independence, the concept of Jewish fighters was still novel. I believe that the writer intended it as an antidote, to the idea that all Jews were helpless victims.In the 50+ years, since the book was written, Israeli fighting prowess has been proven, over and over. However, these older stories are still interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, classic oldies","review":"Obviously the previous reviewer is far too young to remember Eric Burdon and The Animals.

The result is a mixture of documentary and docu-drama that reflects the great Soviet filmmaker's unique sensibilities and dramatic stylings. The story of the film's genesis is the subject of several books on the art of Eisenstein's cinema. The film is presented in a collage of segments that delve under the masks and into the layers of the mysterious Mexican soul. The film is a must if you are a Mexicophile or just a film buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of Mexico and Cold War Ideology","review":"Great Black and White footage from 1930s Mexico in a documentary/historical form from an alternative ideological eye.

Directors Aisha Bain and Jen Marlowe take the viewer on-site to Darfur, and through on-camera interviews with dozens of locals they let the people describe the tragedy in their own words. Their personal anecdotes are heart-breaking and appalling. The desert landscape, wind-swept and littered with bomb fragments, is stark. Despite its denials, the Sudanese government under president Omar al-Bashir has backed the Janjaweed militias to plunder, pillage, rape women of every age, and liquidate entire villages. According to the United Nations, 400,000 people have died, and over 2 million have been displaced (many refugees pouring into Chad). This documentary is only 55 minutes long, but it's a graphic, powerful and informative reminder of how much of the world can ignore the most unimaginable horrors when countries have no self-interest at stake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darfurians speak","review":"Dafur Diaries is indeed a Message From Home. This well crafted film tells the stories of the people caught up in the ongoing atrocities that define this poorly understood conflict.The film makers do not preach at the audience. Instead they exercise a degree of cinematic restraint by allowing the films subjects to tell their own stories. In doing so the Darfurians inform and educate.Because the film is so well crafted it is never boring. In fact it leaves you with a desire to know more about the people, the confict and the region. In the long run that is what the authors meant to accomplish and I believe that is the true measure of the success of this documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven' received it.","review":"Too bad, this was the reason for all of my order, but more then two months later I am still waiting for this dvd.

Definitely plan on purchasing more of their albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Note Johnnies","review":"WOW - This album is proof that even if you like one song on a CD, it does NOT mean you'll like the rest of their stuff. These songs (except for \\"Chasing Cars\\" which I still like) are SO MONOTONOUS and unimaginatively played! In each song, not only are the lyrics repetitive, but the music consists of phrases that are intoned again and again, without much variation. The drummer rarely plays any fills, but just keeps playing the same beat over...and over... and over... It makes for a truly boring listening experience. The comparisons to Coldplay are valid on only the most superficial level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre...at best","review":"With the exception of 'Chasing Cars,' there is little originality or variety on this album. Final Straw is much better, and significantly less depressing. The entire album is slow moving and morose in mood. Perhaps I need to listen to it more, but I find myself wanting to turn it off almost everytime I pop it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I rarely purchase a CD without listening to the entire album first. I've been burned too many times. I thought I'd take a chance on Snow Patrol, based on the strength of their single, \\"Chasing Cars\\". That was a mistake.Is it just me, or did every other melody sound exactly like the one before it? The lyrics were repetitive and mediocre. I feel that good music should make you feel *something*. Listening to this, I felt NOTHING.Well that's not true. I felt disappointed and annoyed for having wasted my money on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"below average for Snow Patrol","review":"I just gotta say that anybody who likes their early stuff and the Reindeer Section who says this album is good is being very forgiving. I listened to this album and just thought, \\"These guys want to make a whole lot of money.\\" This is especially disappointing since they have had up to this point such an authentic sensiblity. Like another reviewer said, you can play this for your family, or in your car and not be disgusted... BUT, for Snow Patrol, this is below average. The packaging seems appropriate: vaguely artsy, but meaningless, just like the music. And I'm not saying the music is meaningless just to be mean. It really felt meaningless to me, which makes me kinda sad, coming from Snow Patrol. I feel betrayed, or at least that they betrayed themselves. That said, there are some songs I like here, but none that knock me out, like on all their other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"A tragic disappointment. This should've been called the We sold out album. There are several radio friendly tracks. Lightbody has obviously worked hard to lose his heavy accent and the end product is bland and sounds just like everyone else. There's nothing distinct about this album. There are a couple of pathetic attempts to recapture the mood of their previous album but they fall flat. Sadly, they still have great lyrics, but they lack emotion. If you like the earlier sounds of Snow Patrol, don't waste you're time on this generic trash. This isn't the indy Scottish alternative sound you expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Well, their guitars are in tune. That's about all I can say about this creatively dull CD. It has all the syrup but none of quirk of Coldplay whom they seem to be emulating. It might be endearing if it wasn't so boring. I found myself yelling at the car stereo on track 10 \\"open your damn eyes already!\\" The one bright spot was 'Set The Fire To The Third Bar'at least it had some soul. The lyrics are probably the worst part except for the music - haven't these guys ever heard of a lead guitar? Seriously, I am majorly disappointed considering how impressed I was by an acoustic version of 'Chocolate' I heard on a local radio station. Gotta Go - I've already wasted too much of my life on this... yawn... err, what was I talking about??? Doesn't matter, see ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set the Fire to the 3rd Bar...wow, what an AMAZING song!!!!","review":"By judging the wave of reviews on this new snow patrol album, it becomes readily apparent that there is a new \\"tv\\" audience to Snow Patrol that wasn't there for the previous albums. To say that this album is monotonous or a one-hit album is straight blasphemy.Just one listen to \\"Set the Fire to the 3rd Bar\\" left me speechless. That is THE song of 2007 for me and we are not even there yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it - but that doesn't make it good...","review":"I somehow feel too biased to review this album... Snow Patrol and their music have meant so much to me for many years now, and I can't help but wonder if the fact that their early albums helped shape me as a person when I was younger makes me think this new album is the eighth wonder of the world without merit. Oh well. I loved it - granted, I caught myself comparing it to a Coldplay album on several occasions, though as far as I'm concerned, \\"Eyes Open\\" blows Coldplay out of the water. Gary Lightbody's lyrics are brilliant as always, and the duet with Wainwright was reminiscent of the Raindeer Section days. Then again, there I go projecting - Snow Patrol reminds me of too much for me to be objective. In short, this is a pointless review...I love this album. But I understand why others don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to this music","review":"You know what??? After hearing the song \\"Chasing cars\\" on the season finale of Grey's Anatomy I fell in love with the song and now that I have the album Snow Peas this music has touched me.

Give it a chance.","review":"The day I bought this cd I listened to it once and then put it away with the rest of my cds. No song really caught my attention except for \\"Chasing Cars.\\" A few days later, I took it out and gave it another chance. Then I started feeling something special about each of the songs. Now, I play it constantly on my iPod. I've grown fond of it. It took a few listens for me to really get into it and now I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It good enough","review":"I just wish these guys had a little more edge to them.

I wasn't really expecting to be impressed, as I figured it would either be too much like Final Straw or horribly different. While it does have its similarities, it also feels fresh and just as rewarding. Going back and listening to Final Straw is even better now that there is something to compliment it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I bought this CD because I'm a Grey's Anatomy fan, but love all the songs.

This is meek, watered down, radio friendly and unexciting. After two listens, yes there are a few decent songs but other than that...go buy Final Straw if you haven't heard 'em and are interested. I was wondering why it was so cheap. Unoading it to the naive or hopeful I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scourge of coldplay","review":"This music annoys me.

With my experience with this purchased I will not be ordering again and time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"When I saw on Napster that Snow Patrol had a new release, I sat in front of the computer for an hour. Final Straw has to be one of the most perfect albums ever released, but this doesn't even sound like the same band (much less the same singer). Talk about generic, the opener \\"You're all I have\\" is so standard, with obvious lyrics and and the same 3 chords, you'd think 13 year olds would have written it in their garage. Nothing grabs you on this disc, and when it does, something goes horribly wrong. On \\"Shut your eyes\\" the spare guitar line reels you in, and the lyrics are intensely intimate; an entreaty only to you, the listener. Then the entire chorus of 20 people (not professional singers) enters the scene and ruins the mood. The rest is bland, bland, bland. \\"It's beginning to get to me\\" is a bright spot, though, but not enough to save this repetitive non-effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken case","review":"I know that this may be the the fault of the shippers, but the case that the CD came in had a significant crack in it.

With that being said, this is an overall good album (3.5 stars) that starts off great but then gets a little boring near the end. The first song \\"Your All I Have\\" is a great, rocking song that starts the album off on a good foot. A few mixture of slower and a power ballad (indie rock style) songs here and there smooths out the album. But the last couple of songs on the album get to be a little dull and monotonous. The decent lyrics are superceded by the great vocal talents of the singer. The music is nothing ground breaking but will definitely keep you going. Friends of Colplay and Sebadoh will dig this album.Got to see this band play with Athlete in the Tampa Bay area and they were great. They put on a good and entertaining show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up","review":"I don't mind this album. It's got some PRETTY good songs, but it doesn't compare to Final Straw in the least.Final Straw just transported me to another musical plateau. I guess you could call it a concept album in a way. It did tell a story about a relationship from start to finish & it was BRILIANT. The whole thing was just a rollercoaster ride of emotions & feelings.Eyes open just sounds to me like the same old stuff you hear from other bands. I find little originality in it. Lightbody even sounds like he's bored while he's singing these songs.Very disappointing. It's beginning to seem to me like they took the commercial route maybe due to management's advice, to gain more exposure than \\"Final Straw\\" did with the typical results. The new album did gain wider exposure & sales, but it's ORDINARY. C'mon guys, you can do so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh....the disappointment","review":"Well, I will keep this brief. I usually would not write one of these, but I feel like I may be able to help someone out. If you loved Final Straw, chances are you will be shocked how this album is NOTHING like that one. I was highly anticipating this new album, ran out to get it on the 9th....after trying to see the bright spots in the album for some time, I have to say there really aren't any. The whole thing is bland. Where are all the great lyrics and sounds I know they can create? Here's hoping they get it right on the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Snow Patrol, I really do. Final Straw is a great album and it made me go out and buy their older stuff (that I could find). I even saw them last year at Coachella and was really impressed by their live show.But this album is really disappointing.It's really produced, to the point where it seems like the question when recording it was \\"how do we make this song appeal to the most people?\\" There's an edginess that's lost on this album. To that end, it doesn't feel as sincere, either.The vocals are probably the easiest to point to, as what once sounded like heartfelt indie rock now seems like light rock crooning.I had high hopes for Snow Patrol -- and for this album -- but those hopes weren't realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Patrol's best!!","review":"This is my favorite Snow Patrol album.

All concert videos should be shot in widescreen like High Grass Dogs is. You really get the sense that you are in the Fillmore looking at the entire stage rather than just a portion of it. The director also manages to bring out the personality of the Fillmore by letting a camera roam around the hallways and back rooms between songs. Petty and the Heartbreakers turn in an incredible performance taking songs mainly from their last 3 albums but with enough classics to please everybody. And never once does the band look like they are performing for the cameras. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, BAD, EDITING!","review":"I JUST FINISHED VIEWING THIS DVD.

Remember the \\"Pack Up The Plantation\\" tape from the mid-80's? Great show. Amazing energy from the band, excellent setlist, and TP in his prime. Plus it was energetically directed, with great shots of all the band members, back up singers, etc...One of the best concert videos ever. Compared to that, and many other live concerts on the market, this one is a drag. Overall it's a lackluster performance, the camerawork, editing, and overall pace of the production is sluggish. The greatest insult is the cutaways of individual bandmembers that are not even in sync with the soundtrack. Tht tells me that this show was undershot, and consequently over edited. Essentially sucking the life out of what was probably a good show in person, but feels amd looks tepid on DVD. One highlight: The inclusion of \\"Listen to Her Heart\\".

It is a joy to watch and if you're a woman you'll love how Julia's character and her sister take their power.

Callie Khouri writer of Thelma and Louise is the writer and it was great to see another great film written by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice comedy, worth watching.","review":"Something to Talk About is the sort of movie that is saved by the cast. If it had not been for the work of people like Roberts, Duvall, Quaid, Sedgwick and others, this movie would hardly have been worth watching. Especially Kyra Sedgwick did a wonderfull job, but than she had all the good lines. Good work with the horses too and Dennis Quaid shows a surprising talent in handling children. The story itself is not very special, but the actors make the best of it, producing a pleasant comedy with rather more points of interest than is usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fall Movie","review":"I love Julia Roberts and Gena Rowlands. Kyra Sedgewick is in this one as well. The film is awesome. It has an awesome plot and the setting is beautiful. The horses provide a good sub-plot to the main marital-problem part of the movie. Kyra plays my favorite character, Grace's fiesty sister. Her quips are fantastic and Julia Roberts and Quaid totally make their roles beleivable. It's a cute, funny, drama--who knew they still existed?

Duvall wants to know if she got into the \\"Apple Wahn\\"... If anyone comes away from this one without being entertained, they ought to get out and about a little bit more! Sedgwick and Roberts resemble one another enough to pass for sisters.I'm surprised that they haven't been teamed up as sisters for a project that could lead to sequels.I think someone is missing the boat! (They're only two years apart in age, Sedgwick being the senior.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent cast/performance BUT foul language overwhelms!!!","review":"Although Julia is ALWAYS Julia, & sister Kyra Sedgwick is superb, the foul language served no purpose in advancing the questionable storyline.

There is not one exercise here that is in the Pilates matwork routine. The moves are all Yoga based with a Pliates influence.I bought this DVD as a supplement to the Pilates book by Brooke Siler... and was highly disappointed.. !

Fisher (the second author) so much as admited that his book is the best because it is the only CSET book currently available. Both the book and the course fall far short of the material covered on the actual exam. I am a past MSAT taker and 1st time passer-- I unfortunately have the pleasure of having my MSAT score not count due to new CA regulations, and was confident that the information required for CSET success was less than that required for MSAT due to the oversimplifications in the Bobrow and Fisher text and course.Should I have to take the test again I will utilize more specific content materials. Perhaps, AP course materials are better suited to study?Good luck. I hope you find a better study guide than this one. Please, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book helped me pass","review":"Okay if you are relying on this or any book you are probably not going to pass but this book served me very well. I passed all three sections of the test on the same day on my first try. But this book wasn't the sole reason for that. This book served its purpose to remind me of all the things I learned in my cred. Program, isn't that it's purpose? All these negative reviews saying that it is missing stuff or it needs more content need to grow up and realize that the CSET is suppose to test everything that you learned in a 4-5 year BA and cred program, thats not going to be in one book. I love this book and I wouldn't have passed without because I have been out of college for 8 years and needed REMINDING of all these topics. Lets be honest the people who can't pass the CSET after 3-10 times should find a different profession, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TeachingSolutions is a SCAM","review":"Sadly I made the same mistake a couple of the other reviewers did and purchased there product. To start with the web site shows a picture of a book, CD rom and a Cassette tape. What you get is a PDF file that you then have to print out. The extra coaching they promote is also a joke. It costs you $20 bucks but what you get is a Email address that you can send questions to. Unless you have money to flush down the toilet dont bother with they product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I PASSED the CSET using this book!","review":"I just passed the CSET using this book as my study guide. I gave it only 4 stars because I found the way that some of the information was presented (history and science) was very dry and hard to remember. I used the Everything You Need to Know About ______ Homework series by Zeman and Kelly as additional resources. They came in handy for the material I found a bit harder to study for (history and science). It does provide 2 practice tests which are beneficial to take to get an idea of how the test is laid out and how fast you need to move to get through the test to finish in time. You can take all 3 subtests at the same time and pass if you use this book and study hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak study guide - Could Be Better","review":"I don't know what all the hype is about, especially from the poster above. The book is an abbreviated, outline version of what you need to know.You HAVE to do your own studying, and look into buying other books (4th, 5th Graders, Boosalis, etc). I too was SHOCKED when I first purchased this book and flipped through the pages. The stuff you need to know is nowhere near the exam itself, not to mention that Cliffs test itself are a total flop ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same material as previous MSAT book... and typos","review":"I was given this book as part of a test prep class, and had to supplement its contents with extensive outside reading -- consider the Hirsch books, the \\"Everything You Need to Know About...\\" series from Scholastic, online encyclopedias, and the Usborne published books to up your knowledge.Also, I discovered by accident that much of this book is copied VERBATIM from the Bobrow-published MSAT study guide. Even though the test is supposedly different, and the science supposedly easier, this book is almost identical to the MSAT test prep book. Which makes you wonder why they couldn't fix the numreous typos between publications...Haven't taken the CSET yet, but I know I wouldn't feel prepared relying on this book alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"Wasted my valuable time using this and the Kaplan guide (which I have given an equally bad review...) The practice tests are NOTHING like the real thing. The actual multiple choice questions were far more difficult than anything the guide prepared me for. As I anxiously await my results, for subtest I and III, I plan on taking a prep class for subtest II. My advice is don't waste precious time and money on this....BIG thumbs done."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"Read the previous reviews and did not use Cliffs Test Prep but instead used everything need to know 4, 5, 6th grades.

The test was very long and draining took all 5 hours for the three subtests. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money and Time","review":"The review sections of this book are completely worthless. For instance, for the Communications/Media/Drama review section there is only 2 pages of the most basic terms, that any idiot would know what they mean. And for the Literacy/Language section, there is only about 8-9 pages focusing primarily on grammar and not the type of linguistic concepts that appear on the real test. The Literature section is equally weak, with only the most general of timelines and glossaries. I wouldn't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH PLEASE HELP!","review":"This has been a disappointing year! I now have to take the tests again. I DID NOT PASS.

So, if you buy it...I wish you well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Outline...Not A Good Source","review":"The theory of organization in this book was good, but in practice it was a disaster. The book includes subtests to show you your trouble areas, which I thought was helpful. however, the actual review sections are poorly put together and leave out a lot of crucial information. It doesn't explain, but rather just gives vague statements and drawings. On one of the sample questions it talks about what a paper will look like after being folded and cut in a certain way. As an explanation for this answer, the authors simply state to cut it out and see for yourself. Well, that's not very a practical explanation as you can't do that during the test. I haven't gotten my scores back from the CSET yet, but it was ugly that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment and waste of money","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment ever. Not only is the CSET a stupid test to begin with but this book does everything but give you an idea of what to expect on the test.

Do everything you can to avoid buying this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same material as OLD MSAT","review":"The Cliff's Notes covered the basic material of the new CSET, but I thought it wasn't as thorough as it should of been. The CSET test had questions that were not covered on this book. The route I took was to read some of Hirsch's work. It helped out more than the Cliff's. Also if you are a new CSET test taker, don't purchase any of the products from teaching solutions. I just read about it on the internet that it is a scam and a bogus product. I had just got mine, and I could tell you to save your money.

First off the mixing is dreadful;Blackmore's guitar is drowned out by the keyboards throughout. It also suffers from the same problem as Deep Purple's equally boring 'Made In Japan',possibly one of the most overrated live albums ever, in that the long extended versions of the tunes just meander, not going anywhere. If you want the line-up with Dio,stick with the superior studio albums. I think the were much better and more concise with Graham Bonnet and Joe Lynn Turner. This one's for completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest live albums ever recorded","review":"This album is absolutly awsome. The live versions of every song on the album tower above the studio recordings, (I still love the studio recordings). Man on the silver mountain is played at least twice as fast as the original and really puts it to shame. Catch the rainbow features Not only dio performing flawlessly, but also cozy powell tearing up the drum set. Dio as he often does throws in extra verses and esspecially in this song the are unbelievable. 16th century greensleeves is another highlight, Blackmore really drives the riff at you hard. I can't say enough about this album, any dio fan or rainbow fan must have this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Rainbow","review":"One of Rainbow's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM.

This live recording shows them at their peak.Usually, live rock recordings do not do justice to the music. In this case, all versions of the songs recorded are actually better, *much* better than the original studio recordings. The band is nothing less than epic in its proportions.Mixing quality of this recording is excellent. All tracks are long, much longer than the studio versions-- hence eight or nine songs on what was once a double record set (or now a fairly long CD).If you love rock 'n' roll guitar, and particularly if you love Ritchie Blackmore's rock 'n' roll guitar, then you will love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING- NOT A CD","review":"There are two versions of this album for sale on Amazon.

It's an amazing story of what a woman had to go through while fighting the problems that came with her husband's crack addiction. If you have ever felt overwhelmed to the point of giving up, read this book. The things this author endured are truly amazing and no human should be subjected to the challenges she faced in this period of her life. She didn't give up though. She got through it and tells exactly what kept her going in this book. Whether it's a drug addiction or any other difficulty, Cynthia Hunter is proof that you can get through it and that happiness really is right around the corner. This is a very moving book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story of survival and triumph","review":"This is an amazing story written in a raw style that clearly depicts the agony and pain of living with a crack addicted spouse. Cindy's story sheds light on what happens when you continue to try and believe that people in the control of drugs will change. Working her way through an unbelivably abusive relationship while raising her young son and trying to care for her unborn child is a testament to what can be done not matter your station in life. She pulled herself from a living hell and took control of her life in order to create some order. The work she is now doing to help others in relationships ruled by the iron fist of drug addiction is commendable and they style and tenor of this book done any other way would just not be as impactful. Take the time to read this book, it will give you a look inside the world of drugs, abuse and show you how there is always light in your darkest hour. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"Very well written. It was one of those books that when you start reading it it's hard to put down.

The only way this can happen is if SHE was the crack addict and not the husband!!!! I have no sympathy for this lying manipulative woman who is now whoring her story for money. Research the facts, a baby cannot be born addicted to crack unless the mother has been using it! I feel no remorse for this woman and threw the book away immediately. I want my money back. This woman is a liar and gets no sympathy from me. Her kids deserved to be taken from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, very dissapointed","review":"I bought this book, started reading, was amazed it ever got published, put it down, picked it up again and reconfirmed my opinion. I thought the writing was simple and pedantic. Her story didn't add up in some cases. (she's slicing him up in the kitchen and her brother doesn't wake up?,)It spoke to a limited group, primarily black women living in the hood. I work with these women, they're not going to read this book. I found the vernacular to be pandering. There was no hope in this book. I found myself more frustrated than connected with the author. I wanted to hear about her journey of self-discovery, God-discovery and all I read was \\"poor me\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"average book with a great message","review":"I don't mean no disrespect to the author. I think she had good intentions for writing this book. I just think that as a writer, she missed the mark.After reading the reviews, I went out and bought the book,expecting a good read. What I got instead was a preachy self help book.I think that this book is good for people who may have had problems with drugs or have with dealt with addicted spouses. But for those of us who are looking for a good read, this is not the book for you. It's not a page turner, it not a book you try to stay up late to finish reading. In fact, I didn't even finsh reading the book. The preachy messages after the diary entries were just too annoying and distracting. The messages should have been saved for the ending or epilogue.For an exciting novel about drugs, I would recommend Crack Head by Lisa Lennox or Harlem Girl Lost.

The Boxcar Children series appeals to most children so I purchased Snowbound Mystery without realizing that it was a comic book format. The child was disappointed and so was I. This book would be a good choice for the reluctant reader; a child who is overwhelmed by the number of pages in a book and a lot of print.

I would have given it 5 - stars except I had to mount it on the top frame of my mountain bike because the insert that attaches the lock to the bracket is on the u part of the lock, see products' photo. The weight of the lock would not allow me to mount it any other way without it flopping to one side of the bike. The insert for the bracket that could have resolved this only made the brackets screws unusable, it separated the brackets ends so far apart the screws could not span the distance. This is easily solvable by getting screws the same diameter as the ones that came with the lock from your local hardware store, just measure the gap and get them to cover that distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not Lock","review":"If you came here to buy a bike lock, turn around now; here be demons.

Never used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be reading the rest of the series!","review":"I only bought this book because of the horse racing connection. My guess is that the author has never been to a horse race in her life, much less done any adequate research on training and what it takes to become a jockey. Even for the reader without any knowledge of the horse racing industry, this is a very poorly written book, the ending is something a child would come up with, the characters evoke no emotion whatsoever from the reader, and their development is non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"No empathy for the characters, no knowledge of horses or horse racing and the book was difficult to follow.Do not read this book if you love horses or horse racing. It has little to do with any of it and it is very obvious that Fern did not do much research into either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horse Knowledge??","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews.There is hardly any empathy for any of the characters, especially for one of the main characters at the end of the book. Oh, and horse knowledge? There is no way a Kentucky Derby would end as it did here. I don't want to give it away...but for starters, lets just say a horse does not cross over a finish line..but under a finish wire.The line of characters was also confusing, but I eventually figured it out.However if you are like me, a book with horses in it at all keeps me entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kentucky Sunrise","review":"UGH! How insulting this book is. If the plot got any more simplistic, I don't think that I could have finished the book. Oh wait, I didn't finish the book. There really was nothing to the few chapters that I did read. Would I recommend it? Not a chance. Generally I like Fern Micheals, but this is a book that should never have been released. Does she think we are all simpletons?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan of this one!","review":"Kentucky Sunrise follows the families of Kentucky through another run at the Derby. I found the story hard to follow and the characters did not have any depth. There was no empathy for the plight of the family members and tangetial stories that distracted from what I think was the main plot. Defintely would not recommend reading this one unless you're on the beach without anything else in your bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author obvisouly has no experience in horse racing!","review":"I started reading this book way back in August and I've been reading it for over a month and still haven't finished it. This book is trash! A horse just doesn't go to the Derby without prior prep races. They usually have a two year old season and then they have prep races in their three year old season and if they are lucky the horse makes it to the Derby. Another major flaw is that jockeys would NEVER ride their first race in the Derby. Jockeys start out riding at the bottom ranks and work their way up to the bigger stakes races as they improve. I still can't figure out why this author would write on a subject they had no experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is it that this kind of junk can get published?","review":"It seems that all you need today is to have the patience to write a full-length novel - the talent and original ideas come in a poor second and third. This book is horribly written, the plot is cliche, the characters are selfish and hard to relate to, and Ms. Michaels has added the final insult of not researching her topic. She knows nothing about horse racing, horses, or Las Vegas.I think, besides all of the errors, that the thing that bothered me the most about this book was the stupid names of the characters. Pyne, Birch, Fanny, Willow, Hatch Littletree, even a Monica Lepinsky. This is drivel and should never have been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Time Reader Disappointed","review":"I picked up Kentucky Sunrise at the library hoping to find a new author I would enjoy. I am a Kentucky girl and grew up around horses. I will say that Ms Michaels knows horses but she left me utterly confused about the motivation of her human characters. Maybe I need to read the preceding stories so that I will understand why the characters behave the way they do, but the plot development in this book was very difficult to follow. And the epilogue at the end made absolutely no sense unless it was the setting for the next book in the series. I am not motivated to go and read the first two books in this series and would not recommend Kentucky Sunrise."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL ... don't waste your money","review":"This book is terrible. The characters are scattered and impossible to follow, the plot (what plot?) is horribly scripted, and it's a complete waste of money and time. I'd been considering reading it for some time, and now I'm sorry I spent money on it.If you're looking for a good horse story/mystery read Tami Hoag's DARK HORSE. Tami Hoag KNOWS horses ... she's an avid competitor herself. Fern Michaels obviously knows nothing about horses or horse racing. She'd be better off writing Harlequin Romance novels ... they are short and it would be much less painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also not a fan","review":"This is the first Fern Michaels book I've read, just picked it up on a whim.

One star may be one too many!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this trilogy, but....","review":"I have read the Texas saga, the Vegas trilogy, and the Kentucky trilogy, as well as a few other books written by Fern Michael. For some reason, the Kentucky trilogy is the only one that I really loved. I love Nealy, her 'rags to riches' story and some of the people that come into her life.I do love the horse breeding/racing storyline too. But something that I've noticed, and the main reason why I stopped reading Fern Michael's books, is the continuity in her storyline from book to book. Sometimes even from events at the beginning of a book not quite matching up with the twists she puts in at the end. It's like she decides what she wants to throw into the story as she's going along and then doesn't even remember that the details differ from what she's already written. For this reason, I could only give these books 4 stars. As long as you can overlook that flaw in the writting, I would recommend these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kentucky Darkfall","review":"I read the entire Kentucky series and was horribly disappointed by how it ended. I'm an avid reader but haven't been this disappointed by a series...ever. Michaels spends the entire time redoing the personalities of her previous characters and makes them seem more narcissistic and selfish than in the first two books. She also obviously knows little about horse racing, but I had this figured out by the first book. Don't waste your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic Fest","review":"I ordered all three books in the series as books on tape. Because my commute is a long one I suffered through all three books. I have to say I have rarely seen characters more narcissistic, clueless and selfish. Finding a character I could even root for was daunting.I would not waste my time with this sad group of characters. The whole series was like watching a train wreak, only not that exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neely was an awful character","review":"This is the only book in this series I've read and I thought Neely was horrible!! She was selfish and controlling and clearly had no love for her husband or her children. She was just obsessed with her horses and owning the family farm, etc. I thought she was a horrible person. I can deal with characters who have flaws they need to deal with, but she had no redeeming qualities at all. It was an awful book, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and a waste of time and money !","review":"A terrible finale to what was otherwise a good series. Why wasn't Smitty or Ruby and Metexas mentioned more then in passing ? Seems like Fern Michaels was just tired of this series. And who \\"they\\" are was never adequately explained. I don't feel like listing everything else with this book. It could've, and should've been much better. I was tremendously disappointed. Waste of money. Don't buy it, you're better off calling it quits after the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"kentucky sunrise","review":"excellent reading - would give a 5 star rating and reccommend to anyone who has anything to do with horses and horse farms"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Fern Michaels is one of my favorite authors and I love her books that are written in series.

Some people from Saturday Night Live are just not eligible to graduate from comedy school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as funny as volume 1","review":"This is my 2nd review in seven years. I bought this because of the almost 5 star rating. I loved volume 1 and thought this would be even better. The only things really funny were the racist toys, Mike Tyson for president (10 seconds long?), what not to do when getting pulled over by a cop and the taxi cab confessions. The confessions are a 30 minute video extra; otherwise this DVD would have nothing on it. It's a long hour when you hardly laugh. And what happened to Wanda Sykes?? She was hilarious in the 1st volume. If I had to do this again I'd buy only volume 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a horror movie!!!","review":"This movie is nothing but super crazy christian extremist propaganda. I am 100% certain that anyone who gave this film five stars has something to do with the film. The movie wasn't worth watching for free let alone buying.Basically this kids commits a few very small sins so satan starts messing with his head and tormenting people around him. There is maybe a whole five minutes of the stuff that is suppose to be scary, the rest is just crazy christians preaching about how every little thing is a sin.Candy = sin, rock music = sin, anything about teen pop culture = sin, kissing a girl = sin, a girl talking to a boy alone = sin(and makes the girl a whore).I don't know why Jesse Eisenberg is on the cover, he's only about five minutes of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead and Seriously Disappointed","review":"The cover is misleading, Jesse Eisenberg, is barely in this film. My assumption based on the rest of the movie is that they blew nearly all their budget on getting Jesse Eisenberg to do a 5 minute shot at the beginning of the film, and a 5 second flashback (same footage), followed by a 15 second shot.The rest of the film was pretty much a train wreck. I kept watching the movie waiting for the \\"horror\\". I could have just watched the trailer again, because that's nearly all of the horror in the film. Well if you don't count watching the film itself a \\"horror\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"good actors; script goes in too many directions","review":"They put Jesse Eisenberg's face on the dvd cover to sell it, but he is barely in it. The other actors are great even in the smaller roles, but the problem is that the writer/director is writing several different films, and none of them gets fair treatment. Is this a coming-of-age story, a slasher film set in the camp or woods, or is it an anti-religious or pro-religious treatment? It is really hard to say, since none of these threads gets picked up and carried anywhere. Will the young man remain with his family even though he loses belief? What happened to the priest by the end? Will the young gal ever be seen again? Why bother showing the bullies in the forest since they don't have much to do with the story? What was with the demon visions?Too many things to ponder with no real answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell No.","review":"Offensive, preachy, judgemental Christian propaganda disguised as a horror film.Despite the cover, this is not a Jesse Eisenberg movie. Nor does it contain any horror. I was mis-lead, lied to and manipulated. Ironically, something the Devil is very good at doing.I should've used the $3.99 to buy a \\"Spawn\\" comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be 0 stars - doesn't give the option","review":"Absolute WORST horror movie that I've ever seen - do not waste this amount of your life on this movie even if it's free - I can't believe I watched the whole thing waiting for 1 MINUTE of horror - this movie is worse than the lowest budget $4000 movie ever made. Ignore the star names - they are in the movie for less than 3 minutes and DON'T EVEN HAVE NAMES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE GARBAGE","review":"This movie is pure garbage. I was able to take ten naps in the first ten minutes, and (guess what!) the stupid opening music was still playing. Okay, seriously, I didn't watch more than the first five minutes. I wish I could get a refund because this movie SUCKS! Don't waste your time ladies and gentlemen (unless you're seeking the cure to insomnia)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNOOZEFEST","review":"CAMP HELL is not a horror movie and even though Jesse Eisenberg's face is featured prominently on the DVD's cover, he isn't in the movie very much.The film's focus is on a charismatic Catholic church camp led by a fiercely fundamentalist priest played by Bruce Davison. Will Denton (from the FRIGHT NIGHT remake) plays a teenager who lusts after Melissa, a fellow campmate. Of course, this is considered a grave sin and Melissa leaves the camp in shame. Meanwhile, Denton has disturbing dreams involving some kind of demon.CAMP HELL is tedious and quite dull. Based on \\"true events\\" the movie is talky, preachy and muddled in what it's trying to say. It's misleading marketing as a horror movie will certainly disappoint its targeted market. But as a film goes, it's just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO","review":"More like 'Camp let's rip people off for a few bucks'I found no viewing pleasure in this film what so ever,the premise and storyline were boring and had nothing to do with horror and Jesse Eisenberg was barley in it.I kept watching thinking ,ok any minute now it has to get better,it never happened.I was also thinking wow,a new slasher flick with Jesse,maybe he owed the producer a favor or something of that nature and it's going to be good.no way,avoid at all cost ,pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]","review":"What the hell did I just watch? The only scary thing about this film is that there are really religious freaks out there, who are willing to send their kids to camps like this. The producers of this movie must have known how awful it was, because they put a big picture of \\"The Social Network Guy,\\" Jesse Eisenberg on the cover, and list him as the star, when he's in the movie for all of 2 minutes. The star is Will Denton, who you may remember from the short lived TV series, Kidnapped. He was pretty good, so was Gossip Girls, Connor Paolo. It's too bad they didn't have an actual script to work with. It really just blows my mind that things like this get made. No one in their right mind would consider this movie worth their time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What It Seems","review":"For the first several minutes it seemed like a Church, perhaps more so Catholicism, sponsored evangelism was on the plate for this film. But, as the camp staff, campers and family members' characters were developed I began to see their excessive rigidity, self-serving righteousness, blind servitude, abuse, blame, intolerance and hate.Whereas the individuals most persecuted, whether rightly or wrongly (by whatever standard), were the ones guided by what they believed and what their own emotions presented as being true to themselves - to think independently and to care and love unconditionally.But, then perhaps, the movie was constructed to be a tabula rasa. We see what we wish to see.Oh, as far as the technical aspects of the movie, the acting was quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Christian Propaganda","review":"This movie is clearly ANTI-CHRISTIAN: whoever the director was its obvious that forces worked through him doing an excellent job at paining Christians as dogmatic buffoons not to be taken seriously by ANYONE. And the moral of the story is - Christians are insane lunatics, the priest at the end dies of a stroke and the kid loses his faith even after seeing demonic forces in action - he chooses not to believe in God(hence embracing the devil), i.e. the Devil is the winner. This movie is WORLDLY propaganda - don't believe the hype. Jesus is the SON of God and despite attempts to try to minimize the deity of Christ his light shines through this trash movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"great services","review":"this is not commercial thoughi am happy inform you because i love amazon.com so muchi ma very satisfied with every service i got through amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Andre Previn plays Harold Arlen","review":"This is a 1994 digital remastering of an LP Andre Previn made in 1960. As a result, LPs couldn't run to more than an hour's playing time so we have an all-too-brief concert of Previn playing ten mostly well-known tunes by Harold Arlen. I knew all of the tunes except one called \`Cocoanut Sweet'. A lot of favourites that have become standards are here: \`That old black magic', played up-tempo and somewhat demonically; \`Come rain or come shine' - a beautiful tender rendition; \`Stormy weather', \`Over the rainbow' . . .

Although I do think there have been a few good remakes of Asian films, this certainly is not one of them. I admit, I do love the Pang Brothers and have their versions of The Eye, The Eye 2 and even The Eye 10 (an inside joke, but well worth seeing). This version of The Eye is just not very good. It falls into the category of the ones that should not have been remade for they now are so bad, many will not see the original great work of art. This, I believe was my first Jessica Alba movie, and will most likely be the last. Most of the acting in this was sub-par and then some. The only good actor of the bunch was the cancer patient (also played well in the original). Anyway, I hope this helps some people decide, and I highly recommend the original, as it is SO MUCH BETTER. IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT MOVIE. NOT LIKE THIS JUNK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative & blithe thriller...","review":"Despite the plot loopholes and disjointed jumps in logic that the viewer is required to overlook, the overall enjoyment of the film is not compromised. It is a carefree thriller that effectively peaks one's interest in, firstly, what is going on, and then, is there a reason for this to be happening. Both are answered to varying degrees.Fairly enjoyable to watch and adequate acting holds the attention of the viewer. This reviewer recommends that you can rent without hesitation, but buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither scary or interesting","review":"When one would see the previews you would think that \\"The Eye\\" is a scary film. However, this is not the case! \\"The Eye\\" is not scary at all, which is probably because the plot is not interesting enough to even care what is going on.\\"The Eye\\" is about Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) who has been blind since an early life tragedy. She has a great passion for music, which fuels her desire to be able to see music, not just hear it. Sydney decides to get a double corneal transplant, which restores her sight. While she is recovering from the operation, she starts seeing things that are not there. After this becomes a reoccurring factor, she believes that her donor could see into a different world.\\"The Eye\\" never really held my interest at any point in the film.

These Japanese translated into American versions of \\"horror films\\" is redundant at this point, because none of them are delivering what they so desperately want, which is cover your eyes gasping terror. I don't know who they are marketing these films to, horror fans? Well try again, there are too many good horror films that have all the suspense and blood and guts you can handle to even take 'The Eye\\" seriously. \\"The Eye\\" was too busy trying to make each scene look pretty, and the story was borderline interesting. But after seeing trash like \\"The Grudge\\" 1 and 2, all of the novelties of this amatuer scare tactic type suspense thriller doesn't work. It's not creepy, it's not disturbing, it's not horrific, it's childish. This is yet another one that I couldn't sit through, I actually had to force myself to even watch half of it.

The only hitch is that with her new eyes - which were donated by a young lady with psychic powers - comes the unasked-for ability to see into the spirit world and predict the future.\\"The Eye\\" might have been an interesting film had it focused solely on how a once-blind girl learns to adjust to life in a suddenly sighted world. Instead, we're subjected to an inane, gimmicky thriller in which the heroine improbably manages to run across either a dead person or someone doomed to die just about every time she turns a corner.There's no end of point-of-view shots in which ghouls jump out and yell \\"Boo!\\" at the audience, but the whole thing is about as scary as a youngster dressed in a bedsheet doing the same thing on Halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a BLACK EYE.","review":"It's one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.

I love Albert Collins, and the fact that he had Copeland play with him on an album made me curious. I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"MacKenzie produced a better text with C. Guilford","review":"This book is overpriced and almost useless. It only serves as eye candy for someone with exposure to the petrographic microscope. Outside of pictures it contains terse explanations and alot of blank wasted space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid confusion!","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Fairbanks: this book should not be confused with the Mackenzie and Guilford atlas. The Atlas of *Rocks* and Minerals tries to be too comprehensive (by including both rocks and minerals) and in doing so has lost all of the information about less common and accessory minerals that was in the Mackenzie and Guilford text. Of course, much of what's in both books is now available on the Web, but it's still hard to find large format color photos like the ones in Mackenzie and Guilford.Another (less expensive) alternative is A.R. Philpotts' \\"Petrography of Igneous and Metamorphic Rocks.\\" In my experience as a student and then a TA in a mineralogy course, Philpotts' book does a better job of pointing out the distinctive characteristics of minerals than do the photographic atlases."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent book","review":"The book is written in a consise and well laid out manner. As the previous writer stated, the colour photos are priceless and are exactly as you would see looking through a petrological microscope both in crossed polars and thin section"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Top Knob","review":"The butter dish lid is so wide it is hard to grasp. A small knob like the one on top of the sugar bowl lid would be a great design improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has a slot that can't be cleaned!","review":"I bought this thinking it would be better than all the cheap supermarket spoon/spatulas. It is worse - the head is not sealed to the handle and batter / food / grease / whatever gets in the slot where the head and handle connect and is impossible to get out - soaking, dishwasher on heat boost - nothing works. Also, 400 deg limit is iffy when using on the stove - 600 deg limit is much better. Mine curled a bit when used on the stove, but since it had a permanent reservoir of filth, I tossed it anyway. Better to splurge on the ones from Pampered Chef."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells terrible","review":"I didn't buy it on Amazon, I bought it in Bed Bath & Beyond. I don't know whether it is the store's problem or what, the spatula has this horrible cheap perfume smell. I didn't realize this until I used it to stir the corn soup(since it's heat resistant and my pot is non-stick), and the soup tasted like perfume. Afterwards, I tried to wash it with detergent, soaked it in hot soapy water, nothing would make the smell go away. So buyers be aware, check the smell of the spatula before you use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting world ~ Sacred","review":"Not bad game, graphics of the environment you play are quite detailed, although a little bit repetitive. Probably about 1/2 way through the game playing vampiress now. Awkward access to potions when you want to use them on accompanying characters is frustrating and there are some bugs on the version I'm playing (unable to complete some side quests). Otherwise great, particularly that most the world (Ancaria) is open to explore at your leisure, rather than available only after some prerequisite missions have been completed."},{"rating":"1","title":"what ain't no country I heard of","review":"I do not know what or where this game is from or made for but it seems windows was not it's 1st intended place to be played as I could not get it to work and shelved it after hour of trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just have to say my piece","review":"Tried this game on my two machines: Duron-1200, 256MB, GF3-64MB, Win98SE -and- a laptop P4-2667, 512MB, ATI9000-64MB, Win98SE.I managed to play at most about 5 minutes then it took down both my PCs. Game didn't work on both campaign and multiplayer modes.After many attempts, reboots, even reinstalls, I gave up, and already uninstalled the game.Although, I'm thinking of trying it on my third PC: P3-550, 256MB, GF3-64MB, Win98SE... nah..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and boring.","review":"I tried this game over a course of several months and really tried hard to enjoy and like it. But unfortunately it is just too boring. Nothing of significance ever happens. You just go from one place to another slashing and hacking but get nowhere. Unfortunately this problem is not unique in PC games. Some games such as the old King's Quest and Ultima series as well as the newer Baldur' Gate manage to keep the story interesting but this one does not! For example, you can do a whole dungeon and all you get it is some very standard treasure. On the occasion you may get a stand alone side quest. To keep the game interesting a story must unfold. Conversations with locals is very limited and you don't get much by going around and talking to people. On the good side, the interface is great. In fact the game engine by itself is very good and able to create a great game. It is the story which is poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred vs Diablo","review":"I like to play many games and I use virtual cd player so I dont have to keep swapping CD's - This game requires the CD to play.Game play can be buggy at times. Getting the lastest patch 1.8 doesn't seem to do much about it.More drops and loot then you can shake a stick at. Can advance your player above level 100, so you have some definite goals and it will last quite a while.Overall its a good game. The ending is extreamly disappointing and will leave you with a feeling of... ??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"It's a wonderful game, but the prolific amount of bugs found in the game play cost it that final star. Overall, if you like rigid storylines with A+B+C plot sequences, this may not be the best of games for you. However, that lack of structure is also what makes the game so unique. You have the freedom to move about an immersive world that maintains a fresh feel even when you aren't working on the main quest. Sub quests are neither easy, lame, nor hackneyed, making it all feel like more an experience to play than a just another game.Overall, it's almost perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Sacred","review":"Wouldn't play on three systems. Tried it with Patch and without. Tried all variations and combinations of settings. Uninstalled game. Too bad. Looked like it would be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bugging, Problems, Huh???","review":"I just bought this game is it is awesome. Like others have been saying, it basically is Diablo 3. The game has very unique single player and multi-player modes. For single player you can go through and enjoy the storyline and explore each area to it's fullest. When playing online, you pretty much get in a party (or solo) of 6 people and kill everything in sight. The story is pretty much gone, but it's fun to explore the lands and vanquish powerful foes. Lastly, I would like to say to all though experiencing problems, GET BETTER COMPUTERS! I have been playing the game on and off line for several weeks now and not once have I had a crash or glitch. I don't know why you people have been having so much trouble, the game runs perfect for me. ANYWAY, THIS IS A MUST OWN GAME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off saving your money","review":"This game would have been good if it came out four years ago, but now it just looks dated. Also, the game is plagued with bugs. I recommend holding out for the price to drop significantly and the bugs to get fixed before picking up this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"A good idea, but the game has WAY TOO MANY PROBLEMS. I could not get it to run on my top of the line machine and tech support was of no help. Check out the Sacred web forums for the thousands of persons who bought the game, but cannot play it.I really disapointment for my whole family. It is really unfair that they get away with selling something that does not work for soo many purchasers, and then we are stuck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely works, and support is lacking","review":"I got this game a few months ago and I have only been able to keep it running for a few hours of gameplay. And the company's technical support doesn't know anything at all about their product. I let them know what is wrong, give them crash logs, everything...and they still can't figure it out. It got to the point where I gave the game to my friend and I just play it at his house all the time now. Don't get unless you know EXACTLY that it is going to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful game but its buggy problems are just too much","review":"This game had the potential to over take the king of action rpgs, Diablo, but it fell flat on its face.The graphics, characters (especially Seraphim and Vampiress), and game world are all terrific and a joy to play and behold... when the game doesnt lock you up or crash.Sacred was obviously rushed out the door before it was ready and it really shows. There are so many bugs, crashes, and game breaking glitches that it borders on ridiculous.If you buy this game make sure you download patch 1.6.And the next patch, 1.7, is due out in TWO MONTHS. The developers stated that the next patch will be out in June. Now if that doesnt tell you that the game needs a lot of fixing then i dont know what will..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware... Good game... poorly made","review":"This game has a lot of potential, but shouldn't have been released yet. Be especially cautious if your computer is near the \\"minimum specifications\\". My computer is at the low end, and I can't even play half the time. I freeze (requiring CTRL-ALT-DEL) 3 or 4 times before I can actually log on. When I finally get logged on, the game will kick me off the server with no warning at random (every 3rd or 4th game). There are countless bugs, mis-spellings, and problems. I foresee an endless series of patches for online play. If you can stand the hassle... go for it. But don't say I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems","review":"I was excited to get my copy of Sacred and that's pretty much where the fun ended. I installed it, but kept getting disk verification errors when I tried to play. I read the \\"readme\\" file and found that the game may not work properly with Windows 98 or Me. So I went and bought Windows XP. I reinstalled Sacred, and I am still having the same trouble. I can now see the opening sequence, but then the game just turns itself off. I read in previous reviews that there were bugs, I just never imagined it would be this bad! I'll be returning my copy and buying Beyond Divinity instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are less bugs in a Louisianna Swamp!","review":"I have NEVER had so many problems with a game as I have with this one.

It is not as addictive as Diablo 2 LOD but the graphics make up for that. I think that Encore has a lot of work to do on fixing those bugs though. There are lots of places for improvement. For example i called my horse and my characted disappeared until my character mounted it. That kinda freaked me out. I hope that Encore polished the rough egdes of this game a bit, and it might just be as smooth as Diablo 2 and Ultima Online. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution Laptop Users","review":"First, I gave this game a single star for one reason. I couldn't play it. It might be a great game and bought it based on recommendations made here. However, when I got it home and loaded it on my laptop (866 PIII-M, 1 GB mem, 16 Mb Video), it actually hung my XP system - impressive! I set all display and sound options to the minumum, downloaded the patchs, got the latest DirectX runtime (9.0b) and still it would not load. If you look in the readme file the company mentions that the game may not run on all laptop tops due to their inability to test every integrated video chip configuration and I guess mine was one :(. So, if you're thinking of installing this game on a laptop please be aware that there may be problems. I'm not saying it won't run (I had the minimum recommended system requirements but not the recommended requirements) but be prepared to be frustrated and ensure you can return the game if it you have too."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S MY REFUND","review":"This gun is plasticky it's flimsy.

Technology and the way Rehab counselors use technology has changed drastically and a study guide really needs to address this.

We play WORD HUNT with the whole family.The cons of this game is that some of the words on word hunt that we have come across are 'Vagina' and 'Porno' which I am quite certain should not be on a game that is recommended for kids.

I couldn't find detailed info about it anywhere on the web, nor did I find the product in any stores. It's not what I was hoping it would be.

She called 20,000 American citizens \\"stupid\\" on national television (David Letterman, 11/9/00, regarding the voters of Palm Beach County, FL). Is this a woman who should be giving inspiration to the masses? I think not. Ms. Roberts behavior is offensive and reprehensible. She must be called on to retract her statement.

A revelation: it's good to be rich and famous. The format of the \\"researched\\" chapters is interesting -- a paragraph lifted from someone else's work, with a \\"whaddya think about that!\\" one-line observation tacked at the end.

It contains playful interviews with the artist themselves, band members and average people on the street! The only complaint is that I just wished it contained more concert footage of the show itself. (But maybe that because I missed their tour.) All four music videos are included especially 'Kelly Watch the Stars' which sounds incredible! Overall, a fun documentary trying to capture and understand the insanity of touring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air....exactly as the title states","review":"This is not an exciting video to watch - quite the contrary: It's boring. It outlines the \\"Moon Safari\\" tour with brutal honesty - the fact that nothing really happens when you're a french duo touring with your american backup band. A lot of questions are asked by the director of the film (which makes me wonder what the focus of the movie REALLY was?) to unsuspecting passerbys (eg; \\"Do you eat at McDonald's?\\").I think the whole point to this film is to bore you. The two stars I give it are for the videos at the end for the spectacular track \\"Sexy Boy,\\" and the follow-up, \\"Kelly Watch the Stars,\\" which features a mix previously unreleased!

While there is some footage of the live performance, its no where near what you'd expect. The title is correct, this is more of a documentary than about the band playing music. A little of the documentary style would have been fine, but when the entire DVD is full of people talking about how great the band is and, well, it just gets old. Like others, I would have much preferred to see the band performing live and less of the filler. I wanted to see how they were going to create the vocals, and what types of instruments they used.The music videos on the DVD are the only reason I keep it.

Yes, sometimes the actors are partially nude, but you really don't see anything at all - and who cares by the way - but everything looks so fake you can't believe it. No one kisses at all.

So far, my feet are much happier.I could have saved these Easy Spirit's as a secondary pair, but the Avia's also cost a couple of bucks less.

I'm not quite sure what to make of it--I feel like, in production, the switch in tone from rather larkily written \\"does love overwhelm even madmen?\\" farce to serious commentary on the responsibility of scientists in a commercial, WMD-manufacturing world (and the ego it takes to believe you can control knowledge and its use) could feel more like a nuanced punchline, a clever bait-and-switch, than it does on paper. On paper, it feels disorienting.

The book includes a glossary of key concepts, and can be read like a companion to cultural studies.

Diane Arbus (eeww) hated being Jewish and would be uncomfortable to see her name in this book if she hadn't killed herself, and Estee Lauder became a Roman Catholic........not exactly a \\"Great Jewish Woman\\".If your idea of greatness is actresses and singers or anybody Jewish who managed to get her name in the paper than this is your book.

It's an inexpensive product so I didn't expect much, and I'm using it on an extra 28 oz. bat my team has (an old aluminum -- we just bought a composite) so it's no big loss.

London, investigating his own case of mistaken death sentence amidst one of the firt political corruption scandals in England. Weaver, a famous London's \\"thief-taker\\", escapes death-cell, tries to solve the murder case\`he is accused of, having mind games with the lost love interest, playing double-games during elections and attempting to get untangled from political mess. The book's got lots fine points and gets action going, although there are parts when the pace snails down, and the end is rather rushed and doesn't satisfy perfectly. One must wait for another chapter to Weaver's adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"17th Century Tough PI","review":"Meet Benjamin Weaver, collector of debts and theft recovery. He is a tough PI whose action and investigative methods that rival Sam Spade and Sherlock Holmes. (Though Holmes is smarter, Weaver takes more risks and chases more women.) Set in the early 1720's, Weaver is hired to investigate the murder of a porter (dock worker). This leads to him being framed for murder. After a daring and somewhat humorous escape, Weaver attempts to clear his name of wrong doing, which takes him into the world of shady politicians and brutal thugs. But, Weaver is a resourceful character, with his clever language and pugilist skills. Like an old country James Bond, he is quick thinking, charismatic with the ladies and quick to use force where necessary. Writer Liss does a great job of describing the times of early London and entertains with Weaver's cunning and antics. Michael Page does an awesome job of reading for the audiobook. I look forward to more books by Mr. Liss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring slog that doesn't live up to its potential","review":"I read David Liss' \\"A conspiracy of Paper\\" and \\"The Coffee Trader\\" and enjoyed both, so when I purchased \\"A Spectacle of Corruption\\" I was looking forward to another jaunt through England in the 1720's (the 1722 general election in particular). I studied European history in college and love historical fiction set in the eighteenth century. However the plot never really grabbed me, the characters behaved like cartoons rather than real people, and I gave up just over half-way. I cannot recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fun Book","review":"This book is very entertaining. I like books that do throw in some historical points so that it doesn't seem like you are reading just for pure entertainment. I did find myself staying up a bit too late to see what happened next, because it did keep me guessing - although I pretty much figured out the big \\"twist\\" at the end right at the beginning - it was fun to see what would happen next along the way. The colorful inventive swearing (and I do not typically like swearing) made me laugh out loud a few times. Not quite as good as A Conspiracy of Paper, and a little bit better than The Coffee Trader, which I do recommend if you like Liss's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would read another","review":"A rich story. Full of twists and turns and all very convoluted.A straight path to find the motive and the powerful figures behind the accusations could have been presented. It wasn't. While taking this windy road, our hero finds that the path is also cluttered.We see the belly of London in the early 18th century, and a feel for its seedy politics. Corruption is at the heart of all, there being no good men to be found who want to do better for their fellow men without some flaw or other.I do recommend it. It has a lot to offer. Not as good as Coffee Trader or Conspiracy of Paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Another great read from David Liss. I do agree with the other reviewers who say it doesn't measure up to A Conspiracy of Paper, but it is still good enough to get 4 stars from me.

Very good sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble","review":"I highly recommend this book if:(1)You enjoy plots and subplots directly out of commercial novel writing 101.(2)You like being able to foretell the rest of a book after reading only the first few chapters.(3)You are fond of novels that plod along like drizzle on a cold London day - dribble - dribble - dribble.(4)You are a reader who likes developing a knowledge of history from friction rather than from a good verifiable written account.Today I am very happy to celebrate two things:(1)Osama bin Laden is dead(2)I did not buy this book; a friend loaned it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Before reading this book I recommend you read Liss' first book \\"A Conspiracy of Paper.\\" The first book will introduce you to Benjamin Weaver and London in the early 1700's. In both his books Liss displays an uncanny abilty to weave history with fiction. One can feel through the authors first person detailed descriptions the grit, grime and smell of that time and place. Both books smoothly moves one through intricate plot and unforgetable characters. Both books are page turners.

So, I'm doing a very rigorous reading/summarizing to create my presentations. At the moment I'm doing chapter 15 and so far it has been a mixed ride. Sometimes, I have to read the paragraph to make sure I'm getting the point. Most of the time it works but sometimes I'm left puzzled.

It's true that I use a tea kettle at least once every day, probably more than any other piece of cookware. So it's not surprising that after 20 years of using my old Revere Ware copper bottom kettle, it bit the dust. I decided to upgrade to a fancier brand, the Oxo, about four years ago. It held up well until this month when the bottom started to severely corrode. Is four years a good lifespan for a kettle? I don't think so. It's on the low end of my expectations. On the plus side, the kettle is well designed and has nice balance.

I wanted to purchase a whistling teakettle because, from time to time, I have put the kettle on and forgotten about it. This kettle's whistle worked less than 25 percent of the time, which renders that feature quite useless. I found the \\"uplift\\" handle to be awkward. It makes the kettle less stable when handling it, as the handle moves up and down to open the spout and this can happen at times when you aren't expecting it. I will say that I did get somewhat used to this, but I still never liked it. The bottom of this kettle is THIN! It did not appear to be sturdy at all. And, ironically, this thinness didn't help it heat water any faster. I replaced this kettle with the Chantal teakettle (I got mine from Amazon before they quit carrying it, but you can find it at Williams-Sonoma). It cost twice as much, but it is more than twice the quality. And the whistle always works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the Good Grips moniker","review":"I generally love \\"Good Grips\\" kitchen utensiles, but am very disappointed with this pot. The design is not up to snuff. It's difficult to fill, usually doesn't close tight enough to whistle, and the handle gets very hot. And the lid broke after a few months of light use.These flaws are what I'd expect if I bought a cheap kettle at a discount store, but for $50 I expect better. I've always been a fan of Oxo, but if this is any indication, they've lost their emphasis on quality and usability (and their justification for a higher price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere, there has to be better out there!","review":"I purchased this piece of junk for $50 and the whistler died within a year. I must admit it does feel comfortable and the Uplift design is a great idea, but it is not worth buying so you can eventually burn your house down because the tea kettle whistle did not go off. Find another way to spend $50, because this is not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever idea, but materials lacking","review":"I really liked the ergonomics of this product. OXO does such a great job with that stuff. I happily used this kettle for a couple of years. Problems arose when...1. The screw holding the handle to the body of the kettle corroded to practically nothing, and the handle fell off. Stainless steel or brass would have worked better than the steel screw they used;2. The rounded bottom allowed flames from the gas burner on which the kettle was warming to rise up the side of the kettle and melt the spout flap!I don't know what temperature was reached, but to use materials on a kettle that can melt at household-use temperatures is a big oversight in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this kettle!!!","review":"They changed the Uplift kettle, and the newer generation is definitely inferior to the previous. The kettle no longer features the pleasant harmonic whistle. The stainless kettles also have a seam along the bottom that the colored kettles do not have. It distorts the aesthetics. And the brushed stainless model takes FOREVER to boil."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Really Black teakettle with harmony.","review":"The bride (of 42 years) LOVES the product. It is easy to fill, holds lots and the handle action is an excellent idea. When the water begins to boil the lid sings softly like a harmonica. Needless to say, this is a very pleasant experience rather than running to answer a shrieking earsplitting soprano scream.*We have not burnt ourselves using this and I am impressed with how easily it locks at the open (something that I was concerned about).*Great ergonomics and a great idea. This product Rocks!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw led to broken handle lid on two separate models","review":"My wife and I experienced the same problem that a few other people have mentioned, but I wanted to add that we even returned the kettle for a brand new one and it happened again. Surely this is a design flaw.The lid forms a tight seal, and is actually difficult to remove. The handle on the lid broke off within the first month of usage. And we were even gentle with it the second time around.Poor design and/or craftsmanship on this one. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but badly designed","review":"I bought this kettle because I liked the modern design. That's about all I like about it.

I recommend staying far away from this kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great in the Long Run","review":"I owned this teakettle for years. Like so many items on the market these days, it looked great. I hardly used it for years. I recently started making my coffee in a French press and heated the water in the teakettle. First the whistle stopped working then the bottom sprang a leak! Unbelievable for the price! Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design but","review":"I was specifically looking for a tea kettle that whistled and whistled loudly.

Our previous kettle started fail (leak, whistle no longer worked) after several years of heavy use on a gas burner. The lid to the new kettle is a bit flimsier than our previous kettle, but hopefully that should not affect its durability. We love the look of it; we'll see how well it holds up - we'll be satisfied if it lasts as long as our previous kettle given the abuse we're bound to give it. Only complaint: the option of the orange color is more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kettle","review":"I purchased this kettle mainly for the pretty color but it hasn't let me down on its function.

I am lazy and leave water in it - no problems with rust until recently. I am buying a new one this year because the bottom is starting to show signs of wear. Overall, I think this product has lasted well. In my house it is used daily and anything that lasts more than a few years is a good get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...when it's not falling apart!","review":"About a year ago, I started drinking more tea than coffee at least during the winter months. SO, I needed a kettle. The first Oxo I bought lasted about 2 weeks before the littole hinge pins at the spout broke so I took it back. Now the handle on the cover has broken a screw mount so it will either have to be replaced or repaired. When it is together and not falling apart it works great. I just done have that much confidence in it's quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many flaws (...)","review":"Sequence of events that led to this review:1. I exchanged the first Oxo kettle I bought because the lid (not the spout) did not fit right, and the steam escaping from the top burned my hand.2. I returned the 2nd kettle because the lid was so tight I had to have my husband open it or fill it through the spout. (This made cleaning it impossible.)3. The 3rd kettle was returned beacuse it had flaws in the finish and would eventually turn into rust spots.I gave up and expressed my disappointment to Oxo about this kettle, They were kind enough to send one to me. This kettle was great -- at first; but, after awhile, the handle loosened up and, yes, steam began to escape. It now sits atop my refrigerator looking down on my ten-dollar kettle that has lasted me for years.Save your money. It's a great concept but short-lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam problems and no whistle","review":"From reading the other reviews, I see that my problems with this kettle are not unique. It actually seems like I was fortunate, because mine just started having problems at three years old. It's stopped whistling and the steam escaping from it is a little scary, which it wasn't before. It always boils quickly. The lid can be hard to get off and on, and the moving handle has always made me nervous (but no injuries yet!). It's way overpriced, too. I got it as a wedding gift. Don't buy it yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak whistle....","review":"The old OXO tea kettles had a train whistle sound. This new one has a single high pitch whistle that is so weak you couldn't hear it in the next room. Save your money and buy something cheaper. It will work as well if not better. I returned mine and got another brand and it works just fine and it was cheaper too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this teapot","review":"This teakettle was given to me as a gift. I will say that it does the job. It boils water. But there were many things I dislike about it. I dislike the uplift mechanism to open the spout. I found it cumbersome. The whistle was odd. It had a low sound and reminded me of the sirens some cities use as am emergency alert signal. I usually kept the spout open so I wouldnt hear the whistle. I have now had it for about a year and today when I pulled open the stopper to add water, the handle snapped completely off.Thats a good excuse to get rid of it. Okay it did the job but there are better teakettles out there. I wouldnt buy another one of this model. I would not recommend this kettle. It does boil water so it worked (until the handle broke)."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design","review":"This was an expensive kettle, and it isn't even worth half of the price. The lid pops off and the handle keeps getting loose and has to be tightened. I think their marketing plan is flawed. Buy something that will last and won't need to be replaced in less than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching water boil.","review":"I've wanted this pot for some time. So I was more then excited when I got it.Well that wore off to soon. First the whistle is more like a stuck car horn then the whistle stopped working 2 weeks after it showed up. If you like watching water boil this is great, but don't turn your back because the whistle will stop working the first time you trust it to call you."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice form, mediocre function","review":"As others have experienced, the whistle gave out after a few months; in my case cracks also appeared in the lid.Uplift handle works well and the stainless steel finish is durable--doesn't tarnish as easily as the finish on other, cheaper kettles."},{"rating":"2","title":"only downside is a hot handle","review":"this kettle is great - stylish, heats quickly, holds plenty of water. Only downside is that the handle still gets quite hot on our commercial range. That's a little surprising, given the amount of research Oxo does to make products usable for people. the handle is the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't keep it clean; looks awful!","review":"I bought this to replace an old Oxo Good Grips kettle because after years and years, the whistle quit working. My old one was a shiny stainless and I thought for less maintenance I'd get the brushed stainless. Well... I'm neat and clean and never fry things on the stove but this thing looked awful after just a couple of weeks. The outside is covered with brown spots and gook and I can't get it off with steel wool and rubbing compound! It's odd because there was only an occasional amount of soiling on the old shiny one. I'm going to throw this out and get a new kettle. If you don't care how things look, you might like this... but I can't stand to look at this blight on my stove. A colossal waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"handle melted off","review":"a very cheaply made contraption, the handle melted off the first time I used this kettle. I'm mailing it back to OXO.I rated this with one star only because there was no option for no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it zero if I it was a choice","review":"I ordered this kettle in March. After receiving it, I noticed that it imparted a terrible chemical taste to the water. I sent them an e-mail describing the problem and requested a refund and a method to return the item. Their web site directed me to call their help line, which I did. They were very polite and indicated that they would send the shipping label so that we could return the kettle. They indicated that they would issue a full refund. After 2 weeks I had not received the label. I placed another call and was told that my request was being processed.I finally received the label and instructions and sent the kettle back in late April. I received the refund Yesterday, July 17-- after 2 more calls.This product is awful and Oxo's customer service (save for the very polite staff) is terrible. You couldn't pay me to try another Oxo product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else","review":"We've had this kettle for about three years, and every time we use it are reminded of how much we dislike it. The whistle stopped working a while ago, the handles get uncomfortably hot, and it doesn't clean up well (we have the \\"stainless\\" steel--not really so stainless). My biggest complaint with it, though, is that the lid--which is wide, and is supposed to make the pot easier to clean--is really difficult to take off and put back on. Every time I pull it off of the tea kettle I end up banging my hand on the handle. Ouch! Buy a different tea kettle. That's what I'm finally doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped whistling","review":"Very heavy, whistle sounds like a steam boat. But worst, it stopped whistling at all after a couple of months. Very disappointing, given the high cost and Oxo's usually good products"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusty Stainless","review":"I am very disappointed in the kettle. Not only does it have an unreliable whistle (which someone already mentioned), it also started to rust inside! I like to keep boiled water in a kettle, because I prefer not to use tap water when I cook. After a few days of keeping my kettle filled, rust appeared. As a comparison, my cheaper enameled kettle lasted for 2 years without rust. Although I do like the innovative design, I am returning this item because it failed to do the tasks a basic kettle should: whistle and store water safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention - floaters! Particles and black film","review":"I bought the shiny chrome \\"stainless steel\\" model, washed before using, as they recommend, then boiled water for a pot of tea. Noticed my tea was leaving black grease-like marks around my cup and could see a visible slick or film on the water. Poured the rest of the water into a clear pitcher only to find black floaty bits in it. Don't know if it was from the sealer or if they were actual pieces of metal. Cleaned, boiled another pot of water and the same thing happened. Boiled again at length with white vinegar and water. Still, there were floaters. Needless to say, I returned it immediately. Injesting unidentified floating objects with tea is not recommended.Looks cool, interesting pouring concept, nice colors but water comes out dirtier than water put in. Could just be a problem with the chrome pot. I heart OXO, but will definitely not be buying their tea kettles again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor workmanship","review":"Generally I love Oxo products, but I was really disappointed with this one. Shortly after receiving this as a wedding gift, the whistle stopped working.About 6 months later, the seam at the bottom began to leak. I don't remember reading anything about not leaving water in it, but it seems like you should be able to leave water in a teapot. I have a Revereware teapot that is over 12 yrs old, I leave water in it all the time, and it works fine. The only reason I switched was I liked the wide mouth on the Oxo so I can get inside to clean. I've gone back to the Revereware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this kettle 3 years ago. The whistle is great, the handle is fine. The problem that my husband and I have is with the lid. The lid forms such a strong seal that it is almost impossible to lift the lid without a peice of it breaking off.The inside became rusty as well. Looks great, not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Tasting Tea","review":"I am really disappointed with this kettle. On the second use, I noticed that the tea tasted strangely metallic. If the water sits in this kettle for any length of time, it takes on an unpalatable flavor. After I threw out tea a couple of days in a row, I decided to bring the kettle back to the store. I have never had this problem with my old tea kettle. I've been drinking tea for over 40 years and I have a very good palate and I was on to this immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"No whistle","review":"I purchased this kettle because i wanted a kettle that whistled since I've been known to forget I put the kettle on. Well it whistled great for about 2 months but has now gone silent. I was most disappointed since i have in the past had good experiences with OXO products. This kettle looks good but keep looking around if you want a whistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - why all the complaints?","review":"I received the stainless steel version of this kettle as a Christmas gift three years ago, and it's been a trooper. I am really surprised at all the complaints. Mine has held up to three to five uses a day for three years on a gas stove with no leaking, no rusting. Whistle works fine unless my husband overfills the kettle, which the directions warned against. I love the auto-open feature and soft handle. Handle insulates well unless you leave it boiling for too long or turn the gas so the flame comes around the sides of the kettle, which is not really the kettle's fault, or the manufacturers. I'd love to buy the kettle these complainers are happy with, if such a thing could be found. This one is the best I've ever had, and I've worn out about a dozen other types before it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks....","review":"I purchased this for my wife for Chrtistmas and brought it home to find it leaked water from the top the 1st time we used it. If you look at the top handle, its angled toward the rear. If you are not being careful and watching your \\"water level,\\" when it starts to boil, it leaks from the top handle. It caused a mess for us. Also, I was not fully satisfied with mechanism it uses to open the spout. Unless the tea kettle is placed on a flat surface, you cannot open or close the spout, because it uses leverage (from the handle). We took it back the day after Christmas. Still looking for a perfect tea kettle...I thought $50 would have done it, but I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not whistle!","review":"This pretty teakettle does not whistle! I believe it doesn't whistle because of the uplift handle/spout mechanism. I tried boiling water several times and each time the water boiled it did not whistle. I went to the stove and held the handle down tight - with force - and only then did it whistle.... but upon letting go it stopped whistling. So - if you want it to whistle - you must stand by the stove and apply pressure to the handle so that the spout cover closes securely - and if you have to do that- then what is the point right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melting spout","review":"This teakettle has a nice pouring design (cap lifts off while your pour) but what's with the cap melting off? I have never had this problem with any other teakettle. I usually like OXO products, but this one is a fail. Oh, and the whistling mechanism got so weak that the other day, I didn't hear it, the water burned down, the kitchen had a bad melting plastic odor for an hour, as I took off the cover, the handle broke off, and it totally committed suicide. This was not inexpensive. As I look through the reviews on Amazon, there seems to be a weakness in every teakettle out there...for what seems like a low tech appliance, why have we not perfected this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass On This One","review":"The first one we got leaked from the bottom seam. We got another from Amazon for free. However, now the lid on the second one has broken. The product looks nice and the auto-opening spout is convenient but this model just doesn't last. For the price, I would expect it to outlast my children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The clever handle gets in the way","review":"Oxo used to be synonymous with good design -- but this tea kettle should have been left on the drawing board. In theory, the clever handle (lift the kettle, and the lid automatically opens) is a good idea, but if you're used to a standard kettle where the handles swings out of the way, this one might seem too awkward. The handle gets in the way of both filling and washing up. Other than that annoyance, the kettle does have one good thing going for it: the wide base is excellent for gas stoves; flames don't reach the sides. Some steam escapes the lid if it's not fitted precisely, but the whistle is sharp. And, it looks nice, so...that's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money spent for a teapot that didn't last","review":"Purchased this as a gift for my mother. She loved it. A bit heavy though. After 6 months the whole whistling assembly fell apart. Now looking for a new better tea kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I was so excited when I saw this. Simple, elegant.... But in less than a week, the covering on the spout was melting off. And we are in the kitchen while the tea kettle heats - there is no letting it sing away for minutes at a time. How can you make a product for boiling water if the temperature at boiling causes the spout to melt away?I really feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I had this kettle for several years and was very excited when I bought it. I liked how it opened by tilting the handle and the fact that it had a large opening for easy filling and cleaning. After a few weeks, however, I noticed that the screw that held the handle in place was getting loose. Eventually the screw would pop out and the handle would be useless. I was able to tighten the screw with a screw driver, but hated the fact that I had to do that every 3 weeks or so. I didn't want to buy a new kettle because I had spent $50 on this one. I recently bought a new kettle, but did not get another oxo. I usually like their products, but is one I will not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"dog ears","review":"You would need to be able to hear as well as a dog (or cat) to hear the whistle on this tea kettle.Yes, It is very pretty BUT it takes forever to boil water in, the spout opens every time you touch the handle & the lids leaks (as in when it is boiling, water & bubbles come up from the edges of the lid well before the whistle makes any sound at all (what little sound it makes).Too bad, the idea was good"},{"rating":"2","title":"OXO Good Grips Teakettle","review":"This is our second Good Grips teakettle. The rubber on the handle was wearing away on the first one after several years of daily use. We replaced it with the same model. What's that tell you? The only reason we don't give it five stars is it doesn't seem to be quite as sturdy and the whistle is not as loud as the first one. Time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"best tea pot I ever had","review":"I was given this teakettle as a wedding gift a year ago. As you can expect, most teakettles start getting mineral buildup after a while, but not this one.

The Best One Yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking junk","review":"I've had two of these and both had the same problems after less than a year of use -- the cover expanded and became very difficult to get on and off, and the handle loosened until eventually I couldn't get the screws back in tightly enough.

In this case, you don't get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"good looking unit, but not a good design","review":"On the Oxo model I use, the lid is held together by two screws where the handle attaches. Every three days or so I spend a few minutes removing the several pieces of the lid and carefully re-assembling them, and tightening the screws with a screwdriver, it's not a big deal but it's not awesome either.The angle of the handle makes the kettle difficult to fill, if you fill it through the removable lid the handle is in the way, if you fill it through the pour spout the handle is at an awkward angle relative to the faucet or water pitcher.After several years of daily use the parts all still look new, they are obviously high quality, but the poor engineering has me in the market for a different kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"expected better","review":"poor design with the handle in the way when your filling it from the top. expected better from Oxo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking, easy to pour but bigger than it looks!","review":"I am an avid tea drinker, making 2 or 3 pots of tea daily and this is a beautiful, well-made tea kettle.

Too bad, I really liked the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for gas stoves!","review":"This kettle is not designed for a gas stove. All it takes is one use with the flame a bit too high or the kettle a bit off the center of the burner, and the plastic spout cover melts.

There are very little directions or instructions on the package to warn you against using the adapter with items such as blow dryers. When I came back to the U.S. and tried my blow dryer, it didn't work anymore. But I did use the adapter to plug in my video camera to charge, and it worked just fine. I also charged my PSP Player. It worked great. The only other complaint is that the adapter is pretty loose on the outlet. I wasn't sure if it was going to stay put while it charged.

Absolutely the most practical unit I have used. It is also safe to use since it has a built-in fuse.This may seems obvious but you need to know that this device does not convert the voltage so don't plug your electronic devices unless its power units states that the Input voltage ranges from 110 to 240 VAC @ 50-60 Hz (probably the most common around Europe, Asia and America).Absolutely a most have if you travel with your laptop, digital camera, cell phone and other suitable devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful for the fine print!","review":"Read the fine print on this -- this product does not convert or reduce electrical voltage -- essentially what this does is provide a physical way for (insert your country's) plug to fit into (insert destination country's) plug. So if the country you are visiting runs on, say, 220, make sure that the device you want to plug into it can handle the 220 volts so that it doesn't blow up -- and that information will (typically) be handily located on the device itself (i.e., look at the small print on your phone charger, and see if it says 100-240V 50-60Hz)"},{"rating":"1","title":"think twice","review":"I bought this item for my trip to China.

For instance most laptop power supplies can handle 110 volt as well as 220 volt. Check the label before traveling.A couple of cautions. This adapter is fused and is limited as to how much wattage can be drawn. Good for safety, but don't use a travel iron with it or try to power multiple devices. You'll blow the fuse which I learned the hard way. Also, it is a bit bulky and may not fit in tight spaces.

So I can plug this into US-style plugs and plug UK appliances into it and vice-versa.

I love it and the reason you will too: it is fast! When you take a picture and you wanna take another, you just push the shutter release button again, and voila, the pic you would've missed with your point and shoot because it had to \\"recharge\\" or process the image. Even with flash, you can just keep clicking and taking pics. One big difference - with this SLR your eye WILL be looking through the eyepiece, and not at the 2.5 inch screen, because there is no image preview on the screen. But now, you WILL take good pictures in good light because you won't be depending on a washed out lcd screen in bright sunlight to see what you are capturing.At this price, get one today!

If you are thinking about a DSLR, definitely consider the Sony Alpha. I would still recommend my Maxxum 5D upon which the Sony Alpha is designed, but now the Sony comes with so much more for a very competitive price.BTW - one reviewer states that anti-shake doesn't work above 200 mm.

It wasn't until the 1980s when the masses began to learn these things.The book is a classic and is just as valid today as it was in the mid 20th century (why wouldn't it be?).Drucker explains within the book the reason for the word \\"practice\\" rather than \\"theory\\" of managment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most original work on management ever written","review":"Peter Drucker needs no introduction.

Hammer and Oasis) what happened to the surprise artists like Alanis, No Doubt and Whitney Houston?Overall, I think this set was a big waste of time. I spent most of my years in High School as a music freak, and the years before and after that I collected, listened and studied all genres.Perhaps I should just release my Ipod playlists, with better 90's collections, and more thoughtfullness involved?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much trash....not enough treasure","review":"im usually a big fan of the 80s music (thats when MTV used to play videos )the 90s decade was musically ruined by garage bands that couldnt sing for ****. quite to the contrary, the 90s had some decent songs .... its just not featured on this box set (whatever)"},{"rating":"1","title":"General lameness.","review":"This set pretty much sucks.The lamest collection of songs from the '90's that you're ever gonna hear, sounding like they were taken from 3rd generation sources.On top of that, the book inside features various wankers who try to sound glib and ironic, but still end up sounding like they should be writing for a Time-Life collection (with the exception of the Sub Pop founder).On top of it all, and this really gets me, the material describing the events of the decade in a timeline format, on top of being generally lame, is written AND edited as if by a non-native English speaker, which a) makes it hard to read, and b) contributes to a general feeling of shoddiness. Not what you want from a hundred-dollar investment, is it?I'm really surprised at Rhino; I'm usually a big fan of their collections. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"feminist ?","review":"When I read this book when it first came out, I remember thinking how great it was to finally find something written by a woman who was not hidding her gender under a masculine pseudonym or who had to use just initials for a first name.In retrospect, after many years, I realize the only thing I remember about it is that it sounded like Lesbian soft core porn with males reduced to mechanical sex slaves for the domineering females. This was considered very avant-garde stuff then before it turned out that real feminism just consisted in having women having access to well paying professional jobs (doctors, lawyers, etc.).The real future turned out to be a lot more prosaic but more empowered than we could ever have imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Lost Velvet Underground Album!","review":"The cover, which shows a gauge tilting into the red toward \\"VU\\", suggests that this will be a loud, grinding affair like the group's first two albums, but the truth is that this nice, laid-back set of previously unreleased songs belongs to the general period of THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, the group's third album. Most of the songs here probably would have gone onto a fourth album had the group not changed labels. Oddities include the rollicking \\"I Can't Stand It,\\" the sensitive \\"Stephanie Says,\\" the goofy \\"Temptation Inside Your Heart,\\" and the country-influenced \\"One of These Days.\\" This is definitely essential for any VU fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I know its heresy to say a Velvet Undergorund albumm is anything except amazing but I'm going to anyway, people need to know the truth!!!

Stephanie Says is basically a early (& inferior) version of Caroline Says 2 from Berlin with a name change for Caroline whilst She's My Best Friend, Lisa Says, Ocean & Andy's Chest are weaker versions than those Lou Reed put on his solo albums.Its not all negative though, I Can't Stand It is brilliant & with its choppy guitar interplay & good vocals could easily fit on the 3rd Velvets album. Foggy Notion is also a great song.I don't hate this album but I don't love it either but I'd say get the 4 official velvets albums & then think about if you really want this.Or tape the 5 good songs from one of your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"This is abother re-release of Sidewalks Fences & Walls, produced by Swamp Dog... don't buy it- Solomon Burke was never paid for this recording and will NEVER perform any of the songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal . . .","review":"Nothing compares to the facts, and no one who has not lived this could write it as C.M.

The tempi and ensemble work are excellent. What a wonderful Act two finale!As for individual voices, I am certainly not going to say that Skovhus is better than Thomas Allen. But he with his round tones and resonant voice, Skovhus amusingly conveys the scheming and frustrated Count. Oh....and you also get Studer, McNair, Gallo and Bartoli!But the real star is Abbado.

But if you have the choice between video and DVD, pick up the video instead. The packaging for this states that the extras include 40 Full Moon trailers, 2 theatrical trailers (funny since this movie was direct to video), Cast info, and a Featurette: The Making of Witchouse. What you REALLY get is 6 trailers, 34 less than advertised, lame cast bios and no Featurette. Someone over at Full Moon made a pretty big mistake and noone else there caught it. I think anyone interested in this should be aware of what you are really getting, ripped off! For the price, the DVD with the extras it has is pretty good, but since it advertises more than it delivers, the rating suffers. You're better off with the video, you'll get a few trailers, and the featurette appears after the film. You won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another reason Full Moon Productions is missed....","review":"Full Moon productions made some of the best cheesy horror movies of all time. Puppet Master and Subspecies are two wonderful examples. Witchouse is another of their great hidden treasures.When Elizabeth LeFay gathers her college friends to her old, family mansion of May Day, she invites the diverse group for a party. What ensues is a gory, revenge blood bath where Elizabeth's ancestor, an infamous witch named Lilith LeFay, rises from the dead and extracts revenge on the descendents of the puritans who murdered her, three hundred years before.Yes, the special effects aren't the best, neither is the acting, but the over all energy of the film is infectious and you find yourself sucked in and swept away over the scant 70 minutes the film takes.A fun, fast escape from reality, Witchouse is a buried treasure worth digging up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What posessed me to watch this?","review":"This movie had no redeeming qualities.

I don't think anyone in the cast had ever acted above high school theater and they delivered their lives as if they were being read off cue cards. It was so annoyingly bad that I could not enjoy it as a bad horror film (and I like bad horror films). In a rare switch the squeal Witchouse 2 is much better.I generally always mark down a film that does not have subtitles or closed captions but that is just a given with Full Moon Films.I actually did find subtitle downloads for their movies but I have no idea how to join them to the film on DVD.

The blending end, unfortunately, is not so sturdy. The wires are about the thickness of whisk wires, and they tend to clump or spread apart when confronted with hard bits of butter. I have used mine several times, and while it does eventually get the job done, it's only slightly more efficient than butter knives. The wires on my tool are permanently mis-spaced from normal use--there is a large gap between the middle loops. It is easy to clean, and I imagine if you're working with softer materials, like shortening, this tool might work for you. On hard butter, though, it's frustratingly ineffective.I am not pleased with this product and strongly encourage you to buy something sturdier. I'm eventually going to upgrade to something with blades--I think the increase in sturdiness will outweigh the inconvenience of cleaning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wires Spread","review":"I have had this blender for a while. It is okay on smaller jobs such as streusel but I recently made a double pie crust recipe and instead of cutting the butter the wires spread and let the butter pass through almost whole. It was a mess. By the time I was done by arms were sore, the blender was misshapen and there were still huge chunks of butter in the dough. I would suggest getting one that has sides to it so the wires don't have as much room to spread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart too easily","review":"It works like its suppose to for a while, be the \\"tongs\\" are too fragile and bendable.

This worked well enough and it was easy to grip BUT it is flimsy. Even with the limited use I made of it (once a month) the plastic holding the wires BROKE.

So was very excited when I saw this OXO model. Was VERY disappointed with it. As other reviews point out, the wires do not cut--they bend. They are not rigid enough to cut shortening into dough. The handle is great, the wires are useless. The 'OXO Good Grips Dough Blender with Blades'[model number: 1124200] looks like a better tool, although I have not tried it yet. I just went out and bought another 'cheapie' with BLADES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worthless!","review":"I was visiting a friend who didn't own a pastry cutter, so we ran to the store to get one. All they had was this Oxo Dough Blender, so even though I prefer a blender with blades, I bought this by default. What a mistake! When I tried to chop the shortening into the flour (for a pie crust), this piece of junk only SMASHED the shortening into the flour, and I couldn't create the 'pea-sized' shortening pieces that allow you to have a light, flaky crust.I do not recommend this blender at all! It ruined my pie crust! I only recommend a pastry blender/cutter with BLADES that chop the shortening into the flour, or the butter into a streusel topping. Oxo actually sells a correctly bladed one (the \\"Oxo Good Grips Dough Blender with Blades\\"), so why would you buy their inferior dough blender??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This does not cut in butter very well, it just mashes it, since the wires are round, not flat like blades. The wires are very bendy, which also is ineffective. Sending this to Goodwill and got one with the blades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I'm Here","review":"I'm here on Amazon looking at pastry blenders to replace this guy which finally broke yesterday. The handle broke at one of the end wires, so I had to pull it up out of the way so I could finish my pie crust. Granted, I had it for years, but I'm looking for my tools to last a lifetime- I guess I'm funny that way.I also agree with the other commenter that the hard butter just pushes the wires out of the way. This really isn't a very well-designed piece of equipment and I should have noticed it when I bought it, but I was pretty enamored of OXO Good Grips tools. I can't imagine someone with limited abilities being able to use this thing though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable to use, but not functional","review":"Nice handle design, but that's about as much as I can say for this pastry knife. The wire blades are too flexible, so they tend to bend around butter/shortening instead of cutting it. If you want something that works, buy a pastry knife with blades that are cut from a solid piece of metal, instead of individual wires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked plastic","review":"I liked the product because the handle was more comfortable to hold than my previous one. Cold butter was hard to cut with this, and the last time I used it, one of the end tines was bending way out. After closer inspection, I saw that the plastic around the tine had just cracked apart. Some duct tape might do the trick, but no, I'm now searching for a better pastry blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great item!","review":"I'm a loyal fan of the OXO Good Grips line.

That means the fat and flour must be blended well, but not overblended. This tool has taken a lot of the hard work and time out of the old way of using two knives in scissors action. The overall balance to weight ratio is excellent; the handle is a good diameter and width, and the tines are spaced apart nicely. The design of the tines makes reaching all parts of the bowl to pick up flour a breeze. Cleanup is easy since you can toss it into the diswasher without fear of rust. I highly recommend this product from novice to pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless..!","review":"I bought this blender to make pie pastry, and I was thoroughly disappointed.

This dough blender works perfectly. It's much faster and more comfortable than the old \\"two knives\\" method. And it's sure easier to clean than a food processor. For making biscuits, pie or tart crust, or any other kind of baked pastry product, it's a great tool to have. It costs less than $10, so if you're thinking about getting it, stop thinking and do it.A tip: if you're good at planning ahead (I'm not, unfortunately), you might want to try putting it in the refrigerator an hour or so before using it, which will help to ensure that the butter doesn't melt excessively before you can finish cutting it into the dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I bought this reluctantly because I needed a pastry blender and this is the only one I could find. After reading the other reviews, I figured it would be fine. Big mistake. The butter pushed the wires around at first, then got stuck all over them rather than actually being blended into my dry ingredients.

The coach was a slacker and was throughout the movie. In this one Billy Bob seems to try to mimic Walter Matthau and the rest as well. The original was racy and risky. This one at the final game all of a sudden both coaches are mean? It just didn't work. None of it worked. I like Billy Bob and I was able to finish the movie. But come on. When Joeys mother was like \\"I'm taking Joey home right now\\", was a joke. It just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid's Movie","review":"Probably the worst movie that I've seen in a very long time. This movie was billed as a kids movie yet it had so much bad language and adult content. Worse scene of the movie was Billy Bob sitting in Hooters with his team singing Cocaine! The script was bad, the jokes were terrible, the casting was atrocious. Very, very disappointing. The original was much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Foul Balls and No Home Runs.","review":"Hollywood really needs to get off the remake bandwagon. This remake was really bad. Despite a few laughs we kept asking, \\"Is it over soon?\\" It was painfully obvious these child actors had no previous experience, lots of overacting and not endearing. The continuity was off during the games with fouls and homeruns. Thornton and Kinear have done much better elsewhere. I know I'm not supposed to compare to other films but really... stick with the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"alot of fun","review":"the original is a fine movie but i dont think this one was made to be 'better', but rather just meant to be alot of fun. and after coming off a successful 'bad santa', this movie is right up that alley giving you more of that hilarious crude billy bob humour. so you all ought to know by now that these seemingly 'children&adult' movie's with billy bob are going to have some crude humour and some of the jokes are going to be over a childs head as well. doest mean everyone cant still enjoy the heck out of it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News Bears: Not For Everyone","review":"This movie was comprised of a stream of dragging scenes of young boys fighting, cursing, and showcasing their unbelievably horrible baseball skills. Nothing deep, nothing profound. Just rowdy kids playing ball.However, there were some sharp one-liners and jokes that made me laugh out loud. Billy Bob does a good job of playing a disillusioned, crass old lech trying to redeem his middle years by assuming the role of a little league baseball coach.If you liked \\"A League of Their Own,\\" you probably won't like this one because this movie is as far away from a chick flick as Liberaci is from being straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news for the Bears","review":"As a person who grew up watching the original Bears, I was quite disappointed in the new version of the classic. Not only do I find the movie offensive and unfitting for kids of any age, I was extremely turned off by the constant use of vulgar language and sexual suggestions through out the movie. Its no wonder the kids of today have such problems watching and listening to the over use of swearing in movies now a days. What happened to family movies where the whole family could sit down and enjoy them? I don't see where there was the need to have the kids swearing at the coach in pretty much every scene. And the scene with the kid sitting on the bench where the only words readable were \\"got laid\\", with him blocking the word \\"off\\" is necessary. If you want a good movie, don't get this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"this film struck out&quickly","review":"Billy Bob Thornton should have been able to knock this film out of the park,but instead He strikes out. this film is boring.the acting is Horrible&doesn't hold my attention at all. if it wasn't connected to the 70's classic then I wouldn't have wasted more than a half of a hour wasting my time on this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS PROVES HOW UNNECESSARY REMAKES ARE....","review":"It was nice to reminisce of the good ol' days, when movie making was an actual art. This movie shows a perfect example of how remakes of classics are totally unnecessary, unless they can show off newer animation and technology (e.g. king kong, war of the worlds, etc.). Billy Bob is funny, but thats all this movie offers. Was this movie a remake or a spoof ? The kids acting was horrible, and they are far less cute than the original cast. The bad mouthing and swearing of the kids was not funny, but more annoying than anything. Tatum O'neal was adorable as Amanda, but this new girl looks as if she is being forced into acting and looks like a guy with long hair. Hollywood, should ban all remakes !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what it says it is.","review":"It's a big spatula, firm, well made, quite a stiff blade, and ideally suited for things like cake baking.

This CD is not worth buying unless you have some extra dollars,... but on the second thought it's better for you if you buy some burgers with that!They used to have an anthem songs and hits like \\"I remember you\\", \\"Youth Gone Wild\\", \\"Slave to the Grind\\", \\"Monkey Business\\", \\"My enemy\\", \\"Into another\\", \\"Breakin' Down\\", and so many more... but all gone now.Solinger is nothing compared to Bach, and if you listen carefully to most of the songs, it was like that Solinger trying so hard to sound like Bach. The drummer also poor, very poor, the guy playing (I don't even remember his name) looks like a junkie with no spirit to live. Rob's playing is much better than you, man!!Only 1 song that a little bit worth hearing is \\"Disease\\". The rest is like the band trying to be badboys with dirty lyrics, but that's not the Skid Row I used to know. My advice for the band management is recruit back Bach"},{"rating":"1","title":"Country Row? Not the Skid Row I was looking for.","review":"So I've been on both sides of the fence with this Skid Row battle. I've seen some bands carry on pretty good with new singers and I figured hey we'd get the usual two sides with both having good results. Well Mr. Bach is still metal and hard rock just the way I like it and this.........UM Skid Row? Is it really. Starts out with something similar that has a Bach era feel to it then BAM!!!! Country music?, Country music REALLY!!!!!!!! Did I miss something here? I wouldn't even of minded if you went back to more of your sound from the first skid days or if you have to toy with a country feel then it better be sounding more like Dime and Vinnies project not this crap.

Come on guys get back together and tour already. Look if Motley Crue can get back together and tour even though they travel in seperate tour buses so they don't fight then so be it!

I can't tell any major difference in the bonus track and would of preferred a re-recording or a live recording of a original Skid Row song instead like on Thickskin. Johnny Solinger is a great singer and the music is still Skid Row. Dispite the bad reviews Scotty and Dave still shred. I agree there's a lot more punk vibe on this record but the first album had it too. I think the country songs were just showing their sense of humor. At least half the songs are that solid Skid Row groove. The haters need to get over it. I mean have you heard the music Sebastian Bach has put out since he left? Or the condtion of his voice? If he was still around you would be writing What happened to Skid Row? This is a case where the singer IS NOT!! the band. I believe their next disc will really shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skid Row??? UGH...","review":"Whatever happened to the sound that made this band what they are? \\"Dick in the System\\" is a decent tune..but the rest of this CD sounds like it wants to go country which, for a metal fan such as myself, is pretty frightening!

An affront to the name Skid Row. Yes I am a Baz fan but this is an honest review - if the band had gotten a good new singer and put together good material I would be able to listen to it. How any Skid Row fan could give this any stars is beyond me. There is none of the edge or emotion that made the band great. Even worse than Thickskin.

This is the type of album that can keep you in a trance for days on end. Nearly every song has that mesmerizing feel about it, the sole exception being \\"Here She Comes Now,\\" a ballad which gives the listener a needed pause to catch a breath. The title track is one of the group's finest, while \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" and \\"The Gift\\" engulf the listener in a sea of guitar feedback. By the time you get to \\"Sister Ray\\" you'll be completely swallowed up. At over 17 minutes, I find it unnecessarily long, which is the only reason I hesitate giving this album a full 5 stars.

Well, you'll just have to read it, too!Altogether Aron examines many baseball myths in scientific terms to either dispel or to confirm them.His writing style is light and airy, but he's concise and to the point.

I saw this one and thought we will give it a try. By that afternoon something had clicked and she understand how to rhyme! It is now 6 months later and this is both hers and my favorite of the books that are out there for this system.

My old whisk had 5 wire loops that would jam into each other and bend funny (piece of junk). The Good Grips 11\\" balloon whisk has 10 wire loops that don't come into contact with each other, allowing for more thorough whisking. The plug in the handle where the wire loops go though is heavily sealed, keeping it very sanitary. It's really durable. It can whip up a half a dozen eggs in a big mixing bowl super quick (that's the most I've tried -- I'm sure it can do more). Also great for large gravy making at Thanksgiving. Other than discoloration of the wire loops (after much use and dishwasher cleanings) it still looks and feels new."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually prefer the feel of a good wooden handle...","review":"...but since I'm lazy and this is dishwasher safe, it wins by default.

It handles a single egg or a box of cake mix. The handle is comfortable to hold and weighted just enough that it doesn't tire my hand or wrist - even with severe arthritis. It's large enough not to get totally lost in a bigger bowl but small enough to work efficiently in a tighter bowl too. The tines aren't flimsy - they keep their shape while you are whipping away. Easy cleanup in the dishwasher. Can't think of a single thing I'd change.Last whisk standing.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I want to give every child a chance to dance\\"","review":"Nobody could capture a persona to tape like Bolan could, or pen melodies as breathtaking as his...This is the stage in his career when he was merging his nutty pop-folk with touches of electric guitar, right before he abbreviated the band name and reinvented himself with Electric Warrior. Personally, I find Beard of Stars, Unicorn, and T-REX to be flat-out amazing work. Many choose to ignorantly pin these albums as just the material that lead to Electric Warrior, but those people are really missing the heart that is present in the songwriting.Check out these lyrics to \\"Root of Star\\":\\"a root of star/ I gave to thee/ from the canyons of the sea/ a jewel of frost/ that was lost/ in days of dreams when we were freea shield of bronze/ a thousand gongs/ that calls the queen of dreams to me/ a mask of jade/ was surely laid/ to the formal finery\\"There is a certain mystical power at work here not present in his later (more renowned) albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talentless Hacks","review":"I received this album (on vinyl) in a stack of records cast off by a friend.

Her diction is excellent and she shows a real flair for interpretation in every language. I agree with another listener that her Brazilian songs are very special. She is a rare vocalist who can keep her jazz credentials in balance with her ability to convey popular songs. It is too bad that she didn't have the \\"A\\" Team in post production. While the instruments are well miked, someone made the decision that she needed reverb/echo on each song.

Granted that some songs he sang by the mid seventies reflected his state of mind in relation to losing the love of his life, but he still came through at that time with good songs too.

This glove's material is as grippy as I have ever experienced. However, the seam design and seam cut on this glove is TERRIBLE. If you look at the second image on Amazon's entry for this product, you will see that the thumb piece for this glove has a seam that comes to a point in the upper left of the picture, just above where one's thumb meets the palm. This is a natural pressure point when holding a racquet. My skin ripped away at that point within 20 minute of my first match. Later I was able to carefully trim the excess fabric along the seam, so that now the rubbing is merely slightly painful rather than skin-ripping.It is possible that this problem was caused solely by the sewing and is specific to the glove I received rather than the entire model, but it turned what would have been a 5-star glove into a 2-star glove."},{"rating":"2","title":"great glove","review":"i had never played with a glove before so i figured while i had the card out and i was shopping what the hell. i'm quite glad that i did because it changed my game.there is a semi-sticky surface on the glove that really grips to the racquet handle. after two weeks it has started to become a little less tacky, but i do not notice this during gameplay.i'm not sure how this measures from one glove to the next, but i do very much enjoy this product. the fit is nice, and i dont even notice i have it on once i start playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This movie is so bad it hurts to watch it.

What I found was a common story dealing with the ordinary lives of gay men overpowering the wills of younger, and very poor, gay boys.I can accept a story of a gay lifestyle. It is common enough. But there was no effort to give the characters depth beyond identifying the adult as wealthy and the boys as poor and desperate to please. The senseless killing that highlighted these young men's behavior brought no meaning to the story, expect to realize that death leads to death. And life goes on. I do not think that what was told in this film was any different than what might be told in New York, Paris or London. Filming the story in Medellin, Colombia may have given it cult status, but it failed to give it any meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"A poorly made video (no, not a film -- it was shot on video) depicting an older man who meanders meaninglessly from boy to boy.

The acting is nothing to write home about, mainly because the script is so feeble. The characters are poorly drawn and basically unlikeable.I could hardly believe this was the same film the critics had been praising so effusively.

The on off switch is all but hidden, the cord wrap is useless, the wheels and axel vibrete and rattle, even the stickers are falling off already.

Since this is oil less it is important to keep it from overheating. Also, the gauge was defective and they want me to take it to a center to get it fixed so I bought an external gauge to avoid the hassle of it being in a repair shop for indeterminate time.

The blade is of a pretty good thickness, so it seems strong, and it has a beveled edge at the bottom, so it's not a sharp point, but it's great for dividing dough and scraping really effectively. In addition, it has a ruler on the edge (for measuring...anything, I guess), and a grippy, rubberized handle. The handle is my only complaint with this, as it doesn't feel quite right - it's maybe not quite big enough for me. Still, it's nice and grippy and feels secure.

There is no mention of the workings of the item such as electrical hook up yes or no. Are there any Electronics with it ??????

The seccond Had some. then we have Grandia Xtreme. In like the first couple of sentences there was a large number of them. The game is also a dungeon crawl, the enemies are not a challenge to beat, including the final boss, and the graphics are kind of cheesy. I hate the new battle system. Myam looks like her hair is made up of red banannas. I could go on forever about this horrible game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"In this day and age there is no excuse for such a pathetic attempt at an rpg. The storyline is horrible, with the worst dialogue ever. This game is little better than a dungeon crawl. The game drops you in the middle of a tedious story line with all your characters already there. There is little attempt to give them any sort of individuality and the main character is so irritating that you prefer the main villain. I regret spending 40+ hours on this game. I kept thinking that it would improve, but it doesn't. The only redeeming aspect of this game is that it has the best fighting dynamics out there. But if that's the case, I would recommend playing some of the other Grandia games. I give it two stars just because of the fighting engine, but it's still not worth playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xtreme-ly Unmemorable","review":"Grandia Xtreme is the black sheep of the series. It shares a battle system with the other Grandia games, but little else. It's primarily a dungeon crawler. You spend most of your time slogging up and down a few relatively boring dungeons and have very little world exploration or character interaction compared to the first 2 games.It's story and characters are so uninteresting, that I can't remember a single character or location name. Whereas I can still remember most of the characters and places in the first Grandia game, even though I haven't played it since the year after it was released (years before I played Grandia Xtreme).If you want a mindless, fairly easy dungeon crawler, or you just want another game with the Grandia battle system, then this is your game. But most likely, you're better off looking elsewhere. Had it been the first Grandia game made instead of the 3rd, it might have gotten better ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GAME IN A WHILE","review":"this games shows you alot the battle system is the best i have seen in a long time it is funny to grate story line and with twist at eatch corner if u dont have this game u should buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sandal I've ever owned.","review":"The comfort and support these sandals give are unlike any flip-flop I've ever tried. They feel much like a full hiking sandal with the heel strap unfastened -- which is how I wear full sandals, anyway. Traction is great. They feel good wet, and are also quick-drying -- soggy sandals are a pet peeve of mine, which is why I usually bring an extra all-rubber sandal for water activities (sacrificing support) when traveling. No need for that now.A great bonus is how they fit my feet perfectly. I've tried other Keen footwear and I've had problems finding a good fit. The big toe protector is usually too small for me - not good since I frequently get ingrown nails. No such complaints with the Waimea. I also think they look pretty cool, and can be used as all-around casual footwear (I find some Keen sport sandals and shoes to be pretty ugly and purely utilitarian). I'm very happy I found these sandals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD & CD","review":"Las Numero 1 is a great CD and DVD: It is fun to watch Los Hermanos Castro sing their hits and to watch guest singers, like Veronica Castro & Manoella Torres, sing with Los Hermandos Castro. It was also very interesting to hear Jorge Castro & Gualberto Castro sing solo & duet. When Los Hermanos Castro broke up, it was Gualberto who zoomed to fame as a solo singer, but Jorge Castro, I believe was terribly overlooked. He had a great voice and a marvelous range, but Jorge could not hit the tenor notes like Gualberto.

Mille and company lay waste to every thing in their path on this release...if you don't beleive me, just get this thing! The production is raw enough to enhance the aggression, but its a LOT better than on \\"Endless Pain.\\" There are a few slower moments like \\"Riot of Violence\\" and \\"Take Their Lives,\\" but overall this is a really fast album. My only complaint would be the guitar solos, which are basically maniacal tapping and whammy diving, but for the music they're playing here, it suits the insanity that is so prevelant. FEEL THE PLEASURE TO KILL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kreator's death/thrash classic","review":"This is still my favorite Kreator album. Although Kreator eventually developed into a pure thrash band, this album could arguably be considered death metal, as it has guttural (though higher pitched) vocals, blazing speed, dark tremolo picked riffs, and insane noisy solos- all musical features adopted by the death metal scene. Although Kreator's musical abilities improved on future releases, for me they never topped the dark, raw intensity of \\"Pleasure To Kill\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife Loves it","review":"I got this for my wife for her Birthday and she loves it.

Now, reading my fourth Marsh novel, _When in Rome_, I can say that I like her even better than Agatha Christie. _When in Rome_ is about a group of tourists (incl. the famous Inspector Alleyn) whose guide suddenly disappears. Only Inspector Alleyn, who joined the tour because he suspects that the guide is a key member of a drug ring, is worried about his disappearance; most of the tour group couldn't care less. In fact, a few of them couldn't be happier that the seedy Mr. Mailer has conveniently vanished."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one Marsh that can be skipped","review":"The deficiencies here are glaring. Two of the victims are villains and the third hisses a few words, spits at one of the villains, and is gone, never to reappear except as a dead body. We don't miss any of them and don't really care who killed them. The central characters are never remotely in danger of being suspected. The most interesting feature of the story is a fictional twelth-century basilica built atop a third-century church, which had itself been built atop a house dating from Mithraic times. In all, a book without tension, suspense, or interest (except in the basilica)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have purchased O'Cedar mopheads for 20 years.

The emphasis is on building things yourself, and to that end it is an extremely valuable handbook for our increasingly passive society. There are definitely things here that will give you pause or that are culturally dated -- like making a blow gun, trapping and raising wild animals and taxidermy at home -- but that is where parenting comes in, and all-in-all I would say this is a valuable and exciting book for kids, filled with pragmatic insights and a fun historical document as well.

The moods swing further than on most of the their albums but it sits together incredibly well as a cohesive whole.

I know it has to be that loop; that song was huge in Latin America at the time when PSBs were there working on this LP. I like this LP a lot, but I still hate \\"Electricity\\" and \\"Se A Vida E.\\" I like them for their more ethereal and European stylings on whatever dance genre they are using. And those two tracks don't have it! But \\"To Step Aside\\" is maybe my favorite? I also like \\"Before\\", which MTV Latino was playing when this came out. I got the special remix CD with this CD. It was an import. I almost like that remix CD as much as the regular CD.

The Tuesday it was released I was at the store. Got home...hated almost every track. I bought 'Before' as a cd-single and thought 'The Truck Driver and His Mate' b-side was better. The song doesn't even sound like PSB. Being a die-hard fan, I let it sit and played it again and gradually fell in love with it. The easy fade in from 'Discoteca' to 'Single' is just brilliant.

It appears PSBs have tried to incoporate somewhat of a Spanish theme into this album, but they have not followed it through! What we end up with, then, is an awful pastiche of discordant Latin American rhythms and woeful electronica.Perhaps i'm being a bit harsh on PSB. The album does, after all, pick up in the middle with the pleasant - if innocuous - \\"Se La Vita E.\\" And the album's highlight - \\"A Red Letter Day\\" - would have been certainly worthy of inclusion on \\"Very\\" or \\"Behaviour.\\"Nonetheless, this is incredibly disappointing given the talent of the PSBs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS TIME TO RETIRE GUYS.","review":"Absolutely awful.

I was expecting something as rich and deep as \\"Behaviour\\". But what came out was something (in my point of view) as basic and poorly written as a rave-dance-track. The lyrics are 2nd rate, the rhymes are laughable and the (beautiful) music (they used to write) was overcame by dance beats, latin beats, even Bossa Nova-like beats. \\"Discoteca\\" and \\"Single\\" are mindless tracks that keep repeating themselves. \\"Electricity\\" is as boring and dull as \\"Up Against It\\". \\"It Always comes as a Surprise\\" is an easy melody helped by a likable bossa nova mood.

Both of their Tribute albums are fresh.

I should not have. This DVD has quite a bit going for it. Firstly Chailly's conducting is superb and the very sound of his orchestra is outstanding. Secondly the production in effect translates the opera into a two act affair with disk one playing nonstop through Act 2, scene 2 and disk two doing the same for the rest of the opera. This works quite well for home viewing. Thirdly the acting, singing, and movement all highlight the drama and tensions of this opera and keep one involved with what is going on with the characters. I was particularly impressed with Villazon, Croft, and Lloyd in this regard. Needless to say I am quite happy to see Carlo played as an anguished adolescent. And the sets and costumes? Well they don't get in the way of the drama. Is this THE Don Carlo? I will not say. Is it an exciting night at the opera? Definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL PRODUCTION","review":"If you are an Opera lover you must have this DVD!!!I just can say: you need to see it, to believe it!!!

I used to have a horrible habit of forgetting to take my daily meds and vitamins. If I'm running late in the mornings I just pop that day's 'bubble' in my purse and take them on the go. It saves so much counter space, too. I no longer have 6 or 7 different pill bottles junking up the limited counter space I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for organization","review":"I received exactly what I expected to receive in a timely manner with no surprises or delays. I had bought one of them a couple of years ago and could no longer find them in the stores. I was thrilled to find them online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liking this product","review":"I read reviews of a number of pill organizers and decided on this mainly due to individual, daily pill pods. Before purchasing, I was concerned that since AM and PM compartments don't have individual lids, the AM and PM pills may accidentally get mixed together. So, far this has not been the case. The pills remain in their own compartment in the pod. Like others have stated, if the lid is opened too wide, the pod tips backwards, but this is remedied by leaving the lid at a 90 degree angle. I like that I can leave the day's pill pod on the counter top, while store the rest in the cabinet. I have had no problems opening and closing the pods, but I can see how someone with arthritis may have trouble. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"The only thing I would change on this item would be the size. It is a bit big, but it is fairly useful. Great for anyone on the go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pill Holder","review":"I use this to hold all my pills and supplements.

The main issue is it the little pill containers don't stay latched very well. Considering the cost of medication, I really need a container that stays latched, losing meds I can barely afford as it is, is not an option for me.This device only works as a stationary pill holder/organizer, and you better be careful when you pick it up, because they come open VERY easily.Sigh... I'll use it until I find something better.I have to put the containers in a sandwhich baggy to be on the safe side. That way when they come open I don't lose my meds."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews first - not happy","review":"I purcased 4 of these units as they looked like they would do the job. When they arrived, I gave 2 to my sister before I'd even tried them.I think the design could use some work. I really expected the AM and PM to be seperated and the pills do get mixed up. Next when you open them to fill them the top is heavier and they tip over while filling. I have to go to extra trouble of trying to set up an arrangement where the lids are held in place against a magazine etc before filling.I'm not happy with this purchase and if I'd not already opened them and given half of them away I would definately send them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A problem solver","review":"My elderly father likes to carry his daily meds around in a little case (taken from the day-of-the-week case I fill up on weekends), but now that he has am and pm pills to take, I needed a new system since he easily gets confused. These little cases, an individual one for each day of the week, really help. I fill them up on weekends, and put a little label with the numerical date on each one too, so he knows, for instance, it is Sunday, May 31, and he plucks that container off the rack and puts it in his pocket. Not perfect, but an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"I love this!

I have read that the pill cases are slippery, but I didnt see a problem with that. I also read on the reviews that the items lid is heavier than the base and its hard to fill...maybe its cause I'm a nurse and give pills for a living, lol...but I found it not a problem to fill. I also read people saying that it was hard to give pills in the am if there were pills for pm due to no lid on each side...I hold one finger over the pills in the pm and turn the item over and never have once lost one in the shuffle...SO...I bought enough for two weeks worth of pills and am ordering more tonight so I can have a month ready at one time!

It has a divider between the AM and PM sections. The only downside to the product is that it can be tough sometimes to open at first as there is not a point of leverage to grab on to. This might be tough for those with bad arthritis. (I'm only 26 so it doesn't bother me much.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big yet convenient","review":"Got this for my mother so that she can be more diligent in taking her pills. The compartments are big enough to fit all of her pills for the day. It is also easy for her to open unlike some other pill cases. The color coordination is nice also. And she likes the convenience of just taking one case with her in her purse for the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Your Meds & Vitamins In Line!","review":"This is a great product. I gave it to my dad for the holidays because it is portable and has a spot for AM and PM. He would put his vitamins in a tissue and half the time they would fall on the floor.

The exterior of these individual pill boxes is too slippery; she was unable to hold them and return to the tray.

When when opened, the meds could accidentally be spilled into another section. Great concept but needs some modifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very efficient","review":"Poor product thou company was great. seemed to be a good idea but very tedious in filling.

Previous to this pill box, I had an elongated weekly pill box. The problem with the large weekly pill boxes is that they are too large to easily carry and often have small compartments that don't hold all of your pills. I decided to buy this pill box based on all of the rave reviews. I can honestly say that you will not be disappointed, especially if you are required to take medication twice a day. I am extremely forgetful regarding medication. The transparent daily pill boxes allow me easily have a visible indication of whether or not my medication was taken without having to open it. The daily pill box is rather large and can easily hold several of your larger pills. I liked this design because I can grab the day's medication right before I head out to the office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I purchased this for myself since I am now taking supplements and I found myself forgetting to take them.

BUT having said that, there's no denying that Mangione has a talent for melody invention. And he seems to surround himself with sidemen who are likewise \\"melody-sensitive\\". This time he's teamed up with producer/co-songwriter Morris \\"Butch\\" Stewart. Some tracks sound like vintage Mangione of the late 70s, while others - \\"hip-hop Mangione?\\" - make one wonder WHO thought THIS would be a good idea? All in all this is a recording worth having in the collection if you're of fan of CM back to the days when he was credible.

The whisk is too flimsy at the point where the \\"wires\\" converge on the handle. Therefore, you have to hold the whisk by that part of the wires and not by the handle to keep it from flexing too much. A reinforcing circle of nylon would have solved this problem.

The original production was just horendous. Plus the lyrics and guitar playing is terrible! Not to mention the vocals. Even for Death Metal vocals these are bad.

Possessed is talentless and only got notieced for a VERY short time because of their evil image. I'm not buying into it and intelligent listeners shouldn't either.

Possessed didn't last long, and after hearing this, I can see and hear why.

I believe that this translation has merit in that it relays the Koranic message in a way that is easy to understand. Those wishing to explore more precise, and thereby more complex versions, should ideally look to the original text, or a dual-language version, where there are adjacent columns of Arabic and English. Since the Koran is originally presented in verse, one may wish to read a tranlation which also presents the text in verse. But, for those who wish to study the text in a relaxed fashion, I would recommend this prose translation. Incidentally, another reviewer's comment clarifying the meaning of the word Qawamoon as truly meaning \\"have been charged with\\" is correct, based on my own research.

Don't tell US that Islam is peaceful. Start telling your fellow moslems. They are the ones that need convincing. Having read this, it seems to me that the Koran is a very violent and intolerant message. It is also anti-woman, anti-science, anti-gay, anti-jewish/christian, anti-peace. I can see clearly from reading it how followers could use it as an excuse for war. Don't tell me that Jihad means \\"struggle\\" and not war.

Many passages are poorly translated(i believe purposely), to give the worst view possible about islam. You would be better off reading any version other than this(also like the plague, to avoid anything written by Robert Spencer, who also spews propaganda against Islam, and is a well known Isamophobe).

Dawood often distorts the message. He turns observations about wartime activity into commands of aggression. He transforms passages regarding the natural love between husband and wife into suggestions that women are soley for a man's pleasure.Those who want to appreciate the poetry are best off reading the orginal Arabic (or buying a taped version so they can listen to it without having to learn Arabic) Those who are interested in a translation that preserves the beauty of the language and an accompanying in depth explanation should read \\"The Message of the Quran\\" by Muhammad Asad.

Ice Cube weaves in and out of serious topics about ownership, real-estate, white collar crime and Anglo fantasies but these addressed get re-dressed and celebrated for their errors and mistakes. In my conclusion, there is no redemption to the immoral of the story. Nothing here is worth the price for this dvd.

The only downside is that it was larger than I was expecting. Right now I am using it on a crib frame turned into a daybed.

On top of that the pins meant to lock the rails up have a spring mechanism that tends to come through the holes and need to be fiddled with.In the end, mine don't work properly and are no longer 100% reliable.

Also, the buttons don't *stay* out during the stow-away process, and so I need to go through all the trouble of unsticking them again when I put the bed rail up!! It's a giant pain in the butt and involves lots of cursing and back pain (from lifting the mattress up repeatedly).

So the half of the bed that is sitting on this bar is elevated.

The representative was rude--telling me it shouldn't be washed. He was sarcastic when I was inquiring about the straps on the product (as he had me searching for the model number).

His bed is relatively high, but we have not been concerned. He is not able to release the rail on his own, yet I am able to easily collapse and stow it under his mattress when I make his bed allowing him to use the bed as seating and play space during the day. Also allows us to use his bed as a guest bed if needed without having to completely remove the rail.The rail was easy to install with adjustable straps & brackets that hug the bottom of your mattress. Once on firmly, it has stayed in place, even when changing the bedding. The rail itself has two release pens that can slip when not locked in place but are easily pulled to allow the rail to be stowed. Rail stowing is easy when tracks are squarely in place.

Amusing, witty, and with enough differences in each short story to keep us entertained.

Would buy from seller again"},{"rating":"2","title":"OXO Products Rock!","review":"Like other OXO products, this one is also a good buy! Every time I buy OXO products, I get what I expect from OXO! Some reviews say it's too slow, but I think it's okay. I like this shifter better than traditional squeeze-handle shifters which make my hand and wrist tired. OXO flour shifter is easy to use, clean, and store, and I like it. The only disappointment was that the one I received from Amazon had a large dent on it. Other than that, it's a must-have for baking."},{"rating":"2","title":"One handed operation = awesomeness","review":"Oxo wins again with this handy gadget! (Excuse the pun) It is easy to use and can be operated one-handed using a side-to-side motion. It has tight-sealing lids for both the top and bottom, so you can leave flour in it all of the time. It holds two cups, which is perfect for most applications, yet it remains small enough for easy storage. I had been using a strainer, which can be pretty messy, so this was a big step up from that.One thing to note regarding the tag for arthritis on this... I have psoriatic arthritis, which effects my hand & wrist joints. After typical use with this sifter, my wrist joint is pretty sore. I do not think this is a better option than traditional sifters, in that regard, but I thought I would mention it. Perhaps the tag is there because the handle is more ergonomic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just \\"OK\\" Sifter","review":"I've been slowly gathering a collection of Oxo products that are easier on me. I have fibromyalgia and one of my most painful places is my hands. I wanted to LOVE this sifter, and, while I think its a bit on the small side, I really fell for the covers that could be put on the top and bottom to make the job of multiple siftings much easier. I knew right off that a squeeze type sifter wouldn't work for me, OUCH! What I didn't realize was that the repetateive shaking with the Oxo would be just as uncomfortable. A really good concept, making comfortable kitchen tools, but too bad this one really didn't accomplish what I had hoped it would.Good points? Top and bottom covers, quality construction. Bad points? Too small, still uncomfortable to use, not made in US."},{"rating":"2","title":"study and reliable sifter, but slow","review":"I have had this sifter for several years now and it is the best of the 5-6 I have had. It is sturdy stainless and has convenient covers on top and bottom. Since I have arthritis, I find it easier to use than a trigger type or winder . Yes, it's slower, and it is small, but for me it has lasted longer than any others I have had, without leaking or breaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"I returned this product right away. I wanted a sifter that you could use with one hand. You would do just as well to use a strainer than this product. The design made it useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"I have been very pleased with other OXO products, but this sifter is a dud.

The plastic cover that fits on the bottom so that you can fill the sifter on your counter is too loose and fell off. It is practically impossible to sift flour. While gripping the handle and squeezing to sift there is nothing to hang onto to balance the sifter. You have to balance with your other hand. Perhaps it would work OK with a 1/2 cup of flour but it certainly did not with a larger amount. I gave up and went back to my old sifting method."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT!","review":"I bought this sifter and washed before I used it. The bottom strainer part came undone, so I pushed it back into place, except it wouldn't go back in the right spot, so everytime I shook it side to side, it wouldn't sift, because the metal piece that slides back and forth to sift wasn't touching the bottom strainer part anymore. Needless to say, it went back and I got the old fashioned kind with the squeeze handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have paid attention to other reviews!","review":"This is the worst product I have purchased from Amazon.

I had a sifter with a squeeze handle which hurt my wrist after a while and purchased this one thiking it would make sifting much easier.As others have said, the sifting is VERY slow with this sifter. Also, I found that cake mix and powdered suger would get lodged under the blade and would not sift. It actually bent the blade upward, and pushed the mesh screen out.I wouldn't recommend this sifter. I am going to get an old-fashioned crank one this weekend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty but not fun","review":"This sifter looks great but has a strange requirement. You have to shake the sifter back and forth for it to sift the flour instead of the normal (at least as far as I'm used to) trigger action found on most sifters. This works but is a little bit laborious and messy. It comes with plastic lids for both ends of the sifter which seem superfluous. It could do without the lids and with a lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time!","review":"After waiting all these many years, a flour shifter that really works. AND it has the plastic covers, top and bottom, so the flour shifter does not have to be stored in a plastic bag!

The popular grip-trigger models get stuck every other squeeze. This one is a dream. No sticky, complicated parts to break and a very simple, easy to use shake-side-to-side design. I also love the comfortable handle and the clever caps for top and bottom to keep the flour from shaking all over the cupboard during storage. Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!!","review":"I used my new sifter yesterday for the first time. What a disappointment! It was extremely slow to sift 1 2/3 cup of flour, taking about 4 minutes. The side to side, shaking motion was tiring, so much so that I had to move the sifter to the other hand. I was surprised at that as I think I have strong hands and wrists, typing a lot and being a keyboard musician.I quickly ran downstairs to the trash and retrieved my old, reliable and fast crank-style sifter. I'll try the new one again but suspect it will end up in a garage sale!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"I think you are supposed to hold the container and wobble the handle to sift.

I would avoid this item and pick a different sifter."},{"rating":"1","title":"lid doesn't fit, sifter is awkward to use","review":"We were really disappointed in this product. In the past, this brand has put forth some great products, but this one really falls short. We have ended up having to use heavy household tape to keep the top lid on, which still doesn't keep it airtight and the contents fresh. The sifting is \\"awkward\\" according to my husband. Again, I would not repurchase but I will still keep trying other items by this brand, because in the past I have been impressed with the brand. oxo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame design","review":"Bought this one, sight unseen. Too bad. I'm generally pleased with other products by this manufacturer. Stick with the design your grandma had, the one with the squeeze trigger grip.

With this one, I can easily clean any particles that don't go through the sieve, as there is only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails over time","review":"I have had this sifter for a few years now...used infrequently. Now, it needs to be replaced. It worked great, at first, but over time, the mesh gets distorted and the surfaces no longer touch and hence the flour does not get pushed through. I've resorted to using a knife or other utensil to help, but it is virtually impossible. Good in theory, not in practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sifting, as easy as pie!","review":"I found this product on sale in a specialty shop and grabbed it up at 1/2 price. I have used the OXO products for 3 years and have been very pleased with all items (with the exception of one soap scrubber). I like the way I can put the flour in this sifter with the lower lid in place, add baking soda, baking flour and salt without everything coming out before I've finished my measures, then once completed, place the upper lid, removing lower lid and sift as easy as pie. This is the best sifter I have ever used.

I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in Jewish or Polish history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A distortion of history","review":"People need to be made aware of history. 'Shtetle' is Marzynski's attempt to make us aware of his version of history - obviously a version in which the Polish inhabitants of Bransk are the 'bad guys' and Jewish inhabitants are the 'good guys'.

I had a hard time connecting with a few of the main characters in the book. The author seemed to try to strike a balance between giving us a rich environment and well developed characters, but it just did not work for me. I did like the strong female characters.

I thought Zubin Mehta did a great job with this, but, take my word, Beethoven was never this much fun. This album is for die-hard Blackmore fans. Most of the album is pretty insipid, so don't expect classic Deep Purple or Rainbow Rising. Get it to hear Beethoven's 9th.One of the best heavy metal instrumentals ever. Too bad it's on such a dog of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic sound","review":"Although I will always prefer Rainbow's 70's albums featuring Ronnie James Dio on vocals, Rainbow's 80's work with Joe Lynn Turner provides that unique classic early 80's rock sound that has never duplicated since. Turner's vocals are excellent and Blackmore proves one can make sucessful a transition from hard rock to commercial rock. I was only about 1o when this album came out, but style and sound feels even better once you rediscover it and many years. And for those too young to know the sound, try it out, there is nothing else like it.

Rainbow really peaked with \\"Long Live Rock and Roll\\", but with this release, Blackmore abandoned all rock and roll and went for the pop jugular. It was like listening to Survivor. The lyrics were uninspired and the songs were paint-by-number. Especially annoying were the keyboard playing by Don Airey (God I miss Tony Carey). I was wondering why \\"Spotlight Kid\\" sounded so familiar, then I realized it was \\"Kill the King\\" warmed over. I literally threw this cd out of my car window during the second listening of \\"Magic\\". Ughh. The trouble with Rainbow is that Blackmore changed the line-up constantly so that the band never really aged together, like Zepplin or U2.

It just shoved in our face how he could spend 3 months on the MOO and then pretend he could know what a MOOer was like. And how dare he say most MOOers moved on? He was never a MOOer, so easy for him to say. Most MOOers I know from five years ago still live there. _He_ moved on because he was never there to begin with, only logging on and doing as much as his girlfriend allowed. I guess that's why he had to say over and over that the book was hers. I did really enjoy the way he described the real world as if it were a MOO, though. That was pretty creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"This again?","review":"It's bad enough that a virtual rape that passed by our screens years ago can still cause trees to be killed for profit, but now Dibbell adds to the fun by telling all readers how to committ \\"crimes\\" on-line.

You do have a tiny life: now get a real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"When I first heard about this book, I was very curious to read it. Although I never played MOO before, I did use LP MUDs quite often. So I was really eager to see what is there to write about a virtual community. The idea for this book, is great. But it is so boring. First, the book could be shortened to at least a 1/5 of its size. So many extra words!!! Second, it seems to me that the author was over romanticizing certain things. It seems to me he would be more excited from virtual rape than he would be excited by real rape. (Ofcourse, I'm excaggarating, but this is the general feeling I get from reading this book). Overall, it is an interesting book, but way too boring for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book! Book! OK!","review":"Never in my life have I read such trash.

They suffer from the lack of unpredictablity and are on the verge of sounding juvenile (think Cleopatra). What perhaps is worse is the number of people in the group. 7 is way too many and considering that the guys hardly contribute towards the tracks (except for the occasional \\"yeah\\" and \\"c'mon\\") its a wonder they're still inside the group.

Also, it's one of those CDs which has so many good songs that you keep switching favorites (after you get bored of one.) First, my favorite was S Club Party, but I listened to it too much.

So many of their songs are upbeat, but traditionally, you have some slow ones. The one complaint I have about S Club 7 is that their voics aren't fully matured yet, and also some of their lyrics are a little corny. But otherwise, this CD is something you'll want to listen to a lot. This is a very lively group and their songs are really different than what you'll mostly hear today, like Britney Spears, or all rap. And that gets old. S Club 7 is just what the music world needs!

It easily guides the reader into the subject and invites her/him to participate in this human experience by exposing it as relevant to the natural daily life. By this participation some important concepts are developed and made clear much more than may be attained by rote memorizing without a suitable context. However, the historical development of the phenomenological movement and its main figures are only mentionted in a brief sketchy way at the end of the book.

Instead, it is a long winded, rambling account of the author's (non-investing) life; after page upon page devoted to a topic other than speculating/investing (e.g. sports) he attempts to draw some parallel between the subject in question (e.g. sports) and speculating/investing. All too often, the analogies/parallels are weak to non-existent. For a book supposedly dedicated to speculating, remarkably little of it actually deals with this topic.

And make you see that trading, and life itself are speculation. Once you know this you can also realize that the majority of people in society are followers and are irrational. That to bet with them or use their reasoning is almost always foolish. People in life look for sure things... same with many in the market. Others don't look at risks and jump... just like life and the markets. So your goals is to think like the few who think different and win, by using your head.

Hmmm, what about Victor's individual responsibility for such a decision? It is always quite telling to have the opportunity to judge the future performance of a supposed investment genius, especially when the publication of a self-congratulatory biography coincides in time with a total reversal of his/her investment fortunes. Wonder what Victor will call his sequel--\\"Flunking out of a Speculator\\", perhaps?

My mother called today to say that the clock wasn't working. After inspecting the clock, and finding out that it was made in China, I looked at the other pieces and found out that they too are made-in-China movements."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be a great writer to write this badly","review":"Read this book just to see how a terrible, pretentious little author could one day grow up to be the great John Updike. Astonishingly bad ... and that's working with a pretty cool story. Yes, Rabbit Angstrom is a hateful, inconsiderate little twerp ... but it's a story worth hearing. How the story's told, though, the language, the writing is so awful it cannot be parodied effectively. For example, this book contains what must be the worst English sentence ever written. Updike, describing the conclusion of a sex act, says, \\"His sea of seed buckles and sobs into a still chamber.\\" Oh dear. And yes, the author became a titan. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"Just finished this book ... it's one of the 1001 Books to read before you Die. What a painful experience. There is not a character in the book you can like or feel any empathy for including Rabbit. I'm baffled that this book is considered such a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aged poorly","review":"This is a well written book featuring an unsympathetic main character who is difficult to identify with.

It came outside of the time frame it said it would. I had to purchase another book because I needed it for a book club read. Never order from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Updike is a Hack","review":"Updike? a great American writer? Please. The man couldn't write his way out of a paper bag. He has no diction, his prose is frightful, and he certainly isn't going to convert anyone with Rabbit Run, a pitiful waste of paper, as pretentious as it is creepy. What we have here is another sob story of a man who needs to grow up instead of playing basketball all the time. He's not going to make the N.B.A. So why doesn't he put down the ball? Updike's entire novel centers around this question, trying to make the case that just because Rabbit is no good at basketball doesn't mean he shouldn't play. Please. I suggest Moby Dick, this is pretentious trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is it?","review":"I can't speak to the quality of the item as I have not seen it.the delivery estimate was 3/23 - 4/7.

So I didn't care what happened to him. Couldn't bring myself to finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a favorite book","review":"Yes, Rabbit Run is almost unendingly depressing and gives very little hope for humanity. The main characters range from the disturbed to the despicable; however, all of them are extremely believable. Updike paints a picture of the protagonist, Rabbit Angstrom - a self-centered infidel, a lousy father, who by all means ought to be completely unsympathetic - and yet I can genuinely empathize with him. Ultimately, I think that Rabbit is redeemable. Also, Updike's prose is - as always - spare and beautiful, and though he tends to only write about one topic - WASPs having affairs - he does it well enough to make it almost universal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A differing opinion","review":"Huh? Why is this story of a pathetic man such a classic? It's depressing, predictable and trite. For instance, when Rabit first runs away in his car, I thought O.K. we've got a great American road trip here and we're going to the gulf coast, but instead he returns to Pennsylvania and lives with a whore in an attempt to make a not-too-radical change that he inevitably undoes. Rabit is the classic peaked-as-a-high-school-athlete looser.

Updike's descriptions are masterful. The story and characters are not the most appealing, especially from a female point of view. But oh, the flow of words!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Writing, Hate the Story","review":"Updike's prose is lyrical. His observational skills and ability to distill a moment, a complex idea or emotion are poetic. His story crafting is legend and well deserved. However, I hated this story. Reading it was like listening to a favorite song only to realize the lyrics are describing something repugnant. Maybe I'm burned out on the anti-hero or just tired of being sympathetic towards dirtbags who are too unclever to meet even a modicum of their responsibilities as they reinvent their lives or search for meaning. Whatever the cause, I'll run from spending yet another second with \\"Rabbit.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If you want to read a terribly depressing story that has a plot which goes nowhere, read this book. If not, stay away. This was an easy read but hard to finish book. If it had not been a gift I would not have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabbit Run Amok","review":"Harry Angstrom, a.k.a. Rabbit, is the main character who runs away from his wife and lives with a fat prostitute named Ruth. He has wild mood swings during which he runs back to his wife, then runs to a friend named Eccles, runs back to Ruth, and finally runs away after his daughter's funeral. Harry is someone totally irresponsible of his actions and acts hopelessly immature. If my summary of the book sounds pointless and confusing to you, then you have gotten the idea. Don't read this book if you're not a pious fan of John Updike."},{"rating":"1","title":"wishing for a zero-stars option","review":"I read this book 5 years ago, learned to hate John Updike, and haven't picked up a book of his since. (Looking at the book on amazon and some of the other one-star reviews, maybe I should give his more recent works a shot, but this one has kept me angry for a long time.) Today, I started what seems like it will be a bad book that described \\"plump, round buttocks,\\" and naturally thought again of Updike and how much I had hated his description of women. I'm not quite motivated enough to diss him to go and check out another copy from the library to search for the phrases that I hated the most (white mounds of flesh..), but I was delighted to see that I was not alone in my disdain for this novel and this author (at least at this phase of his writing..), and I am pleased to add another single-star (regrettably not zero-star) review to his depressingly high pile of praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do as I Do","review":"If Updike deliberately intended for this book to portray a person who's life you definitely should NOT imitate, then maybe this book should get 5 stars. But I wish that he had stated that a little more plainly. Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom is, as a character in the book says to him, totally self-centered and spoiled. It made me want to scold this fictional character's parents for doing such a poor job of raising him. The story is almost unrelentingly depressing. He thinks only of himself, and doesn't care who he hurts in his pursuit of his latest whim. It would be nice if he learned something positive by the end of the book, or at least acknowledged some of his shortcomings, but alas, that is not the case. The only redeeming quality in this book is a positive portrayal of a minister -- a man who is good, doing his best, yet human. That's a creature most writers today don't even know exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"how did this guy get considered as a good author?","review":"This guy must have some connections to have made such a name for himself. I defy anybody to read this book and not come away thinking that the writing is EXTREMELY amatuerish. This prose does not flow as one person mentioned (...). i would rate it lower but one star is the lowest amazon goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This is a book about a loser that leaves his pregnant wife and moves in with a prostitute. They go out to dinner with various 'friends' and sit around and insult each other. There is not one likable character in this book. I gave it two stars because John Updike writes so imaginatively, but his characters need help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Uggh!!! Updike can't write worth spit! This is just pure junk. Not only is it dull, but it's about nobodies. A total waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away from \\"Rabbit, Run\\"","review":"Having just finished this book I'm kind of sorry I did. Not completely sorry, as I liked the interactions between people and think Updike has a great eye for what makes people tick. But, about 100 pages into the book I was tired of reading all the net and snare metaphors ridden to exhaustion and decided to skip most of the overwrought description and focus on the interactions between people. The one thing that kept me going was a mild interest in seeing how Rabbit would devolve or evolve, but honestly, unlike most of the other characters, he's the same jackass at the end of the book that he is at the beginning. In the real world people who refuse to learn from experience are oddly fascinating, at first, but in books they stale quickly. Maybe the Rabbit series gets better, I hope so, but, I don't think I'll ever find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Set-up for the Rest of the Rabbit Series","review":"\\"Rabbit, Run\\" is a story about a young man who is trapped within a flawed, though privileged life. He has a wife and child, parents and in-laws, a job and a sports legacy, though none of these elements are truly perfect and fulfilling for him. But when is life perfect and flawless?Rather than accepting life's imperfections and trying to work them out and improve them, he decides to physically and mentally run away from hardships and challenges time and time again, constantly seeking out a more meaningful life he thinks he can find. In reality, he doesn't have a clue where satisfaction and fulfillment lie and ends up dissappointing everyone who once loved him.The book is funny, sad, and amazingly written in Updike's unique prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"This is by far still John Updike's best book. I loved \\"A Month of Sundays\\" and \\"Couples,\\" but you cannot beat the Rabbit Tetralogy (sp?!). It is smart, funny, thoughtful, and entertaining--evoking the feeling of the time it was written in beautiful detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great LRB music collection","review":"This LRB music collection won't let you down.

I tried to get the film for many years and was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Although it is dubbed, it is still a great film. It arrived on time and in great condition and is a wonderful addition to my DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I had just read Eat Pray Love and wanted to read more of the same. I was excited to find Nothing to Declare, but found it quite disappointing. She complains a lot about Mexico, how she hates to be alone, her new boyfriend (who takes care of her and makes her feel like the man in the relationship), and so on. If there was any self discovery in this story I missed it. Skippable. Read Eat Pray Love instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to care about","review":"A better title of this book might be \\"Nothing Interesting to Write About\\". This book was a total disappointment. All the people the author meets and writes about are oafish, selfish and/or unlikeable, including the man she takes as a lover, as well as being thoroughly boring. The one exception is her neighbor Lupe, however her sad and hopeless situation is common refrain in any poor area of any country. Too many children, not enough money. I will say that her descriptions of travel, food and medical care in Mexico have convinced me it is not someplace I ever care to travel to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating reading","review":"Not only does Mary Morris transport you to Central America, but also in the depth of a woman's soul. Fascinating writer. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing to Declare","review":"This book is so fantastic that I have re-read it and also bought a copy for a friend. She was delighted and said she stayed up all night to read it.Mary Morris has written a fascinating insight into living in San Miguel, Mexico (although she also visited other Central American countries). Her characters in San Miguel really come to life. And in the bargain, she also gives a very honest picture of her personal changes. I think her situation is one that many women can relate to. I cannot say enough good things about this book and can see why she has received so many literary awards.In reading some of the other reviews, I think some people have not \\"gotten\\" the point of the book. Certain in terms of those expecting research to the point of giving specific names of animal species, etc., please know that those are topics for another kind of book. The reader of this book gets the big picture, and it is played out in a very personal account."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic dvd","review":"This is a fantastic dvd.

I went through a period where I thought I didn't need classical guitar in my life. For some unknown reason, I sold this DVD back to Amazon. I'm not sure why I did this - I loved Andre Segovia during his final years as a musician. This Dvd recounts his final days and beautifully shows how well the classical guitar sounds in his arms. The best part about this DVD is the effect of reverb on each guitar solo. Segovia plays in a hall (Alhambra I suppose?) and was able to produce the most spetacular sound in each recording. I own a Korg effects box, and I couldn't even reproduce the tone this man produced. If I were to record a good classical guitar CD, the sound from this dvd would be the sound I'd want to capture.There is an interview, as well. Mr. Segovia speaks English very well. He's a smart guy and I wish there were more guitarist like him on Earth. Unfortunately, he is gone, but this DVD lives on. I gave it five stars and I hope you enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting, Sexual Ride","review":"I just finished reading Honduran Summer, Honduran Spring and recommend it to anyone in the 18-40 age group.

Like most books in this series I found it a bit lacking in maps for my - there are about three or four of parts of the system that are not very detailed. Otherwise, the graphics of photo reproduction are excellent. A strength of this and other books in this series is that they are not the usual dry academic corporate histories that some university presses put out but describe the dynamics and operations of a railroad in its historical and contemporary context. As this is a book about the Candian Pacific Railwayjust enough is provided about Canadian Pacific's hotel, airline and ocean liner operations to put this gem of Canada's history into proper perspective. Easily worth 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of genre","review":"This is my favorite skinny puppy album. It's mostly 80's dance, and the music kicks butt.

I purchased this book for a road trip from Baltimore to Miami and was highly disappointed that this book doesn't go all the way. The authors suggest that we buy the \\"companion book\\" about the FL freeways but if we only drive on I-95 why do we have to shell out another 20$+? This is not fair! I think Stan and Sandra should loose that \\"companion\\" and include FL in the next edition.Otherwise this book is fantastic. It is very easy to use, informative, durable and simply fun.

It makes you look forward to your next long-distance drive and eliminates that nagging are-we-there-yet syndrome. Stan and Sandra have done an amazing job conquering the challenge of including a vast amount of information in a friendly manner and with a clear layout for easy use. You just want to read their entertaining guide book with practical and unusual maps before and during the trip, to plan ahead, to stop, rest and enjoy the journey and not just the destination.

My excitement quickly turned to frustration. The DVD is only a collection of up close videos of Mike playing his guitar. There is no tab, no music, no descriptions of any kind to tell you how to play any of these songs. I spent an hour trying to tab out the first few measures of Back in the USSR. At tempo or even in slow motion, this was impossible. Ask yourself if you can simply watch someone play and then play yourself without any instruction on what chords or notes to play. When I complained to GuitarSolutions.com, they suggested several books that I could purchase to supplement the DVD. I wish I had just received the books. I would be playing my favorite Beatles tunes by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesson in frustration is what it is","review":"There is no TAB included!! So, you have to try to figure out the notes and chords by watching them play. This is VERY difficult to do! And in some places, it is impossible to tell what they are playing. I am a beginner and so I am finding this DVD very frustrating because I am spending most of my time trying to figure out the notes and then writing them down. So, unless you are an expert at learning music simply by watching others play, I would not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn Classic Beatles Tunes","review":"I'm 50 and have been playing for 35+ years, I learned some of these songs incorrectly as a young begineer. The looping feature of this DVD allowed me to clean up my act easily. This disk is ideal for the player who has basic chops but can't/doesn't want to read music and wants to learn to play these classic tunes. The selectable camera views and menu selection ease (lead rhythm) is 5 stars, very easy to use. The guitar tones are authentic the only suggestion I could make to this disk is to let us know how you set up your amp to get these killers tones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Sound and Easy to use!!","review":"I've tried to learn to play the guitar through many different approaches -- tabs from the internet, vhs instructional videos and even costly one-on-one instruction. None worked. This new DVD approach though has taught me more than all of the above combined!! The features intrinsic in DVD technology are fully implemented in this Beatles DVD - I'm able to reduce the speed of video in order to follow along with the fingering and the way that the video segments will automatically repeat lets you follow along until you get it just right. The song choice is amazing and ALL parts of the songs are covered -- with special attention to the leads.

This is confusing for preschoolers. Older children won't mind when the very first page opens with \\"I'm Emily Elizabeth, the cat\\" but younger readers are confused. The same page shows a picture of a dog, and the little girl is wearing a cat costume. Honestly, the dog looks more like a cat than Emily Elizabeth does!The pictures are NOT really humorous. They seem hastily assembled, and truly there are dozens of picture books for young children about Halloween which are very worthwhile.

This album is good for hundreds, if not thousands of spins. Each time you listen variables like mood, atmosphere, company, and others will redefine what makes this album so special.If you like bands like Weather Report, or can appreciate the bass work of Jaco Pastorius, this CD will make a fine addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"best kombat yet","review":"This is by far the best of the Mortal Kombat series. I have the game on X-Box and I haven't been able to stop playing it. The X-Box version has awsome graphics. I had to buy a different controller though because the standard X-Box controler buttons seemed stiff and the directional pad sucks. Try the control made by MadCatz. I love the versus mode. You can battle a friend and even wager coins that you've won. I just wish that there were multiple fatalities and stage fatalies. This game take some practice and you have to put the time in to learn your favorite fighters styles, moves, combos, and strengths and weaknesses. Once you've done this game provides hours upon hours of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest X-Box Ever Played and Best Mortal Kombat!","review":"This game is definitely a 5-star, two thumb up game! With new characters and old. Johnny Cage is back. Liu Kang is gone after killed by Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, a new villain to the Mortal Kombat world. There is a lot of blood but HEY.... It is rated M for Mature and it's Mortal Kombat. There a new moves, combos, fatalities, and you can even impale your opponent with certain people that have swords. Get it. It rocks!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game!!","review":"I have always been a big Mortal Combat fan right from the beginning. This new version did not let me down at all. There's so much to do in this new version. You get to train with different characters and learn their moves. Once you do so, you earn Koins that will allow you to open up 'Koffins'. Hidden in the koffins are new characters, backgrounds and some silly stuff. The movement and graphics are amazing. If you're a Mortal Combat fan, you will not be disappointed with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are so many better games!","review":"Now, when I saw the game the first time it looked great. The graphics look extremely smooth and the (excessive) blood effects add a very arcade style feeling to the game.But when I actually played it it was horrible! I feel like there is a 0.1 second lag whenever I push a button. There is absolutely no feeling of actual control over the fighters, like there is in DOA3. The different styles are a nice idea, but in my opinion totaly useless. Why didn't they make a new fighter for each style then?Even in Shenmue II, which is not even mainly about fighting, the fighting feels more controlable.This game is for people who enjoy to see extreme blood effects or need \\"Fatality Moves\\" to finish a fight.Everybody else should stick with DOA3, wait for Soulcaliber2, or maybe even buy ShenmueII. (Although this would be wierd)"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a bust","review":"I have been a fan since Mortal Kombat I. I knew this game didn't have babalities and pit fatalities and friendships before i bought it but thought it wouldn't matter. Well, it did. One finishing move per character gets old. Unlocking more characters takes forever. If you like games like DOA3 that require strings of combos then this game is good. If you wanted a game like the old Mortal Kombats then forget it. The fatalities are weak also. You can't morph into other characters with Shang Tsung either. Whats up with that. I bought the strategy guide also. After playing for several hours i returned it the next day for Ghost Recon. Now talk about a sweet ass game.

I never really liked the other Mortal Kombats, I guess I was a fan of Street Fighter. After throwing this game in my XBox.... wow. Finally a fighting game that I like, that does not get old. I just beat Konquest mode and unlocked Blaze and Mokap. Not that big of a deal, Scorpion is still the best. Some combos took me more than two tries but no biggy. My main problem was with Mavado's fight with Sonya, quite possibly because I [am bad] with Mavado, but that's besides the point. If you have a remote interest in fighting games, what are you reading this for? Go buy Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mortal flaws in the gameplay.","review":"Nice graphics and action packed! Too bad they messed it up with a stupid combo system... In order to unlock all characters, you have to complete 'Konquest' mode - this means you will have to do combo's etc. But some of the 3-style combo attacks are nearly impossible to pull off. I've been playing beat'em ups from day one and I found myself struggling with Raiden's combo for half an hour!! Honestly, I felt like performing a fatality on the disc.The gameplay is also very tedious. If -for once- you opponent DOESN'T block your attacks, you would be stupid not to use your best combo. So you find yourself performing the same tricks over and over again.

I'm thinking of telling The Agony Booth about it.The humor doesn't work, to the extent that I think I want a laugh track after all. Or a drummer doing rim shots. Ba-DUM-bum! Characters are distinguishable by such things as fake national accent and stereotyped mannerisms, hair style and/or color, or shouting all his dialogue. I didn't watch it all.

Unfortunately, there's at least as much ranting from the author about his views of what's wrong with the political left, and as much of his glorifying of the political right, as there is info about blogs. Info about blogs seemed to be only a backdrop from which to share his strong right-wring political views. If you are a strong right-winger, buy the book. Otherwise, if you are a centrist, on the left, or interested primarily in blogs, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intec 3-D Sound System for PS-2 PlayStation","review":"While styled nicely to match the PlayStation PS-2 game unit, the Intec system is a POOR performer. Cheap, plastic \\"dimestore\\" construction of speakers and components are first on the list, while tinny and somewhat LIMITED volume and audio are next. Only 3 controls on the front (volume, bass, and surround on/off) leave VERY little control over the audio.The subwoofer \\"breaks up\\" at anything above half-volume, and has NO real bass effect. The surround sound is more like an enhanced \\"spacial effect\\" rather than true surround. Speaker cords are WAY short of adequate to allow any true surround placement.Treble and high-end audio is uncontrolled and unpleasant (\\"shrill\\")to listen to over a long period of gameplay.This item LOOKS like it costs about $25 to make...Avoid it !!(unless you have no care about GOOD audio for your gaming...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!![.]","review":"THIS ITEM WILL ROCK YOUR HOUSE!

There are a good mix of pieces from the traditional melodic synth string pads we are familiar with to driving rythmic/hypnotic pieces that simply spellbind you! The overall feel is......well.....all I can describe it as, is electronic gothic. It's just so full of atmosphere and dynamics. That Yamaha CS80 synth string sound that Vangelis uses on everything (just about) is there in abundance. This mixed with the choral elements and a fantastic use of gregorian chant, results in one of Vangelis' best albums. I am an avid fan and it took me a little time to get into this album. After a couple of weeks of listening to it ,on and off, I put it on one day and the whole thing just clicked with me. I was entranced!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of round from the factory","review":"Purchased these drums to replace the OEM drums on my Saturn Vue with 92000 miles.

I put my original drums on and the 'ticking' stopped and hasn't returned (going on second day).

Great fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, but skip this edition","review":"This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.Get another edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I'm surprised---if this isn't one of his best, I can imagine what his other works are like! This is really good, though. Its action packed and a bit humorous for a story over 100 years old! Its about a world completely unfamiliar to me; of course its fictional but the whole story is different. Elephant hunting in Africa! Searching for lost diamond mines and Zulu war! Wow!This was really good and you could relate to the main character, Allan Quartermain. His companions in the book are just as admirable, too. This was a great story---I wish people were more aware of this kind of book nowadays. They are truly missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's not go overboard!","review":"I was going to write something similar to what Ryan Lynd did -- this Kindle edition is marred by question marks in place of characters such as ö, , and so on. But let's not get too upset; it's not as though these characters turn up more than a couple dozen times in the whole book. I didn't think it ruined the reading experience, just caused the occasional bump in the road. After reading this I spent $1.99 on the Halcyon Classics Allen Quatermain collection (Kindle edition) to get this and 14 other works -- complete with ö and . Better, and very very cheap, but if you want just King Solomon's Mines and you want it free, this is very acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun quick read","review":"fun story, old English was fun.

It is worth reading, if you enjoy historical advemture as it based in an era when the ox and wagon where used as modes of transport! Some readers may find certain words offensive or racist, but if you keep an open mind their use is justified. Great story!!!

I strongly recommend it.Tom Roe, Author of the Gaelic Letters and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless author","review":"Ryder Haggard stories have a timeless aspect to them. They are page turner adventures. King Solomon's Mines and She are among his best. Their believable characters, well sketched by the author, draw the reader into the action. The book is difficult to set aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"Published in 1885, this is a classic that is worth reading. Alan Quatermain is the main character, a hunter and adventurer. He is approached by two friends to help them find the son of one of them. Alan remembers meeting the son who was on his way to the fabled mines. The three set off and of course things don't always go smoothly for them. There are some great descriptions of Africa and they have some amazing adventures, coming close to death, being involved in a war and so on. It's kind of a boy's book I suppose but I enjoyed the writing and wanted to keep reading to see how it all turned out. Good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Saga","review":"Henry Rider's masterpiece introduces his reader's to big game hunter Allan Quatermain, a reluctant but effective and convincing hero. Quatermain leads a trio of upper class Victorian era Englishmen along with a mysterious native or two across Africa's treacherous deserts and mountains in a search for lost relatives and a fabled treasure. Along the way unimagined hardships and dangers occur as the travelers meet and cope with various natives, both friendly and deadly. Somehwere in the background of this tale, the reader may see Indiana Jones being formed. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I read another book by this author, Children of the Mist, which was fabulous. That book was like an Indiana Jones movie. This book is very different. I could not get into this at all.

I couldn't stomach another chapter after the one titled \\"An Elephant Hunt.\\" I love classics and have read my share of them; this is full of atrocious viciousness and the base human qualities that have driven species to the brink of extinction through pain and suffering. It is NOT an \\"adventure\\" to kill for fun; it is abominable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ORIGINAL Indiana Jones!","review":"It's really too bad that most children who love the adventures of Indiana Jones have probably never read (or even heard of) Allan Quatermain and KING SOLOMON'S MINES. This is where it all started! Haggard's first novel chronicles the adventures of Quatermain (okay, so maybe he's not as cool as Indiana Jones), Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good as they search South Africa for Sir Henry's brother, who has vanished while searching for King Solomon's treasure.The novel is the real treasure. The story, while obviously written many years ago (1885), is still fresh and exciting. It was fun to discover this story as a 38-year old kid! Any age will enjoy it. And what a great adventure story to read to your kids instead of taking them to the latest action/adventure junker playing at your local theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quartermain is a classic character","review":"This is one of the free classics available on Amazon. I greatly enjoyed the Adventure of the African Safari as told thru the eyes of Allan Quartermain. After watching the movie League of Extraordinary Gentlemen I had realized the only character I was not fimilar with was the character of Allan Quartermain so I decided I would read these books and have been happy with the outcome. These are an easy read and just a fun adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid classic","review":"A story of exploration that's intriguing the whole way through. I didn't really notice a distinct climax or beginning/middle/end structure, it just keeps you steadily curious.The formatting for Kindle is pretty well done. I only noticed a handful of characters that were replaced with question marks, and I'm not sure whether the footnote indicators came through right, but otherwise everything was fine and none of it interfered with reading the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Reading","review":"Having heard about Allan Quartermain forever, I finally decided to try one of his adventures. I was not disappointed. The story, told by Quartermain himself, moves along very naturally. It is a great adventure story, with big battles, tough decisions, quick thinking, and life or death struggles. You do, however, have to have a little appreciation for the fact that it was written in the late 1800's, so some of the plot devices are predictable and the outcomes forseen miles away, but it doesn't detract from the fact that the book is a fun, easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"The Rune of Zachary Zimbalist was awesome. I loved the mandiballs. Probably my favorite part was when Zachary's mandiball bit Denny in the rear end and it had its temper tantrum. It was also funny when Zachary pretended to throw the ball at Denny and Denny flinched. I thought it was really creative about the group of animals with Eddy Abby. On the cover of the book it says book one so I cant wait to read book two. I am not really a lover of reading but if I find a book that is good, then I read it! I read this book in two days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book.

Two same questions, two different answers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful for the ASTB!","review":"I bought this book as an introduction to the spacial apperception and aviation information sections of the ASTB. There are so many errors in the book that I started the test more confused than I would have been if I hadn't tried to study. The spacial apperception test wasn't even close to the kinds of study questions in this book and the mechanics section was far less technical than this study guide led me to believe. The officer administrating the test told me afterward that they usually recommend the ARCO guide and now I know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome study guide","review":"This study guide is great for the AFAST, all i used it for was to take the practice test, if you do that you will do fine on the test. The helo knowledge part was not even anything in this book, if your looking for that, dont buy it, not worth it. Also, the knowledge and mechanics parts of the practice test in this book are nothing like the real AFAST! The AFAST is so much easier and so common sense esp on the mechanics part of the AFAST.

The instrument and complex movement practice sections contain numerous grievous errors. The AFAST does not contain high level math test like this book indicates, but instead mechanical concepts. It is amazing that this book was published in this apparently unedited and misinformed state. The book the Army gave me to review 15 minutes prior to testing was way better.

In futuristic dragon, Bolan really goes all out with catchy guitar riffs and vocals that could just make anyone ooze in amazement. This album, however doews have one major flaw... Marc's American girlfriend, Gloria Jones (who is the soprano usually backing marc up) needs to be reminded of her position as a back up singer, not a co-lead. Her overpowering, yet lovely voice, sometimes drowns Marc's out and can make a song that was supposed to be mellow and dramatic a loud, alert song.

The Toshiba was the perfect match. Just minutes after I opened the box, the easy-to-read manual had the DVD experience right in my living room. For the price the Toshiba is the fastest, and most feature-filled DVD player.

The button are on the smaller side, but no smaller than any other remote.Also, for the person who said the skip backwards button doesn't work with Audio CDs, they do work.

Rather like one would admit going to see a Drive-in movie because they loved the poster. The ballyhoo worked in this case. I also figured for 10 bucks, how could I go wrong? After all was said and done, the movies were wonderfully terrible as I expected. What surprised me was the QUALITY of the transfer, albeit from worn material. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE looked especially impressive, even presented in widescreen! There is nothing memorably awful about the film unfortunately and its foray into the \\"artsy fartsy\\" horror genre pales in comparison to the moody and stylish NIGHTMARE CASTLE a film more concerned about its creepy visual style than creating anything remotely plausible. If this sounds enjoyable to you, then this is 10 bucks well spent. Those who fear Madacy discs, don't fret too much here.

It clearly explains Dr Winnicott's theoretical development, and where and how he disagrees with Freud and Klein, as well as illustrates that Winnicott was a human being with many significant personal problems he struggled with. It also portrays very nicely the politics that went on in London among the Kleinians, Freudians, and Anna Freud during the period. It is well annotated, for example it cites the only available source to find a clear write up of what is was like to be in psychoanalysis with Dr. Winnicott (A biography of Harry Guntrip who was in psychoanalysis with Dr. W.)

Fair Rainbows","review":"I've purchased seven prisms through Amazon and six different types. They're all very good deals.The clear prisms create the strongest rainbows. Large facets result in the longest and thickest rainbows as well as the most vivid colors by far. The cut of this prism is to create more but smaller color splashes of moderate color strength. However, the round shape is very convenient because you don't have to concern yourself with facing the prism a certain way to catch more rays.A good way to hang them is to use fishing line, which is quite inexpensive and not very noticeable.This large prism is very good and well-worth the price. However, a better prism is this one:76mm Teardrop Crystal Prisms #873-76- yet I'm not saying everybody should buy it.However, even the best one I bought here, the 873-76, is only 30% leaded crystal.

Its one continuous long string of text from the first page to the last. I had no idea that I was ordering an OCR copy when I placed the order and so receiving it was an absolute disappointment.

Considering that this is already a difficult work in German, let alone in translation, it is impossible to decipher in the provided format.

Wrong. As much as he seems to want to live and let live, he is simply applying Western imperialistic thought in a Eastern setting... so really as much as he wants to escape imperialism, he takes over this imperialistic ruled society--- remember he sucedes a Belgian priest. Aside from this, the whole story is about avoiding conflict at almost any cost--- personally, without this conflict how does one know she is alive? Alas, I found the character of Hugh passionless on the whole and felt sorry for nothing drove him really.... except, and here's the irony, his determination and passion at the end is finally seen when he trecks back on a quest to find that Shrangri-la he left behind. Isn't that the way life is though...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Horizon","review":"My goal was to re-read this classic book and be able to do it again at some future time. I certainly achieved that goal thanks to Amazon's availability."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Fascinating Book","review":"Even after reading the book a second time the, the fact that someone might be able to live to 400 years of age still fascinates me. With the recent newspaper aritcle about a group of Americans who recently found a valley very similar to Shangri-la in the Tibetan mountains, it makes the story very believable. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enduring classic","review":"I first read this book as a teenager in preparation for being in the stage version for a high school play. It enthralled me from the start, and has never let me go. The aspect of the book I like most is the elegant use of language. The descriptions are vivid but not overdone; the book washes over you with serenity, much as Shangri-la does over Conway. The only quibble I have is that the American character, Barnard, talks like a British version of an American, and so is unconvincing to this Idahoan. (Yet how many times have we Americans done the same thing to British sensibilities?) In summary, I have read the book a dozen times over the years, coming back to it like an old friend, and will probably read it a dozen times more."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is paradise?","review":"The Lost Horizon really brings to mind the question of what is your paradise?This is a book about a man who, along with three other companions, ends up in a mysterious civilization in some community lost among the mountains. This new life offers immortality (or close to it), but there is one catch. You may not leave. Some are able to become used to the confines of the little city but others (mainly one of the main character's companions) refuse to accept and make an attemt at an escape.The main character has to decide if he will stay, because for him this new place is paradise, or if he will help the other young man escape.It is an interesting book and, once you get past the first couple of pages, it goes by fast. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A excellent example of a utopian society","review":"I read this book as part of a utopian literature unit in my AP English class. From a political standpoint, this book sparks questions about a utopian society, then answers them with simple, intelligent examples. The emotions that Hilton illustrates are somewhat vague, but he manages to convey a sense of hidden love, peace, and happiness during Conway's stay at Shangri-La. I found myself captivated by the utopian lifestyle, and amazed at the beauty of a seemingly \\"perfect\\" community. I give this book four of five stars, however, because I felt it was just a little shallow and would benefit from more details- still an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a plot","review":"There wasn't much of a plot in this book. Nothing exciting happens, and nothing is deffinate. There isn't much of an ending either.. the only reason i kept reading it was because i liked the size of the book.. heh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"\\"Lost Horizon\\" is definitely not the best book I have ever read. It starts out with four men talking about different things when they come to the conclusion that they all know Hugh Conway, who was kidnapped along with three others. Their plane crashes in the mountains, and they are rescued and taken to a place called Shangri-La. Here they experience a lot of peace because Shangri-La is away from the ongoing war. Many things happen, and Conway along with one of the others decides to leave. This is the way the book ends, except for the Epilouge where Rutherford again talks about Conway and tries to figure out where he is. This book is definitely for those who like weird things. It was not the best book for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A FINE BINDING!","review":"I ordered this thinking I would get a lovely hardcover edition of a favorite novel. What I got was a cheesy production that was not even typeset properly. Unfortunately I don't see another new hardcover edition on Amazon to order instead. I have ordered used a first edition from 1933 in hopes of getting something worth looking at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like School","review":"A member of my book club chose this as our book to read this month. It is a short book, but it took me forever to get through it. It's not hard to read, but it is terribly boring. I finally trudged through it. The last 2 chapters were the best, most interesting for me. It leaves the reader wondering what happens to the characters. It felt like a book I would have to read for school and write a report, or have a discussion about it.The other members of my club seemed to like it o.k., but I couldn't bring myself to stir up any happy feelings for it. It felt like school. I'll leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't understand","review":"No, I don't at all understand how anyone can assign even the first star to this putative literary work. I invested a goodly fifty pages without noting the first scintilla of action or intrigue, although I did suffer through reference after reference to 1920s practices and customs at Oxford--couched in impenetrable Edwardian slang. I had absolutely no idea what was going on, other than that I was bored witless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shangrila Revisited","review":"This is a classic novel from the 1930's. It was very popular at the time and sparked a movie of the same name. It was to a large extent America's introduction to Tibet. Interestingly it presaged our current concerns about global destruction resulting from unbridled greed and lust for power.I enjoyed the 1930's terms and attitudes and at the same time see not much has changed. It's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking charmer","review":"Who wouldn't be charmed by a tale of life in a stress free utopia where life is long and there is time to pursue the better things in life? However, in the lamastary of Shangri-la, issues arise as newcomers must determine whether to trust those who promise such a life and whether giving up what we have in the outside world is a fair tradeoff for the blissfull life at Shangri-la. On one level, \\"Lost Horizon\\" is escapist fantasy. On another level, it is highly thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written!","review":"Excellent example of moderm escapism, without the modern car chase and unneeded inuendo...Read & reread many, many time, this story, like Shangri-La, never gets old."},{"rating":"1","title":"rare, but it happens","review":"This is one of those rare books where a screenwriter improves the details of a book to come up with something better.

Why on earth was this issued?For about $3 more, you can still buy the Edsel UK import which adds all the non-album singles to the CD (many of which are batter than most of the LP tracks), PLUS you get a whole second CD with alternative versions of most of the songs. With the Edsel you get a total of 43 tracks; with Fat Possum you get 13.The Edsel reissue series of the 1972-on T. Rex catalog was an stellar example of how to do reissues correctly. Put just the original album and any non-album singles on one CD, and then put all the alternates on a second disc.

Most have had no speech and just constant footage of planes and weapon systems. This one falls short of the mark. The music is bad, the footage jumps from one thing to another so quickly sometimes that it fails to show the aircraft in detail. That is my biggest complaint for this DVD. They will show a f-16 on a landing approch and just when you can really see the detail they jump to something else. With weapon system shots they jump to a new shot before the explosion has finished. Overall it just does not come up to the standard that the others have been. If you want to get some of these DVD's then I suggest giving this one a miss and grabbing one of the other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video!!","review":"As already said in another review there is no commentary on this so if your looking for info this isn't the DVD for you but if you already know alot about planes then this is a must buy. It has several hours of great footage for all different planes and is sure not to disappoint anyone who likes them."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ENJOYABLE & INTERESTING!","review":"I am not an aircraft buff nor a military buff, but I found this 5-disc set to be a very valuable addition to my collection. Each disc has a brief, minor introductory commentary, but you can use the Skip function on your remote to avoid that if you wish; I appreciate the near-total absence of commentary. The soundtrack provides pleasant background music plus dynamic sounds of the planes in action; the video provides me with an informative insight on aircraft/military behind-the-scenes activities that I have never before observed. I can divide my time between watching & listening to these discs and, simultaneously, newspaper reading or painting, for instance.I am way more enthusiastic about the Sky Wars series than the other three reviews in 2006 and 2009. The prices are now very, very low and you owe it to yourself to enjoy the Sky Wars experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No information conveyed; Pointless","review":"There is no narration to these DVD's and much of the images are actually not of the aircraft labeled on screen.

You will gain nothing but buyer's remorse from the purchase of this DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical Communications for a Purpose","review":"I am so impressed with the book. My engineering students are pragmatists - they don't like arbitrary rules and someone else's idea of elegance. But this book shows them how to achieve objectives with written communications - something they really get. Effortless (almost) to read and provided with a number of checklist tools to remind the writer what he seeks to do and the means to do so, no student has indicated that this book was \\"not relevant\\".

I loved the rivalry between Woermann and Kaempffer. Klaus Woermann and Erich Kaempffer are my favorite characters in this book. I found them fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Keep is a definite KEEPER!!","review":"A great book that I'd recommend to any fan of the horror genre (with a very tiny dash of fantasy thrown in for good measure!!). I loved how Mr. Wilson created a truly original spin on the whole vampire legend and how the mysterious Glen character fit into it (I don't want to spoil \\"Molasar\\" for anyone who hasn't read the book yet, but expect some good twists!). I'm always fascinated by credible and creative retellings of famous legends/myths/mysteries.My ony complaint is Magda - while I have no problem with her as a character, I had a problem with some of her dialogue. Sometimes it bordered on cheesy, the way she would describe her love for Glenn, or the predicament she was in.Otherwise, this is a great book that I can see myself reading again a couple years down the road. I thank the author for keeping me up late at night watching the shadows for an entire week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved every gothic, supernatural, nazi minute of it","review":"I loved the movie and wanted to see how different the book was.

And I have to say \\"The Keep\\" is one of the best books I've ever read of any genre. Read it, and disregard the movie. My friends told me that if I love the book, which I do, then do NOT see the movie so I never have. So even if you're not normally a horror fan, read this. Wilson's a master of description. You feel like you're in that cold, clammy Keep as the shadows and the night close in...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in horror fiction","review":"One of the best books ever written in horrow fiction, definately one of the most original. The story is great, so are the characters and the dark atmosphere.

This evil presence is superbly created by F. Paul Wilson. His best work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Keep was very scary","review":"The Keep is a great book from start to finish. I had seen the movie years ago and the book was so much better. Thank You"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is great, its got it all, action, adventure, exotic locations, and a sense of dread that stays with you. Wilson really makes the Keep seem alive against the backdrop of WWII. I know that this says that this is the first book in the Adversary cycle but I found that this book is just as good as a stand alone novel. Very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KEEP this book!","review":"This is a novel that I read several years ago, and it still vividly remains in my mind. This is a novel for those who love vampire stories, especially Dracula. It's a novel that takes the reader to an occupied Nazi village in Romania. In this village there is a castle with 16,807 nickle crosses embedded in the stone walls of the keep. It's a great read that remains a constant page turner. It's a story with a great plot, that will leave you with a jaw dropped to the floor by the time you reach the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Without the love story, this would have been a really great creep fest. What a strong and gloomy beginning! But it seems to disintegrate about half-way though- like a vampire in sunlight. Color me one of the stinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly, overrated book","review":"The Keep made for a pretty bad movie. However, until reading this book I had no idea that the movie was actually better than the source material. This story starts out very solidly, with a great premise and very nice set-up. About the middle, though, the book completely shifts and becomes a paint-by-numbers adventure story. I strongly suspected that the book was going downhill when the \\"vampire\\" made its first appearance to the old man and his daughter. It just took all the menace away from the proceedings. From this point forward, The Keep is just a silly, silly story with a conclusion so ridiculous and \\"Hollywood\\" that I could never recommend this book to anybody. Ever. It's lunacy that this book has such a high rating on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I read all year....","review":"Buoyed by the praise garnered for this book ... I purchased this book with reasonably high hopes. However, it turns out that the best part of the book was in the imagining. Unfortunately, the story is dull, populated with cardboard characters, and instead of building to a satisfying denouement, the book cranks along on rusty gears, until it slowly and thankfully eases to a halt.From this purchase onward, I have learnt to read...reviews from the \\"Lowest rating first\\" What a pity I can't set that choice as my default."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaw-droppingly overrated","review":"About as scary as He-man fighting Skeletor, but not nearly as cool. Picked it up because it was recommended by an Amazon reviewer that liked it better than \\"The Terror\\" by Dan Simmons. Could not have been more disappointed. \\"The Keep\\"'s premise is interesting. There are Nazis and something like a vampire. Sparks should fly but they absolutely do not. The writing is crap. There is no tension, no dread, no atmosphere. The characters are two-dimensional. The love story makes the Darth Vader-Princess Amidala romance in the recent Star Wars movies look sophisticated. The story itself is laughable; trite, boring and, most damning, not the least bit scary. How can so many people be so wrong? 5 stars? Amazon reviewers, j'accuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"Wow! I got this recommendation from a friend and thought it sounded a bit silly at first, but I was very impressed. I loved this book. Very well-written and I couldn't put it down.

It was such a charming idea and I figured I could use it for decoration until she grew some. When it arrived, I ended up amusing the two of us as I played with and she watched, figuring out what each segment of Charlie does. Now, at almost two months, she reaches for this toy and likes for me to hold it up for her to touch and look at (she's still too young to hold it - it's fairly heavy, but I guess since it's for 9 month old babies....). Charlie even motivates her to creep toward him during tummy time. I love this beautiful toy and am certain she'll like it for years to come. Also, not only does it have the look of a toy to be passed down, it certainly has the durability - my pit bull puppy loves to steal baby toys and this is among his favorites, but he hasn't managed to injure it....yet... ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Tracks!","review":"I've had this vinyl for two decades.

I purchased this for my son as a healthier alternative to plastic dinner utensils, and I have been very impressed. The design is beautiful, and the quality is top of the line. The flatware has a shiney finish and washes well in the dishwasher. The fork prongs are quite pointy, but have actually allowed my little guy to learn how to use a fork properly by stabbing the food- just be sure your child is supervised closely while learning to use the fork.

Neither has a strong point of view, neither adds very much understanding to how a conductor might interpret Mahler. I got through them as a public service not for any enjoyment.

Save your money, don't buy this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many closeup of open mouths","review":"I was disappointed in this film, mainly because of the excessive number and length of the closeups on the conductors' faces. Also, it would have been helpful to know who was conducting which orchestra. One can guess, I suppose, by the language the conductor uses to address the musicians. It was interesting to see each conductor's rehearsal technique and to learn more about their attraction to Mahler's music. But I found the closeups distracting, and it spoiled the film for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only risk is not taking one","review":"This is the story of a daughter of a brilliant mathematician who has also lost his mind. She's fearful of developing the same condition. When her father dies, they discover mathematical proofs that could rock the world as we know it. The question is--did her father write the proofs or did she? This is a fascinating and intelligent drama. I found it difficult to follow due to so much of the story being told in flashbacks. In many ways, due to Hopkins's excellent acting, the flashbacks were far more real than the storyline they were trying to portray in current time. Hopkins was almost too good of choice for the father--he far overshadowed either of the lead's performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was excited to find this film because of the actors---but it is a WASTE!! It's amazing how great actors can be turned into a TERRIBLE movie with bad writing, bad directing and boring filming.

I've seen superior movies with this acting outfit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that good actors and good acting = bad movie","review":"What is this movie about, really? Is it like the Amazon reviewer says, \\"advanced academia, revelations of love, fear, regret, and potential recovery\\"? Maybe, but I don't think so. This film deliberately toys with its audience so we can't get a fix on whether Catherine is crazy or sane, skittish or companionable, a liar or a saint, brilliant or dull. At the end we find out, but we're given a lot of false scents until then. So maybe it works as a kind of academia thriller, but for me the thrill was gone.To me it seems the story is more about the challenges and ethical issues surrounding the care of ill parents. How much should children be expected to sacrifice to provide a \\"dignified\\" life for their parents? But this story falls far short of answering that question, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"good performances - weak story line","review":"The acting is superb - all four characters. The problem is that the story is based on an unbelievable premise and mental illness - even (or especially) when well portrayed - is just not very interesting.

Gwyneth Paltrow gives a shreakingly one note performance, whining and pouting, and maybe smiling once or twice in a role that reeks of self-absorption. Only Jake Gylenhaal salvages his role, and Hope Davis is as annoying as Paltrow. Anthony Hopkins looks like he has gas, and the movie is about as exciting as reading an algebra text. Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A More Beautiful Mind","review":"Truly a must see, especially for any father of a child more brilliant than himself, whether either is insane or not. Touches very sensitively on the mutually developmental parent-child relationship; and the difficulty of loving a parent, watching that parent erode, and knowing, with both sorrow and joy, that the child will surpass the father's loftiest accomplishments. Beautifully nuanced performance by Gwyneth Paltrow (Gyllenhall and Hopkins are good, too, but Paltrow is the show). Taken together with her appearances in \\"Bounce,\\" \\"Emma,\\" \\"Sylvia,\\"and \\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" among many others, this provides strong evidence that she is one of the best actresses ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously???","review":"I really tried to like this movie, with great actors in it, I figured it had to be a winner. I found myself hoping for something more around each corner, only to find disappointment. The continual jumping back and forth in time, drove me nuts. There were no peak moments during this film, to me, it just seemed to drag on, as I prepared myself to be jolted back and forth repeatedly. Sure, I found the actors believable, but I hated how the storyline was carried out. I think there was much more potential for it to be much more entertaining, but the the producer seemed determined to drag us through an unending torment. I found the movie somewhat confusing at times. This movie did nothing for me, other than make me wish I had spent my money on something more entertaining. I simply hate movies that wallow in pity, and despair."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason you've never heard of this movie...","review":"Reading many of the one-two star reviews pretty much sums up my feelings. The character development just isn't there. Anthony Hopkins, my fave actor \\"ever\\" is barely seen and when he is it feels like \\"Instinct\\" all over again. The worst part of the movie is with the \\"tuh-duh\\" moment (such as it is) of the movie in which the writer and director made the absolute least out of the mathematical theory written in the notebook; it just wasn't presented in a way that made it the least bit interesting to the audience. *Spoiler: And the part about the father/daughter handwriting looking the same because they spent a lot of time with each other actually made me LAUGH!Thankfully I only rented this from Netflix, and I suggest you do the same.

I endured it, hoping minute after minute to begin enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might Work as a Play; Not a Movie","review":"I understand that Proof is a Pulitzer-prize winning theatrical play (best drama). Well, the story might work well as a play; but falls flat as a movie. Amazingly bad acting from such a talented cast, limp plot, terrible dialogue, and no interesting visuals to speak of (hence, a bad subject for a film, which is a visual art form).I thought the film might appeal to my interest in intellectual films (okay, my interest in pretentious art films loved by psuedo-intellectuals such as myself). However, even in the pretentious intellectual art film category, it fails miserably. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why I disliked the film so much; it might be that the actors didn't seem to believe in the story - as if they knew they were asking the audience of too much, that this story in any way was believable. Because the actors were not invested in their own characters, I simply could not emotionally connect to any them, hence, the poor film experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, but....","review":"Based on the premise of this movie, I thought that I would enjoy it. But I found myself continuing to watch simply to find out how the movie ended. Although Gwyneth Paltrow received glowing reviews for this performance, and is doing what I'm sure is a wonderful acting job, the character she plays (Catherine) was so irritating to me that I found it difficult to watch. I didn't feel sympathy for her, as I should have, and I couldn't see how Hal could be attracted to her. Perhaps part of this was due to the mechanism of jumping back and forth in time--maybe I couldn't get a complete picture of who Catherine was. I only saw her as self-absorbed, foul-mouthed and ready to spurn any kindness offered her. She appeared to be more of an adolescent--in her behavior and her way of whining when she spoke--than a 27 year old. Also, I wanted more of the intrigue of those who have a passion for math, but that was missing in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly Dull","review":"Even my favorite actor Jake Gyllenhaal could not rescue this drab movie. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Katherine the daughter of a renowned mathemetician (Hopkins)who seens borderline cuckoo or brilliant (you decide). The father has died and the daughter seems to be battling a love hate relationship with her father's memory. A very long 90 minutes until the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joining the broken pieces of a fragmented memory!","review":"I must start by noticing we are in presence of one the warmest and intimate movies made in years. An intimate a very haunting story that deals with the missed contact with the reality of a very young talented Mathematics investigator. Her daughter tries the best she can to join the pieces in this intricate puzzle of formulas and theorems he left. She assumes the difficult task to further his investigations.Behind this very painful script, I should remark the prominent acting of Gwyneth Paltrow , who must play a razor edge role between insanity and reality, to create this diffuse atmosphere that will swaddle our rational, analytical and cold logic.It is not easy to direct two Oscar winners, but John Madden faced the dilemma and with discrete lightning and closed locations made a very poignant chamber work."},{"rating":"1","title":"great names","review":"bought this because of the actors... not really worth buying, and stopped it mid way.. and headed to the garbage !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst.

Though Hopkins, Paltrow and Gyllenhal should make for a good cast this movie suffers from some of the worst dialogue and acting I have seen lately.

I can watch just about anything and have seen some low budget Paltrow movies that I thoroughly enjoyed. But, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

This is the worst film ever of Gwyneth Paltrow. Viewing Proof last nite, I couldn't help wishing someone else had played Catherine other than Paltrow. I thought Paltrow was a bit over the top actually in the role. Paltrow and Gyllenhaal had nothing together in terms of \\"on screen\\" chemistry. As much as I am trying to put my finger on what the problem was with this pitiful film, I have to admit that it was just about everything. The story did not flow at all. The dialogue did not work. Casting was poor. The sister of Paltrow was just ridiculous.

Maybe if you are into math formulas this will interest you. I found it anti-climactic. I kept wondering when something would happen and it never did.

They work for much more than lasagna, and the handle holds up well to dishwashing and occasional resting on the rim of a hot iron skillet. I don't know what we'd do without them -- all of our other spatulas are now residing in the basement. The best thing is how well they flip 3-egg omelettes made in a small skillet or pancakes laden with fresh berries: the angle combined with the size makes for easy flipping every time. And it does lift out lasagna squares well, but we don't use it for that very often. Best of all is how easy it is to clean it (I use an SOS pad when it has sat with food on it and the surface still looks brand new). Have fun, it's worth every penny!

Their products are typically very thoughtfully engineered, however, this one is a failure.

The only thing I found annoying was the starting of the movies on that animated drive-in screen. I could have done without that. The movie prints themselves are in decent shape, or at least par with other copies I have seen of these movies. The only other beef I have is the green tint of the wasp woman.

It surprises, inspires and humbles the reader to know that humanity can exist in the midst of such horrible chaos.I liked the fact that there is not happily ever after, that the characters must fight to produce their own future. But, it is good to know that along their journey, they met many who would help them.Primo Levi is a wonderful writer. He stays true to character, winds the subplots into the main plot without jerky interruptions and allows the characters to be real, not stereotypes."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This book is a great read and VERY pertinent.

Most dual-time watches are bulky at best and ugly at worst. This new Skagen model is sleek and elegant and I can read both dials easily. The double face fills up the back of my rather narrow wrist, but the Skagen line is known for its slender depth, so the profile is still low. And it's practically weightless on my arm. I know I'll enjoy wearing this watch.

Unfortunately, one of the clocks stopped working accurately within 1 month, and the other stopped entirely within 3 months. A watchmaker identified the problem as defective watch movements (not batteries, water or abuse). It is a disgrace that a company charging over $100 for a watch can't put in the same quality mass-produced Japanese movement that one gets in a $10 watch elsewhere (and which costs less than $1 wholesale).

With Hallmark, one expects the overly sentimental, but one also should be able to count on a bit better writing.

One of the most unique parts of this book is the way it takes one case study and uses it to illustrate how each of the different perspectives would approach the same problem. This technique is far more effective than using different case studies to illustrate different techniques. The book also gives very detailed explanations of the perspectives, a little bio of the perspective founder, and also provides information on how to use the perspective in today's world. Another unique factor is that the book provides seperate sections within the chapters to explain the the role of the client and therapist. Of all the books I own this is the most comprehensive book that illustrates how each perspective contributes to each other, how they are similar, and how they are different, while demonstrating how a therapist can use each theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"This text has become an essential counseling theory work.","review":"Corey's text is an essential text for those wishing to enter the counseling/therapy field.

Minnie's \\"casetta\\" up in the mountain has the same Art-Deco bar with more tapestry hanging here and there.Act Three. We are not in a forest but in some place with enormous bones standing from floor to ceiling.

Those of you who don't live in apartments, or who have kitchens less than 20 years old or so probably won't have this problem, however.I got these as a second set of measuring cups, because in some recipes you just don't want to stop in the middle to wash up.

While you can bend them back, it's still an annoyance and makes these unacceptable. The basic idea is great, since there are times when you need measuring cups that will scoop (unlike glass Pyrex measuring cups that are better for ingredients that you pour). However, since these do not really do the job, look elswhere. All Clad and MIU France (made in China, in spite of the name) make similar measuring cups and they receive positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have other Oxo items that I like very much, but these Stainless Steel Measuring Cups are a big disappointment.

Don't waste your money on these pretty but cheap measuring cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from Oxo","review":"I bought these on a whim at Target, and figured I couldn't go wrong with stainless steel and Oxo...I should have done my research 1st. The handles bend fairly easily--like when I was scooping a cup of flour out of its bag--and the colored numbering on one of my cups has smeared and worn off! Very strange, I've only handwashed them so far.

And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand.I hope the complete album makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm afraid, like Wire & Glass, it will only be a rehash of previous works, no matter how good it sounds.

(Oxo is very good about standing behind their products.) However, it is odd that they sent me something with the same innate flaw. I should have been told that ALL nylon spatulas will melt!

The first time I used it, the handle got a little too close to the flame of my stove and the end melted. It was still serviceable, so I was more careful the next time, but apparently the cooking temperature of an omelette in a pan is higher than 250 degrees and the entire leading edge melted to my omelette and my non-stick pan, half-ruining my very expensive All-Clad pan, entirely ruining my omelette and of course the OXO Good Grip Turner.

The characters are the same which is enough to buy the book. The prose seems mechanical. Much more description of the contents of a room or office then the content of the subject matter. Actually boring and reads more like 2 or 3 chapters of a magazine article then a stand alone nove.Mr. Butterworth (probably the real author of this book) needs a lot more editing and help. The best thing about the book is that my copy came in large print version. If the followup which I am reading now is as bad, Mr. Griffin will have to take charge again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Saboteurs","review":"You can tell that this book was not written by W.E.B.

I was quite disappointed in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his standards","review":"This was the weakest of all of the W.E.B. Griffith books that I have read. I think the co-writer of this book was really the primary writer on this one since it really did not feel like Griffith's other novels. The character development was lacking and the \\"heroes\\" of this novel were really by-standers throughout the book. I never really felt involved with them and they were never really involved in coming up with the resolution. The resolution was through the stumblings of the villains and not anything positive by the \\"heroes\\". I felt that the \\"heroes' were not even the main characters of the book. Overall, a very poor imitation of Griffith's past works. PLEASE write the next one yourself!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happens when you don't write it yourself.","review":"Big, big disappointment. Not up to standards. Just ends with about a half dozen subplots unresolved. I assume the son wrote this book--at least that's what I choose to believe.

At a minimum, get him a good editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"As a long time reader of Griffin, I would say this is his poorest by far. I have read and re-read the Corps and Men at War series several times and always feel warmed by the characters each time. I felt let down by this effort. I can only hope that Butterworthless wrote this while Dad was out of town. The characters are barely tollerable much less believable, the plot very loose and the ending should have taken another 200 pages. I really he hope he gets back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever","review":"I have read all of Griffins books and have enjoyed each and every one. This \\"book\\" is a complete joke. The promised story about Sicily is an afterthought at the end of the book. There is no character development and subsequently I didn't really care about what happened to them. Of course because nothing really happens we don't need to care what happens.Griffin should be ashamed of himself for putting out a piece of junk like this with his name on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Griffin","review":"I can see where Griffin attempted to shore up the writting in this book but the plot was weak, not sharp, and drifted. My recommendation to the son is not to quit the day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are the old favorites authors just too old?","review":"I have read every book authored by W.E.B. Griffin. I almost could not believe that he wrote such a poorly constructed novel. Then I saw that now he has a \\"co-author\\". The co-author did not help this book. The story was disconnected, characters weak in their development and lacked any form of tempo. I can only hope that the fault lies with the co-author. The only alternative is that my favorite authors are just getting too old. I saw this in my youth as C.S. Forester, Alastair McClean and Graham Greene lost their touch. Maybe it is I that is just too old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Thomson","review":"I'm a great fan of Griffin, but not a great fan of authors collaborating with others, even their family. It seems too much like wanting the sales without the sweat. In this case the plotting is good, but the flow, rythm and tricks of the trade that Griffin brings are lacking. It's proof once again how good Griffin's work is and how sadly in this book he is missed. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad and weak","review":"Griffin has been one of my favorites for years. This book however is a sad disappointment from such a wonderful writer. Why did he even bother to publish it?Clumsy throughout it leads me to believe Griffin did not really write this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rather keep waiting!","review":"This was nothing but an attempt to cash in on an old series he abandoned twenty years ago. At least a third of the characters were left out (what is happening with Jimmy and Cynthia?) and it was just a short, contrived dissapointment. The rich story lines and character work that I have come to expect from Griffin were nowhere to be found. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the rest of the book??????","review":"I've read ALL of the Griffin novels and normally keep checking with Amazon for new releases. I immediately bought \\"The Saboteurs\\" even before it was released. When I received it in the mail, I immediately thought something was wrong. The package was not as bulky as it usually is with Griffin books. When I opened the package I immediately noticed the book was about half the size of a normal Griffin book. That should have been the first clue. I finished the book, and felt that I was robbed of the other half of the book. The story ended aburptly and that made the book a waste of time........Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saboteurs was a let down","review":"I've read a great deal of Griffin's novels and have enjoyed his writing but I was most disappointed in Saboteurs. He builds great characters only to unceremoniously and quickly kill them off leaving you to wonder why he spent so much effort telling you about the character. The title characters are sacrificed seemingly early in the story. About 20 pages from the end, as a second story develops, one wonders how it can possibly take place in the remaining pages. It doesn't. Instead of the great storytelling one expects, the writer breezes over the storyline to a rather abrupt conclusion. I'm sure there's a sequel in the works, but I won't be buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this one's the worst","review":"All Griffin books are pretty much the same, and I've read them all. This one lacks a cohesive beginning and a decent ending. It's like they cobbled it together out of other stories, parts deemed not good enough for past books. They were right. The resolution of this story, both of the saboteurs and the Sicilians are laughable, and implausible. I'm glad I got this one at the library, because if I paid any money for it I'd want a refund.This is for die hard Griffin fans (like myself) and even then, not for all of them. At least I got some sun at the pool when I read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hard to believe this book is from W.E.B. Griffin","review":"After 20 years, this book clearly shows that the master of military fiction/history has allowed the torch to be passed to his son and clearly posses little if any of his dad's skills. From the basic story, which is o.k. to the descriptive tools (weak at best), the story ends with nothing. It just ends, as though the author had something else to do and didn't have the courage to say good bye to the listener. It's horrible. I really hate to see this book and having waiting for a new book every year or two for many years, I now dread another (which I'll buy as well I'm sure). Any reader, who has followed any of his five series, will be greatly saddened by this book; I'm sorry for the great writer, William Butterworth, we've come to know and love as \\"W. E. B. Griffin\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEB3 + WEB4 = 1/2 Book","review":"This skimpy shallow effort is a classic example of either laziness, greed, ineptitude, or a nasty combination of many. Usually talent skips a generation, and Daddy Butterworth should know better than to have his son pitch in with such an effort, then get egg on both faces and lose much of the value of the elder's franchise.All I can say is that I was disappointed (it ends in mid-plot) and happy that I took this one out at the public library. That is to say, I wouldn't buy it for any price, and probably will be kicking the WEB Griffin habit pretty fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a copyeditor","review":"I agree with the first review: Candidy spends too much time in the bathroom, and the descriptions used to flesh out the story are just tiresome. Butterworth is overly fond of the word \\"signage.\\" This book needed a decent copyeditor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"Does not measure up to earlier Griffin novels. I suspect he had little to do with the writing--only lent his name probablyBoring. Much detail about life in the US in 1943 and most of it wrong (I remember those times). A few exmples: Harry Truman was NOT vice president in 1943, Henry A. Wallace was. Author says a taxi driver put the transmission in \\"park\\". Not a chance--no automatic transmissions then. Elevators were not self service then--they all had human operators. The list of errors is endless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War) by W.E.B. Griffin","review":"This book was not nearly up to Griffin's original standards. His name may be on it but I suspect William E. Butterworth IV, whose name also appears as an author, must have done most of the writing. Character development, plot, and overall qualilty of writing are not what I would expect from a Griffin novel. Characters which have appeared in earlier books in this series appear again, but it is just not the same. Griffin either needs to start writing himself again or get out of the business. His cohorts don't have his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Griffin doesn't write it himself-Forget it!!","review":"This is not second rate, it is third rate at best! Griffin is going downhill at a supersonic speed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Son is not the father.","review":"I have been a fan of W.E.B. Griffin for many years and generally buy the hardcover rather than waiting for the paperback. This time I made a mistake. Griffin is obviously trying to pass the baton and the income from his franchise to his son. However, while Griffin is good at character and story development his son is not. In this book the German sabatours in the U.S., who should be the cream of the German intelligence operation, do stupid things so they conveniently get killed off. There are a number of instances of happenings which beg to be developed which just aren't. Particularly, the hero facilitates the escape of a number of Italians from the clutches of the Germans. This just happens with no associated story development. Needless to say I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a veteran, a pilot, a professor and a former cold war warrior. I have been a great fan of Griffin's books because they were technically accurate -although his knowledge of instrument flying is twenty years out of date--and they remind me of situations I have been in and of people I have known. The Saboteurs is a disappointment. Mr. Griffin's books were interesting in part because the characters were real and that may be because he was writing from personal experience based on people he knew. The characters in this book are flat.A very minor point; in the previous books, Eric Fulmar was not illegitimate. I can only infer from this that Mr. Butterworth needs more supervision. Still, it was a fun read and one can only hope that Mr. Griffin will be a more active participant in writing the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The son is a hack","review":"The old man is getting old and he's trying to set his son up to be a writer. I get it. But what it completely irresponsible is that WEB wouldn't groom his son to take over his legacy. And even more reprehensible is that Butterworth didn't study his father's craft in order to maintain the high writing caliber and crafted storytelling. Butterworth obviously was told to write some chapters, and WEB just stuck them in to make it look seamless. I don't know what's worse: That Griffin didn't aptly teach his son how to be an author, or that Butterworth fells so entitled to his father's readership that he didn't bother to learn. I will never buy anything with Butterworth's name on it, and if that comment by the other reviewer is true - that Butterworth is just a publicist for the Boy Scouts, then he should be ashamed of himself, trying to fill his father's shoes without ever having worked as a writer or even as a journalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sabateurs","review":"Not worth the money. My first impression is that the author merely wanted to crank out another novel, and hope that sales would be based on his previous excellent work. Thank God I did not waste money buying the hardcover edition. \\"Boring\\" is the most charitable thing I can say about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read.","review":"Wow, what a way to kill a series of books. I doubt Griffin even read it, let alone co-authored it. The characters are flat, the storyline is boring. What is the plot? On going characters from earlier books are simply left out or they are only mentioned briefly. Do I even bother reading the next book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needless descriptions","review":"This is the worst book in this series. It is filled with boring needless descriptions. Either one of two things happened:1. W.E.B.'s son wrote it and he doesn't know how to punch it out, or,2. W.E.B. himself felt pressured to get out the book and just filled pages with trivia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going downhill","review":"Though I've enjoyed most of Griffin's earlier work, The Saboteurs is really pretty bad. These newer works of Griffin seem to be published without an editor ever having glanced at the pages. It seems that Griffin thinks as long as he can fill the pages with his alcoholic characters pouring drink after drink, his fans will continue to buy his work. That's it for me, I'll never buy another of his books.W.E.B., Truman wasn't sworn in as VP until January 20, 1945. Who's doing your research?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor First Showing","review":"Just an overall very poor showing for Junior as co-author. Haven't been too impressed since. I've read every single one of Senior's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them for what they are, fictional rendering of loosely based history centered around an overpriveleged gregarious main character, be it spy, marine, aviator or cop. They are fun mind candy and worth the price. This one wasn't. Junior's second wasn't either. I'll keep reading, hoping that Senior is around long enough to teach his son enough to continue the legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I would have given zero stars if that rating were available. I have read over twenty of Mr. Griffin's books. Usually I can't put the book down until I finish it. \\"The Brotherhood of War\\" series and \\"The Corps\\" series are excellent. This entire series has been mediocre at best. This book was absolutely TERRIBLE. Don't buy it or waste your time reading it. I'll try another series from Mr. Griffin, but anymore like this one and he has lost a reader and a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly amateurish","review":"This is a plodding, badly written book, with endless descriptions that serve no other purpose than to fill in the space allocated by the publisher. There is no sense of finality, no plot, and no excitement.

Good collaboration between W.E.B. and his son and look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Saboteurs","review":"This book is a grave disappointment. It appears to me that father and son each took a topic, wrote a few chapters and then randomly assembled them. There is no continuity, no connection and no excitement.I've read everything he's ever written but will now read the Amazon reviews carefully before buying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Letdown!","review":"I've always enjoyed these W.E.B. Griffith books and looked forward to this one, but alas, it wasn't to be. This has different story lines that never seemed to come together. It's like a series of short stories within the same time frame, but by 3/4 of the way through, they still hadn't come together, and I flat gave up on this book. There are too many other books to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major dissapointment","review":"Having read and absolutely enjoying ever other book he has written, I was devastated by the poor overall quality of this book. W.E.B. Griffin DID NOT write this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of all Griffin's books ... by far!","review":"I look forward with bated breath for each new book by WEB. WEB rates high as my favorite, then Clancy and then Cussler and then a gap to the rest. I have read all but a few of the Cop Series, and reveled in each. An old Marine I am still in love with the Corps Series, and even the Soldier Series. All of the series are great!But the Saboteurs not only falls short, it does not even leave the starting gate. Characters - weak at best. Plot - barely interesting. Intrigue - non existing. Ending - it just happens to run out of pages ... you feel nothing ended and there isn't any lead to another follow up book or masterful end to a villain.I hope this is not a reflection of the end for WEB.

The Saboteurs confirms that his recent releases were not accidents, they were in fact terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute drivel!","review":"I cannot begin to express how disappointed I was with the latest offering from WEB and son. I was scratching my head, trying to figure out just what was missing here.In all of Griffin's previous works, his characters all sizzled with energy, the dialogue was appropriately *salty*, and the plot lines were almost ALWAYS a bit interesting. Sadly, none of these elements were present in this volume. Even the major protagonist , Richard Canidy, comes off as a *sad sack*. This COULD have been an exciting book, considering the element of German infiltration and sabotage in the eastern U.S. Even the young coast guardsman with a buttered sandwich didn't really help much! That incident was probably written by Butterworth pere, and not Butterworth, fils.A sad conclusion of the series for me... I gave it only 1 star, 'cause I couldn't give it NO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm only left with the memories...","review":"I have read just about everything W.E.B. Griffin has written, and at least twenty of them I've read twice. Having been a huge fan of the Men at War series and Dick Cannidy especially, I was SO happy when this book was released. Unfortunately, I have to say that I wish I'd been left with the memories of an excellent writer, because the reality of this writing is that it is boring, repetitive, spends far too much time on every single detail with little time spent on the actual plot, and an utter disappointment. We all get older, and sometime talent flags as we do - but this book would have been better had it never been written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Ann die?","review":"The development of so many new characters (who mostly die by the way), starting several new story-line threads, and the abrupt ending without solid conclusion left me feeling like they rushed this one to market. Even so I thought it was an enjoyable romp and hope to see more of the main characters and some plot resolutions.Take your time and keep writing. By the way you should get Ann out of the house using the spunky British gal who digs people out of the rubble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a great fan of Griffin. I've read every one of his books, many of them twice or more. I been concerned that he's getting old and the supply will stop. Apparently, he's addressed this issue by bringing in the kid. Unfortunately, the kid can't write. While emulating the old man's style, the story is boring, incomplete, and tedious. There really is no story. An excellent first chapter is never wrapped properly. We spend the whole book setting up our hero to go into action on Cypress, except it never happens. Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"There seemed to be an inordinate time to set the various scenes--sometimes too detailed.....This is not a typical WEB Griffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"As a avid fan of WEB Griffin its sad to report that this is not his work. Its a collection of pointless prose. The story line is absent, without destimation. There us no romance, honor, tension, clausable actions or solutions. Names of previous charcters are used but they are shadows, not real characters. The best I can say is that the type is big and the pages few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read for Griffin Fans","review":"Excellent book I can see where it kind of dumps you in the middle of things, but if you have read the who series, this is an excellent addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word, boring.","review":"I have read every book written by Griffin and I felt that it was painfully obvious that he did not write this book. I normally read his books very quickly, usually completing in a week or so looking for every opportunity to get in a chapter or two. However, with this book, I could not get myself interested or excited to read it. It dragged so much and there just wasn't any suspense. Some parts were anguishing to read and I *gasp* found myself speed reading through parts so that I could move on to another book. I cannot recommend it. I do however recommend his earlier series of, \\"Brotherhood of War\\", \\"The Corps\\", and \\"Honor Bound\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Saboeurs Sabotaged The Readers","review":"This was a real letdown from W.E.B.

It's literaly half the length of Griffin's other books (about 250 pages vs. a typical 500 pages). It reads as if Griffin was forced to tack on a quick ending in order to meet a publication deadline. What happened? My guess is that this book was largely written by his son who is a new novelist and perhpas a slower writer than dad. He could not finish the book on time, so the publisher made him quickly come up with an ending for the half finished book so that it could go to press on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he serious?","review":"Did Griffin really put his name on this???

I had read all of the Griffin war series and enjoyed them but this book had no real plot, virtually no action, and no real end to the story.

E. B. Griffin really stood out. The first books I read were the Men At War Series, and I really found myself wanting more. The Saboteurs is an excellent return to those characters.It picks up at the completion of the previous series mission to bring out a nuclear scientist and sets the stage for a new series. Canidy prepares for an operation in Sicily and Fulmar chases a group of German saboteurs in the states. Much of the story revolves around the characters Fulmar is chasing, and the underworld figures Canidy is dealing with, The plot moves well, and leaves the reader wanting more. Its definately a \\"You gotta sit down and read this one\\" novel.This is a great read for a guy when he goes to the beach and wants to distance himself from his wife/significant other's copy of Under the Tuscan Sun. A really good read, highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time to go to the bathroom again","review":"A very disappointing book. After reading so many good books by Griffin in this series, this is a sorry excuse. There is no consistant plot line and after setting up the adventure in Sicily for the entie book it takes less than 10 pages to occur. There is never any account on how the hero gets his man. I cannot believe that the state of ones bladder could so dominate the thinking of one individual. He should try Vesicare."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"W E. B.

I really do like many of Bradley's Darkover books, especially the Renunciate books. However, The Spell Sword, one of her earlier works, has little depth to its characters and is not as well written as her later books. As another reviewer said, The Forbidden Tower, which I really like, has these same characters. The Forbidden Tower was published 3 years later and Bradley had improved her character and plot development skills most satisfactorily by then. The Spell Sword left me feeling unsatisfied and frustrated with the weak characters presented in the book. What little informationthe Spell Sword has can be found in later, much more well-written books.Its most interesting to read the Darkover books in chronological order (as listed at various websites), but you can skip this book and go directly to The Forbidden Tower and you would not have missed anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put it Down","review":"The story line is so exciting, and the characters so lovable.

The characters were never developed. The story itself was extremely disjointed. It seemed that that the authors had creative ideas and tried to bring them together but cared nothing about the fact that it became absurd. One final observation was about the excessive sex involved. At first you could see the connection and it did help in understanding the characters. Later it became obviously overdone and borderline comical. I have never disliked a book more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and One Dimensional","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I've read in a while. I kept reading, hoping it would redeem itself, but instead it only got worse. The misogynistic Wolf, the main character, never grows past his obsession with women's genitalia. The women have no depth and remain objectified. The plot, if one can call it that, becomes horribly improbable and stereotypical at the same time - star gates which magically transport, good aliens who can telepathically speak to us, bad aliens trying to wipe out humanity, etc. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud.","review":"This book was too grandiose for its own good.

I have read and greatly enjoyed these authors' previous work (Alpha Centauri). White Light is the worst SF story I have read in a long time. The \\"space exploration\\" part is lame and seems quite unsophisticated or convincing, and the same goes for the \\"cosmology\\" part. As previous reviewers have noted, the characters were not likeable nor even very interesting. Regarding the sex, that was about the only part I sort of liked, but I wasn't looking for an erotic novel. If someone gives you this book and you have nothing else to do, maybe it is worth reading. Otherwise, forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the cover fool you.","review":"This story is bascially the worst of every soap opera plot combined with 2001.

The only story that was the slightest bit interesting was 'The Treasure Hunt' by Mary Balogh. It is about a young woman, Lady Constance Manning, who realizes too late that she has engaged herself to the younger brother when she is actually in love with the older one. Even that story was somewhat unsatisfying as, in the end, we are left wondering if the younger brother sacrifices his own love so that Connie may be happy or if he is also happy to break the engagement. However, the story itself is very sensitive and touching in the usual Balogh style. I hope she writes a sequel for the younger brother, Sidney. But the other stories are so boring that it is a chore to turn the pages. My recommendation: wait until all short stories by Mary Balogh get published in one volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Disk","review":"Although the software works to clean up the hard disk.

Thats another reason for you to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Jonas and his family live in an ideal world. A world without violence, crime, or poverty. Unfortuately, their society is also arranged so that people live without choices. There is very little emotion. Respect for life means something completely different in their community. The memories of life for the entire community are stored in one person's mind, the Giver. When the children are twelve, they are assigned their occupations, which will not change for the rest of their lives. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of memories. He begins a journey, from which he will never recover. This is a very intersting and thought provoking book. There are some very disturbing ideas addressed in this book. It is a wonderful story to read, regardless of one's age. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to live in a \\"perfect\\" society, you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver by Chris Rees","review":"A perfect world, wow! My book is called the Giver it is by Louis Loury. The Publisher is Bantam DoubleDay Dell Publishing Group Inc. It was published in 1994. It is a must read! Jonas lives in a perfect world. He is 12 and an easy going person. In this world there is no color no joy and most of all no love. He has to bring these things upon them so he leaves the community. If you like fantasy, I am sure you will like The Giver. In the end he leaves for elsewhere. 10 to Adult would enjoy this book. Mostly a boy but it varies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facile Fable about Utopian Dream Turned Nightmare","review":"Lowry does a good job of writing a fast-paced dystopia novel where society, making a sort of deal with the devil, trades in their humanity--their choices, their capacity to error, their inclination for diversity and adventure--for a safe cozy womb-like existence where a false perfection kills the human spirit. Jonas, the main character, is a twelve-year-old boy who, like Jim Carey in the Truman Show, must re-evaluate what freedom is and act on his courage to change his destiny. A society that seeks to remain ignorant in the name of a utopia is a great theme that is explored effectively in this novel. For some companion pieces, I recommend H.G. Wells' short story In the Country of the Blind and two films: the aforementioned Truman Show and Pleasantville."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"The fact that I had to read it for class did not help me appreciate this book. I did not like the main character, Jonas, or any of the other characters. I was utterly bored, even with the few interesting pages this book provided. I did appreciate the messages that (my class and) I got out of this book (such as how differences are important). The ending, though some may enjoy being able to make up their own, annoyed me. I had many unanswered questions by the end of the book. It bothered me that Jonas, knowing the cruelty of his lifestyle and that there was a better place, would leave his impressionable sister there. Jonas is willing to save the baby, but not his own sister? Having read The Outsiders the year before (which I had enjoyed immensely) I had high hopes for this book. Reading this book made me return to my previous opinion that the teachers who choose which books the class is to read enjoy torturing their students."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Not Too Bad of A Life","review":"I gave this star four stars, the book was good but it had something that I didn't like. Author tells us in the book that the life were living in right now is really great. At least we dont have lots of rules to listen too. This book has lots of surprising parts. The bad part in the book is that at first you wont kinda understand, but thats me. Jonas is a great charceter he play a good part in this story. In the beginnig for everyone, they cant see no colors,they cant use the word love, and they cant even pick their own jobs for crying out shake.

I am in the 7th grade, and this book is great. I couldn't put it down! I thought it was interesting learning about how different Jonas' community was from our world.

But as he recieves memories he sees a new society, of how things used to be. A place where color, music, pain, and war exists. He also notices the flaws ot the society that he lives in today. WHat will he do about it?I found this book to be both moving and inspiring. Like other books I have read it forces you to think of what the future could be like. A more likely version than alien's taking over and having a Star wars-esque way of living. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has an open mind to orginal fiction.

As a caveat to my review, it is important to mention that she is 3 yrs behind grade level and relatively immature for her age. It took reading half way through to get the \\"utopian\\" idea. Prior to that language could be tough to follow without knowing the theme. I would have enjoyed more time with the giver and the development of that relationship along with a more purposeful recognition of Jonas' realization of his community and parents. I realize this was written from Jonas' perspective, but she made me care about how the \\"community\\" would manage the memories and I felt I was left wondering. I did enjoy the story but felt there was more to say. I am not sure what she will make of the story as a whole.

It is about a boy named Jonas, living in a Utopian world. This book is a good book because it is a different and weird community.

When Jonas turns 12, he receives the job called the Receiver of Memory. After he gets it h wants to change the community.

I would recomend this book to everyone in the world because in this book a lot of people can learn a lot of things that happen in life all the time. If I was stranded in the middle of nowhere I will bring this book to keep me company in my life because I can learn to do what the main character does in the forest where he doesn't know where to turn in the forest.

I really enjoyed this book because I like reading fantasy books and you could tell that this one was. I makes me wonder if the future could\\\\will really be like this. The things that I didn't really like about it was that, It was alittle confusing at first but most books are. I also wish that there had been a more happy ending, and alittle more details on what happened next.

It really caught my interest and I liked that Jonas was different from every one else in the story. It makes the story more interesting when jonas discovers that he is different from the others, and he gets these amazing memories. The only bad thing about it is that he cannot share these memories with any of his freind or family, just Gabriel. Jonas also is not allowed to discuss any of his training, or take medication to relive the pain from his training,and the painful memories that he recieves from the giver.(Oh I forgot to mention some of the memories are aslo painful) Jonas uses some of his peaceful memories to help Gabriel to sleep at night. I would definately recomend this book to others.And that's all I have to say about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"I thought this book was awesome. I really liked it. My favorite part was when Jonas received the memory of love. I also liked the way the aurthor used forshadowing in this novel. So that every part of the story had a reason for being there. In my own opinion the saddest part in the story was the releasing of the twin and Jonas saw the real meaning of being released. The reason I thought that this book desearved 4 stars was beacause when Jonas fled to elsewhere they didn't tell us what happened when he got there. But if they had the the story would have gone on forever. I beleive that the aurthor of this book has a great talent be cause when I read this book I realized that life is so much more. If we didn't have pain then we wouldn't have strength, and even though love may hurt sometimes it is great to have loved someone at all.

It was a story that took a while to understand, but once you did you didn't want to put it down. The story is about a boy named Jonas living in a perfect society, no crime, no poverty, no nothing. He has no idea of his birth parents or siblings. All he knows is that from now on his life is living there and consuming the starnge job of Reciever. This is a kind of book where you have to be mature. There are a couple of parts that have to take a serious person to sit and read with no laughing. So, I strongly say to read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Everyone Should Read","review":"When I first started reading this book, my boyfriend laughed at me. He told me it was something he had read in 6th grade. But I don't think a 6th grader can fully understand the message in this book. It makes you realize how lucky we are to live on this earth, even with all the bad things that happen. Jonas's world was not perfect, even though he believed that it was at first. How can a world without color, love and emotion be perfect? To me, love is the basis of all life.

Many of Lois Lowry's books reveal the same imagination and revelation, as does \\"The Giver\\". In a way, you can relate to many of the characters and their actions. Also it feels like you're there in the story with its in-depth detail, surrounded by these characters. It is an easy-to-read book and each page makes you want to turn it and read more.

I found parts of this book a little disturbing and it sent me wondering about our world. If you read this book, be ready to ask questions and also give yourself time to figure out some what is happening. let the facts sink in. This book is a little complex, but I still loved it.

Now that i listened to it i changed my mind.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination!","review":"The Giver was an excellent book that would inspire one's imagination into the limitless number of memories and feelings the main characters in the book embark upon. while some of the issues discussed may not be appropriate for all readers I did not personally find any of the concepts offensive. In addition, this was a great coming of age book that I would personnally recomend to all your young-adult readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review The Giver","review":"I picked the story The Giver because it was challenging to me.Itwould talk about how they were controlled in ways that were notfair.

The young reader will be intrigued by the many differences of this book. This book explores love, friendship, and differences, most things that teens experience in their every day life. This book was well written and was liked because of the... and wierd feeling of Jonas' world. This book recieves a 4 out of 5 stars. A very fine and well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending","review":"I dislike the ending of the book.

I did, and I liked it. It is about the distant future when everything is colorless and the same.The main character?s name is Jonas who was selected to be Receiver of Memory. The Receiver of Memory?s job is to receive memories of pain, sadness, and agony so the people don?t have to experience them. But he also receives memories of colors, happiness, and joy so the people will have no feelings and all be the same. I recommend this book to everyone over 10. Even though this book starts out weird, keep reading. It gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMSpringCreekHigh-Book Report Review","review":"I thought that The Giver was definately a good read. Although it wasn't particularly difficult to read, it was thought-provoking. The tale of a new community in \\"sameness\\" is one that I have not yet heard. It was totally original and gave new meaning and depth to my memories and of what I think of as my community and my way of life. In never having thought of the lessons learned in everyday life the way that this book proclaims them to be, I sat in a pure state of thought after completing the selection. The only books that I could think of that could possibly compare to this are Madeleine L'Engle's- A Wrinkle in Time, George Orwell's- 1984, and William Gerald Golding's- Lord of the Flies. All in which people are set apart in some way and begin taking on their own culture and ways of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"8th grade","review":"First, I an an eighth grader at deerpath middle school, in lake forest, Il. Our class read this book as a project. I am in the lowest level of L.A.(our district's name for english) and I am not a great writer or reader, but after I got past the first three chapters, I finished this book in a day. This is amazing for me, I am a relativly slow reader, yet this book is so in depth,I found it impossable to but it down (I finished it 10 minutes ago) I have alwys been interstes in si-fi/futeristic books. The giver isnt si-fi at all, but it shows the terrors of communism and blindness in a easy to understand, and hard to out down package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some interesting stuff...","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and have just recently read Fahrenheit 451, a very similar book. Both are about colorless, utopian societies, and in both the hero chooses to go against this society.

I enjoyed both books thoroughly, and would recommend this book to people of all ages.I would also like to note that the sales rank of this book is 451."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"I liked the book because it made me think.

The book keeps you thinking on whats going to happen next. This book is the best of the best books i have ever read. Their couldn't be a better book then the Giver. The best part about the book is when Jonas starts recieving memories and he finally starts to see color. Jonas is a brave boy. Trying to save the town from sameness. And in the end he had succeeded"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literate, challenging ya fiction","review":"It's not \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave New World\\". The writing does not measure up to even the less well known Huxley or Orwell novels. But, it is not just some dumbed-down version of a dystopian tale, or a gussied up action/adventure fantasy with a message.Rather, it is thoughtful and workmanlike attempt to introduce ya readers to dystopian literature and to literary novels of ideas. (It that regard it seems to be in the same class as Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\".) I don't see how you help a reader grow into more adult fare without having this volume at least available."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"ok i can understand why this book got a newberry metal, it had a good plot and it is worth reading but i found that i didn't really like the characters and i thought that it was alittle too improbable even for a sci-fi book. as i said before you should get this book and it is worth reading at least to give you a new idea of what life might be like in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I had to read this book as part of a Young Adult literature class, and the attend a lecture by Lois Lowery. I can honestly say, that I wasn't that thrilled with the book. I felt like I'd read it before. I hadn't, but I read a book that had similar ideas that was written in 1938 by Ayn Rand entitled Anthem. Anthem takes place in the future, in a world where individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. All decisions are made by committees and individualism doesn't exist. Giver is essentially about a society that has eliminated pain and strife by converting to \\"Sameness,\\" a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"The Giver is a great book with suspicion through out the whole book.

Not only is the book well-crafted and a powerful idea, but it contains many levels of meaning. The Giver is the sort of book that different people will interpret differently, based on their views and experiences - and all of those interpretations are right. This is a book ripe for discussion and rereadings (for rereadings bring new insights and new discoveries, and a further understanding of both the book itself, and the significance of the book).I highly recommend this book to almost anyone (and do so on a regular basis - several of my friends have already adopted this book as one of their favorites)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"I read this book as a freshman in high school, which was last year. Most of the novels I wind up reading in English class wind up being boring or not to my interest, I thought it was going to be the same when my teacher handed it out to my class, but I was wrong this book kept me reading and reading as no book has before. I would have given it a 10 if not for alot of the parts of the book had me confused and I had to go back and read it over again. Overall I really enjoyed it and recommend it to all Freshmen. Thank You-Ryan Cox"},{"rating":"2","title":"An On-the-edge-of-your-seat book! It was excellent!!","review":"The Giver is a very different book, but very well laid out. The book has a lot of mysteries to it because they say things that don't make sense to people like us. Like \\" When I touched he was shocked because we aren't supposed to touch other people in our community.\\", but you find out why later on in the book. **Hint**Hint** Just because it may not make complete sense in the begining, doesn't mean it won't in the end. It does start to make sense later in the book. For school I have to read 30 min. and I was reading 60 and 90 min. a night instead! I couldn't put it down. I love how the chapters,usually, end in suspence. This is a great book that I HIGHLY recommend!!! :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for its age","review":"This book is still one of my favorites. I recently finshed reading Brave New World and I began to make comparisons between the two. I believe that Brave New World had a much better premise and scope of a possible future, even though it was written in 1932, but The Giver is the better book. The Giver is great for the fact that it has so much meaning in just a few pages and just seems more like the kind of utopia I can see in the future. I recommend it for anyone too young to read Brave New World, and to the majority of people who have read BNW."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the really desparate reader","review":"this book was not the greatest, but it did have it's moments. at the end it really surprises you because it has kind of a sudden ending.

Just think if there was no hatered, racism, or pollution. On the other hand they didn't have love, colors, or music! I liked this book except for the end. It was dumb and stupid.

It makes you think about moral and philosophical questions. However I feel that many of the characters' personalities were not explored enough. The ending also left too many loose ends and did not give enough closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for teens and adults alike!","review":"When I was in fourth grade, this book was read to me by my English teacher. I liked it then, but couldn't really get into it. I understood it, but I just couldn't grasp the emotions needed to fully enjoy the book. Now, in the 8th grade, we are reading it for an assignment. I have only 3 words--I LOVE IT!! We were assigned to read 1 chapter each night. I finished the book in less than 2 days. Once you pick it up, it's glued to your hands until you finish it, and then the basic idea is glued to your mind forever. I would recommend this book for anyone over the age of 12 or 13. Anyone under these ages simply would not be able to understand the content of the book fully. All of the emotions that Jonas is feeling, the conflict that is brought about by \\"sameness\\"--you HAVE to be able to understand these concepts to enjoy the book. I strongly recommend this book. And to Lois Lowry--keep up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all ages.","review":"This book was great for a few reasons...Theme - a utopian society will always be relevant and always be thought provoking. Especially when its well written like The Giver is. I find the theme to be incredibly interesting, especially since I have only ever read one other similar novel which was 1984.Size and syle - It was short, very easy to read and follow. The thing I liked about it is that even though its technically a young adult novel, it can be read by all ages.The characters were interesting. The plot was fast paced and engaging.Overall, its a must read for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver written by Louis Lowry is an exellent book.","review":"The Giver written by Lois Lowry is very good. Jonas lives in a society where everyone is the same. A society where you get chosen to do a certain job. Jonas is chosen the greatest of all assignments. The Giver gives Jonas memories that make Jonas go through hard times. This drives Jonas to leave and find out what a real society is like. Lois Lowry's treatment of the story keeps you on your feet. She makes you get involved with the characters with her fantastic and unique way. I think this book is great for kids of grades 5-9. This book is not only good for kids but is an exellent book.I reccomend this book to anyone who loves great books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great and very entertaining read","review":"lois lowry from the first few pages of the book shares with the reader a perfect community which she captures beautifully. i loved reading this awesome book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting book about a new world","review":"I think that Lois Lowrys \\"the Giver\\" should be read by everyone. She describes the new world exactly and you can imagine everything. You get many information about Jonas, the main character of this book, and his life in that community, his problems etc. I dislike the beginning of this book, because it is boring but don't give up. later it becomes more and more exciting and you can't stop reading, until you reach the last page. This book is written in an easy language and because of this it is easy to understand, even for younger people. It was a great experience to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver is a book thst truely makes you think about life.","review":"I liked The Giver a lot.

You should read The Giver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the wonderfully terrifying world of sameness...","review":"This story presents a world that is so wonderful it's terrifying. The book is well-written, short, easy to read and understand, but, in my opinion, that does not make it a kid's book. I think children lack the past-present-future perspective necessary to successfully experience this story. Even adults can get lost in its depth and miss the true meaning of the circumstances and choices made by the characters and the consequences of these choices. In any case, if you enjoy dystopian fiction, you should not miss this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"This book is wonderful! As I turned the pages of this book, I learned new ideas, thought about stuff that I normally wouldn't have and enjoyed the wonderful story! I enjoyed the idea behind the book: living in a perfect world without pain or feelings...except for one person in the whole town. I think, that living in a world without feeling or pain is not very good. When we live we enjoy or not enjoy things because of how we feel about them. In the town in which the story takes place, it's difficult for me to imagine how people there can enjoy life if they have no feelings about anything. I'm glad that Jonas and the Giver knew about feelings, pain, color, and music.I read this book all in one day, the moment I picked it up I couldn't put it down! In some of the other reviews, people said they didn't like how Lois Lowry didn't write the ending. But I think that's a wonder of the book, you can make the ending however you want. I recommend this book to everyone older than ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subjects raised, but the story has logic problems.","review":"The story has a very interesting if not new theme of a dystopic planned society and the ending is deliberately open. Unfortunately, the story has logical problems that prove distracting to a reader thinking about the subjects raised, and therefore make you aware you are reading a constructed narrative.Better constructed stories on similar dystopic themes areThe Forgotten Door (Apple Paperbacks),Between Planets,Citizen of the Galaxy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"I have just read this book (...). This book was interesting and at some parts it left you wanting to read more and more. But at the begining of this book the author seemed to not have any idea of what she was writing. The begining and the end i personaly thought were terrible. Not so much as the end but the last chapter. The parts that kept me reading were good but still the author might have been able to put more thought into what she was writing. The author had many things that did not fit and things that were badly placed because of the words that she had said before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but...","review":"This book was a well written book, I think, but I did not enjoy reading it.

I read it before my daughter, and man was I glad I did. This is an intersting, read, but for kids over 14. I believe the subject of murdering babies is not appropriate, not matter what, for pre-teens. The book is too dark for young kids. There are many parts of the story that are wonderful and thought provoking, but it just goes too far for kids.

The Giver was not full of feelings because Johanas' community had no feelings. Also there was nothing to explain if there were no emotions. Another reason why The Giver was not good literature is because there were no interesting details. Nothing was really explained in The Giver. Also in the interesting parts the author didn't really go into detail. Lastly, The Giver was not good literature is because there was not a surprise ending. The ending of The Giver was horrible. The last words of the whole story were \\"But perhaps it was only an echo.\\" That is why The Giver was not good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giver","review":"A reader from Seaford: The Giver is a book that makes you appreciate the little things that you have in life.

This current weekend of Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday was an excellent time to read this. As the book addresses much about memories, both painful and pleasurable, this is an opportune time to reflect on our beliefs, actions towards others, and what we want for our children.

Everytime a child is born their life is already assigned to them, their job and also their mate. The people are just born into this with no recalection of how the world really works. A guy who used to be called the reciever is now called the Giver. He teaches Jonas about colors and winter and everything before it was all controlled, and he cannot share this with anyone.

But in another aspect it is folklore because the way the people in the communtiy live is all based on the way things used to be so yes The Giver is an apppropriate book for the study of folklore it makes a person think real hard and wonder does this book fit the desciption of folklore and that has to me judged by the reader.

Pills keep you from enjoying sex, your parents are obsessive-compulsively normal, and only one person in the whole city knows what's going on and how things got that way. One very special boy decides to break the chain. So far so good: we're talking Huck Finn in the 22nd century. Unfortunately, our hero's end is so open-ended, it begins to feel like the clones back in squaresville had it right all along. In my world, that makes The Giver a moral tale in support of oppressive conformity hiding in the sheep's clothing of an anti-social fable. Gross. Sometimes being coy is just wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intreging book from the community beyond!!!","review":"The Giver is just one of the many books written by Lois Lowery.

The Giver transmits memorys that the communtity has never recieved. This was a really good book and I would recomend it to anyone who wants to broaden yourthoughts about different life styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giver","review":"The beginning it is really boring.

This book is nothing more than a watered-down kiddie version of 1984. It uses the same central theme--disallusionment of \\"the system\\", rebellion against \\"the system\\", and the ultimate breaking of the disallusioned.The story is slow (and painful, if you've read any other society-gone-to-hell pieces), the characters are bland. Heck, the only reason Jonas and the Giver are any bit interesting is that Lowry seems to have fashioned them off of Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi."},{"rating":"1","title":"my opinion? Blah.","review":"I first read this book in seventh grade, for a book report. I had mixed feelings about certain parts, but ultimately hated it. It was too sci-fi for my tastes.I read it again recently, and I still don\`t really like it. It\`s too confusing, too scifi-ish, too many twists and turns.So, my opinion: unless you absolutely have to read it (like for a school report or something), skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and stupid","review":"Newberry Awards are most useful for telling a reader which books to avoid. This is an example of a 'book' that wins an award for appealing to literary intelligentsia rather than because it's a 'good read'. There's no sense of wonder, no sense of adventure, but everything is very *PC*.Go buy \\"White Fang\\" or \\"The Yearling\\"Read something by Mercedes Lackey, R. A. Heinlein, H. Beam Piper or David Weber. But for goodness sake, please don't buy this book on the same principle of *not* feeding stray cats. It only encourages them to stick around and reproduce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifying for Children","review":"Children are forced to read this book in 7th grade. At one point the book was banned in many schools and I can see why. Do you really want your children to read about babies being murdered by their own parents and tossed down a garbage chute? That's only one example of this warped tale. The book is so dark that I think it can disturb children and possibly adults as well. The points made in the book can be made without the intense darkness and fear pervading the story.I don't think any 7th grader is emotionally mature enough to read The Giver. When I was in middle school we read a short story by Ray Bradbury that made all of the same points (in a SHORT story no less)without the horror. A better writer does not need graphic and disturbing details to bring a child to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"The book Im doing my review on is The Giver and the author is Lois Lawry. Some of the main characters are Jonas,the Giver,Jonas's parents, and Gabriel. The setting of this book is in a private community. Some of the main conflicts are that Jonas gets. To the age where he gets assigned his jobs. Something specail is when they get there jobs. The place they're at is a dystopia. I liked the book at first, but then it got boring. I didn't like that their comunity wanted to be so perfect it was boring. Thats my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"repulsive","review":"When I was told about this book I was told good things but when I read it I was disgusted by the story.

It has a poor mixture of mystery and drama. If you like action books ,this one's not for you. It has a dull plot because it takes place in an descrete area that is diconnected from society that we know and love. Everything is perfect, except for one thing. The freedom of choice we have does not exist in that world. The main character is a young boy by the name Jonas. He is chosen to take on a job that the community depends on.

Jonas is not allowed to talk about his training to anyone so he must bare all of these feelings for himself. He learns the real truth about his community.

Much more that a miscategorization, this book is generally poorly written. With little to no figurative language, how can we expect our children to learn to write while reading just the basics of language. Metaphors and irony make political commentaries good.There are also logical errors in her book. It does not follow that death and leaving the bounds of the community would have the same consequence, yet in The Giver, they do. There are much better books that offer much the same message of The Giver while using better language and better logic like Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Anthem, and 1984. If we are looking to educate on a dystopia, any of those books would provide much more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book i have ever read","review":"this was such a boring book!

As newborns have no visible veins, the infant was injected in the forehead.Now if you think that this is appropriate subject matter for your 7th and 8th grade children, buy it. If you choose not to buy it, please beware that they may still read it in school.As an adult and father of four, I'm left with the impression that an adolescent would be less likely to trust their parents after reading this book.Save you money and buy a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring and non exciting","review":"This boring novel is filled with sci-fi. Only few parts in the book are exciting. Even though strange, it has earned many awards. The author that wrote this book is very talented. It is filled with sadness. The best part in the book is when Jonas (main character) learns what the word released means. Released is when a person is killed that is not reacting good in the community that they live in. In his community there are no automobiles, alcohol, money and many other different things. Instead of driving cars they drive bicycles. There are also no jobs. Instead of money people get things free. Goods are supplied to all households.

This book is based in a utopia where the government is perfect and everyone lives in harmony. A boy named Jonas has become the receiver of memory, his journey is filled with joy and pain.

It's a Utopian story like 1984, but for a younger audience. Both books warn us about utopias and teach that an 'imperfect' society is better than a 'perfect one. Without freedom and choice, life's not worth living.This book also manages to be very original in its ideas. I find the idea of one person carrying memories of the old world amazing. Middle schoolers will like this too, which I guess is prbably why they assign this in middle schools.Basically, it's a good book with neet ideas and exellent morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that made me go hmmmmm..","review":"For me; the Giver was truly a thought provoking experience.

The book makes me appreciate our world, even with it's flaws, like war. In the book there is a perfect community without war, but when they took that out, they also took out color, music, weather, and even love. It also makes me appreciate my right to choose.

It is about a boy named Jonas. He is turning 12. When you reach this age you are assigned a job. When they are calling out names they skip him. That is where the book gets exciting. He later finds out that he is going to be trained by The Giver. The Giver has memories that know one else has. They are filled with pain,love,sadness,fear,hate,lonleness,and color. In Jonas's world everything is grey and plain. I loved this book because the ending is something that you decided. The only reason i was disapointed was because there isnt a 2nd book.

I had to write a report on it with a paragraph of the setting...and I had to say 'a community'. I'm sorry but I don't really understand where everyone is getting the idea that this book is 'perfect' and all. I mean I can KINDA see where your coming from if you were to say that the book makes you think or is intresting.

This is a science fiction book that has a lot of ambition of what a perfect community would be like.

Jonas a t Age 12 gets the privilege of the receiver of Memory. His teacher is an elderly man by the name of The Giver. The Giver is the Receiver of Memory before him. During his training he is given the memories of the past world. He alone knows what is to feel pain, fear, hunger, and many other emotions. When he se's his father do some thing of complete horror to him he decides that he can't stay in the community much longer. So he runs away with the help of The Giver.This book is one book that you could read over and over again. It is even easy enough for a 10 year old to read. But in the end this is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible world, plot lacking","review":"I really admire Lois Lowry's writing style in this novel. She does an excellent job giving the reader a full and detailed picture of Jonas' life in the community, and the restrictions that they placed on the citizens. This is an example of the ultimate controlled environment in which no infraction or unpredictable element is tolerated. This book has a lot of potential, but I think it falls far short in the plot. Much of the story seemed to be collections of situations in the life of Jonas, and only at the end did he actually execute a plan to give the memories back to the people. Even this was not thoroughly explored. I enjoyed reading this book, but I think it could have been a lot longer and more intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Selection","review":"I found The Giver to be a shockingly realistic portrayal of what a conformist future may be like. Everything and everyone is the same, and variation is rare if it exists at all. It is here we find Jonas, a 11 year old boy about to turn 12.When a person comes of age at 12, they are assigned a job to do for the rest of their life. Because of this, I thought that the book may have had communist undertones. More in the sense of a Utopian communism than a communism in reality. Everyone is the same, and has the same things. The world is ideal. There is no pain, suffering, war, or grief.I feel that The Giver flawlessly depicts the struggle of an individual in a society that is unwilling to change. Jonas is forced to deal with how he feels, and the knowledge he is different from everyone else. I found the plainess of the other characters to be an excellent foil for Jonas's differences.The book leads to a stunning conclusion I found to be a perfect ending to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver--A great read!!","review":"The Giver is a great book.

It shows what advantages and disadvantages such a Community Of Sameness has. Initially you wouldn't think that it is very interesting to read because the whole community is explained and the new words for this novel are menaged, but it gets more and more exciting if you read further.

Lowry seems to be trying to show, in an extremely artistic way, that in order for an emotion to truly exist, there must be a balancing antithesis. For there to be love, there must be war. To truly experience beauty, you must also know repulsion. Jonas realizes that his family and friends have never truly felt pain or saddness or anger, and that makes him feel extremely alone. This \\"painfree life\\" is really nothing but a long gray death.'The Giver' is a challenge to you and to me, to the whole world, to never forget the memories. They are our responsibility to bear, and to share.I am 16 years old, an avid reader. I have forgotten more plots than I remember. I pray I will never forget this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter a Strange New World","review":"Imagine a community of perfection. Everyone is completely equal. Everyone has the same opportunity.

I am not so big on reading but this has got to be one of the best things i have ever read. The fact that they book is not only about sharing memories and the importance of that but it lso deals with conformity and all the problems that can occur through onformity. The book describes very well and very creatively what would happen if we descnsitized every body in the world and basically turneds them into drones. The fact that people in this story had their fates chosen by others kind of scared me and made me think, what would we do if this happened to us? I really found this book to be interesting and at times some what confusing but it all became clear again within the next few lines. So in conclusion i will stop babbling and say that this is a great book and i haighly recomend it to anyone who is into strange or unusual things...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver Exceeds Expectations","review":"The Giver is a fascinating book and something which all children/young adults should read.

A wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written.... thought provoking art","review":"Although few pages, it touches down on so many aspects of life that are taken for granted, while creating a world that can be politically & religiously deciphered as well. It is a book that I vaguely remember reading when I was younger, yet now, reading it at the age of 23 I have such a deeper appreciation of the complexity that is this piece.In response to the critics before me, I believe the ending to be exactly what it should be... simple and somewhat open-ended.

Lois Lowry is an amazing author, and her story of The Giver, kept all our attention. The way she wrote of the future is unbelievable. Jonas' world was perfect until he became The Receiver. Then he learned of pain and war. Although many people are not sure what happened to Jonas at the end and have some \\"unanswered questions\\" I believe that Jonas and Gabriel died. When they are on the sled they talk about Elsewhere and they become warm and joyful.

It is well written and full of exciting plots. I really liked how she introduces and showed the true meaning of Release. My favorite part of the story was when Jonas ran out of the community because it was thrilling. How she describe was great. The part I disliked was the ending. It left too many unanswered questions like what exactly happen to him? Or what happen at the community after Jonas left? Another reason I didn't like was that she makes to many mistakes in her book. An example would be like she said that the people in the community didn't know what were animals, yet they knew what was salmon. Other then that the book was great. I really recommend this book to kids about 10 years old and higher because if younger kids read it, they would understand it that well. Hope you will get a copy of The Giver after reading my review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding The Giver","review":"This book makes us wonder if anything is perfect. In this book, Lois Lowry eloquently describes Jonas in the search for truth within a seemingly utopian community. Everything in this amazing book means something.

Lois Lowry's epic about the dystopia within a utopia will leave you shivering, yet wondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"I decided to read this book because several people compared The Hunger Games to this. I can see why people would think that Suzanne Collins had been inspired with the story of The Hunger Games from this but it's not the SAME story as some have said. Both books are Young Adult but are still great stories no matter what a person's age.I do like this book and it's scary to think of a future like what is portrayed here. I hope that our society never turns into something as horrifying as this. Even though it's not a \\"slap ya in the face\\" kind of scary, it is frightening if you really think about how it could be. I hope I never have to live a life of \\"sameness.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible masterpiece!!","review":"I absolutely love this book. It is oneof the most thought-provoking, profoundly disturbing books that I have ever read. The thing that is most frightening about it, however, is that it seems like a plausible way for society to be in a hundred years or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down, the BEST book I had to read in High School/Middle School","review":"This is the best book out there for students. This is a classic.Enter a dystopian world where color does not exist. Marriage has no emotional. Sexual feelings are suppressed and everyone has a job and task to do and does it without question, without rebellion. A society without crime but a society without heart and warmth. A society without orinigality and individualism. A collective hive of drones living in perfect harmony... but are they really living?I can't say more without giving the story away. READ THIS BOOK! This is a must read for EVERY human being. The ending will stick with you for as long as you live, trust me. This very well may be the future that we are headed toward..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great book for young adults. Great story to share with your child. It encompasses a child's imagination and allows that imagination to take a life of its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but strange!","review":"I liked the book but it took a while for it to get going, to get me interested. It was really confusing at first, but when i started to understand it i really enjoyed reading it. Some parts slightly disturbed me, but i guess thats what made the Giver interesting. Over all i thought the book was really good, well written.I would suggest it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good dystopia style book","review":"This book is similar to many of the anti-utopias such as Orwell's 1984, Zamyatin's We, and Huxley's Brave New World. This book is targetted more at younger audiences than the other anti-utopias, but it is still a very interesting book. It is about what life is like when you have escaped from freedom in the name of happiness. Much like We, the people in this community of sameness are proud to have surrendered differences and freedoms, because noone has ever been as consistently happy as them. If you like The Giver you should definetely also read We and probably some other dystopias as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending ruins the book, leaves me angry","review":"Maybe the best book I've ever read in my life...until it reaches the ending. The most dissapointing feeling i ever had in my life as a reader was getting to the point of the book where i was in love with it and realizing that there were 15-20 pages left in which what i felt was the beginning of the book would have to be ended.It was criminal. The most ungodly ending i have ever read ruined a piece of literal art. It almost seemed as if Lowry just got to a point in the book where she just got bored with the book and looked to end it. It was like ending Romeo and Juliet with the families reconciling and the two living happily ever after. Killed the book altogether and I'm furious that i was robbed of a possible legendary novel and a reading experience by an ending that just seemed effortless, giving up on an amazing concept. Sad almost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. A quick read but you can't put it down anyway. It is fairy-tale, Brave New World re-visited, and profound moral proclamation all in one. Lowry wants you to use your imagination at the end. At first I didn't like this. I wanted something more real. In retrospect, however, I've come to see that there is no room for reality and, at the same time, room for much, much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Book","review":"I first read this book when I was in middle school and I absolutely loved it. It was nothing like any other book we had read. It was a book that made you think about society and conformity. I recommend this book to my friends and have book several copies to give to them as gifts. It was one of the few books that stood out from all the books I ever had to read in school, along with Fahrenheit 451. Please give the gift of The Giver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expertly crafted story of a world that may not be too far away","review":"The Giver offered a world some people long for and others will fear. The people in the book believe they live a perfect society. No one wants for basic needs like food and shelter. Everyone has an assigned job, and knows what events they should experience with each stage of their life. Everyone is essentially the same. Only one person knows all of the beauty and sorrows of the world, the Giver. And he is about to give that knowledge away to Jonas, the new receiver. As Jonas gains knowledge and memories from the Giver, he begins to worry about all that the community gives up in order to acheive the sameness they live in. Is the lack of fear about war and poverty worth the loss of color and love?This book will make you think about the changes in our own society, and what they might bring. A great way for kids to learn about different social issues as well. I recommend reading it as a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've Read In a While","review":"This book really gives the reader a perspective of what it is like in a perfect world.

It was gory, violent, and confusing at some parts. And then at the end it left much of the original plot unexplained. But at that, there were a few good parts.

But hey as the reader that's YOUR choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giver","review":"InThe Giver by Louis Lowery the main character in the book is Jonas lives in a perfect world and becomes the new reciever and tries to escape. It is set in a world that tries to have perfect community. In the book the main conflict is that the community tries to be perfect and jonas does'nt like it. It is a dystopia world because it is a disaster,but they are trying to make it a utopia. Even though the book won a Newberry medal I don't think this is a good book because it is boring and makes no sense. I suggest no one reads it."},{"rating":"2","title":"enthraling","review":"The Giver is a very good book. It gives a different way of living and looking at the world.

But when it is time for his job to be chosen Jonas is selected to be his community's(more like an isolated city) Reciever of Memories. Suddenly the horrible truth is revealed to Jonas- the truth of his utopia type world. This is his revelations about the world before this, and his reactions and decisions because of this. It is a book that I read every year, as I have for the past 7, because of its wonderful plot, and captivating ideas. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by A.F. (marlboro)","review":"The Giver is a really wonderful book. In my opinion, it starts out kind of boring, and has a cliff hanger ending (the kind you just love and hate). I think over all though, this book is really well-written and interesting! Lois Lowry did a wonderful job writing it. Jonas's society exists without problems because everyone is arrogant and doesn't know what's going on. This book basically says that even in a perfect and organized world, there still will be problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you relize how great your life is.","review":"The Giver is about a boy that lives in a world that has no crime, no color, no sex, no difference.

The Giver is also a good book because it has descriptive details. Also the book shares and important message that people should be able to make their own choices. For ,example it gives details about the memories. It makes readers think what if I was in Jonas' position. Also, the characters in the book are believable and you could picture them in your mind. The book shares an important message that people should be able to make their own choices. Jonas' community doesn't make their own choices and that is what they author is trying to convey.As you can see The Giver is a good example of good literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, not a good ending","review":"This was such a great book, its very interesting and it kept me reading, then when I got to the end I was very surprised.

This is a very good book and I think it deserved a better ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver is an outstanding book!","review":"The Giver is a great book for ages 8 and up. It's a book about never giving up and doing what you belive. In the society that Jonas lives in everything is the same. No one can see color and they have many rules that they have to live by. It is very interesting the way that these people live compared to the way that we live today. This is the one book that I have read and enjoyed. Once you pick it up you wont be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book that everyone should read!!!!!!","review":"The Giver was a great book by Lois Lowry.

Jonas is honored with this posistion. Jonas starts to recieve the memories from the reciever who is now called \\"The Giver\\".

Maybe some people would like it, but not me. I kept reading it, hoping it would get good, but it just got worse. And the worst part about it was that at the end, I seriously felt like the book had somehow taken something from me. And I don't mean just my time. Now I'm just trying to get it out of my head. It had the potential to be really interesting, but I just don't think it quite got there. Someone said it was rushed at the end. I agree. It felt like the author just kind of gave up. I was hoping that the novel would redeem itself somehow, but no such luck. I would be horrified if my child were required to read this in school. I don't believe in censorship, but it shouldn't be required reading. The reading level may be for younger readers, but certainly not the topics discussed in the book.

It is very boring and really doesn't have a storyline and it seems too fake to think that it is anything close to the real world that we live in.

The book is on slow pace and colorless mode (like its community) until the last few chapters. The ending is stunning, but not in a good way. It is left uncleared of what actually happened to Jonas and Gabriel. In my perception, they died. The ending is sad and disturbing, even for adults like me. Defenitely not a book for children. I regret buying and reading this book. If you ask me, \\"Holes\\" is much worth reading and my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing - not for children!","review":"I bought this based on all the positive reviews and the fact it was a Newberry Medal winner. However, after reading it, I'm not sure I really trust the judgement of the Newberry Medal now. As one of the negative reviews I read mentioned, any book that portrays a society nonchalantly 'releasing' newborn infants to maintain the order of things should not be a 'children's' book. There are other young adult books that depict this type of apocalyptic society just fine without resorting to that level of monstrosity. I did not feel enlightened at all upon finishing the book....just depressed and sorry I wasted my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"'The Giver' Inappropriate for less than 8th grade","review":"When Jonas at age 12 receives the assignment of 'Receiver of memories' he learns more about his society of sameness than he cares to. As a Teacher I found this book troubling that schools would sanction the reading of 'The Giver' for anything less than 8th grade. The book talks about 'releasing' people and if you have the misfortune of reading it, as you can guess, it equates to euthanasia. I read it before my son's 6th grade class completed the book due to a newspaper article I had read 3 years ago.My son has had nightmares ever since. He does not understand why someone would write a book like this.

And this book is different then the other 2 books I remember reading because, it is a whole different type of book.I did not like this book at all.

There were different jobs, such as the caretaker, and the assistant directer of recreation. People receive their job at the annual cemermony. Jonas has been chosen to be the receiver, the most impotant job. In my opinion it's quite great in the middle of the book. The author uses good desciptions.This is one of those science fictions or fantasy books, that I would recommend to readers that are in sixth grade to people that are sixty.

Also, in their community every decision was made for them by an elder, that is very different from our society where you can make your own decisions and be more mature. We rate this book 4 stars because it was exciting, yet sad at the same time. The plot kept you interested throughout the story, and it was different from any other book we have read. The book kept you guessing. That is why we rate The Giver 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver Review","review":"This novel was pretty good, but it was not the best book that I have ever read. I do recommend reading this book although some parts were confusing like the last few pages. The middle of the novel was probably the best part to read and was suspenseful. Jonas' life was full of adventure and interesting situations. Overall, The Giver is a novel that I think that readers who enjoy science fiction and the future will find this book to be something to look forward to. So in conclusion, I would recommend reading this book in your spare time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver Wonderful Book","review":"he lives in a community that has discovered sameness,everything is perfect.Jonas is selected to become the new reicever of memory.he Suffers not from his training but from all the lies and unknowing people about him they conduct a plan to cahnge that.will their plan work?read the book to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Have I Read Such A Book","review":"What would you do if you lived in a world without color, without love, without pride, without choices? It wouldn't be hard if you didn't know it any other way. Jonas's world seems perfect. Everyone has a job, everyone has food, and everyone is the same. But what lays beyond this community? Is there something else? When Jonas is selected to be the Reciever, he learns that ther is a different way. A better way. There could be love, pride, and choice. Jonas holds the community's memories. He has no one to share the burden with but the Giver, the man who transmits the memories to Jonas. But when Jonas finds out of the community's dark secret, he must learn that when you don't know it any other way, you only do what you know. With hate comes loves, with love comes courage, and with courage comes the will to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver by Lois Lowry is a book about life and what we take for granted in it. Lowry shows all the different things that we do in every day life that in the utopian community, in the book, the people can not do. For example, the people get assigned their jobs, they dont have the freedom to chose it themselves.I think The Giver is a great book to learn some of life's lessons from. Though Lowry contradicts her story a couple times it is over all an interesting book. I believe that every one should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lowry Novel Yet","review":"I really enjoyed this book basically because of its diversity. The Giver was like nothing I had ever read before. With a combination of intensity, depth, and a somewhat alien community, this was unique and suspenseful. I had been told by other Giver readers to \\"read slow and take notice of everything\\", but I just couldn't put it down. I was so disappointed when the book came to an end, but I was lifted right back up again, when I discovered that The Giver was part of a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"Well The Giver is a good book at first it is a bit nonunderstandable or you wont understand the crazy thing was ther community.

Jonas can see color, hear music, and knows of the world before it became like it was presently. Jonas is compelled to change it back. The most emotional part was when Jonas was out in a field and all the kids started playing \\"war\\". The thing is, they don't even know what war is.

Lois Lowry writes about a controlled society and a boy finding his way through life in that community. The book raises issues concerning constant control and makes the reader consider everything they take for granted in their daily lives. The book itself ends with the reader still questioning how Jonas' life ends. Personally, I liked The Giver for the questions it raised and how it made me actually think about what life could be like. The only thing I found that it should have more of was adventure or some excitement. It was a very thoughtful book, and not a book to read just for entertainment purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!!

Both are about memories, and feature a young main character. While different in many ways, they both make you think about where society is headed, and how technology can be used for good or evil. The Giver has a sadder ending than An Audience for Einstein. But both are fascinating. I would say that the future in The Giver is darker and more disturbing than the closer future of An Audience for Einstein. At least things somewhat return to normal in An Audience for Einstein, while things remain bad in The Giver at the end. In that regard, An Audience for Einstein has a happier ending, especially for the main character. The Giver is a classic novel, while An Audience for Einstein is newer. Both have won awards. They can be read by anyone from teens to adults and will hold your interest. I am glad I read both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I first read this book in the 7th grade.

In the beginning, it started of by giving some backround to the story and their beliefs of the community. Then as the story goes on it shows how the boy learns that there is more to what he was brought up to know to be true. Towards the end of the book, he becomes rebellious as he starts to realize the truth. The giver's job was to give the memories of life to the receiver who turned out to be Jonas our main character and with those he felt that everyone should have the memories that the giver has fed to him. The only part I did not like to well was the ending. It was sort of a cliff hanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I had to read this book for school, so maybe that tainted my judgement, but I thought it was good none the less.

It was mostly about a perfect town but the did not really live the way people where made to live. Basicly they don't have feelings or know about anything from a normal town."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Book!","review":"The reason that this book is so great is that it can be read on two levels. The first, more obvious level is that it tells a story about what the future could possibly be like. The concept of a colorless, symetrically boring society is very original and provokes thought in the reader. The main plotline tells the story of a young boy's struggle when he begins to realize all the things that once existed in the world, such as color, animals and emotions. The fact that only he knows the real truth creates a deep sense of loneliness in the 12 year old. Moreover, this book can be read on a deeper level. The themes of conformity and morality hold a strong presence in this novel. In short, \\"The Giver\\" is an excellent story that can be enjoyed by all readers over 11 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, one of the best books ever written","review":"Fantasic book about a community in some place and time other than here and now. About the life in a community with no pain or suffering yet with no emotions no love. Lois Lowry is a genius, although much of her book contains ideas from other books (1984, the bible) she is great storyteller. Anyway isn't that what a genius is, someone who takes something old and makes something new. Heart wrenching tale.

Three characteristics of good literatureinclude how it relates to you, full of action, and a surprising ending.The book did not relate to me because the community followed rulesthat completely contradicted my life.

As you can see The Giver is NOT good literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"This book is really good. The thing i liked most about this book was the idea that no one in their own community could see color so no one was made fun of. This book is about a kid that is given the job of being the Giver. He is the kid that will be able to see color and feel true pain. Everyone in this community is to obey all of the rules or if they don't they will be released out of the community. Also there are no twins allowed because they look the same and no one looks like someone else. This is a really good book and you should read it to find out how this books end!!!!

Much Too Short.","review":"Everyone knows the basic premise of this story so I won't go into it. It's a great story, a definite page-turner, but way too short. And that's mostly why it's a 4/5. It felt like a long short story rather than a novel. And what I mean by that is that it needed more meat. More detail. This book could have easily been 400-500 pages long without slowing it down too much. Where are the descriptions of the community in general? Flashbacks to when Father was a child? Stories about Father caring for Asher in the Nurturing Center? Stories of Jonas and Asher working together and Asher causing Jonas to not be able to concentrate? Flashbacks of the Giver back when he was the Receiver? It could have been much, much longer. And I really wish it had been.

The security of the book really makes you appreciate how good we have it, having your feelings and fun.

They get assigned jobs. They can't see color and they get put in a family. They also have to tell their dreams if they had any. It was a hard book to understand sometimes like when people got released. It was also hard to understand how much freedom they don't get. It was suspenceful in many ways. One time when they were at the ceremony waiting for their tasks. And another time when Jonas (a main character) was going to The Giver while wondering what they meant by pain. And finally, the time when they could never get to Elsewhere. One of many lifes lessons that I thought of while reading was to never give up. When Jonas was biking to Elsewhere he knew not to give up and that ti was somewhere. I would strongly suggest this book to anyone over 12 years of age because sometimes it is hard to follow along."},{"rating":"2","title":"They call it The Giver, but what does the book give you?","review":"In the beginning of The Giver the book was boring to me.

This is a story of a boy who experiences incredible situations and makes it through the impossibles. In this book The Giver by Lois Lowry, Jonas was one of the main characters.

Save this book for older children (grade 8 and above) due to content, and because they'll get more out of it. This book appeals equally to adults, and to anyone who enjoys reading about societies that are different from ours (whether futuristic or contemporary). Read it before your children do, and then talk about how this society differs from ours - the pros and the cons, and their reasons for their opinions. My children and I have had some wonderful discussions about what our \\"ideal\\" society would be, what they think their assigned job would be when they turned 12 if they lived in Jonah's world, as well as the reality of being \\"released\\" and its similarities to the Holocaust, and more.

Granted, the prose are not very colorful, but the story moves along at a brisk pace and, at a mere 179 pages, even people who rarely open a book should be able to make it to the end. I read Ms. Lowry's work because my 13-year-old son's 8th-grade, English class was assigned it. I was very pleased to know this excellent book was part of their curriculum. It's a great, yet somewhat downbeat, story to help kids as well as adults think outside their limited purviews. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Middle Schoolers...They won't put it down!","review":"I read this book when I was in 8th grade and it was one of those required readings that didn't feel so \\"required\\". The plot is intricate, interesting and full of surprises as you discover the main character and the odd world he lives in. The ending does leave questions unanswered but that's the beauty of it.

We find out that the novel is sometimes difficult to understand for the reader,because the author often uses abstract words and we didn\`t nothing about the future like this.I find the book fantastic , because you get knowledge how the life could be in the future. You can take part the main persons life.But I think that the end of the book doesn\`t fit the story. So we write a new end about the new life and feelings of Jonas."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite English novel","review":"When you start reading the book you do not understand anything , but then more and more the fictual world is building up in your mind.

That means he will be after his training the leader of the Elders a committee that leads the community . And last but not least there is a rule for everything even for things like the age when children get their bikes .

But then I started feeling like some of it wasn't explained very well. A story like this, which is obviously far-fetched, should have everything explained...but instead, much of it went without ever being clarified. For example, how can a community stop people from seeing color? How could they control the climate without some sort of border? How could they prevent other people from coming in? None of it was given any thought or explanation and it drove me crazy!I also HATED the ending. I got close and even commented to my husband that it was getting really good. And then bam, it was over. I agree with another post that said it seemed like the author got bored with writing the story and just decided to end it.I thought the idea behind the story was excellent and it would have made a really interesting read, but it simply wasn't developed enough.

In his community there are no automobiles, alcohol, money and many other different things. Instead of driving cars they drive bicycles. There are also no jobs.

The receiver of memory holds all of the community's memories.Jonas goes on an adventure with a baby in his family unit(the baby's name is Gabriel).We thought The Giver was a bad book because it had a lot of complicated things that the author could have explained better. We didn't like the plot. It built up too slowly and ended too quickly.The book had too much stuff that didn't sound realistic.

The plot and the themes work together beautifully to keep the reader both intrigued and guessing. You find yourself appreciating your own world and the things we so easily take for granted. The Giver shows us a world without feeling and without emotion, and one cannot help but think about ways in which our own world is also devoid of such basic necessities in life. This book will entertain, but also educate the reader about the ways in which society as a whole can so directly affect each one of us as individuals. I highly recommend this book to any reader above the age of 11."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not live like this!

Also I like it because the book is about a future that is not real. There are no animals in their make-believe world. The people can't make choices. That is why I like the book.The book is about a boy named Jonas. It's about how he was selected to be the new Receiver of Memory. He and the Receiver try to think of a way to change their community. The people in the community lie about things and don't know that it is wrong. Jonas and the Receiver are the only ones who know that they are lieing and they know they're not doing things that are right.Who would enjoy this book are people who like some drama.

The beginning of the book starts off very slow, introducing the characters. Eventually, you realize that everything is the same. There is not a bit of that thing we now call individuality. There are no feelings of any kind, no pain, happiness, or even hunger...Then this one boy had been chosen to be the receiver. This job is filled with pain and suffering. He has to take all the memories from the Giver, memoeries of times when there was love, hate, pain, suffering, and happiness. Jonas, who is the main character, starts trying to use these new feelings that he has acquired through the Giver and wants to apply them to his life of \`Sameness'. It does not work though, because the people have npt experienced what he has felt since becoming the receiver.Overall I give the book a b+.

I didn't get around to reading it until I was long out of middle school, but I'm very glad I did.Technically, I believe this is children's fiction. However, it's very, very deep.The story takes place in a utopian society where everyone has forgotten how to feel (which would be one of the wort things that could possibly happen to a human in my opinion). Each child, once they reach a certain age, will be assigned a job. There are medics, glorified babysitters, and so on. And then we have our main character, the Receiver. The Receiver is a very special person as he has to receive all the old memories of feelings and then pass them on to future generations.There is a lot of depth in a short book.

Her utopian world makes little sense because she fails to explore it in enough depth.

Older teens probably won't appreciate it, but once past the \\"I don't read kids books\\" phase it can be read again for more depth and analysis. For some reason, Giver gets banned a lot, which I can't fathom. The only thing I can think is an issue; there is one particularly distressing scene.

The chapters are concise and well structured. Each chapter carries the plot a single distinct step ahead. Though the chapters are untitled, you can easily summarize each one in a succinct sentence. The language is very clear, the plot is interesting and the book reads very quickly. It's a textbook example on how to write good prose. The reason i'm giving it just 4 stars is that, despite its masterful execution, it doesn't really have that gripping a plot or that mesmerizing characters that linger with you after laying the book down. Still, i warmly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It as a Kid, Even Better Now","review":"I read this as required reading when I was in middle school and it's even better the second time.

Also if you do not follow the rules, you will be released.My favorite part of the story is the very end of the book because he hears music and singing for the first time in a different society.

When I read the book, I became overwhelmed at how society could become so uncaring, how all of the memories from the past could have been eliminated and forgotten. Sometimes, the society in the book didn't seem that far off from our society today, which is a little scary!

His discovery into his assigned job as \\"the giver\\" is one that is troubling and leads him to search outside of his community to find a better life.

I thought it was one of the most insightful and thought-provoking books that I have ever read. What intrigued me the most was the society that Lois Lowry created in this book; a society where everyone and everything is the same. It seems like it would be completely impossible, but is it? Could our government, in the hopes of making life easier for us, slowly turn our society into this one? I don't know the answer, but it's something to think about.I also liked the way she explained the importance of memories. It's true that memories can often be painful, as both the Giver and Jonas experience, but they can also bring joy. In the Elders attempt at making life painless, they also took away that joy. No one in this society really lives, they just go through the motions of life contently, but they aren't really happy. It is memories and the ability to choose that make life worth living."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"The Giver was a great book.

There were many surprises that I didn't expect to happen but it was kind of odd that the community didn't even know what pain or love was.

He was horrified when he found out that they were killed with a poision. He didn't want that to happen to the baby that lived with him till it wouldn't cry during the night. So when Jonas left the community, he took the baby with him. He pedalled for days and days. Sometimes he had to hide from jet-planes that flew overhead looking for him.
