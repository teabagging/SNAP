This book is incredibly well-written, however, I find the story to be very stale and ordinary. I recommend this book as a prelude to the incredible Lord of the Rings saga and the Silmarillion.

Smog seemed to be a big force with a huge wrath but he was killed easily do to the lack of diamonds over the one part of his body that is the most vulnerable, his heart. I think there should have been a big war lasting days, carrying the drama out longer. This book was a bit slow in the middle and beginning but picked up at latter until the disappointing end.

Bilbo, the hobbit, and his company of dwarves are on their way to steal back their long forgotten treasure that is guarded by a hideous dragon. This story tells of the hardships they encounter on their journey and the changes that each character, especially Bilbo, goes through. this book is wonderful because it ties in the world of fantasy with real life. The characters go through the same emotional and sometimes physical struggles that we find ourselves going through. The Hobbit is a great book that everybody can relate to in one way or another.

Although essentially a children's story, it has an appeal to all ages (it is similar to the more recent Harry Potter stories in this respect).

This pivotal series was viewed through the eyes of probably the greatest manager in the game, Tony LaRussa of the Cardinals. This book shows that it is human nature, not necessarily statistics, that dictates the outcome of a ball game. The book gets into the decision making process which goes on in the dugout....when to bunt, when to steal, when to pull the pitcher who is starting to lose his stuff....and they are more than just decisions made by looking at statistics, but the author shows how instinct, logic, and emotion impact the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside baseball","review":"I must be the last Cardinals fan to read this book, but I had master's degree to finish and this wasn't on the reading list. Having waited, I get to read it with a greater degree of hindsight, now that LaRussa has retired and Matheny is manager. I plan to tag-team this book with LaRussa's new book about last season's run for the championship. Even without all those caveats, this is the best inside baseball book I've read. It explains why few managers are as successful or long-tenured as LaRussa--few managers have what it takes in the way of brains, dedication, intensity, and most of all, love of the game for the game's sake. One part of that hindsight is reading about Matheny as a player and seeing the early makings of a manager. For all those who thought the Cardinals were taking too big a gamble on hiring Matheny because of lack of experience, this book will show you that he wasn't the neophyte everyone thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball is still baseball","review":"This book was a great look into the strategy and mental aspects of America's \\"Forgotten\\" Pastime.

Ha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Baseball book","review":"This is a very good sports genre book, but it could have been a little bit better. I was very skeptical when I picked it up, but I was very pleased by the end. it covered Tony La Russa as he prepared and executed his game plan around a series in 2003 against their arch-rivial Chicago Cubs. It covers him handling the Kile situation in 2002, how him & his wife handle his job, and gives his opinion on several of his players. As I read it, I was waiting for the obvious question: How did he get into management and choose it over the legal profession?. It never came.The writer also starts off comparing the rivally of the Cubs and Cards - and how it is more intense than the Yanks and Red Soxs - No Way!It is a great book for the baseball fan, but especially a St. Louis fan.Above average for a sports-genre book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Sabermetric garbage","review":"I love Tony LaRussa, as I'm an A's fan. However, Bissinger has an agenda with this book. He wants it to be the anti Moneyball. He doesn't believe in the philisophy of using statistics to judge performance and make decisions. He has said this, and attacked Michael Lewis' Moneyball without offering any kind of decent rebuttal. He goes on some rant that humans aren't machines and that the human element is important. Yes, every person is different \\"Buzz,\\" and statistics are just a way of quantifying those differences. 4 postseason appearances for the A's and a world series title for the Red Sox bear out the success of sabermetrics. It's here to say, despite the fact that stubborn baseball people hate it because it destroys so much of their outmoded and inefficient ideas and strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redbird Rivalry","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would rate it as one of the top 10 baseball books - but, undoubtedly, behind Men at Work. 3 Nights in August contained much useful information (both coaching ideas and personal). I felt like I was an eye witness to the on goings in the dugout. My only point of contention is that I feel the author was too hard on J D Drew. True, I have not interacted with him since the CWS, but I didn't get the feeling he was the selfish baby he was portrayed to be. I am a die hard Astros fan, but I caught myself cheering for the Redbirds. All in all a good read - I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL movie! Not even Elvira can save this turkey.","review":"I am amazed anyone could say this is a good movie. The plot is completely ridiculous and all over the place. Dracula spends half the movie trying to bring his daughter back to life, then in the space of two seconds he inexplicably changes his mind and dumps her in the canal. The first forty minutes seemed like a good setup, but the rest is just ridiculous. Elvira is usually good for a laugh, but this is one movie even she can't make worth suffering through.The dubbing is indeed as bad as everyone says--a fight scene in which no one even remotely connects fist to flesh is particularly hilarious. The guys swing at the air while one moans for no reason. It's like an Ed Wood film in Spanish. In fact, this Drac bears some resemblance to the Lugosi stand-in in PLAN 9.Not even cheesy fun.

No matter what you do, you will never see the whole screen, and never is it more evident than in the credits where some words are cut. In the movie, some scenes just lack coherence because of this. For example, when Naschy first appears after opening the door of his Sanatorium to his visitors, we CAN'T SEE HIM because the screen is cut!!!Terrible DVD.

Suddenly, this thief has the cops and the Russians looking for him.It sounded like a great idea, but the story was a huge disappointment to me. The characters were not very believable. For example, the woman who has her purse stolen, tracks down the thief and tries to get the film back.

I bought one also for my friend who used its techniques with great results as well. It's about time we women had an idea of what motivates men, & I love having the inside edge. I'm now in a great relationship with an awesome guy and this book was my bible to get there. Not that I couldn't have done it before, but when you need help to counteract your natural tendencies to run after what you want, this book will help you be sexy, sit back, and get your guy to run after you. And actually, as the book says, he's really more happy doing that. I recommend this to any women of any age who just needs to feel great about herself and who also wants to get and keep a GREAT guy. In fact, I think I'll go read my dog-eared copy again today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book!","review":"This is an awesome book.

While I thought being a \\"bitch\\" was something bad, after reading this book I realized Being a bitch is a good thing.

I respect and adore women for everything that makes them women. I've always said a man has two duties in life, to provide for his family and to know how to please his wife in the bedroom. I am a real man and the consummate gentleman. With that being said, if a woman tried to employ the tactics laid out in this book, I would drop her without a second thought. Real men are too smart for these games, and these tactics will either land a woman with an ahole who employs the same tactics or a man who would never stand up for her when it counted. This book is heavy on deceitful tactics and little else. The problem is self-esteem; and this book won't fix that. Not one bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This book speaks nothing other than the truth! It is a very interesting read, and teaches you everything that a woman should know about the dating world and the men in it.

I started reading it on my way home and finished it within 2 days! It is astonishingly honest and straight to the point and made me see my romantic history in a new light.Every woman who has ever had problems with men should buy this book and recommend it to her girlfriends. I am marrried now and my book is lovingly handed over to my best friend- she needs it really bad!!!You could say that you already know men and that nothing you can read or hear will add up to your knowledge--- Just like I used to say, but trust me, this book is going to change your lovelife once and for all!!Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why weren't we told this before?","review":"I thought this book was informative, insightful and yet humourous. In hindsight there's a lot of things that I would have done differently in my relationships if I had had access to this 'inside' information earlier. I think every female should keep one handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Antidote to Men are from Mars...","review":"This book should come with a coupon for Hagen Daas, because you're going to end up on the sofa eating comfort food and wondering what went wrong. I read this book. I laughed in all the right places, but then I made a terrible mistake. I took Sherry Argov's advice seriously. My marriage was good, but this book made me think I was getting shortchanged. So I took the leap and took control. Now I'm in marriage counseling and wondering if I'm going to be able to hang onto my husband. I did get one thing right, though. After eleven years of wonderful marriage, I managed to get my husband to call me a bitch. I'm trying to get him to believe that I'm in a midlife crisis. Because I can't bring myself to say that I destroyed a great relationship because of something that sounded good in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BITCH- Babe In Total Control of Herself","review":"This book really did confirm alot of things that I already knew about guys and also opened up my mind to other things that I didn't know about guys. And this is coming from a girl who hangs out with them more than she does with girls. I really recommend every girl to read it and in some cases guys too. The girls will get an eye opener and the guys will get some laughs, because of how truthful it is!!!!

God Bless and live well!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book For Men to Read As Well","review":"I read this book to learn what women think about men and what they think in general about relationships. As an avid student of the Art of War, I think this is a most read for all men that are willing to prepare themselves fully in how to recognize the tactics that women slavishly follow or how to mimic the kinds of men they are looking for. Yes, this is deception, however it is exactly this kind of strategem that the author of this book, Sherry Argov, is promoting. Men used to work hard at guessing what was behind women's motives. Now the task is easy, as women are writing more and more books and in the process, revealing more and more in the process about themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good advice","review":"I read this book last summer and used it with the man I was dating, and he almost dumped me!There are some good points in here, about not compromising your value, and being confident in yourself.But then the parts about not showing emotion and showing your true self is just bad advice. Showing your emotions sometimes shows authenticity.To be combative, manipulative and treat a relationship like a game of chess is selfish and unloving. I believe these tactics work great on men with low self esteem, but not on confident, successful, quality men.Read at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow book","review":"I bought this book out of curiosity after reading all its favorable reviews, and unfortunately, I find it very disappointing. I think Agrove tried to write a manual for women to train a man. Relationships are much more complex than the book suggests, and I don't believe that men should be trained like pets by using the carrot and stick method. I find this book very shallow, simplistic, and targeted to apply to the masses. Also, I don't like the title of the book. The author could call \\"bitches\\" \\"strong women\\" instead. Both \\"bitch\\" and \\"doormat\\" seem to be derogatory to women, and men are depicted as silly puppies that can be easily manipulated by the \\"stick and carrot\\" method. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Every woman should read this book! It was super helpful and makes so much sense. I wish I had come across it sooner.

Two kids and thirty-one years later, I'm still in love with the same hard ass, tough, determined woman I married long ago. We, however, don't play games with each other.Quit playing games and maybe one day you can say the same thing too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously ladies?!","review":"I'm sorry but this book is garbage. I could only get through the first 3 chapters & it just felt mind-numbing. We need a woman who's a Neil Strauss type to write a book lol. I learned more from The Game, being a woman, than anything from my short read of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys: Read Up On Your Prey and Strengthen Your Game Skills","review":"Guys, this is a great book to read for no other reason than it will help you strengthen your game and read what other women are reading about us. Find out if you are unwittingly giving yourself away with unsaid cues and learn what women are looking for in men, especially what they are wanting men to be looking for in women. Versatility is the name of the game in playing the game, and reading up on your prey and what drives them psychologically will definitely give you an advantage. Learn of their desires, their needs, and how to placate and play to the sense of independence of the \\"strong woman.\\"Sharpen you skills by learning more on how your taget thinks and know how to better present yourself in the manner that such women are looking to find in a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"May work on an average frustrated chump but not high value guys..","review":"If I ever sniff out a chick following a \\"planned strategy\\" or seemingly intentionally being disinterested, she gets tossed. No guy with any type of game should accept any drama. For you girls that rock the boat, thats the easiest way to fall out of it or get kicked out of it.Nice try, but girls need to trust their instincts, not the advice of an author no self respecting guy would even date."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a stereotypical delusional woman....","review":"...could write an entire book about something she is apparently clueless about, and keep a straight face.fwiw, ladies, i have dropped plenty of women who act like the author of this book suggests. i kept the one who acted the opposite way of everything this book suggests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"One of the worst books that I purchased in amazon. It may be useful just for young teenage girls not for the adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way it should be done","review":"This book was helpful because it reminds us that dating is not as hard as we make it out to be. First and foremost, you'll learn that the most important thing is to have a fulfilling life of your own, before you seek a companion. You'll learn what the term \\"bitch\\" describes, as it's not what you're thinking. It is an assertive woman who has her own life, can take or leave her man, and stands up for herself. All the while, this \\"bitch\\" will love her man, and make him feel like a man, like he's in control. Of course we all know better. I recommend this book. It was an easy read, and it opens your eyes to what you may have been doing wrong in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"So True Til It Hurt","review":"After reading this book, I realized just how many mistakes I have made in my previous relationships. With occasional sobs/tears and laughter, I had to agree with every rule in the book. Who would have thought that a man wouldn't want a woman to spoil them? I never thought that a man would see being nic as a sign of weakness, but it is so TRUE!!! Every man I have dealt with in past relationships have been spoiled by me but they always walk away. The last guy got a motorcycle and all expense paid trip to FL out of the deal AFTER the break-up and his \\"we can see other people\\" just because I wanted to be \\"NICE\\"! How crazy is that. I still think he sits around with his friends and laugh at me. If only I had this book in the beginning of the relationship, this would be so different now. A must read for every women. Men will USE you if you let them. Demand respect and you will get it. Never be a doormat again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever!!!","review":"This book initially seemed like a book that told you why men really act the way they do. But by the time I was done with it, it seemed like a book that would help you realize that it is all about 'being good to yourself' and not allowing anyone to disrespect you (male or female). This is definitely a book for all women to read. Forget all those other relationship books out there. And all you men should read this too, just to realize what us women have to put up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls- Do yourself a favor by buying this book","review":"This book is worth every penny. It tells you something that every girls need to know how to make relationship works. It is an amazing book, it's written in a very clear, easy-to-understand manner and stright to the point. A MUST READ. Give yourself some respect my fellow sisters! I was that NICE GIRL once and always wondered why the whole thing never worked. Now I have the answer - and I will stick to it. This book will not teach you how to lure man with sexy lingerie but with your own dignity."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's In a Name","review":"Just by the title alone, I didn't think that it would be something I would get anything from. However, I'd heard many women discussing this book. I discovered that I was a true \\"Bitch\\" (dreamgirl). I would recommend this book to any young woman (like my daughter and niece). It's very enlightening with \\"in your face\\" reality. Sherry has touched on some things we do in relationships, but have a hard time accepting that we are being \\"doormats\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"I tip my hat to Ms Argov. Her vignettes and insights are captured with humor and chilling realism. Because I'm a man, I started the book by fighting against its basic premise; yet by the end, I grudgingly capitulated to the inevitable conclusion that - in the long run - men need partners who are their equal.This is a must read for men and women alike who are interested in finding and keeping meaningful long term relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm reading it again and again!","review":"I am reading this book again and again. My gosh--to finally have someone sit down and explain it is like--thank you!!!! I never had a mother or a sister to teach me this stuff and now I understand things that confused me.I understand the nonverbal behaviors of men--why they pull back--why I give myself up, what I do that sends the message I am insecure, etc. I believe this relationship book has changed the way I approach relationships permanently.I also understand what attracts a man so much more--I think we think it's all looks or sex. It really is dignity. Most importantly, it felt empowering. I felt good about myself after reading it, and I felt that I have much, much more to bring to my next relationship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wish i had it earlier","review":"In all relationships, compromises are essential, but women tend to sacrifice more due to our nature. This book act as a reminder to stand firmly on your own position and don't ever let any men bring you down. honestly I wish I had this book earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advocates game playing & manipulation","review":"I wanted to like this book. Many women, including myself, could benefit from having more of a backbone when it comes to romantic relationships. In that sense, this book is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the book's message is muddied by its endorsement of game playing and manipulation. The author tells you many times she's not telling you to play games but the reality is that's what her advice boils down to. So . . take away the importance of being strong and being yourself. But unless you want inauthentic relationships based on manipulation and games, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book , i ever read","review":"Great , great book!!People , who leave bad comments ,just didn't got what this book about !

I don't agree however, that anyone should have to change their complete frame of mind and actions, just to find a meaningful relationship. I cannot take all this advice without a grain of salt, and I believe I'll just continue to be the nice me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things you already know","review":"This books repeats its self over and over and it's things we know as women I wouldn't recommend to anybody could have wrote this book I guess I bought if because of the title......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not yo Mama's Advice","review":"This has good advice for single women of this decade.

I got an idea of how men think about certain women and why they act selfish and careless sometimes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this is just wrong","review":"The title of this book contains a certain obscene term that I have never once heard a \\"real\\" man use affectionately about or towards any \\"real\\" woman. Ladies, that is a clue. I am sorry to say this, but any female who follows the advice offered up in this book is dooming herself to the possibility of a relationship with either a vapid milquetoast loser or a dangerous simmering volcano with a bad temper and a wandering eye. Some of the ideas in this book are so silly that I nearly spewed hot cappucino out of my nose when I was perusing the book at my local bookstore coffee shop. I hate to rain on anyone's parade, but better to hear it from me now than to become disillusioned, bitter, hurt, and lonely later. It's definitely possible for you to attract men, if that's what you want, but being, shall we say, \\"constantly aggresively testy\\" is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD FOR ONE AND ALL","review":"BELIEVE IT OR NOT ...

Barry, if you're so busy being a doctor, why do you constantly recycle the same reviews over and over again, and then vote on them yourself? People are getting tired of seeing you sell the title that you're really trying to push in disguise of your constant recycled reviews.As for this book, it's interesting and helpful. Depending on where you're at in your relationship or stage of life, it does bring useful information that can benefit anyone. Take what works for you and make the best of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work!!","review":"I acted like a super bitch -- and it didn't help! None of the tools designed to shift the parameters of a relationship provided in this book did much for me. Perhaps this book is aimed towards women interested in a different type of men, because I am sorry to say that the man I was dating saw through the tricks being pulled. After a number of dates, our relationship began falling apart as I was getting more bitchy and manipulative, as Sherry's book suggests. At first, the guy fell for it and was upset that I seemed to be losing interest in him. I did not want to see him heart-broken, but continued following the advice given as I wanted to maintain the relationship. But it didn't take long for him to catch on to what was actually happening. He said that my wonderful aura had been lost and said (really) that I was acting like a disgusting bitch. I hate this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly dreadful","review":"If you want to end up as a lonely bitter eternal single this is the manual to follow. Women would be outraged if they found a book like this advising men to act like complete creeps towards them.If you want a quality partner in your life for more than a one night stand, you have to treat them with respect.Don't waste your money on this pathetic book for the sad Sex & the City spinstresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman needs to read this book","review":"Enough said, all women should read this book. Some of the ideas are a bit extreme but take it all with a grain of salt and it's about making sure you don't get taken advantage of. That's just smart, a very smart move to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice read for a traditional woman","review":"Loved this book. I wish I had read it before my last two relationships--but then again, just the word \\"bitch\\" in the title of the book would have turned me off (I was too nice at the time to want to be associated with the B word).Now I am learning to be the challenging, strong, no-nonsense woman that I am, and redo some of the damage traditional upbringing has done to me. It's not an easy process but it's fun!I can never be so mean, however, as some of the examples in the book (ruining my partner's underwear if he wants me to do his laundry, for example). I also have a hard time with telling lies to get what I want or to pretend to be who I am not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended from this single woman","review":"I had a friend recommend this book, as she had heard other non-married women recommend it. I think it is pop psychology at it's worst and I like pop psych usually.If you are truly a doormat in all facets of your life, can't say no, then buy the book.If you are single, because you have focused on your career and have a limited dating pool then don't buy the book.If you like the book \\"The Rules\\" then again you might like it. I think dating as a grown up requires throwing out the rules, being honest and enthusiastic to meet new people. This book doesn't suggest that as a solution versus once again the single woman is told \\"it is all you.\\" It could really be you, I don't know you ;-)The book is written in a satire format which is amusing, but I read about half of it and said enough. I do have a friend who I think maybe could use the book, but I am afraid she might take it literally. So for now it lies beside my bed and I probably won't finish reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"why men love bitches","review":"Great product, shipped quickly. Very happy.

The content was delivered with a very fresh and humorous perspective.I can say that what it says is absolutely true. This is not about playing a game or leading the man on.

I read this book in one day (just couldn't put it down) and now I've recommended and bought it for most of my girlfriends.

It makes perfect sense. I have read numurous books on dating/love, but this one takes the cake.. if you're contimplating buying it-- DO IT. It's 100% worth the money, and it will give you a new attitude towards yourself and dating. It really helps you keep your sanity when you start dating a guy, and by holding back somet in the beginning, it helps you get what you want in the end.. it's really the best book out there!Ps. I have tried to get my \\"depressed/pathetic/obsessed with getting married and guys can sense it \\" friends to read it... and they have rejected the advice. They are still single, and very confused why.

It's not about the mean-bitch type, who layers her disturbed personality with a veneer of respect -- respect for her only, while she hacks away at the self-respect of her male associates.And it's not really about technique and tactics -- although there are plenty of them provided. To do it well you have to FEEL your entitlement to respect in a relationship, and then the advice makes sense. Read the book. Require respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book--not a man bashing book but a woman inpiring","review":"i loved this book--it was nice flowing read that you didn't want to put down--it wasn't about men bashing. it was a great book about a \\"BIG RED TRUCK\\" what are you doing putting up with anybody who puts your feelings last when you are supposed to be someone special--what are you doing crying by the phone and wondering what you did wrong- put yourself together and do something for yourself instead of waiting for everybody else make you feel special--obviously that doesn't work--it's an eye opening book--ignorance is not bliss"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Man Admits He Likes Bitches?","review":"This is a fun book to read and has some good advice, once you get past the traditional definition of bitch versus her definition of bitch. I agree with acting like a prize (showing that you value yourself) and not being \\"too nice\\" which translates into not being desperate or needy. I totally disagree with the advice that the meal you cook for him should be popcorn. Also, while some of these things will work initially, I don't think anyone wants a long-term relationship with a true bitch. As they say, take what you want and leave the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this to your daughters and nieces","review":"I wish I had read this book 20, no 30, years ago -- but it was not written then.

Old fashioned in powerfully modern way. Pragmatic information which has application in all aspects of female self-identity and personal strength.

The empowerment aspect of this book is good, and there are some humorous parts, but it just seemed to me like a less funny, far less interesting version of \\"Stop Getting Dumped!\\" which I totally loved. \\"Why men love\\", I'm not so crazy about.

She started to cry, and we were able to resolve it all, by really talking.This book does not teach a woman how to be real.

She had read it and said that it was well written and had a comedic value to it so I downloaded the preview to my Kindle. After reading the preview, I purchased the entire book and sat down for an evening of what I thought would be a great read.The first 1/3 of the book is entertaining. It does have some good advice but was nothing that I hadn't already implemented or heard before. The enormous fault that I find with the book is toward the end, it starts to compare men to things like your dog and that you should treat them the same way. It turns condescending and I couldn't finish the last couple of chapters because of it. As the book says, there is a difference being a full blown irritating bitch and a bitch that a man loves. Unfortunately the author writes like the bitch a man loves in the beginning but turns toward the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most women just don't get it","review":"The reason most women find this book exciting, is because the psychology used in this book is what attracts women to men and keeps them interested.It does NOT work the other way around, not for the long term at least. Its a completely different set of emotional priciples that keep men hanging in there for the long haul.Playing aloof to the guy who finally sets your heart on fire, is a sure way to put that fire out. Not to mention all the wonderful emotional thrills you would lose out on, which is reason to be in a relationship in the first place.The only reason to get this book is if:1) You are a total doormat.2) You want a guy to be your doormat, in which case you need to find a total wimp. But ask yourself is this the kind of guy who pulls your heartstrings?3) You want to have an open realtionship (seeing other people outside of the realtionship).So be Bitch at your own risk---you may well lose your soul mate when you finally meet him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Men Love Ditzes","review":"I doubt any adult male with an IQ would buy into these cheesy games.

(Page 143)- Make him feel powerful by having him address the hostess: \\"Johnson, party of four.\\" (Page 87)- Fake an orgasm by panting like a dog and keep going even if he gets up and does something else. (Page 70)- Emulate those clever Japanese women who are degraded in public but collect their husband's entire paycheck in private. (Page 86)- Pretend you're too stupid to microwave popcorn. He'll take you out to dinner. (Page 7)This book was good for a few laughs, hence the two stars.

Basically, guys will like you but, you will no longer be \\"you\\" but this complex creature who will have predetermined reactions for every situation. Half way through the book, the author has gotten her point across millions of time, she contradicts herself in every chapter, telling you not to be his servant, nevertheless you should never complain for his mess in the house, letting him do whatever he wants, etc. She repeats herself trying to write a book out of a single thought.

The pre-sets all suck - the polyphonic ringtones are all too quiet to hear and the full-audio tones all sound like old video game theme songs.

The book discusses farmers, urban artisans, and everybody else in early America. It also does NOT ignore the traditional subjects of history - politics, leaders, diplomacy, economic development.

Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books...

The Eugenia subplot was fascinating and the characters were well-rounded and interesting (especially Sir Sedley Clarendel, who I thought showed a lot of potential, and who was much more than the fop he appeared to be). I should warn you (especially everybody new to Burney)that it starts fairly slowly, but the plot really picks up a couple hundred pages in. There were several times that I got so into reading it (especially the last 200 pages) that I ignored homework or other things that I was expected to do.

It's a compilation of true, autobiographical stories from Crichton's life, from his days in med school to vacations to foreign lands to experimenting with psychic phenomenon.This book gives you a good understanding of Crichton's thinking processes. The problems with medicine (albeit in the 1960's). The openness with which he visits and tries to understand foreign cultures (and his mis-adventures in doing so). Some of his closed-minded tendencies, which we can all understand.What is particularly interesting to me is how he, as a man of medicine and a scientist, opened his mind on psychic phenomenon. I don't claim to understand any of this aura-reading, meditation, seances, etc., but it's really fascinating that Crichton spent some time experimenting with these phenomenon.Great reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Travel &#65533; Good, Other stuff - ???","review":"I thought the Travel parts of this book were extremely entertaining to read.

I've always enjoyed Michael's books, especially this one. I really got a sense of where he got a lot of his story ideas. From the scuba adventures (Sphere) to the medical schooling (ER, Five Patients, many others), you can really see why he knows so much about the topics. When I was in London, I actually when to the London Psychics organization and had a reading myself. I can't say that it changed my life, but it was damn fun!! Enjoy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Good autobiography by an interesting writer and person.

Crichton definitely has had some interesting experiences and I enjoyed his perceptions. Some trips I found myself saying better him than me.

Mind boggling !...The author includes a story to a southeastern brothel where children are the prostitutes. As a reader you are shocked at him and his friends, actually checking out the kids in room after room. Somehow Crichton decides it is not for him and opts out.I am thinking, Did you really have to go into the brothel where children are prostituted to find that one out?Sick....Washington Post calls this crap \\"entertaining\\"!

It covers his academic background at Harvard Medical School, follows his decision to drop out of modern medicine (interesting given that he produces TV series ER) and then follows him around the world.Get past the biography and find a tale about exploring the world. I read the book several years ago just as my eyes were starting to open to the world. His adventures were a roadmap for expanding the mind through travel.It's a very interesting travel log. Are his experiences more clouded by a medical background, a writer's imagination or a desire to live as the locals? In the end it's a remarkable tale of discovery, not so oversimplified as to ignore the pains of the road. Think a medically trained Paul Theroux.I highly recommend this book on both levels - to understand the author, and to encourage a broader worldview."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"Travels is one of the most fantastic books I have ever encountered.

Instead, I found this book to be frustrating, annoying, irritating, and almost unbearable to finish. I have lost all respect for Michael Crichton. During the 10% of this book that actually covered international travel expeditions, I found him to be a whiney, cry-baby. He had no backbone, complained about EVERYTHING, and found no joy in the simple things in life. He certainly didn't find the \\"growth\\" that he claimed. Beyond that, the other 90% of the book covered his strange fascination with auras, spoonbending, etc. It was just weird. Not a travel memoir by ANY means. If you seek to read this book because you've got the travel bug and are looking for inspiration...look elsewhere. This book should NOT be in the travel memoir section of the bookstore. I want my money back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a surprise","review":"I am truly surprised so many people loved this book.

Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude. He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter. How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. I have no desire to read any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"The book starts off strong with interesting accounts of his medical school experiences, but after a while, the story becomes more of a sales pitch for meditation and other new age mumbo jumbo. By the end, Crichton looks like a total kook rather than the \\"Harvard trained physcian\\" that he uses to advertise himself. If you really want to read about \\"Travels,\\" pick up a copy of Tony Horwitz, Bill Bryson, or writers who actually know how tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travels","review":"We were very disappointed as the book arrived very wet. It was December during the time that we had a month of heavy rain. It was packaged in a paper envelope and it was soaked when we opened the packaging so when it finally dried after several days, it was in terrible shape. The pages were wrinkly, some of the ink ran and it had a smell to it! And it was a Christmas gift so it was very disappointing!A suggestion would be that in the winter when weather conditions are wet that the book be put into a plastic bag before wrapped in the paper packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting twist on the typical serial killer novel","review":"The house across the street from Cathy has a violent history. When she was a little girl, the man of the house killed himself and his wife. Now, a new odd couple has moved in: a woman and her mentally-handicapped son, Randy. And with the new neighbors, a shadow has fallen over Phoenix, as a spree of gruesome, highly-original serial murders begins. Catchy soon begins to realize that at the center of these murders is young Randy, a special boy with a special gift: murder...\\"Death Instinct\\" is rather predictable, but at the same time it's a highly enjoyable read. This is a distortion of the typical serial killer novel that could only have come from the mind of Bentley Little. It's a serial killer novel for horror fans, written early in his career. It lacks much of the macabre satire that makes his latter work such a guilty pleasure, but it is still pretty original.

I am sure he had a rough time and was from a rough neighborhood but the book is littered with Christian speak and rings really inauthentic and manipulative to say the least. Nicky Cruz would have us believe that a minister came in to the ghetto and brought the heads of every gang to their knees in prayer on the street after preaching for just a few minutes, then somehow gets EVERY gang memeber in Brooklyn to attend a tent revival. Where are the people from The Smoking Gun, It smells like some major embellishing to me. Not to mention the writing style is dated and pretty sophomoric. There are alot of typos and grammatical errors and it pretty much feels like it's been written by someone who writes for The Watch Tower magazine.Hey I'm all for a good redemption story but this one just feels like propaganda, if you want to read a good gang redemption story, read a book called Monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, down to earth reading - where's the film?","review":"It's an excellent read, a book that you find hard to put down once you start to read, a book that makes you feel that you are with Nicky all the way.

Indeed, the chance was there for Cruz to show these lost kids what God's love is truly all about and how they can find salvation through acceptance. But instead, Cruz- apparently under the influence of Pentecostal Brainwashing- goes in a tirade of nonsense such as speaking in tongues (purely theater) and a host of holier than thou condemnation tactics- and in the process loses many kids that would have otherwise been found. I don't fault Cruz for his ministries, he is trying in his own way- but if he would leave the snake handling alone, he would reach a lot more lost souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"very strong message","review":"I read this book at a relatively young age (14? 15?) and was strongly impacted by it.

Nicky's depiction of his journey from darkness to light was riveting.

This is the most repetitive book I've ever encountered. It made me wonder if the author was to be paid by the word! Really, it was sad - and annoying - how much of the book was wasted on retelling the previous 4 books. Then there were the constant repetitions of Ayla's \\"formal greetings\\" and the overly detailed and rather crudely written sex scenes that had me thinking it might be more fun to go sandpaper my brain. The story didn't progress much for all the hours it took to listen to it. I don't recommend it unless you just want to hear a voice going on and on and on about nothing much at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new or notable happens.","review":"I loved all four of the first books in this series and couldn't wait for this one. However, it is very much a repeat of everything that happened in the preceding four books in the series about the cro-Magnon woman--Ayla continually dazzles Jondalar's family with her ability to start fires with flint, domesticate wild animals, hunt better than the men in the tribe, etc. in the hopes that her amazing abilities will help them accept her as one of them. With nothing new to add to the series, this one was not worth the time it took to finish reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps going downhill","review":"I have read every book in the series, and despite the fact I was not thrilled with the 4th book, I was excited to see the 5th one had come out. Unfortunately, as far as the series go, I feel the first one was wonderful, the second ok, the third excellent, and the fourth and fifth nothing to write home about. Auel needs to get herself a good editor to tighten up her work. There is a good novel in here somewhere, she just needs some help to find it. She also needs to remember that what made the first book so special is that Ayla was human. She's become such a superwoman I sometimes just find myself shaking my head.I'll read the 6th one when it comes out, it is as if I can't help myself. But here's to hoping Auel recovers the magic she seems to have lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it be over?","review":"What a disappointment! Be prepared to skip not just pages but whole chapters! In fact, do yourself a favor and skip the whole thing!! This entire book can be read in minutes, I brought it on a plane trip and was so cheesed off that I wasted the valuable space in my carry on. I mean, nothing ever happens in this entire book--its boring--all character development has been arrested--why does the reader have to be subjected to every inane, sophmoric thought that goes through these characters minds? Why was this book even printed? Did Jean Auel get tired of her characters? Geez-o-man, I hope these reviews save at least one person from being bored beyond belief. Whatever happens, Don't buy this book!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I don't know what happened, but his book was a sore disappointment. I waited excitedly for this book to come out. When I was done all I could say was that I would not recommend it to others. The story was weak. She described everything to death and forgot to tell a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long-awaited disappointment...","review":"Having been a faithful reader of the first 4 books, Shelters of Stone was eagerly anticipated for 11+ years. What a let-down! It is if someone else wrote this book. The repetition of descriptions of places or encounters that the characters have is annoying, to say the least. Jean Auel never wrote like this in the first 4 books. Ayla can rethink a thought or conversation for two or three pages. It is if the \\"author\\" is trying way too hard to educate the reader or make the situations in the book more true through repetition. Or the publisher, like a teacher, said this had to be so many pages long and the writer went back and repeated and rehashed each scene in the book. One of the most irritating books I've read in a long time. If you liked the first 4 books of the Earth Children series I would NOT recommend this book. It is a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone cold cash shelter.....","review":"Sorry Jean, but like many other Ayla fans, I have absolutely longed for this book, and now I wish I had waited for the paperback.When \\"Plains of Passage\\" ended, Ayla & Jondalar have journeyed through an array of fascinating adventures, and have at last arrived at Jondalar's home cave, pregnant, ready to be mated. \\"Shelters...\\" tells the story of their next 8 months, a tale that would have taken a couple of chapters in any of the preceding books, in an agonizing 749 pages...I skimmed and skimmed looking for a spark of Ms. Auel's altogether absent inventiveness and storytelling skill. No pathos, no finely drawn protagonist, no interesting new adversary. If she had wanted to add another few pages, perhaps Ms. Auel could have quoted her Song of the Mother ONE MORE TIME? I'm disappointed that JA would cheat her fans....I gladly paid for the book, but the story I expected was missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I cannot believe, after 12 years of \\"research\\", this is the best Ms. Auel can come up with. The tediousness of the cave life (yes, yes, you wake up and pass your water, but do I need to read about it several times throughout the book?), the ad nauseum introductions, the one-dimensional characters...I was beyond frustrated! I think ice age cave life was well covered in her previous books and was looking forward to seeing the story advance and bring closure to many of the visions and dreams Ayla has had throughout the previous books. Even now, Ms. Auel has let 5 years elapse since this was released and I can't help but wonder if we will ever see the dramatic conclusion alluded to in previous books. She doesn't need more research, she needs to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest of the 5 books.","review":"Finally, I finished the book. This book is too long, with too little content. You feel you are reading the same paragraphs over and over until you have it memorized verbatim. There isn't an engaging story. Basically it's about Ayla getting introduced to Jondalar's people and travelling to the Summer Camp (similar to the story in The Mammoth Hunters) and having her baby. I was waiting for something interesting to happen in the book, but it never materialized."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelters of Stone","review":"Was disappointed in the book. Too much repetition. Wasn't it Hemingway who advised not to use a paragraph when a sentence would do? And, to use short sentences. Had Ms Auel followed his advice the book would have been half as long and, maybe, a much better read. I found her last four books better than this one. Hopefully the next(last?) one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read","review":"I have every book in the Earth's Children series & looked forward to reading book 5. Unfortunately, I'm not even half way thru the book and feel like putting it aside. It's repetitious in ways that are beyond boring such as the greetings done with Ayla. We get the idea after the first greeting. It seems as though the author wasn't quite sure what to put in this book but felt it was necessary to put a book 5 out there because her readers were eager for it. Next time, wait until there is something to write. The readers will wait eagerly! But this makes me wonder if the next book is also going to be boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone else notice these few things?","review":"Why didn't Ayla react to the revelation that Jondalar's Elan(clan?) is the tail of an ermine and that he has always liked the white tails with the little black tips? It just happens to be the very same thing that she used to decorate the white tunic she made for him. Remember when she was floored that she was going to be adopted into the Lion Hearth of the Lion Camp? Also that Jondalar has also been choosen by the Cave Lion, and has scars like her too?Speaking of the Cave Lion, Ayla appears to have forgotten him in this book, she hardly ever \\"prays\\" to it anymore.And why does Jondalar now get very upset around a dead body?He wasen't so neverous around Rydag or the two Sungaea children or Jetamio or Attaroa.Mabey Jean was so busy re-re-re-writing the Mother's Song that she didn't notice there few laps of the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action, please!","review":"After reading the first 700 pages, I gave up any hopes of encountering a plot. Simply nothing of consequence happens in this book. Ayla encountered a few people who grumbled about her association with the clan, but these were easily dismissed by the rest of the people of her cave. If anything, Ayla was too easily accepted, leaving her no challenges to overcome. Even the detailing of stone-age life, which was a favourite aspect of the previous books, was lacking here. So, for most of the book, we just get passages from a terrible poem interspersed with Jondalar's proclamations of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"real snoozer","review":"OK--here's the entire plot: Ayla helps a little, hunts a little, humps a little, takes care of her animals, gets married and has a baby. Problem is--anyone who has read Auel's previous books already knew that--that was the plan at the end of the last book! I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, but nothing ever did. There were no surprises, very little conflict, no further character development of Ayla and Jondalar, and no character development at all of anybody else. Tons of named, but useless, characters cluttered the novel. It also seemed there were the starts of some interesting plots, all which deadended.Yes, obviously well researched since we had long explanations of minute details of stuff was made, etc. But I think at this point Ms. Auel has made it abundantly clear that she'd rather do research than write good fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I have to read Wolf's introduction ONE MORE TIME....","review":"This is the culmination of the degeneration of a great idea and a great character (Ayla). I read the entire Earth's Children series last year, one after the other, and I didn't even make it halfway through this last one. It was utterly useless plot and boring self introductions. She should have just ended the series with them making it back to Jondalar's home... what a pity.I also didn't care for the last half of the series (starting with the last part of Valley of the Horses after Ayla met Jondalar) because it became disgustingly obvious that Auel was living out her sex fantasies through Ayla with Jondalar as her ideal man. This happens way too much, and makes me ashamed of women authors who otherwise have great epic historical fiction plots and ideas.Yes, sex a part of people's lives in all times and places, but when it starts to absorb the plot and characters it just isn't fun to read anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and repetitive","review":"I bought this book because I enjoyed all the others, to varying degrees (though I don't really remember the fourth one at all). And I have to admit this one has a not put downable quality to it in that you want to know what happens! But nothing much does and there are so many repetitive passages that it made me wonder whether the book was edited at all. I think the Zelandoni attitude towards \\"Pleasures\\" is refreshing but I don't think the sex scenes between Jondalar and Ayla add anything to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting journey into the past","review":"I enjoyed the trip into the past I would have liked more interaction with the Clan.I would like to be advised of any books Jean writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"I love this book - it's a favorite I have read many times. Listening to it is a wonderful experience. My only complaint is that Ayla was given an accent that she did not have in the previous four books that I found a bit annoying. I realize she does indeed have an accent in the books, but making her sound Eastern European to achieve what was her \\"clan accent\\" did not work for me. Otherwise I loved it and will listen to it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought out of the children's section..........has now been placed in the adult section...","review":"As a grandmother preparing for a spring break with my grandchildren, I purchased this audio book so they would have something to keep them busy on a long ride of over 9hrs, when we were playing it it came to a part that I thought would be a little kissing however it became X rated for children....not knowing the author or reading any of Jean M Auel books before... this is not for the ears of children 6yrs to 12yrs of age....I on the other hand when my grandchildren went back home I finished the book...all but the sexual parts that go into real detail...would be great for kids.... its to bad that this book goes into that much detail this book as is should not be recommended for children as it was when I looked children books.

I found all of them imaginative and the detail very interesting. I have to admit that The Plains of Passage became a little tedious at times, but the story line made it worth the while.In this installment however, the detail was tediously boring. I found myself skipping pages to try and get back to the story. But the story was merely a recounting of the previously explained history of Ayla and her skills. The characters are even so similar to previous books characters that the encounters are repetetive. The story that this book tells is almost non- existent. The characters are one dimensional. It could have been told better in two hundred pages.In other words, it was a big disappointment, a well written yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"The long road to no where","review":"Like so many other fans of the Earth's Children series, I was disappointed in this installment. In my opinion, the book was about 500 pages too long. Too many words!! Get to the point Jean Auell. Where was the character development? Where was the story of the people? The dialog was totally unbelievable. In short it was an effort to finish the book, I only did so because I am an optimist, I kept hoping it would get better. Will I read the next book? If it takes another 10 yrs. to get out I probably won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing","review":"I waited twelve years for this book, and I would have been less disappointed if it had not been written at all. It is entirely too lengthy and uses too many words to say too little. The description of how the \\"spear thrower\\" works is one example. What took half an hour to read could have been summed up in one page. The use of contemporary English does not fit the characters at all. I think I'll pass on the next book in the series where Ayla visits the Pacific. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"the shelters of stone","review":"I have read the first 4 books in this series. I thought the Valley of the Horses was the best one. I bought the unabridges version of the Sherters of stone in cassette form. Jean Auel, in my opinion, wrote a very long book of descriptions of Ayla's talents with healing, medicine and food. Al of which were explained in the other books.THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ACTION EVENTS IN THE WHOLE BOOK. It dragged on and on. The next time I buy a tape version I will get the abridged version. Maybe that will cut out all the stufff Jean told us in the first 5 books. Based on the other books, especially the first three books, I was extremely disappointed in this last book. I can honestly say I would not reccomend this book for others to waste their time on reading it.Fred Davis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing ever happens in this book","review":"While I really liked the earlier books in this series, this latest installment is a big disappointment. I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, and it really never did. I think there were huge opportunities in the plot line, but it's almost like Auel lost steam because she never pursued them. For instance, the whole book could have circulated around a dramatic meeting or conflict between the Others and the Clan, followed by understanding or resolution. Also, Ayla's character did not \\"ring true\\" at the end; she was uncharacteristically weak and fearful. Sorry to say, but we should skip this one, and keep the good memories from Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"This is the book to read when you need to fall asleep. The excruciating detail will wear any reader down. I loved the series but felt the characters in this book had no personality. Ayla has become such a goody-goody with none of her previous fiery personality and Jondalar has none of the character he had in the previous books. The new characters introduced in the book are sadly lacking in development. Rather than buy Shelters of Stone, read Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, to say the least.................","review":"After waiting 12 years or more for this book I was very disappointed!!!The story is repetitive at times. Also, there is too much attention to detail. I think Ms. Auel spent too much time writing this book. I found myself skimming over the descriptions to get back to the story.Too many new character introductions, some of which have detailed story lines and then are never mentioned again.I have loved all of Jane Auel's other books and hope that the next book in the Children of the Earth series is more like her other books.I usually abhor abridged books but think that in this case it might be a better choice.If you do not have the other books in the sereis borrow it from the library or from someone that already has it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - a HUGE disappointment","review":"I really loved the first 3 books in the series and liked the next 3 in the series, but felt the books were becoming too much formula plot lines. This book was such a disappointment! She has so much to work with to create great drama and has seemed to instead repeat herself endlessly about the animals, the crafts, the history, geology, etc... Not to mention the laughable descriptions of the sexual eposides.This is a definate must miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"TEDIOUS ITERATION","review":"It is apparent Mrs. Auel wrote this book to cash in on the popularity of her first four Earth's Children books. Much of the writing in \\"Shelter's of Stone\\" seems to be copied from the other books. The descriptions of caves, clothes, tools, etc. are wordy and endless. The character's are weak and if there is any plot, I can't find it. Auel uses 741 pages when she could have told the whole story in 25. Save your money and don't buy this one and you can be sure I will not waste my money or time on reading her sixth."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHELTERS OF STONE - A Disappointment","review":"I have read the other books in the series and waited anxiously for this one. This latest is so repetitive that I don't really believe Jean Auel wrote it. An example is that the Mother's Song is about three pages long and is repeated three times. When Ayla is introduced to members of Jondalar's family, the lengthy formal introduction is repeated each time she meets a new member, and there are about two hundred members. It is not until about the last three chapters that the book picks up the pace and we begin to get a story line. Maybe this is where Jean began to write. The novel could be considerably condensed by tightening up the prose and eliminating the redundancy. Where was the editor? I felt embarrassed for the author. I probably will read the final book, but I certainly hope it is an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder if Ayala could walk on water....","review":"....because she could do everything else.I have read all of Auel's Earth's Children series and I have to say that is book was a disappointment.First off, the characters are all one-dimensional, boring and predictable. We all know that Ayala can do, say or wear anything and it'll turn out to be \\"right\\". Jondalar is such a wuss, lol. I mean, does he ever disagree with Ayala or get over his insecurities of every man desiring \\"Ms. Perfect\\"?Another thing are the explicit sex pages. Ok, how many times to we have to know when Jondalar is going down on her? Yes, yes...feels great; I love it too but there are so many times you can read about it before you start turning pages 3 at a time to skip over the taudry and tedious 3rd rate, quasi-porn.All and all this book was NOT her best. I'm really wondering if Ayala will ever see her son, Durc again. Maybe Jean should concentrate on giving the readers what they want! THat loose end needs to be tied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She lost her touch...","review":"I read the other books of this series all in a day each... this \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" has been at my night-stand for weeks and I am only half-way through it... Mrs. Auel this time takes to long describing things, people and places, and the story itself never takes off... a great disappointment after a 12-year wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"I enjoyed her previous books. This one is, if not the most, at least a serious contender for, the most boring book I have ever read. Thank God I'm finished with it. What preserverance to complete it at all!."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word - BAD!","review":"About 1/4 of this book is well written. The rest [sticks]! Yes it is that bad.I love the Earth Children series but I am not going to say this was a good book just to be a loyal fan. ... It has SO many inconsistancies, way too much repetition, and no plot what-so-ever.Do yourselves a favor, if you must read it, wait until you can get it a the library. Don't waste you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless....Sank Faster Than The Titanic","review":"The only good thing I can say about this book is that I didn't have to buy it. It was a birthday gift from my sister. What a way to celebrate your 60th birthday. I eagerly awaited the 5th installment in the saga of Alya and Jondalar. Jean, you have insulted all of your devoted fans. Give us credit for having read the previous books and stop repeating yourself over and over and over again. Enough already. If you can't do any better than this, forget the 6th book. Sorry Sis, I wish I could get your money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"There was no character development in this book. The characters were either perfect beyond belief or just downright bad and lazy. The protaganists, Ayla and Jondalar, have become one dimensional and boring. The antagonists don't actually create any conflict worth writing about. The book is unbearably repetitive, and the physical background descriptions were endless. Too much of the book spent time reiterating what had happened in previous books, I think unnecessarily. Or maybe I've just matured in the past 12 years and expect more...What a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOSING HER TOUCH..","review":"Jean Auel started out with an exciting story of Ayla, but threw the series, she slowly either lost interest or just forgot how to write. She is loosing her followers, who have watched Ayla grow. All hopes for Ayla to return someday, and find her son Derk are all but lost, as the books become more boring and seem to only fill pages with gibberish. The #6 book in the series is not out yet, but I think I will read threw the pages before I buy it, to see if its worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"romance fans only","review":"If you have to know how Ayla's world turns out (Will she perform heart transplants? Power Zelandonii civilization with cold fusion? Tame a mammoth instead of eating it?) then by all means read this book. And, I think if you are a fan of Romance Fiction, like Nora Roberts or Diana Galbadon (sp?), then you would probably enjoy it.If, however, you want a gritty exposition of the human ice age, forget about it. Or, read the book for amusement value. Otherwise, read Clan of the Cave Bear and stop there. That book managed to be a great piece of storytelling. Shelters of Stone is a tired piece of romance fiction from an author who is obviously tired of writing the series.Best thing I can say about it: it is MUCH better than Plains of Passage, a throwaway effort on the part of Auel."},{"rating":"1","title":"book was missing appx 50 pages","review":"I recieved the book and appx half way through reading it I found that around 50 pages were missing! evidently a factory mistake so evidently a factory second someone got on the cheap then passed it on to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"shelters of stone book","review":"this was a great book and the vendor sent it wwith no problem the book was the 2nd last book of the EArth children series by Jean Auel and followed Ayla again with more adventures. good reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"All that research and no substance!","review":"I have been one of Ms. Auel's addicted readers throughout her entire series. I fought my way through The Shelters of Stone for the first 275 pages and finally tossed it aside. Replay, Replay, Replay. I enjoyed the five page spread on the caves in France in one of the 2001 editions of National Geographic significantly more. 13 million copies printed of The shelters of Stone! My copy got trashed. A great disappointment to this previous fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transition","review":"After waiting 11 years, I was thrilled and disappointed. Thrilled to finally have book 5 here. Disappointed, as not much happened. There isn't the \\"drama\\" to this volume that appeared in earlier. No threats to Jondalar and Ayla's relationship, no threats to their lives, no real cultural problems or fitting in problems. What I do see is Jean setting the scene for the next volume.We will see the resolution of Ayla becomming Zelandoni, there will be some interaction with the clan, and Ayla did make some enemies. I expect to see more drama with them in book 6.All in all, an enjoyable, light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary","review":"Jean Auel has written 5 books in this series. This one is the poorest. It drags, page after page, it drags. It is repetitious to the point where I skipped whole paragraphs. Much of it is re-hashes the previous books. The sex appears to be added as an afterthought to relieve the boredom. I kept hoping, but nothing ever happened that grabbed my attention. \\"Valley of the Horses\\" was fascinating, it sits in my bookcase and I'll re-read every couple of years. Shelters of Stone I'll donate to the local libary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash...Rehash","review":"I was totally dissapointed by this book. It lacked originality and adventure as the other previous 4 books provided. The 700 some odd pages of introductions and rehash of the other books was totally boring . I almost put the book aside, but kept reading expecting something interesting to happen, but did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZ!!","review":"I'm in agreement with everyone else. I was disappointed in SoS because of the long, detailed, repetious explaination of everything. One positive point. It did pickup speed towards the end which will perhaps make the sequel a better work. Good luck Jean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shelters of Stone","review":"You people are ridiculous!! You don't deserve the 6th book. You've totally missed the point. Ayla, Jondalar, Marthona, The First, Laramar, Brukaval, etc, are archtypes of the people all around us. There is much to consider and learn. We can all find our nature in one of these characters. Why exaclty is Ayla loved, Jondalar desired, Marthona respected, and Laramar despised? Who do we all know who reminds us of each \\"fictional\\" people? Compare democracy to socialism in the Zelandonai and todays societies (USA, Soviet Union, South Africa, EU). What do we do with individuals who are unproductive? Uncared-for children? Children who have birth defects? How is wealth measured? Is monogamy realistic? This book is as great as those who read it. Sure, the story could have gone a few different ways. Write your own series if you think you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"As I learned after reading it, this book was completed after the author's death. It would have been kinder to leave it undone. The story just rambles on and on. And my chief complaint with the whole series is this: Foreshadowing and dramatic build-up always lead to nothing. Ayla always seems on the verge of some exciting discovery. Through her dreams, chance encounters, new but familiar surroundings, we are drawn to expect some great spiritual revelation, but nothing ever happens with them. There is one more book promised to end this series, but I will not read it... Unless I become an insomniac."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 years of waiting...","review":"I'll admit to being one of those fans that read the first four books in this series 15 times a piece! They were wonderful. But after waiting the twelve years it took Auel to write this fifth book, I was sorely disappointed.The style, the excitement and the herbalism i had grown to treasure in the other Ayla books were really lacking in this one. The rehashing of old stuff was over the top, and I think the editor didn't do such a great job of catching the repitition Auel insisted on writing. I guess it would have been helpful for someone who hadn't read the other books in the series, but even then, some of the repition was within this same story!Had i not known better, i would have believed this book written by a totally different person.On the flip side, if you are a die-hard fan such as myself, this book is a must. If only to offer us hope for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The more things change....","review":"As a writer, I was blown away! Don't let the caveman stuff put you off. This is excellent, awesome reading. Auel is a masterful story-teller, first creating a world then unfolding a story that had me turning each page with wild anticipation. I don't want to spoil anything by giving it away, but trust me, this would be money well spent on some first rate thrilling reading! I suppose I'm biased since Baby is her pet lion and my name is Lions. It's awesome story-telling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I really enjoyed the other books. I too was looking forward to this one. But nothing ever happens. The descriptions are too long and the story is very redunant. I skippped over page after page until I finally decided to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I liked Clan of the Cave Bear but Auel gradually slipped more and more into cheap sex novels as she went along with the series. Shelters of Stone should be sold in porn shops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Awaited--Kind of Disappointed","review":"After eagerly awaiting the 5th book for over 10 years I find myself disappointed in it. It was very slow going at the beginning and introduced too many new characters who didn't seem to have a whole lot to do with anything. Brukeval and Laramar could have been made into better antagonists but were left kind of hanging. Don't get me wrong...I loved her first three books and the fourth was alright but I guess I expected more out of the fifth book because it took so long to be finished. Hopefully the 6th book won't take as long and will be better than the 5th."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the edition pictured.","review":"I thought I was getting a hardback and mine has a different cover. It's pretty tired looking so if I decide to keep the series I'll probably get a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelters of Stone - Book - Jean Auel","review":"This book took a long time to arrive from the supplier and was not as shown - in fact I had time to read the last book in this series (1248 pages - large print) before I got a chance to read this one - and they were ordered at the same time. It was a much smaller novel and the print was smaller than I had expected that I would receive. The condition of the book was not bad but there were a lot of folded pages on the inside. I don't dispute that the price was a great deal but I do wish that the supplier had said more about the condition of the book before I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelters of Stone","review":"The book was good, however I found that it repeated the history of all prior issues to a point of boredom at times. The book was full of typographical errors on the Kindle version. If it was worth reading again, I would read the paper version in hopes of avoiding a multitude of typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"I read the first 4 books in the Earth's Children series as they were first released. I've been re-reading them, including this latest book, in anticipation of the sixth book being released in March 2011.Holy Cow! I thought my remembrances of long rambling sentences and overdone passages might have been wrong, but if anything, it is worse than i recalled. The author is a fan of repetition, and finding obsolete synonyms to use for descriptive purposes, then beating them to death as though that would bring the words back into the common lexicon.And enough with the overdone, overblown, overly descriptive vanilla caveman sex. We get it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ebook version of poor quality","review":"I cannot recommend the ebook version of this book. Assuming the print version was edited properly, I would probably give this novel 4 stars. However, there were so many errors in the ebook, I was never able to immerse myself in the story. The errors would jolt me and return me to the real word. The last third or fourth of the last chapter had 6 errors. It was often difficult to figure out what the correct word was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos Typos Typos","review":"The typographical errors in all the books of this series, have made this otherwise wonderful book, extremely difficult to read. Not only are there occasional errors, there are repeated errors, in the character's names. I was very disappointed in the quality of the ebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe I read it a second time...","review":"but I did. I did it to be fair since it has been SO LONG since the first time I read it. And?...it was no better. It is without a doubt the worst sequel I have ever read. The fact that I loved the characters didn't help a bit. Every review is right about the constant going over and over of the previous books. If I could tell Jean Auel anything it would be this: After this book and waiting 12 years (to date) for the next a lot of your devoted readers won't be there. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTNG!","review":"After such a long wait I think I expected something a little more than a rehash of her 1st four books. There was no character depth in this novel compared to her last ones, and I think the main characters acted very differently in certain circumstances than they would have previously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"Don't believe the hype.The massive amount of research which clearly went into this book does not make it a good story. There's no plot; no tension; no suspense. Much of it is actually a clip show, with Ayla and Jondalar endlessly rehashing their past adventures and inventions. Nothing of note happens. A & J return to the Zelandonii, mate, and have a kid. There are hints of conflict with the Clan but nothing happens. The characters are plastic, too-perfect people and the writing is slow, static and rife with both authorial intrusion and needless info-dumps.Pages of truly bad rhyming religious doggerel -- which are, along with much else in the book, repeated several times -- add a touch of ludicrous awfulness.It's boring. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Long-winded! Very little plot!","review":"What is she doing to this series? Clan of the Cave Bear was magnificent. Valley of the horses was interesting. Mammoth Hunters was tantalizing. Plains of passage was barely entertaining. This book is even less entertaining. She doesn't answer questions. What happened to Durc? Surely there is a lot more to his story and the flatheads then this. Surely, there has to be more going with the original clan. I mean, where is the story? She just rehashes everything again and again and it takes pages and pages and pages to get any plot. She is slow writer and I can't believe I waited this long for this thing. I feel like a flathead for actually reading this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"snooze-a-rama","review":"The only way I was able to finish this book was by skipping huge chunks of it. This series (Earth's Children), which began with such promise, has become completely lame. Jean Auel should put Ayla and Co. out of their misery if she can't think of some new story lines. If you must read this, get it from the library. Jean Auel doesn't deserve any of your hard earned money for this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I always like the Earth's Children series and I eagerly awaited the release of the 5th book. I was greatly disappointed with it. I found it very dragging, repetitive and had no definite plot going on. It was very long but it had no actual substance. It's suppose to be the 2nd to the last of the series...it left me bored to tears. I do hope the 6th and final book would have an exciting conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"A bad book made worse by the fact it took twelve years to write. I really cannot add anything else that has not already been said. Ayla is the source of all technology, she discovers/invents every tool that ever existed. She is perfect in every way, shape and form. Far from making mistakes as she did in Clan of the Cave Bear, she executes every form of etiquette perfectly, no matter how new or strange it is to her.The book is poorly written, with cardboard characters that have no believablity. It's poorly edited, with massive amounts of repetition and run-on sentences. Entire sections of the book can be skipped with no loss to the story. Auel never seemed to catch on to the idea that a book can be short, and still be good.I won't go on any longer, because everything that needs to be said has been said in the spotlight reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment in a wonderful series","review":"I too eagerly awaited Shelters of the Stone, as I had so enjoyed the first books in the series. I too am very let down by the lack of spirit and repetitious passages of this book. I was recently disappointed by Diana Gabaldon's latest novel The Fiery Cross, after rating her series one of my all time favorites. Maybe I expected too much of these last novels since they were so long in coming, but I am not waiting with eager anticipation for any follow up books. However, I will probably read them only because of my long-time loyalty to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edit, please!","review":"I can summarize this book in 3 words --- \\"Here, meet Wolf\\".Over 700 pages of repetition. No plot development. No climax (much less an anti-climax). It basically details all the relationships at the \\"shelters of stone\\".Ms. Auel had already begun to repeat herself (in full detail) quite a lot in the 4th book of the series. In this 5th and disappointing addition to the series, she was apparently given editorial rights to this book. Big Mistake. Someone needed to take scissors (not just a blue pencil) to the manuscript."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of Padding","review":"Was she paid by the word? If so, she earned her money. Every sentence in this looong, slow and dreary novel was repeated, rehashed, resaid and reiterated numerous times. The book could (and should) have been a quarter of the length it is. The dialogue is unbelieveable at best, the psychological insights hilariously anachronistic. The only genuine feeling is when cave drawings are described. The sex scenes obligatory every 75 pages are a howl and the fashions are to die for. Read it if you must, but Jean Auel has lost the touch and produced a really bad, padded monstrosity of a wooly mannoth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Thank goodness I didn't buy the book! Reading it took longer than usual, and I even skipped large sections that rambled on with scenic description, or dull rituals. The endless, repetitive introductions, along with showing people how to use the fire stones, over and over, bored me to death. I hope the final book is better! I think Jean Auel took too long a break from writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to read a novel, not chants and song lyrics","review":"I mean honestly, who here actually read word per word the numerous pages filled with chants/prayers and song lyrics? I'd turn the page to skip ahead and lo and behold - - more lyrics! eeks! I'd turn the page again and goodgollymissmolly! More lyrics! Over six pages of funeral song lyrics. Gee, how captivating. And what's with that long poem at the end of the book? What? Is Miss Auel trying to be hip? Hoping to score an MTV spot? Is she going to change her name to MC Auel? I've followed the entire series all these years. The endless sea of boring and needless details from this book has now confirmed this is the last book I'll read by Auel and whoever else attempted to help her write this snore of a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good practice for speed reading","review":"Not only does absolutely nothing happen in this book, but it is so poorly presented that you really don't want to spend too much time reading this. Skip the long paragraphs, skim through the vast majority of the dialogue, forget about the poem, and wait for book #6. Hopefully, the last book (#6 is supposedly the last) will buck the trend of the series going from good to bad as it progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"this series is really getting stale now","review":"I absolutely adored book one, loved book three and quite liked two and four but I'm getting really bored now. The endless, endless repetitions of the stories of their journey, the constant reactions to the animals, the characters agonising over the same things again and again...... If you cut out about half of it, then it might be a good book, as it is.....don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment - where was the editor here????","review":"I enjoyed the first four books, but couldn't believe this was written by the same author. Slow, painfully repetitive, and WAY too long for very little plot development. I made myself finish it (skimming the last half) just because I wanted to know \\"what happened\\" - in case there's a next book. Not sure I'll even read any next book at this point unless the author and editor make a concerted effort to trim. Also not sure why author has to make Ayla the inventor of all human advancements - first to tame a horse, first to use a spear thrower, first to use a sewing needle, etc. Talk about a Renaissance woman! Makes the character that much more unbelievable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a disappointment","review":"Jean Auel's \\"Earth's Children\\" series would have been limited to a single novel had \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" been written in the same tedious fashion. Ms. Auel's eagerly awaited fifth novel of the series, \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" is a study in excrutiating, minutiae. The reader makes progress across this vast and wonderous landscape with a magnifying glass, never seeing anything beyond the short focus of the lens. I confess to quitting the book after 260 odd pages. Ms. Auel is, in my opioion, an incredibly talented author, otherwise, I would have quit 100 pages sooner. Perhaps this was a 100 page novel that was filled with an additional 600 pages of very finely crafted descriptive verbage. I guess I'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I have been a fan of this series since Cave Bear was first published. My favorite book was Valley of Horses. When I heard Shelters was on the shelves, I ran straight out and bought it and was planning on devouring it that night.That was on the day it first hit the shelves and I just got through reading it. It was like walking up a sand dune with a 50lb pack on my back. I had to make myself read it.Maybe it is a setup for the next book, that's the only thing I can think of. Like The Empire Strikes Back. It set up Return of the Jedi and that was about all. I'm trying to convey as much respect as I can to Ms Auel, as I do admire and respect her work. I have a BA in Anthropology, and believe me, she's done her homework.I was so starved for something profound to happen in this book, I was actually hoping Jondalar would bite the dust in a hunting accident towards the end. But, what more is there for them to do? They've completed the journey and there are no more worlds to conquer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for \\"the good stuff","review":"When I was a quarter of the way through the book,I kept expecting some excitement, such as I found in my favorite, \\"Valley of the Horses\\". And now I'm almost half finished, and Auel is explaining how there always seems to be a cup at the spring for people to drink from....duhhh I sure hope the next book gives us some of the ole' Auel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the story?????","review":"Really a reminder and a rehash of her books. Did not have a story line. Really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fresh Voices Needed!","review":"After a decade, both Jean Auel and Robert Waller produced follow-ups to previous hits. I read both and wished I had not wasted my time nor money. Shelters of Stone and A Thousand Country Roads both lacked inspiration and originality. I will not turn instead to fresh voices in literature. Try \\"Lost Nation\\" by Jeffrey Lent or \\"Shade of the Maple\\" by Kirk Martin for refreshing, lyrical prose that is fresh and compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best..not the worst","review":"I was so excited when this book came out. 11 1/2 years was so long to wait. I thought that there were many interesting parts to the book, but that overall, the book lacked the excitement of some of the earlier ones. However, I must say that I am looking forward to the next book, given that Ayla's life has taken an amazing turn and has a promise of greatness and drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"I think that the book was amazingly well written, and it carried us through meeting all of Jondalar's kin. Carried over from the Shelters of Stone, Ayla is pregnant, and she has a baby. Ayla encounters many hardships from people who doubt her medical knowledge because of her upbringing. We are introduced to the Zelondonni, the women Jondalar used to love. Over all, this book stands up to it's 12 year wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harsh reviews","review":"Most of the reviews on here are pretty harsh. Some go into such great detail as to why/how it is bad, it is a little bit silly. Maybe if the book weren't being analyzed to death, it might be enjoyed more. I enjoyed all of the books in this series. I agree that maybe Jondalar was a bit wimpy, but I was more interested in Ayla anyhow, since she is the main character. As some others mentioned, I too would like to find out what happened to Durc. It would be interesting to have another book, where Ayla goes back to the Clan in search of him. Anyhow, if you aren't sure you should spend your money on this book, borrow it from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jean Auel's ultra-liberal world view has gone crazy!!","review":"I loved Auel's first 4 books. But this new book has gone over the top with politics and ultra radical liberalism. Lets be honest, Ayla now represents radical feminism taken to insane levels. I can't stretch my imagination far enough to possibly believe that life could have ever been so perfect back then. It doesn't matter that its 10,000 years ago, Ayla has mastered birth control, gets drunk, sleeps around, is a strong leader, hunts, fishs, is a medical guru and completes every other masculine task known to man. She also teachs the entire tribe to accept severe racial differences. I'm surprised Auel didn't have Ayla somehow attending college in Berekely! Lets be real, do you really think this could have happenend in such a harsh enviroment where survival was at stake every second of the day? I just don't buy it and I think Jean Auel is trying to shove her politics down our throat. Read at you own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This book continues the story of Ayla and Jondalar, sending them home to the Lanzadonii after quite a while of wandering about. It's well-written, with fascinating characterizations and dazzling detail. This time around, the sex didn't get in the way as much. As usual, it's a good read and gives insights into a way of life long since gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long between books","review":"When I found out Jean Auel had a new book out, I bought the hard cover not wanting to wait for the soft to come out. That was a mistake. I have been a big fan of Jean Auel for years, and have read her previous books numerous times. Shelter of Stone however left much to be desired. Her detailed description of \\"everything\\" was a bit much. I enjoy a good detailed book, but this one was overdone. I had to force myself to pick the book back up and continue reading it. The first five hundred pages were slow going, but after that, things picked up and it was easier to read. Hopefully her next book will be less descriptive of rocks and ledges and more of the story of Ayla and her new homeland."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I was so excited......","review":"This book was such a let down, I almost want my money back. I had been griping for years about the Earth's Children series and where in the world was that new book. I was so excited to finally to see the book alive and in print that I bought the first copy that I saw and settled myself in for an absorbing session. Imagine my surprise when I encountered all the other books mushed together in 750 pages of dry, tasteless reading. The repetition of the background of Ayla and Jondolar was really..... bad. I am trying to not sound harsh but I would only recommend this book if you go buy it used in paperback. We will see if the 6th book can recoup my faith in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelter of Ennui","review":"Having gloried in the first four Auel books, I was anxiously awaiting this present volume. What a disappointment! After four tales of high adventure around which were couched loads of information about stone age living, we come to this new effort. I have slogged through the first 300 pages of this tome, and now it rests on the shelf. (Editing out reduncancies and there might be a worthwhile thirty page read here). In those first 300 pages nothing more exciting happens than a dirty trick involving clothing and a death at a hunt, providing I suppose a plot ploy to expose Ayla's healing powers. Not much high dudgeon here. Frankly, the book reads more like ... manual for the stone age then a tale fashioned by a writer who proved capable of excellence in her earlier works.\`"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing end to some great stories.","review":"I could have saved my money and a lot of time if I had know it was just a rehash of all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this continuation of the series.

I am only guessing that the last page I was able to read was in fact the end of the book, it ended so abruptly. Was Wolf hurt; was Wolf killed. I may have to life the rest of my life not knowing since I'm not sure I want to invest any more $$ then have to wait years to pick up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much ctrl-V","review":"I picked this up on a whim, having read the previous books many years ago and enjoying them. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing for this one. Almost the entire book consisted of Ayla retelling events from the last four books to everyone she encountered. Some sections even seemed to be cut and pasted from earlier in the book word for word. The new plot elements were also very weak when they weren't overwhelmed by repetition. For the amount of time between this book and the previous one I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly boring","review":"Even though I enjoyed most of the previous books in the series and looked forward to reading this one, I found it was not only a terrible book, but a boring one.Repetitive, uneventful, heavy, unpleansant to read, etc. etc. Nothing justifies reading hundreds of pages to sumerize it in only a few words. Ayla and Jondalar ger married, Ayla has a baby, Ayla proves (yet again) that she has wisdom and 'powers', end of story.I feel cheated and fear the publication of the next one in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"The much-hyped, long awaited continuation of the saga of Ayla and Jondalar is finally here, and what a non-event it has turned out to be. The characters have turned to cardboard, the plot is plodding and, judging from the repetition and belabored descriptions, Auel must have been paid by the word for this mammoth disappointment. Auel's meticulous research and knowledge of the paleolithic era are, as always, superb--but that's not enough to elevate this potboiler to the level of her previous works.Since nothing happened or was resolved in this volume, there's sure to be another. I only hope Ms. Auel doesn't make us wait another ten years, and that she is able to capture the magic of her earlier work, so sadly lacking in Shelters of Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eep.","review":"I read the first book, I was hooked. I read the second book, and it was pretty good. I read the third book and started to get disinterested. I read the fourth book and I was disapointed on the focus of constant sex and how much of a heroine Ayla was. The fifth book, sadly, follows in this pattern.Not only is there an *extreme* amount of sex, but Ayla being 'accepted' seemed forced. And the fact she keeps discovering things upsets me. Flint, 'spear-thrower', sewing, taming animals, ect, it's just very overdone.Ayla has no real flaws, which I think, is a huge problem when reading this story, as the reader has nothing to identify with.I've heard people talk about a story about Durc and what happens to him. I think after Valley of Horses, that might have been the better idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad writing","review":"1 Part minimal story advancement + 9 parts rehashing previous novels and/or actually redoing things done in the previous novels...I think I will skip the 6th one when (if) it ever comes out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat Repeat Repeat","review":"It was sooo disappointing...save your hard earned cash and buy something else or you can wait until it shows up at your local yardsale. This book was no not worth the wait and not worth my cash..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"The next-to-last book in the Earth's Children series is well worth the wait. Jean Auel is so skilful at describing the little details of everyday life--What shall I fix for dinner? Can this be mended or should I go for a new one?--that the reader feels right at home in the environment. I sent this book to a friend in England. She decided at 10:30pm \\"just to read two chapters to get into it\\" and resurfaced at 2:00am! I can't wait to read the final book--and yet I dread the ending. Since I have the books, I can just start back at the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH WITH THE EXPLICIT SEX !","review":"I found the books for the most part enjoyable. Unfortunately, as with the other Earth's Children books, I was again disappointed to find myself reading (and in the case of the current book, listening to) sexually explict details that should be saved for magazines sold only behind the counter. If not for these graphic passages, which add absolutely nothing to the story line, the books would be a delight to read. In fact, I can see the series being read by preteens and teens alike. The fictional books might even spur a kid's interest in history, geography or anthropology. Auel's books would merit a better rating but for the passages containing detailed sexual content randomly scattered throughout. Okay, some folks enjoy erotica and that's fine -- go to a porn bookstore to get your jollies. The Earth Children Series is a good read without adding gratuitous sex to the mix. So, how about some new editions sans the porno, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Other reviewers were spot on when they mentioned that most of this book was little more than a rehash of previous books. It makes me so sad - the fascination I felt when I first started reading about this world, such as the craft-making, taming of animals, etc. has been stripped away, repetition by repetition. I especially disliked the gratuitous sex scenes that have replaced the warm intimate moments between Ayla and Jondalar. I ended up skipping them to get to more interesting parts, except I found out there weren't very many at all. As I got to the end of the book, I realized I had skipped at least three quarters of the book, because most of it was repetition ad nauseum about Ayla's wonderful character. I used to think Ayla was wonderful too, but she's just not believable anymore ever since she became \\"Super Ayla, Master of the Universe\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long & boring","review":"This long-awaited book is just a long, boring review of Auel's previous books.There's no significant plot, only place descriptions (the same places over and over again), explanations about the animals, firestones and other discoveries (which we already read in detail in previous books), too-explicit sex (not that I mind sex, but I get tired of it), and bad naming skills (if you've managed to get to the end of the book, you'll know what I mean).I'm tired of Ayla being so perfect, of her always ending up within the top-rank people, of her being the smartest person on Earth (I guess she'll eventually invent the wheel), etc.\\"The plains of passage\\" was pretty boring, but it had some thrill in it. \\"The shelters of stone\\" is boring, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T READ AND PRETEND YOUR STILL WAITING!","review":"I had to give it two stars because the years of waiting and hype gave me much more entertainment than the book did. I have yet to read a more dissapointing book. After years of waiting... years of Jean explaing she's taking her time to get it right... and this is the result? You meet Jondalar's people, one by one, and hear again and again (and again) the \\"formal introductions\\", the explanation of wolf, the horses and spear throwers. Most of the \\"new\\" dialogue makes me think it's set in the 1980's. One can overlook the grammatical errors (there are numerous), but they should be an embarrassment to everyone that OK'd the book. I hate to say it, but this is not a good novel. I found myself skipping whole pages just so I could read something that interested me. You can throw out half of this book, and still get bored.I just cannot believe anyone actually read this and said, \\"Jean, this is a wonderful book.\\"WAIT FOR IT IN PAPER BACK... I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down...","review":"...mostly because I kept telling myself, \\"I know there's a plot here somewhere. If I keep looking, I'll run into it any minute.\\" Alas, I was mistaken. Honestly, folks, this book's entire storyline can be summed up in a couple of sentences, and not very interesting ones at that. If Reader's Digest is still doing condensed versions of books, they might be able to make a readable copy of SoS, but, I, for one, have no intention of wading through this mess again. I really enjoyed the first four novels, and my copies of those are in pretty shabby condition from rereading, but this one's going to stay pristine. If you're looking for rich characterization and a top-notch story, try Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series - at least he releases a new one every couple of years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-Historic Nancy Drew meets Kama Sutra","review":"What a disappointment!! I really expected a story, plot & character development after a 12 year wait and 800 pages.

The one good thing that came from this book is that now I don't like any of the characters and really don't care what happens to them! I'm cured!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment of 2002!","review":"I waited 12 years for this?!?Most of the other reviews have said enough. Basically, this is disappointing. I barely was able to slog through it once, and have tried and tried to read it again (unlike the other books, which have been re-read countless times - especially Mammoth Hunters).The book is written as though the author didn't remember details from the other books. Misspelled names...things that just don't jive with what had been established in the other books...and NO PLOT. And don't get me started about the baby's name, or how anticlimatic the Summer Meeting was. Ugh.I can only hope that Book Six is better...however, I will be checking it out of the library rather than shelling out the money...Sad, sad, sad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this took 12 years?","review":"Length, anybody can do. Research is nice, but laundry lists of extant flora and fauna left me skimming. Remedial writing is insulting. Sample: They can go many ways from the top of the path. They can go up. They can go down. The plot? Jondalar and Aylar ended their journey and were mated. Whinney and Ayla had baby girls. I distinctly remember enjoying books one and two. Books three and four began to slide, but I was still with the series. I still cared what was happening and wanted to know more. I hardly ever skimmed. Call me unreasonable, but if it takes somebody a decade to write a book, I expect more. And do I want to wait 12 more years to find out that Ayla becomes the next One Who Comes First of the 9th cave, leaving Jondalar to tend the kids and the hearth? NO. I knew that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Not surprised to see reviews that agreed with mine. Waited over 10 years for this book - loved the first four. Fifth is a re-hash of books 1-4, no depth or richness to characters - very superficial. I kept \\"waiting for it to get good.\\" I periodically re-read the first 4 books simply because they are so complex and always learn something new. Not in this one. Don't see how Ms. Auel can wrap this up in only one more book.

I've been waiting with baited breath for 11 years for this book, and I couldn't be more disappointed. CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR was terrific; VALLEY OF THE HORSES was interesting; THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS was a little disappointing because of all the cavegirl meets caveboy, cavegirl loses caveboy, cavegirl gets caveboy back. But I enjoyed THE PLAINS OF PASSAGE, trying to figure out what part of Europe they must be in.I agree with a reviewer who said that it's amazing that an editor let this stuff fly. It totally pains me to say it, because I was such a fan. The book could have been cut in half if all the endless introductions were left out and the repitious backstory condensed.Even when the story was tired in the other books, I was interested in the healing aspects, the literary suppositions of religion, and the other anthropology insights.It read like a lot of cutting and pasting to me.

The problem is, it lurches forward for something like 700 pages. Ayla has journeyed with Jondalar (her mate) home to his people. All of them have names like Marona, Farona, and my Sharona (sorry about that) and they mostly welcome her. Ayla goes about her usual tall blond medicine woman persona (it's catching) while sharing pleasures with Jondalar, and being the very best cave person she possibly can be. All the while she is tormented that her new family may discover her Neanderthal heritage and tragic past. Let us leave the neolithic Martha Stewart to her pleasures and reread Diana Gabaldon. Forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money! If you must, check it out of the library.","review":"Mrs. Auel did a brilliant job with her first book, Clan of the Cavebear. Having read everything after, it is painfully obvious she was lucky. All the books after bear out the fact that she should have stayed a housewife, and not pretend to be a professional writer. Someone has taught her how to pad a book with repetitive musings by the main character about events from the first book, ad nauseum. With this latest installment, she has perfected the craft of telling very little story while piling on the number of pages to justify the hardback cover price. I think Mrs. Auel ought to be ashamed of herself for putting out such trash. However, I imagine her aim is to pad her bank account better than she has padded her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock formation, rock formation, new character...","review":"Rock formation, rock formation, new character... etc.The sad part is, the rock formations are more interesting than the new characters.

I enjoyed reading about the certain discoveries of Ayla and Jondalar, the descriptions of the landscape, etc. I looked forward to this book for many years, but it did not live up to my expectations.In a 1,000+ page book, the entire goal was to get to the Summer Meeting. It took 700 pages for Jondalar and Ayla to walk into camp, then finally make the journey to the Summer Meeting. What happened in those 700 pages? Not much.However, there were plenty of name recitals: \\"Ayla of the Zelandonii, daughter of the Cave Bear, wife off Jondalar the Traveller and Flint Napper, friend to Whinny and Racer, subject of boring book, creation of Jean Auel\\", etc. My guess is that if you took out all of the name recitals, you could knock 100 pages off the book.Sadly, a tedious and uninteresting book. Auel's done much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would've given it a half star...","review":"if that were available. This was an awful book. I didn't enjoy any portion of it.

I really expected more than a rehash of events, we don't need to spend an entire tome reliving the same old prejudices Ayla had gone through before. I had anticipated a final chapter, with Ayla meeting Durc and her Clan at some point, and living up to a dream she had about Durc and a new child she had meeting on perhaps dangerous ground. Or maybe I just dreamt this plot.

I was so excited when I heard the book was coming out, but like many others, I have been sorely disappointed. Nothing exciting happens. There could have been great conflict with Jondalar's ex or with Brukeval, but there was nothing!! All we had were Ayla and the ever smiling Jondalar (how could one guy smile so much) and a smart ... One Who is First. She was one of the most irritating characters I've read in a long time. She was pushy and a know-it-all, not the spiritual leader one would think. Ayla has become way too wonder womanish. She does it all, and I guess no one else has ever thought of any of these things!

Have I left anything out? I wonder if Jean Auel ever did have anything to offer besides earnestness and a certain tempo. \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" has been blown up with helium four times, each time with less and less content and more and more pages.

The point of view is so spread around I started expecting to see points of view from various animals who happened to see the couple. In her earlier books, she had that tight focus of one or two points of view, which made for more tension and drew the reader into the characters. Not in this one.And the constant repititions of observations and various processes for making things made up at least a third of the book.So I ask - where was her editor?

I found the writing poor and not engaging, character development lacking and far too much time spent on describing, very confusingly, the \\"cave\\" environment and surrounding landscape. Here's a thought...illustrations!! The \\"map\\" inside the covers did not help! This seems to be such an interesting time in human history but Auel fails to really address this fully. The descriptions of how things were done (i.e. cooking, tanning hides, etc.) were great but...as an Art History student I was hoping that she might take the cave art aspect and its possible meanings a bit farther.

She didn't even have a plot to the story! I appreciated her descriptions of the land and the crafts of the people in the other books as it was a part of the story. This time around, the scenery WAS the story. Did Ms. Auel write this book right after Plains of Passage and simply decide to publish it several years later to build a craving for this release?

Take out all the mindless erotica (that I skip anyway and always have), and about half of the flora and fauna descriptions, and every single recitation of the poem, and you will have a 100 page book to segway on to book number 6.

They do not necessarily detract from the book, but they are a slight bit bothersome.I was a touch annoyed by the repetition. I did not mind the author&#65533;s retelling of activities in previous books as there were some points that were not as fresh in my mind. Unfortunately, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers in that there are only so many times you can describe how the horses are tamed or Wolf introduced.Regardless of the two points I mentioned above, I found the story entertaining and anxiously await the next book in the series. Hopefully the wait will not be as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretched too thin","review":"I enjoyed the saga up to the Valley of the Horses, and was a little disppointed by The Plains of Passage. But this last book is nothing but a tedious account of the day-to-day life of some stone age tribe. It is slow, repetitive and boring. In fact it is about the only book I haven't finished in the last ten years.Just a book about the properties of plants."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelters of Stone","review":"What a disappointment! I have always like the anthropology angle of the previous books in the series, but so much is repeated and unecessary I found myself skipping 5-10 pages at a time. This books is a mix between a boring high school text book and a cheap romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"What a disapppointment! This book is tedious, over long and depressingly repetitive as Auel tries to recreate her dream world where everyone is nice to each other almost all the time. As someone who enjoyed the first three books, and sort of enjoyed the fourth (although that could have done with some cutting too), you can give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"how disappointing!","review":"I agree with a lot of the other low reviews of this book. The only good thing about it is that I borrowed it from my local library (doing so in protest of how long it took the author to release the book!) so I didn't actually buy the thing! There was just too much borrowed content from the previous three books, almost as if the author ran out of ideas and took from the previous three in order to fill her quota for the publisher. As a fan of the previous three books, this rehashing was totally unnecessary for much of the borrowed material was hard to forget, even if you hadn't picked up and re-read any of the previous three books in that ten year span it took to finish the series. IF you're a fan of the series and haven't read this book yet but are dying to see how it all ends, I suggest you do what I did and BORROW the book from a library so you can give it back when you're finished!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, a little too much of this!","review":"This book was a disappointment to me in that it became very repetitious, much more than it needed to be. Ayla and Jondalar made their way to his people, and people there don't know what to make of her. The book goes on this way for awhile, and gets monotonous.A lot of scenery is described here as well.This is okay, but then, it just goes on a little too much. It has parts where some of the scenes get exciting, but not too often.When you read this, be prepared to yawn a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing!","review":"Unlike the first books in this series, this book is tedious and repetitious. There is no real story or attention getting point in the whole 900+ pages . Without the long naming greetings and repeated explanations of \\"feelings\\", there is nothing of interest in the book. As an avid reader and also an anthropologist, I found the descriptive passages so trivial as to make me want to stop reading. I only finished it because I was caught on the weekend without anything new to read!The period-- geographic-- descriptions were informative, but still could have ben covered in about ten(10) pages instead of nine hundred (900). I was expecting another great book, but was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing comeback","review":"When I first encountered the Earth's Children series, I was enthralled, and eagerly read the first four books. It was with great anticipation that I picked up the fifth book, all the years later. Talk about a disapointment! Ayla faces no new challenges...it's just the same formulas all over again. The spark has gone from the series. Even the long awaited birth of their child was boring. I hope the sixth book will be better, but I won't be holding my breath. The magic is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Are we almost there?\\"","review":"This yawner reminds me of seemingly endless car trips when I was a kid. Is it really possible that the author of \\"Clan\\" wrote this turkey? - a Paleolithic soap opera drowning in herbal tea and endless introductions. I'm thankful I checked it out from the library instead of wasting [X]+, but I still paid 30+ days of fines to tough it out to the end. I think I'll celebrate reaching the end by brushing my teeth with a twig. (Did Jondalar use mouthwash? I forget.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible disappointment after so long a wait","review":"I have read most of the reviews and agree with most of them that it was a literary disaster.It's difficult to believe that after a twelve year hiatus this was the result. The book is boring ,repeating the saga of the previous books seemingly without end. Much of the story is concerned with repetitive long introductions which do nothing to advance a story line which never develops. Let's finish with the medicinal value of the herbs,the wild animals as pets,the rocks and topography and the startling new weapons. We have been through that in our previous journey with the perfect couple. What I waited for was Ayala's encounter with the clan and her son Durc ; and not an entire story only devoted to family introductions and a summer picnic.It appears the author is losing her focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho-hum","review":"I had to buy this book as soon as I spotted it on the store shelf because I had absolutely loved the first four books of the series. I kept waiting for something significant to happen all the way through the story and was disappointed when nothing did. There was too much repetition throughout the whole book, from the presentation of the characters lengthy formal titles when they were introduced to one another each and every time, to Ayla's flashbacks of her visit to the spirit world with her former clan's mogur, to Zelandoni's Earth Mother's song/poem, and Ayla and Jondular's lovemaking scenarios. I will have no desire to read any more of the series if Jean M. Auel decides to continue with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling short...","review":"The excellence of the first 4 books of this series set my expectations for the 5th book. I however am quite disappointed. The characters/situations/nuances are not nearly as well-developed as in prior books. I agree with other reviewers: it is as if Auel is not even the writer here. I understand that there will be a 6th book in the series. I will consider very carefully before deciding to read the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a prologue? Or just a draft?","review":"I was sadly disappointed, I have been waiting for years for this book and I feel cheated. It looks more like a first scenario which lacks substance (except for the excessive geographic details). I'm not questioning Ms.Auel Research, obviously it's extensive and thorough but this time it doesnt come through as it should and the plot (what there is of it) is sugarly and sketchy. It feels more like a prologue (which it probably is) to a new book, at the end you are left with a lot of loose ends, nothing is settled or properly developed. All in all a terrible let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong here?","review":"Where was the plot? Where was the drama? Where are the fantastic love scenes? I loved Jean Auel's first four novels and I highly recommend them to anyone but \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I feel like I got taken to the cleaners. Twenty years since the last sequel and this is the best Jean can come up with? She should have already retired.The book did so much rehashing of previous plots I wanted to scream. The Mother song got way up on my last good nerve.All of the new material could have been placed in one short story. What a giant disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"Like many readers of the Earth's Children Series, I waited long years for this book to be released. I even took the time to reread the four previous books. I should have stopped after reading Mammoth Hunters. The plot lines ran the same course in Shelters. I was not pleased with Plains of Passage due to the transitory nature of the book and was hoping this would \\"pep\\" back up the series. If this is what we can expect from Ayla and friends in the future, I would aviod subsequent works. The one bright spot was the hint that the next book might provide something new. How many years will we wait and see this time? I should have been reading my copy of Hansen and Kwaler's \\"Stellar Interiors\\" for class. It would have been more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited 6 years for this!!??","review":"I would like to begin by saying I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the entire \\"Clan\\" series. That was up until \\"Shelters of Stone\\". I was almost entirely let down by this book due to the fact that I waited almost 6 years to read the next saga in Ayla's life. The book seemed to lacked the heart and soul of the other books, especially \\"Valley of Horses\\". I felt like she almost didn't know what to write about and all the characters and description, including Jondalar,Wolf, the horses, and even the food that had been such a big part of the previous 3 books, were forgotten about and she was trying to build and/or change Ayla into almost another character. I did enjoy the ending and I was starting to get into it. Maybe the next book will be better; here's to hoping for the next 6 years!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been so much better...","review":"The problem with this book, is that there was no way that Ayla could have met all those people at one time. So we are forced to live through the formal introductions and stating of family ties and titles ad nauseum. We are forced to read and re-read the same scenes each and every time someone meets Wolf or the horses. If that weren't problem enough, we are also forced to suffer through the telling and re-telling (to many different people) of the death of Thonolan and various other events that took place in other books....I was so disapointed with this book. However, I am still glad I bought it and have a complete collection of the series. Let us keep a positive hope that the final book of the series will return us to the Auel writing style that we all love.I agree with everyone else about that \\"mother\\" song. Oh my gosh..... get rid of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing!","review":"The first 4 books in Jean Auel's series captured my interest and attention totally (they were originally recommended to me by my daughter), and I looked forward to this latest volume. As I have, for some years, been in the habit of writing thumbnail reviews of all books I read into my 'Booklover's Journal,' I thought I might share my entry for THE SHELTERS OF STONE with anyone who might care to read it:Following Auel's earlier works, this diatribe was a HUGE disappointment. The novel reads as if the author had been paid by the word. It is BORING, to say the least.Auel uses totally unrealistic dialogue with her characters...and often useless repetition! It is a highly unsatisfying read, and words shouldn't even be wasted on criticizing it. It is truly a waste of time (at 753 pages). Which is probably why I started 'skimming' at Page 200.I doubt, Ms Auel will have me buying the next instalment..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"I am only 3/4 of the way through this book and had to check out other readers' opinion. Yes, most everyone else like me think this book is a BIG disappointment. I've kept going hoping a plot, a climax (not Ayla's) would develop but it looks hopeless. Thanks to other reviewers comments I now know it ain't gonna happen. I'm not a writer but I think even I could have come up with a decent plot, like...the Zelandonii, Ayla, and Jondalar all in a conflict with the Clan -- Ayla meeting Durc -- Wolf biting Zelandoni's hand and she hauls off and wacks him -- something please happen to end this boredom!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed","review":"I wasn't far into this book when I found myself thinking this wasn't Jean Auel writing it. I was very disappointed, I kept thinking SOMETHING was going to bloom into excitement but every scene fell flat. I really think someone besides Auel wrote this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Loved her earlier books and eagerly bought this one. By the time I plodded half way through I had a mental picture of someone learning to cut and paste. The endless repetition of the introductions, and the word Zelandoni, became most annoying. After 700 and some pages you realize the story could have been told in a couple of chapters. Wish I'd just borrowed it from the library. I respect her extensive research but it might have been better appreciated in a non fiction form, as we were hoping for more of a story. More editing next time might help."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was somewhat bored","review":"I am a huge fan of the Auel series. I was disappointed with this sequel. Not only was there a lot of repitition but no controversy or passion that made the other four books excellent.I wanted controversy not a prelude to the 6th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I can't believe this book was written my Jean Auel. I was very disappointed. It was so repetative it made you think she must have been contracted to write a certain number of pages, and with no real story line, the pages were filled with eleborate descriptions of caves, long introductions using every association the character has in their name, and the Mother Earth's song over and over and over. I read each and every description, thinking surely there was something about this one that was pertinant to the story............ waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this book","review":"I just started reading these books this year and have enjoyed them very much. I know shelters of stone is a little repetitive but I think it is one of my favorite ones. After reading four of them doesn't hurt to review alittle.

Am looking forward to starting on last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I kept waiting to get to the interesting parts, but they never came!

Awaiting the final in the series. been a fan of the series for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"The never ending story","review":"All English teachers will agree that detail within a story is a must. They will also agree that there is a point where the detail is no longer helpful but, instead, becomes a nuisance. Jean M. Auel's detail of Ayla's surroundings quickly surpassed the category of descriptive writing and entered the ranks of A Bushman's Guide To Nature. I am Only a high school student but it doesn't take a professional to recognize a disaster. The story is slow and filled with useless detail. All in all I feel that Jean M. Auel should abandon any interests she may have in continuing with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of stone","review":"Jean Auel had no story in mind when she wrote this book. Her first two were excellent but this one and the previous are dribble. If I could, I would get a refund. For sure, I'll never buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again","review":"I read all the others. They were preposterous but fun - Superwoman meets the Flintstones. This was repetitious drivel and drugery. I'll not be reading the sixth - ever"},{"rating":"1","title":"This took ten years!!!!!","review":"I waited anxiously 10 years for this book to come out. What a waste of emotion & time. The story moves at a pace similar to wood petrifying. Does Auel think her readers are all stupid? She must, she repeats & repeats Ayla's & everyone elses series of names, repeats not once, but over & over how each discovery was made (like using flint for fire or the sewing needle) or why Wolf is tame & how terrified Jondolar's people are when they see him. I also thought this was the last book. I guess it's hard to give up a cash machine like this series. I for one will not be making anymore deposits.This is my last Auel purchase. Hey Jean, reread one of your first books and go back to that imaginative, fast moving, action filled format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a first draft","review":"I am listening to the book on tape. It has all the hallmarks of a book that was paid for by the word. Every detail has to be repeated in excruitiating detail. And the assumptions about peoples naivtae about animal husbandry and animal behavior are just not believable. Wolves would not be novel items around settlements, and would not be as well trained just one generation out of the wild. Not believable is to put it mildly. This book reads as if it is a first draft and was never reread by the author. Shame on you Jean Auel. Clan of the cave bear was a brilliant idea. This is book reads as if you were tired of the story and paid by the word. Give it up. Start a different story. Make up something new. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I LOVED this series, until I got to this book. To tell you how bored I was with this book, it took me almost a year to read it, and I normally can read a book that size in about 3 days. Needless to say, I found the storyline extrememly dry, and the conflicts she had to deal with never amounted to anything. Granted, some of this may come to a head in the next and last book, but for this book, there just wasn't anything to keep my interest. Towards the end of the book I became slightly more intrigued as to what would be happening to the characters, but in a book of this length it shouldn't take that long to get interesting. All in all, I am highly disappointed in this book. I have hopes that the next book will be more stimulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more thing I want to add...","review":"...Egads, what a let-down.I won't repeat the criticisms so eloquently conveyed in the other reviews on this page (99 percent of which I agree with, especially the ones that point out that Auel smuggles in a geography lesson and calls it a story because she couldn't come up with one), but I would like to add one point of my own about why I'm so disappointed:After 4 books of being told how Jondalar's people won't accept a woman who had borne the child of a \\"flathead\\" and dreading the struggles she would face when she finally arrived, we find these Zelandonocrats to be a California-style culture who receive the news with a shrug and a \\"whatever\\" attitude, and now it's time for Lamaze class. They'll probably invent the analyst's couch and liposuction before they get around to inventing the wheel.And I waited 12 years for this? Come on, Jean, I know you can do better. Can't you???"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I anxiously awaited Book 5 for several years after reading the first four, all of which I really enjoyed. The story started off ok (more of the same), but included waaaaay too many recaps. I assume most readers have already read the first four books, and probably didn't enjoy this either. The second half (or two-thirds maybe?) of the book were not good. The story was rushed, missing detail and left me wondering if it was even written by Jean Auel, or if she handed it off to someone else to finish it in time for the release. Overall, not worth it. Clan of the Cave Bears will always be the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited too long, and not worth while","review":"I hurried through the 4th book, to recall the story, since the last time I had read it was a couple of years ago. It wasn't necessary. Auel goes over what happened in the previous books SO MANY TIMES, it barely is necessary to have read them. And for those who want to know what comes next, this book seems to add nothing to the story. We know that Ayla will have to retell what happened to her many times, but it bored me to read it all over again and so many times. There is too much detail to things that happened in the other books, and no detail to what is happening now. And a lot goes unexplained, like why Laramar's son was injured, why was he in a fight. There is no depth to the the present story, too much \\"remembering\\" what happened to Ayla and Jondalar before. I really want to read the next book, since this one went knowwhere, but I hope there is more story to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having not read the first four books...","review":"I found this book fairly interesting; for the first half, anyway. After reading a few reviews, my thoughts that this book simply rehashed the previous four were comfirmed. There was too much emphasis on how brilliant and beautiful Ayla was, and how spectacular her control of animals was; I got the idea after the first ten times. My hopes for this book were dashed by the time I finished it. All of the foreshadowing was for naught; tensions were built, and then forgotten about. Discoveries or decisions were hinted at, but never reached. The end of the book seemed rushed; events that were built up to be important were completely left out of the book, as opposed to excessive detail in the beginning (which I am a sucker for). In short: if you read the first four books, or plan to, do not read this one. If you've read this one, you've practically read the first four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I waited 12 years for Ayla, and this book was a total disappointment. Nothing new happened, no new feelings, no new inventions, no new animals, no interesting story. Just a retteling of the previous books and a very expected meeting with the Zeladonii. Even the baby is only barely mentioned. I almost gave up in the middle it was so boring. I read the bad reviews and refused to beleive it, but if I hear bad review on 6 (who knows how long it will take to come out) I'm not going to read it. 1,2,3,4 were amazing. Jean, what happened to the magic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it's Over","review":"12 years of anticipation; 3 days of disappointment. Out of 750 pages, about 300 of them may have contained new material, and as others here have noted, even that was less than compelling. However, I wasn't crazy about The Valley of the Horses, either. I skipped almost all the chapters with Jon and Thon (and was thankful that it was split up like that so that I could easily bypass those parts) and was also bored with large sections of Plains of Passage. I appreciate how much research went into Auel's descriptions of flint tool making and of the flora and fauna of the epoch, but honestly... enough already.I think at this point, I'd like to see Ayla assert her otherwordly power and really freak people out, but that's unlikely. She will likely turn out to be the benevolent queen of the Zelandoni with the handsome King Jondalar at her side, and little Princess Jonayla (puh-leez).That said, I'll hope for better things from the last book because I am an eternal optimist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Earth Mother cried at how many trees died to create this drivel","review":"Like many other reviewers, I have read all of the novels in this series, and have found the quality of the writing (and editing) falls off dramatically after the 3rd book. I slogged through this one only because I wanted to see what advances the plot might take. Very few, indeed. Ayla is perfect; Jondalar is the perfect man; they are both so great, la la la.. The fourth book was painful to read, and should have been subtitled (My thesis on plant life in Neolithic Europe), but this was just awful. I honestly can't say if I care enough to read the \\"final\\" novel. What else could happen in it, except maybe Jondalar accidentally discovers how to create iron, and Ayla has a dream where Creb teaches her how to begin purposeful cultivation of plants, so that they are the \\"Parents of Modern Civilization\\" ???

I am very disappointed in the book, but will continue to have high hopes for the conclusion of the series.My harshest criticism is of the sentence structure throughout the book. The writer did a poor job of portraying \\"cave-man style\\" conversation or speaking. Two sentences run together, separated by a comma do not depict primitive language or thought, and I do not remember seeing this in Ms. Auel's other books.Also, I resent stumbling over explicit sex in a book which I have chosen for reasons other than hot sex or romance. If you must, one explicit scene would be quite enough, and any other occasion to include romance or intimacy could be handled differently.I could not recommend this book to anyone, but strongly encourage everyone to read The Clan of the Cave Bear, Passage of the Plains, Valley of the Horses, and Mammoth Hunter. They were 100% superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelters of Stone","review":"A total disappointment. I bought the book hoping that the authorhad returned to the wonderful storytelling skill she demonstrated in The Clan of the Cave Bear and the Valley of the Horses. By the time of her fourth book, The Plains of Passage she had almost abandoned the story and was so dedicated to flora and fauna that it was hard to read the book. The Shelters of Stone is even less interesting than the previous book. If you took out the part that was devoted to the characters that I wanted to read about the book would be only a few pages. Jean Auel either needs to get back on track or she should start writing educational textbooks.

Her first books were fabulous this was a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have trouble believing Jean Auel wrote this. Its missing all the story telling qualities of the first 4 books. Its almost a kindergarten version.

I was very disappointed because it was so boring and repetitive. Where was the plot? I kept thinking that Ayla was going to decide to search for her son, Durc or that there would be an encounter with the \\"flatheads\\" and Ayla would have to act as an interpreter.

Please believe everyone who hated this book. What did they, glue all the previous books together? Really, the original content could maybe fill a page. The thing is, aside from the repetition and ridiculous amount of boring dialog, is that there just isn't a story here. I didn't think much of The Plains of Passage, but it least it had the man-hating tyrant and Ayla's rescue of Jondalar. There is nothing exciting in the book. Ayla's enemies sort of fade off into nothing. Like maybe something will happen in the 6th book, but really it won't be worth the paper it's printed on.Buy it (in paperback) and read it because you love Ayla (though she is less humble in this one).

As such, SoS is currently proping up a short table leg.Jean Auel's \\"Earth's Children\\" series has simply declined in quality since the publication of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" \\"Shelters of Stone\\" is the penultimate book of the series and by far the least interesting and most repetitive of the bunch. There is no balance between plot/action and the excessive descriptions of flora and fauna; the characters are predictable and the dialogue insipid.Everything a reader needs to know about what happens to the characters can be read in the Amazon.com reviews. Instead of wasting my time and money with the final book, I'll be reading here to find out what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"21st Century Caveland","review":"WOW, over 700 pages of tea drinking, 5 minute formal introductions for every personal encounter, 21st century medicine and anatomy lessons, social welfare reform, and Giorgio fashion statements. Also noteworthy to mention are the condo living arrangements, wine and Tupperware parties, oral hygiene practices, and western Christian ceremonies for deaths and weddings. I loved the parts that told the spirits to \\"go to the light\\" or they \\"tied the knot\\" and were mated. All of this knowledge of humanity, medicine, art, and civilization and they still can't figure our how babies are made. Go figure!I only finished this book because I waited 12 years for the continued saga. What a waste of time. I skimmed over pages of pure bunk including ceremonial songs and chants. Ayla is of course WONDERFUL. Without her, I guess we would still be swinging from the trees.Wait for the paperback to show up at Goodwill for a dime, then it might be a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointing!","review":"One star is half a star too many. We waited over ten years for this book and paid full price for the hardcover as soon as it came out. What is up with that looong boring song being printed over and over in it? The book could have been half as long without that. And as far as the story, the previous books hint that Ayla's child is going to be a boy and that there will be some sort of confrontation between her two sons. No chance of that happening judging by the ending..."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the story","review":"the only thing i have to say about this book is it [was bad]. what happened to the story. i was completly lost by the end of this book. i had read all the other book and enjoyed them but this one i just [disliked]..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored","review":"I eagerly awaited this book and- flop. It's so old! It's really the plotline from \\"Plains of Passage\\" and \\"Mammoth Hunters\\" redone with new characters. Ayla meets lots of people, people are afraid of her inventions and animals, people begin to understand, one person refuses to be friendly with Ayla. Yeah, we know. And the whole thing with her hallucinations being \\"special\\". If Ayla was a modern woman she would be in constant therapy because of those. EVERYTHING HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN!And Jondalar. The sex scenes are so...graphic. And he's such a sexaholic! Thonolan seemed so much more in-depth as a character. Jondalar is a pretty boy, the end. It would have worked out as more interesting if Ayla were only average looking like a mortal, for god's sake. I hate Jondalar now. He's horrible. And, I'm sorry, do we need to know of his \\"eager member\\" or whatever she calls it?Ugh.I'm utterly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"There is but one word to describe this 5th volume of Auel's Earth's Children series: boooring! What a disappointment! Potential readers should buy instead a decent cultural anthropology text. It would be no less tedious to read and might even yield some valid information."},{"rating":"1","title":"...pass the prehistoric hootch, please!","review":"Dreary book that advances the story very little. The settlement Ayla ends up in reminds me very much of some sort of prehistoric country club where mate-swapping looms on the horizon and everybody drinks alcoholic barma during dawn-of-man cocktail hour. The story of the taming of Wolf and Whinney is told repeatedly and the recitation of the \\"Mothers Song\\" seems to appear every few pages and makes one yearn for a male deity to show up. Save your money and get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Paperback","review":"If you are a fan of the past 4 volumes, please wait and read the paperback...then you may skip the majority of the book as none of the characters are developed, it is a total rehash of the past four books, and it lacks Jean Auel normal details....it reads more like a Danielle Steele novel than the Earth Children Series I have loved for almost 20 years. There was not nearly enough character development nor excitement...my own imagination has been better than this total waste of time. I adore these books but this was not worth waiting 12 years for...it either needed to be longer or have some characters cut or something! Huge disappointment! Will not be nearly as excited about the next one even though it is the final one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler Alert! Nothing Happens.","review":"Nothing happens. That's pretty much my review. I waited 30 years to finish this series and discover how Ayla changes the world. I'll just say it is something she claimed from book one so there was no big epithany.In this book, instead of skipping long pages of descriptions of herbs and their uses, I skipped over long pages of descriptions of the paths that they followed on their journey and the pictures in the one too many caves they visited.I was disappointed that there were several plot lines left unfinished: What happened to Ayla's son? I expected them to meet again since there were other Clan characters in the last books. Did her daughter carry Ayla's wisdom and bring even more learning to mankind?It pains me to write this review but my advise is to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition full of errors","review":"I purchased the kindle edition of this book a few days ago and have been disappointed to find it full of typos, misspellings and wrong words that frequently change the meaning of a sentence so that I have to read it several times figuring out what the error is. This edition even has the name of Ayla's son Durc wrong, printing it as \\"Dure.\\" This is not the quality I have come to expect from the kindle editions of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, sad, sad day","review":"Blah.I don't really know what to say.As someone who has a degree in anthropology, I actually love the detail that has always been heavily present in these books. I *like* the \\"boring\\" bits. But this was far, far worse than I could ever imagine. Repetition. No, none, zero conflict. Cardboard characters. No plot. The last 40-odd pages sounded more like the Auel we all know and love, but those cannot possibly justify the 700 pages of junk. The only element in that huge section that got me truly excited was Ayla's (inevitable) discovery of the cave that we know today as Lascaux.I was 14 when I finished the series that gave me an inkling about what I wanted to study in college...I'm now 25. And I'm horribly disappointed and heartsick. Jean Auel, what were you thinking??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete shame..","review":"After waiting so long for the next installment it is sad that this is the best we get. I am so disappointed. I kept reading the book waiting for something, anything, to happen. The story never got off the ground, the charactors were flat and at no time inspired my imagination as the previous books had done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it ain't so, Jean","review":"As a fan excitedly anticipating this book, I couldn't wait to preorder and open it the day it arrived from Amazon. After reading one third of the story, I was ready to give up and use this 700-pager as a doorstop. Reading these reviews has actually been much more entertaining than the book itself. Ayla is so perfect and so Nancy Drew-nice, I want to smack her. I wish Jondalar would get bored himself and have an affair with a bad girl. And please, Jean, no description of minute-by-minute walking around and looking at scenery or conversational minutiae - it's BORING!! Your other books have been wonderful. Please get back the the exciting adventure and your readers will applaud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"This really is a dreadful book. It's all setting, no plot. To save you the time, here's what happens: Ayla and hubby arrive at his hometown; Ayla demonstrates all her inventions; Ayla has baby. Yes, sportsfans, that's 750 pages worth! The book is hideously repetitive. If Ayla had shown off her Thread-Puller one more time, or if she enjoyed Pleasures with Jondalar again, I think I would have tossed my cookies. I wish Auel had written instead an anthropological treatise on early human life in southern France; that's what she's really interested in anyway. Definitely pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"741 pages of nothing","review":"I would have thought it impossible to write a 741 page book and manage to say absolutely nothing. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cover how I feel about having spent good money on this book. I should've waited for the paperback edition, because then, at least, I could've traded it in at my book club. Repetition from the previous books in the series, coupled with reiterating passages from this worthless volume, made me skip several pages in disgust. In short, skip this one... you won't miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving","review":"I don't understand why it took Ms. Auel so long to write this book. Almost half of it is either a rehashing of what took place in earlier books or the same thing happening over and over again in this book. The plot also does not advance much. She spends many pages describing the imaginary scenery, which seems beautiful but not necessary to the story. She does introduce many characters, but the character development is limited to only a select few. Indeed, a character introduced early on who appears to be a main protagonist, is then summarily dropped except for a couple of casual mentions 400 pages later. Finally, large spans of time are allowed to proceed without any text. All of a sudden a whole season goes by with only 50 or so pages of text. The book did progress the story, but the same amount of progression could have been done in 100 pages. It feels as if this book was just filler till the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"And now for the rest of the story...","review":"After finishing \\"Plains of Passage\\" years ago, I closed the book thinking that there was so much more I wanted to know. Frankly, I had the same impression after finishing \\"Shelters of Stone\\". This is not necessarily a criticism, but a caution for those people who like everything tied up neatly at the end of a book.It almost seems that Jean Auel may have written two books worth of material, and just broke this off at a convienent stopping point. There is still more of the story to be told, and I'm looking forward to it. The characters are still compelling and the description of prehistoric living is interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could I would give it NO stars","review":"I can't believe I read this. What a waste. I echo what other reviewers have written.Padantic sex scenes, boring characters and no plot. These people just meander through the same stories and plots of the previous books, only with different names.Where was editorial?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have made a good short story","review":"As usual Ms Auel repeats herself constantly, telling you the same thing she went through a few chapters ago. Again we hear of his blue eyes and her accent on almost every page. Ayla's history is repeated over and over again. ... The average reader will not remember that this is 99% pure fantasy and 1% fact on the artifacts. Perhaps Ms Auel's next book should be Science Fiction where her mix of customs and language would not be so jarring. Put it on another planet and it might be more digestable."},{"rating":"1","title":"shelters of stone","review":"Like so many others, I was anxious to read Jean Auel's new book. How very disappointing. Where oh where was the editor? It wasn't just the repetitions from previous books; but repetitions from 3 pages back that were jarring. If you've enjoyed this series, skip this book and see if she can do any better on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"I too read all of Jean M. Auels' previous novels and while I LOVED, LOVED The Clan of the Cave Bear each successive book went downhill. However, I wasn't quite prepared for the lengthy, wordy, descriptive (ad nauseum) story in her latest effort. I agree her research is intense and obviously feels very strongly about it but I wanted to read this book for a fun summer read, not a lecture on prehistoric man/woman. I also agree with a previous review, the characters are very one dimensional - the good people are good and the bad people are bad. I am loathe to put a book down once I start it, however I was tempted many times with this one. Now that I have finally finished it, I have no plans to read any future installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor???????","review":"I kept doggedly reading, hoping to return to the storyteller I had found in the first 4 books. Never happened. Was there an editor? Ayla's story deserves to be told without endless repetition of descriptions of scenery, introductions to characters that are never developed, and story lines that are started and then dropped without any explanation. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to put it down","review":"I imagine it is not fair of me to review a book I had no desire to continue with... And it is so rare for me NOT to labor on with a book searching for whatever is redeeming within its bindings...but in this case, I agree completely with the reviewer missingtexas. The writing style is monotonous, I could care less about the characters, and the larger themes and \\"issues\\" e.g. racial discrimination of \\"flatheads\\" as reflection of our current societies ills was so contrived. Insultingly simple, irretrievably dull!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"i found this book very interesting and exciting, as i actually read this fisrt, due to my mum thinking it was the first in the series. i think other people might have found it slightly boring because it focuses totally on jondalars people and how Ayla interacts, yet this is in a way the same as the first book of the series (which i've now read), as that focused on how she interacted with the Clan. i would reccomend this to anyone who has read the other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited so long....","review":"I bought the whole series (The Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters, Plains of Passage, The Shelters of Stone) so I could relive the excitement I felt when I first read them years ago. By the time I finished the Plains of Passage, I was getting bored with the repetition. Then I started Shelters and was so disappointed I wanted to scream, it was worse! Much worse! How many times do we have to hear the Iza taught Ayla to wash after sex? This book was a disappointment. I hope Ms. Auel doesn't rely on previous material in the final book of the series to fill in the space between the covers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been had!!!","review":"I am only half way through, and probably will not finish!!This is a big disapointment. Ms Auel seems to tout the French aspect of this book by the wine, the cusine, the erotic sex and the advanced vocabulary!!The ploy of waiting so long to publish this book has made her a LOT of money. Personally I would like a refund!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"After waiting 11 years I was really disappointed. It seemed that everytime someone new was introduced, it took three paragraphs to tell who they were. Maybe Jean Auel will have another book out in about 20 years and by then I won't be around to read it. A very drawn out tale, not what I had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing!","review":"This book is equivalent to my 6th grader's book report.

I have no idea as to what the point of this book is! It is slow, overly attentive to detail, and oversimplifies the obvious.

Life is way to short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Jean Auel Fan","review":"I'm sorry. This book was a real disappointment. I read and then reread ALL of Auel's books as I would await the next book(s). When I saw the size of the latest I was just SURE it would be full of new adventures and stories of Ayla & Jondolar. But that was not the case. I found the book to be uninteresting and dull in comparison to her previous 4 books.Actually, I was left with a feeling that Jean Auel did not write this book. The first 4 books left me always waiting for the next book. Not so with this book.Jean Auel could have summed up what happened in this entire book inside of two chapters. Don't know what happened to her style or her story. Like I said earlier . . . I just don't believe she wrote this book.What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Expectations - but","review":"I couldn't bring myself to get past the first hundred pages.

It is as wonderful as the four previous books. Since I have always loved history, it is wonderful to learn about parts of the world, old and new, through wonderful stories like this. While I know the characters are fiction, I know she has written wonderful descriptions about how the world must have been in that time period. Thank you, Jean, I can hardly wait for the next one. Please don't make us wait as long as we have for this one.I can only say, read the book, you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throbbing manhoods and geology lessons","review":"After a long wait, Shelters of Stone is a disappointment. I wait and wait for a plot to develop, but most of the words involve Jondalar's throbbing manhood (O spare me), Ayla's oral fixation on the said manhood, lengthy geological lectures, rambling landscape narratives, the same-old-same-old surprises that surprise everyone who meets this surprising woman, the repetition of facts (as if either the author forgot she mentioned things two pages earlier, or she believes the reader has forgotten), those rotten spear throwers appearing fifteen times (with people always being surprised), Ayla developing society and modern technology single-handedly (in the next volume does she invent Glad Wrap and the TCP-IP protocol?), and the poor Wolf and horses who (of course) surprise people and fill them with wonder every time they appear. Really, Jean: is there anything in this fat tome that has not already appeared a dozen times in the previous volumes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel Fatigue","review":"It was like seeing \\"The Phantom Menace\\"--you wanted to like it, you tried to like it, but halfway through you realize you just want to finish it because you've waited so long for it. Nothing really compelling here. It feels like an in-between story, a filler, except it's 700 pages long! Unlike the previous books, which would keep me up till the wee hours (even with a full days work the next day) immersed in another place, another time, this one can be read with one eye on the TV and you won't miss much.It's too bad because so many of us have anticipated this book with good feelings for so long and would have been generous in our reviews had we been given a little more than the bone thrown at us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive","review":"I waited twelve years for this? I have loved Ms. Auel's other books, but this one is a great disappointment.It reminded me of a child that had to do a 1,000 word essay and could only find 200 words for the essay. I found myself skipping several pages at a time because I was tired of reading the same thing repeatedly. It seems as if Ms. Auel has forgotten how to fill out the people in her books and make them seem real as she has in past books. With her previous books I could not put them down until I had finished them, not even to sleep, but with this book I found myself forcing myself just to read a few pages at a time, I just kept thinking it has to get better, but it didn't. I can only hope that she recaptures her old style and that book six is much better than book five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was anxiously waiting (and waiting and waiting) for this book to come out. When I started reading the series I was completely hooked. I've read and re-read all four books and they are wonderful, imaginative and flat out good stories.Shelters of Stone was like expecting a big thick slice of rich chocolate cake and being served a whole wheat cracker. All I could think was \\"It took over 11 years to come out with THIS?\\" Quite simply, it was boring. I agree with others on how repetitive the book was. It was just not up to par with the others. Or even close.I bought this book in hardcover because I assumed I would love it and want to read it numerous times. With book 6 (if there ever is one), I will wait for the paperback. Or better yet, pick it up from the local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't Jean's publisher help out?","review":"I enjoyed every one of Jean Auel's books until now. This book was all set up and NO plot. Even though some possible action was hinted at throughout the book, NOTHING happened.

I have fond memories of reading clan as a 10 year old, but on re-reading that I have to say it now seemed flawed and unusually silly to me. The ludicrous perfection of Ayla's character is present even in the early novel, and I now find myself wondering how much of Shelters poor reception is due to its audience maturing and increasing in literary awareness over the long Aul-less years, and how much is due to the (undoubted) lower quality of the writing herein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let-down","review":"After waiting all these years to finally finish the story of Ayla and Jondalar, I am severely disappointed in the fifth book in the Earth's Children series. I loved the first four books but found myself actually skipping pages in this one. I was skipping pages not because I was so excited, but because I was trying to find something to keep me interested. That dreadful song/psalm/poem nearly killed me. I do hope that Ms. Auel will not feel she has to retell the major points of her previous five books when she writes the sixth installment of the series. This book was too long. \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is only 468 pages long and it is a great story. Instead of writing another epic 700+ page novel, maybe the next book will be a little less long-winded and a little quicker in coming, too. I gave the book two stars but you can see I am already anxious for the next part of the story to be told. Please, Ms. Auel, just keep it simple next time.

The interpersonal relationships set in the backdrop of primordal Europe has been the backbone of the series. I grew weary of the landscape descriptions, of every river and creek and inlet having to be named and explaining why they were named that. There was so little of the people of the Ninth Cave, I expected to be let into their hearths to see their impression of Ayla and her animals, new inovations, etc. Instead the only thing we find out is that every man is envious of Jondalar and every woman is envious of Ayla.

What an awful follow up to what was such a promising story. This book was dreadful, trite, boring, and it took a supreme effort for me to even finish it the first time.

I had become a fan after reading the first book and although some of the ones that followed were less well written I had great hopes for this one. I was disappointed. I kept waiting for something to happen that never did. No problems were overcome nor dangers survived. Boring. I got to the point where if I read one more line about how great Ayla is I thought I'd choke. About the best thing I can say is it's nice she finally has what she's always wanted.

The repeating of all names and ties and putting in lyrics to silly, long songs was not a creative way to take up space -- she should have made this book shorter. This effort was a major disappointment. The author gives the impression that this book was done purely for the profit margin, not the integrity of the story.As for the story line itself, it is ok -- but never finishes anything like the contest of wills between Ayla and Marona, or the drunk, or the 'mixed-spirits' guy...and that fact that Ayla is practically forced into their preisthood after repeatedly saying no, and in the past not liking the spiritual stuff, is really just stupid and out of character for her.While I hope it doesn't take 10 years for the last one, I won't be rushing to buy it in hardcover either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the story but the Kindle edition has errors","review":"I love the Earth's Children series but I'm a bit disappointed in the quality of the Kindle editions. Seems to me that there was little, if any, proofreading done before release. I have found numerous errors, the most annoying being the use of completely wrong words. These words are spelled correctly, which is why a spell-check would not have picked them up, but the word itself is not correct and makes no sense in the sentence in which it appears. Haphazard capitalization and strange hyphenations also exist (in this and the other books in the series).I love my Kindle but I wish that the ebooks were checked more carefully before Amazon releases them for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing Shelters of Stone","review":"This book was a great let down.

It was sad that the story line which was hinted at in the last book is not fully explored in this book. What a waste of money, check it out of the library before you decide to spend some cold hard cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda let down","review":"I have waited a long time for this book. I loved her other EC books. This one is almost boring and repetative. When I am reading a page it feels like I just read the same page 10 pages ago. Or so much description is layed out for the scenery, the story seems lost. I think this book could have been written in half as many pages. I understand these places are real, but I almst feel like I am getting a geography lesson. I did enjoy knowing what happened to Ayla and Jondalar, but I did not not enjoy this book as much as the other EC books."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's really no plot","review":"I, like most of the posters here, really loved Jean Auel's earlier novels. Even the slower... ones like Valley of the Horses or the Mammoth Hunters had a regular plot and exciting passages, along side Auel's continous and constant pre-historic lore. (And I thought Plains of Passage was just downright thrilling)But the problem is that this book has almost no plot. Like many people noted the book is one big continous loop. Many of the conversations between the characters were better left up to the fan's imagination. (Such as the meeting between Ayla and Marona). Even Ayla, at some point in the novel notes a repetion from a previous novel (\\"Are we going to have to give him a firestore like Frebec?\\").One would have liked to see more conflict. It didn't have to be this bland.There is one good thing about this novel is that it seems to be setting up (one would hope) a more exciting sequel, and Auel has promised that it will come out relatively soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give it ZERO stars if Amazon gave me the choice","review":"As epic and as captivating as the previous books in the \\"Earth Children's Series\\" were, it's hard to believe that Jean Auel could so utterly miss the mark in this long, boring, and painfully uninspired installment. When most of your time is spent referencing an appendix at the back of the book to keep the 80+ characters straight in your head, when you close the book thinking it could've been a good 400 pages shorter without editing out any of the genuinely good writing, and when you ultimately walk away thinking to yourself, \\"I waited 12 years for THIS?\\" you're bound to be disappointed.If well-written epic women's fiction is what interests you most, then do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Before you're brainwashed into thinking THE SHELTERS OF STONE is anything beyond a colordul doorstop, pick up some backlist Jean Auel, the Diana Gabaldon \\"Outlander\\" books, or anything by Dorothy Dunnett to remind yourself what good writing really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"...The writing style in Plains of Passage and, now, in The Shelters of Stone, has become repetitive and tedious. Ms. Auel's first three books were great reading--good storylines that kept the reader's attention. The last two books have taken on a decidedly different writing tone. Plains of Passage and Shelters of the Stone could have been condensed into one good book instead of two mediocre ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been a 100 page novel","review":"The book had too much \\"padding\\" in my opinion and would have made a good shorter book. Also, for those of us following the \\"earth children\\" series I found that the book was really more concerned with the thoughts and feelings of other characters (notably Zolena) rather than Ayla. I even thought that some of Ayla's behaviour was out of character - she hardly ever took a lead role in the book and was too subordinate to Zolena - she should have been much more of an equal (since actually Ayla was much more advanced) despite her natural modesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Retelling of the first 4 book....over and over and over","review":"I too waited for this book to come out. I bought the book and made myself comfortable to become submersed in the book as I had with the others. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The book was 600+ pages of retelling of the first 4 books with another 150+ pages of death/funeral rituals thrown in for good measure.I was looking for a good story with great desciptions of the characters and location - in short I was looking to excape reality of life for awhile. Instead I found myself hard pressed to become engaged by it.I will be waiting for the next one - hoping that Ms Auel can get back in the swing of things......"},{"rating":"1","title":"next one needs to be much better","review":"This is not the worst book that I have ever read, but it takes a close second. The dialog is dry and uninteresting, the settings don't change, and there aren't enough descriptions of the area. The sense of looking for something is missing, which is what made the first four books so good. But the worst part of the entire book are the long, drawn-out love scenes. I was one of the many people who were waiting at the door of the book store for our reserved copies. If you havn't bought it yet, wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelters of Stone","review":"I have readed this book over and over. Where is the story? Where is the plot? Did I miss something, or was it just not there? Did Jean realy write this book? Boy I hope not, because if she did after 10 years she has lost it.On the book cover it said \\" Jean Auel is at her very best in this superbly textured creation of prehistoric society.\\" Sorry Ms Auel but you miss it by a mile. Better luck next time.Please take your time and go back and read your first book and try to get the magic back before you write #6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"I have read all of Jean Auel's books and this was the most poorly written one of them all. I felt I was plowing through words trying to find the story. That is not how one feels when reading a well written book. Most of the book was taken up with telling Jondalars people all the things they knew. Not very interesting. I feel her writing style has changed very much from her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Somewhere along the way, Jean Auel forgot that a novel is supposed to have a story. The latest installment in the Earth's Children's Series drags along on \\"Ayla and Jondalar get married and have a baby,\\" surrounded by hundreds of pages of obviously well-researched but often tedious details more suited to a taped narration in a natural history museum.Characterization is often reduced to caricature. Ayla, the prehistoric superwoman, is the first human being to domesticate animals and to discover the fire-starting properties of iron pyrite. Ludicrously, she also becomes the first to realize that pregnancy results from sexual intercourse.In short, this is not a novel; it's a National Geographic special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greed One, Fans Zero","review":"I can't add much to the other negative reviews, except to say that if Ms. Auel couldn't give her thousands of faithful fans an effort worthy of the previous books, she should have just let it (and us) go. If Jean Auel actually wrote this, then something is very, very wrong with her. Shame on her editor(s) and the publisher of this truly atrocious book, for wasting the money and, what's worse, the time of Ms. Auel's fans. I guess what with the ready made market, greed got the better of everyone involved. Well, they got my money this time. I hope they put it in the bank, because they won't get it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"News about the author","review":"For those of you who are not aware of it, the original author of this series passed away some years ago. Someone else took over writing the next several books, I'm not sure how many, maybe 2. I don't remember if it is someone from the family who took over the writing or someone else. Anyway, the books written by someone else are good, but they lack Jean Auel's distinctive way of writing. Just thought I would give a little perspective on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major let down","review":"...The book is more about Auel's hypothesis of what the region looked like, and how people lived, than it is and actual story. No build up. No climax. This title is a best seller because we all expected it to live up to the last four books. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close. This is the last of the series I spend good money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Jean Auel?","review":"I think not.

However, J.A.'s follow ups were a bit disappointing and wading through this repetitious tome is a total time waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth a Star","review":"How bad is bad. Auel has certainly showed us how with this bomb. I finally closed the book for good when the kids got tired on the Journey, had a snack, then took a nap. At least the kids didn't have a cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"No story line, no plot, nothing new. Jean Auel should have combined books 4, 5 and 6 and saved all the repetitive filler. We got it the first three times. Very poor writing, very boring book, but that's free enterprise. We didn't have to grab the hook when it was offered. That's my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money","review":"Unfortunately, The Shelters of Stone is a major disappointment. Only once before have I failed to finish a book because it was just too bad to continue - this now makes twice. None of the books beyond Clan of the Cave Bear ever entirely lived up to Auel's first, though at least Valley of Horses was decent if not as engrossing. This book, however, is not only boring, but the language is stilted and bordering on silly as Ayla (whom I used to like as a character) ponders every single detail of life she notices and seems to feel a need to explain it as well. Why did I get it? I was hoping that Auel had returned to her earlier style after taking so many years to complete this book. On the bright side, at least it's thick enough to make a good door stopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelters of Stone","review":"After waiting 12 years for this book to come out ( I had given up hope) I was some what disapointed. I have come to expect Alya to be an independant and resoureful woman. It is as if she has just settled into the routine of daily life. Mostly the book covered what had been already written. Some of the pages were tedious and hard to keep up with. It took me about 3 days to read The Mammoth Hunters, I just couldn't stop reading. This one has left me with a bad taste. If I have to wait another 12 years to continue the saga I will be hard pressed to pay the price for the hard cover edition, and will wait till I can check it out or paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the variety?","review":"I'm wondering why everyone thus far has rated this book so highly. After having to wait only four years for this book, I'm sorry to say that it was rather disappointing to have to read the repetitious \\"Ayla of the Zelandonii greets you...\\" for the ENTIRE book. Did the summer meeting need to drag on for the entirety? Or did we really need to go through 700 pages of her demonstrating fire over and over again?Maybe I'm being critical. I, at least, have to agree with the previous reviewer. Don't bother reading this book unless you've already dedicated yourself to the series. Let's hope something happens soon with the last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book had no point!","review":"Up to this point, I had looked forward to Jean Auel's books. However, after reading her latested installment I was very disappointed. Yes, she has always been wordy but it seemed the whole book was that way. By the time I was halfway through the book, I was wondering where it was going and I found out at the end. NOWHERE!! What a waste of time and money. This was one of those books that you finish and then say to yourself \\"Is THAT it?\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"600 unnecessary pages.","review":"While I am a BIG fan of the 'Earth's Children series and bought every volume, I was extremely disappointed in the final book 'Shelters of Stone'. Remove all the flowery scene descriptions and constant recapping of the previous 4 volumes and the book would have been no more than 100 pages. What a let down after such an incredible journey. I doubt a 6th volume would fill the void left by this blunder."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"This book is far too overdue - I find I've lost interest in the entire series. After reading this enormous (too big) book with its excess of overdone sex, I can assure you I won't be buying/reading the next one! Too much, too much, too much EVERYTHING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the real critiques","review":"Like you who have read both the book and the \\"professional\\" critiques, I felt guilty for disliking this latest in the sequel with such intensity. But then I relaxed when I read the reviews of the average fan of Auel's - I'm normal after all. This book was so dissappointing. I found myself reading each new page just hoping that she would return to the fresh and origianl style of historical fiction that I had grown to long for. But the book never delivered. I'm waiting for her next book. Even the greatest of athletes strike out once in a while and I'm certain that her next work will be a home run. If you've never read the first four books don't bother. Read this one and you'll know everything you needed to know about the first four. Then read the first four and realize how great the series really is. For those of us who have loved the first four - we became tired of all the italicized repaeats."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love all of these books from Jean M. Auel.","review":"Very well researched, splendid stories, each book is a surprise and a joy. Read them, they are definitively very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Progression","review":"As the series progresses they become more and more repetitive to the point that there appears to be absolutely nothing new to to reveal for Earth's Children. I could not even finish it as a storyline or plot was never really developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There was a lot of opportunity to have an exciting book, bu there wasn't any follow through. The repetition was amazing. I understand having to recap some of the events from the previouis books to refresh memories, but did we really have to read how Ayla got the horse 15 different times? After the first explanation, wouldn't \\"Ayla explained how she acquired the animals,\\" have been enough? There's plenty of conflict set up for the next book--if Auel will use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayla, the World's First Feminist","review":"First, I've read all the books in the series and enjoyed them. Okay \\"Plains of Passage\\" was a boring read but not too bad. In \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" Jean Auel makes Ayla out to be some kind of super-woman, who invented open heart surgery to figuring out \\"where babies come from.\\"The promblem? It's gone too far. I think the long wait between books as made me lose interest. Either that or Ms. Auel can't write Ayla anymore. She lost her momentum. At the beginning it was fun to see Ayla invent all this stuff, but the fun is gone. I suppose this can happen with a series or a series of books with one character in the center. (I just hope Patricia Cornwell can keep Kay Scarpetta fresh for a long time yet.)What I will say in Auel's favor, her research is amazing. The lady does her homework and it shows.For newcomers to the series, start with \\"Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" and follow in order, quickly. That way you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they forget to edit this book?","review":"I loved the other two books in this series and was truly looking forward to this book - I couldnt be more disappointed. I'm an advid reader - and this book was painful at times to read. Normally I would of just stopped - but out of curosity and loyality I finished it. This story could of been told in half the pages. Some background and info is nice - but the detail was long winded and more often that not - repetitive. I swear I read the same descriptive paragraphs more than once. I got the description of the cave the first time - didnt need it over and over again.My greatest urge while reading this book was to get out a red marker and start crossing out passages. So if you dont mind scanning through the extra verbage to get to the meat of the story this is okay and minus a couple hundred pages it would of been great - oh well. Cant recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story but very repetitive","review":"I have read all the books and was very much looking forward to this new one. It's a good read if you love descriptions of *everything* and I mean everything. It's great to see Ayla home with the man she loves and becoming part of his family/tribe but it's lacking something. The space that is used by the repetition of formal names and ideas gets really old after a while and I too found myself skipping over entire paragraphs.As a whole, the book is still a good read and I would recommend it to any Jean Auel/Ayla fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"long awaited and well worth it","review":"I read many reviews of this bool and I don't understand, the only book of the series that I have not read countless times is the first one, CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. This book was everthing I expected of it. My biggest question is, is everyone reading the same book???????????? I have read SOS twice now and do not find anything out of line with Ms. Auel's writing, just one question will we have to wait so long for book 6?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few comments on the graphic design.","review":"The graphic design of the book jacket is rotten! The first four books, as they originally came out, followed a consistent and attractive design pattern, thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing. The new binding looks completely different -- simplistic, boring -- and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books. I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design. The decision makers at Crown Publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parts read like romance novels of today","review":"I loved all the Earth's Children books but was so disappointed to read loves scenes (over and over) in \\"Stone\\" that read like today's romance novels.Jean Auel goes to great lengths to give the reader a feel for life 30,000 ago. I am just somewhat disappointed with the graphic love details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for serious fans of the series","review":"After putting her fans on hold for several years, Jean Auel's The Shelters of Stone delivered a relatively disappointing product. Again, Auel clearly demonstrates that she has researched the daily lives of early man in stunning detail. However, this latest book does not deliver anything new or interesting to the reader. Ayla, her proto-feminist(?) protagonist, does exactly what she has done in previous novels: be kind to children and old people, heal furry critters, question religious, cultural, & scientific norms, and make passionate love with her man.I can only assume the book is a bridge into the final chapter of the life of Ayla which will in all likelihood bring together her people with those of the Clan. Save your dollars and get this one from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHELTERS OF STONE","review":"I HAVE READ ALL THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THEM SO I EAGERLY BOUGHT THE LATEST INSTALLMENT IN THE SERIES.

THE AUTHOR REPEATS HERSELF CONSTANTLY, EXPLAINING OVER AND OVER AGAIN DETAILS OF JONDALAR AND AYLA'S JOURNEY. I FOUND THAT UNNEEDED AND VERY ANNOYING. I LIKED THE FACT THAT AYLA WAS A VERY STRONG CHARACTER AND THAT WOMEN WERE CONSIDERED AS EQUALS TO MEN IN THE BOOK AND IF YOU CUT OUT ALL THE REPETETIVE DIALOGUE AND INFORMATION IT IS A FAIRLY GOOD READ. HOWEVER, I AM NOT SURE IF I WILL BOTHER WITH THE NEXT EPISODE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Unfortunately I received this book for Mother's Day and feel obligated to read it from cover to cover.

I for one was so relieved to continue the imaginative story of Ayla's life and it not just be tragedy after tragedy.I loved all the books (sure, some more than others) but; no one's life can be filled with only tragedy. Ayla deserved peace and serenity. Yet, I know there is more to come... (I would love to see a book about the clan and Durc after Ayla left and what becomes of him -- these books could go on forever!)I just enjoyed reading of her finally enjoying life, happiness and love.My advice, just enjoy the serenity and imagine having your own Jondalar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment after the long wait","review":"After waiting all this time for the Shelters of Stone to be released, I rushed out to get my copy full of anticipation of another fascinating weekend read. I ploughed through the book to the end, only to be really disappointed. Instead of a brief synopsis of the previous books, Jean refers constantly to them throughout the text. I'm assuming that anyone who buys Shelters of Stone is an avid Auel fan and will therefore have read the first four books several times.I found no new plots, story lines or snippets that we have not read in one of the other parts of the series. The constant reuse of all the title names of the members of the group became very tedious and I started skipping them !There is hardly even any build up of tension at the end to make the wait for the last book nail biting !I just hope that the final episode will be worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If you are looking for well-developed characters, an interesting storyline and fascinating background information - look elsewhere. I have struggled through 1/2 of this book and thus far have found it to be little more than tedious scenic descriptions (which run on for page after page) peppered with sexual encounters (which are so poorly written as to be laughable). I am returning this book to the library unfinished because I cannot bear to read one more page and am quite relieved that I did not waste money on this drivel. Unless you honestly enjoy books which use phrases like \\"tumescent manhood\\" and \\"pulsating nodule,\\" I would strongly suggest you avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shelters of Stone","review":"I was so disappointed in this book that were supposed to be the last in the series. The endless repetition was enough to drive me insane. How could this book ever have been published? Was it only for the sake of money that could be made out of the sale of this book, because everyone who followed the series was waiting in anticipation for it.

The Valley of Horses continued with Ayla's struggle to survive, ending with finally meeting one of the Others. The Mammoth Hunters starts turning into prehistoric soap opera, introducing another man to compete for Ayla's affection, while Jondular mopes around. The slide started there. The Plains of Passage was nothing more than traveling and sex scenes. Now we have the Shelters of Stone. I guess I thought that after the Plains, Auel took 12 years to bring back some drama and plot, and improve the series. Turns out she must have had writer's block, and the publisher obviously forced her to get something, anything, worked into a manuscript. The editor did a terrible job. This book should have been 400 pages instead of 750. I had anticipated this book, but now I think it's only worth reading out of curiosity and as a bridge to the next and final story, which I will probably be too old and decrepit to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a rewrite of the previous books","review":"I Loved the first books. I waited a long time for this book. It is a major disappointment. Why does the author assume that no one has read any of the previous books? I'd like a new story instead of just a rewrite of the old ones. The pages of introductions between characters are boring. Can't Auel think of any new stories? She starts a few then just leaves the reader dangling. Ayla and Jondalar and even Wolf become tedious and uninteresting. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been an avid reader of Jean Auel's Earth Children Series for some time. I anxiously purchased this book as soon as it came out - ...this book does not live up to the first four of the series. It is so different that I have even told people that half the time it reads as if someone else wrote it. Whereas the other four books are full adventure, interesting plots, and passion, this book has none of any of those things. I thought even the story was lacking in this book: predictable, dull, and flat. If it was my first introduction to the series, I wouldn't have read half the book.Most of the book painfully reviews past events, and repeats the same things several times. Save your money - don't buy this book. You will do better to stop after Plains of Passage - you will be happier with series then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called The Descriptions of Stones","review":"This MIGHT have been an OK book if it had been half the length! Way way way too many descriptions of the rivers, the shores, the stones, the caves etc etc etc. It reads like a **very boring** geological textbook half the time! Hardly what you would call page-turning fiction! We all know that Ms. Auel has done extensive research for these novels, but I really don't want to be reminded of that on every page. Fiction is about plot, character development; not tedious drivel describing the physical landscape.Also, the book is very badly edited. There are so many repetitious parts--how many times does Joharran have to ask Jondalar if he'll teach them how to use and make the spear-throwers!??! Come on!Once again, an author got lazy and is riding on the coattails of her previous success. I won't bother reading any more of Jean Auel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm...I liked it.....","review":"Wow, it wasn't a bad a read as the others would have you think. It is very descriptive on life and customs and exsistance more than the Ayla/Jondalar story line. Her research of the time is amazing. Very admirable.Anyway, it's fantasy, it's fiction! So what if Ayla is \\"perfect\\" and discovers everything and Jondalar is a sex object. Get lost in another time, away from real life for a while! Isn't that what a book is supposed to do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it from the library for FREE","review":"So glad I didn't waste money in buying this book when the library had it for free. But still, I felt myself bored in reading it and wishing something, ANYthing interesting would happen. It was built up to look as if Marona or Brukeval would cause discord in Ayla's perfect world, but alas, nothing ever came of that. And each time Ayla met someone new I would just cringe knowing that ALL the titles were going to be repeated yet AGAIN. How tiresome did THAT become?! At least it wasn't AS repetitive as The Mammoth Hunters, but I still could have done without reading about all of Ayla's past in detail, over and over and over. And in this book, just as in the other books since Clan of the Cave Bear I was hoping Ayla would go back to the Clan to see Durc and to truly bring Broud down a notch or two, but didn't happen in this book either. This book was a big Y-A-W-N."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this: An anthropologist or a travel guide?","review":"Pointless conversation, facts laid out in laundry list form, inconsistent characterization, interminable passages of description...this is the most self-indulgent book I've read in a while.

The repetition within the book is not; nor are the ad nauseum descriptions of rocks, plants, hills, valleys, etc. Are the number of words in the book used in calculating what Jean Auel was paid? probably, and she knew it. The story line, while stretched out and left hanging, was good. The presentation of the social lives, and struggles of the people Ayla is to live with is interesting, if not exciting. But, the whole thing could have been comfortably compressed into a couple hundred pages as the first few chapters of something a lot better...like what we all hope book 6 will give us."},{"rating":"1","title":"O......M......G.........at least I'm not the only one","review":"good GRIEF! and WHEW! I thought it was just me, but this book and Plains of Passage are horrid. Even the reader for Plains of Passage on the Books on Tape version was barely tolerable. What happened to the story telling...this is fiction, not Prehistoric History of Europe 101 overandoverandoverandOVER.Some detail, good...as much detail as these books have (and it's the same in BOTH books again and again and again...we get it, you did a LOT of research), not necessary. And the animals have no personality any more.BLECH! Maybe Jean Auel burned out after Mammoth Hunters, produced a mediocre Plains of Passage and just needed a break. Well, take another before finishing off the series or don't finish at all. I won't buy another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayla is Tina Turner?","review":"Wow, may I just say this: This series has been hard enough to get through (I got the audiobooks free from a friend), but now it's intolerable. Remember how in the early 90's Tina Turner all of a sudden had this weird brit/european accent? For no apparent reason? Well, the same reader has done books 2-5, and now- in book 5, Ayla has this weird accent. She rolls her r sounds and has this broken language deal going on. Whatever. Like the storylines aren't lame enough, now it sounds awful, too.I'm so tired of their sex life by now, Ayla certainly must be, too. Of course, she is the queen of the instant orgasm, so maybe not. Lucky girl, I guess. Anyway, that's my review- no need to review the story because it's the same as all the others. But to change the entire speech and cadence of the main character's voice is just ridiculous. What crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cave people soap opera","review":"I have never seen so much padding in a book, ever. It is worse than General Hospital that my mother watched for so many years.

I think Jean's readers deserve something much better.Carol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glacial pace","review":"As a big fan of the previous four books, Shelters of Stone was a major disappointment for me. The plot was almost devoid of what makes most novels enjoyable, namely conflict. The book seems to be laying the ground work for conflicts that never occur. Once I start a book, I always finish it. This habit was the only reason I stuck it out through all 741 pages. I was glad to finally turn the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a bit too redundant.","review":"I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on \\"how amazing\\" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in \\"Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" and \\"Valley of Horses.\\" (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelters of Stone","review":"This book is boring - the previous were exciting.This one reminds me of Stephen King and his repetitive writing(all in the same book).Could have been only half as many pages and more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"I've read all of Ms. Auel's novels, and have loved every one...until now. I kept waiting for this to get better, and I kept paging through, and it never got better. The story was boring, and insulting in it's simplicity (I felt as if I was reading an archeological textbook for 4th graders), there was no excitement as was the case in other books, and the ending was ridiculous. I actually paged through past the last paragraph, thinking that I was missing part of the book. Talk about dropping off in the middle of nowhere. The only saving grace about the ending was just that - it was the ending! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. It's a waste of [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long wait... Too long","review":"I waited, like everyone else, for the next installment in this series and didn't hold off until a sale or for a discount.I should have.Either Ms. Auel fired her editor or, like too many of her experts, he died during her extended hiatus.How many times must we be told about Ayla using the night-basket because she had to urinate more often due to her pregnancy? How many times did we need reminded that Ayla was frightened to become a Zeladoni? Other examples of this repetitive writing are numerous. The book could have been cut by 15% and not suffered - probably improved.I hope the sixth book is better edited and Ms. Auel tightens her craft. Yes, I will buy the next one and hope for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"sophisticated young women","review":"the book little women by Louisa May Alcott was a great read and i thought the writing style was very easy to read it kept you interested through out the whole book. i recommend this book to anyone with alittle sense of how young girls are and how they are when they are growning up and even some of the hardships that young girls go through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming","review":"Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' is one of the most captivating and heartfelt stories I have ever read.

It chronicles their life from puberty to adulthood and is a warmhearted tale about love and loss. I found it funny, the customs of courtship especially and laughed out loud often.The story is driven by a very lively dialogue, making it a quick read. The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Better than I expected.Will be reading the other books.

Then my mom told me I should read this book because I was going to love it. And she was totally right. The good thing about this book is that it is real. I have to admit it: I fell in love with the real characters. This book shows that life can be great with love. Louisa transmits feelings, and reading this book you feel happiness, sadness, and lots of stuff. My mom told me that she even cried when she read the book. The characters will become your imaginary friends and I'm sure that, after reading this book, you will see life in another way.

It warms your heart when the sisters sit together near the fire and read the letter from their father, and when Jo cuts her hair. You laugh when Jo and Laurie meet their 1st time and talks funnily. You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, & especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy.

The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), \\"...young readers like to know 'how people look.'\\" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess you really shouldn't judge a book by its cover","review":"This is one of the greatest works of American fiction ever written. It touches my heart in a different way each time I read it, and I have read it several times-every Christmas since I was 12. I've been looking to replace my worn, cheap, but dearly loved copy with something with a classic cover to mirror the classic literature its binding holds. This \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is a disgusting display of...I don't know what. The cover has nothing to do with the story. Cartoon scribbles of girls with pimples? Not only is this unappealing, it also implies that what lies on the inside is inconsequential dribble which it most certainly is not.Buy this book, just not this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to Borders instead!!","review":"Borders Classics is a Borders imprint that makes similar cloth covered versions of classic tales.

I set it down then, never realizing it would take this long to get back to it. Little Women is the story of four girls and their mom and dad during the Civil War. Their dad has gone off to minister to soldiers in the war and the girls and their mom are quite poor. Optimism is a key concept among the Marches, however, so you do not hear bellyaching or whining in this household. The girls find ways to entertain themselves with nary a Nintendo or tv. They continually renew their vow to keep a happy face and try harder to be good.

It is definitely worth it reading all 444 pages. Little Women leaches lessons, and tells a thoughtful story of a family who comes close to losing everything but manages to live happily and love each other no matter what. Some tragic things happen, but the March family definitely cares about everyone that comes into their lives and stays strong even while the man of the house is fighting in the Civil War.

This cover is disgusting. I was hoping to find a lovely copy of this book for my sister as a gift because she loved the copy I purchased for myself a while back. Mine is from Borders classics but unfortunately I don't think they are making the same copy anymore. It is a beautiful hardcover, fabric covered, bright red with gold embossing and nice victorian female silhouettes. I was hoping to find her something comparable. I don't know why they decided to make beautiful fabric versions of other classics such as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre which i have purchased and love, but to release this horrible version of Little Women. I truly wish they had made it along the lines of the faric covered hard cover classics. I guess this was an attemt of modernizing a book which doesn't need to be modernized in order to be loved, that is what makes it a classic after all. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEH!","review":"Why give your child an adaptation of a classic?The original book IS a classic because it's that good, but it's not intended to be an easy reader. There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing.

I've read other editions of Little Women and don't remember the word don't being used so poorly throughout the novel as it was in this edition.

In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite classic =(","review":"This book, Little Women by Louisa May Alcott was boring. I did not enjoy her style of writing at all. Another factor that lead to me not liking this book is that it was from the 1800's. Young teens like me are not into these types of boring \\"1800's\\" books. This book was a torture to read. You might ask, \\"what was going through your mind as you were reading this book?\\" Well, to all of those people out there, my answer is \\"boring!\\" Louisa explained everything that was going on... only a little bit too much.

Since acquiring a CEO from Disney the Penguin Classics once a distinguished series has become largely a pulpit for multiculturalists, feminists, post-colonial theorists and academic careerists brainwashed by Edward Said to \\"re-frame\\" \\"de-construct\\" and deface in the name of a politically reductive, emotionally vacuous jihad against Western Culture.

There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic!","review":"This book touched my heart.

The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself. I believe stories such as this are exactly what is needed to help guide a new generation of girls toward a happier and more peaceful adulthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CATCHER AND THE RYE","review":"Most people either hate or love Salinger's novel because they either relate to it or they don't; Little Women was a novel in the same way. If my 53 year old dad read this, he would not have appreciated it as much as 19 year old me, who loves Jo and Beth the most because they struck a chord in my heart. Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together. Feminists, put your guards down because this book is not about submission or female inferiority, it is about overcoming everything with love, both for males and females. Don't watch the movie EVER.

I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excitement for your bookshelf!","review":"Growing up in the March house is no easy task.

So dive into the wonderful adventures of \\"Little Women\\" as they learn life changing lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Despite the Jessie Wilcox Smith illustrations on the front and back covers, I was very disappointed to discover that the artist's color plates that so perfectly capture the characters and events in this American literary classic, were omitted from this edition. Intending to give it as a gift, I ordered this book because I was under the impression that it had the famous Jessie Wilcox Smith pictures. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! About this version","review":"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Classic","review":"Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Keepsake for any girl/woman!","review":"I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover. I was amazed to find this very one on Amazon, because my mom gave me this version 23 years ago, for Christmas! I'd already read Little Women at least twice before she gave me this book. The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times! Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings. This is the perfect gift for a 10 year old girl (that was the age I received this), because she will keep it forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"full of spelling and grammar mistakes","review":"I love \\"Little Women\\" by L.M.

It was a pretty good story and apparently autobiographical, but can someone who is hip on this story answer some questions. e-mail me at msbeckaru@aol.com1) Who is Marmee? The sisters are Meg, Jo, Beth, & Amy as best as I could tell. Does the mom have a name? 2) Is Teddy the same person as Laurie cuz I'm really confused on that. 3) What are Meg's babies names? They didn't say in the movie. 4) Who's the old lady who leaves Jo the poodle and the house? Is she a relative?Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad soap opera","review":"This story is so incredibly melodramatic it's not even funny. Jo is such an unlikeable character.

When I was in grade school, I had to read it for a project, and I hated it. The reason was probably beause it was not flashy or out of the ordinary. It just told the average story about the average family at that time. it may be interestign for some, but the young readers of today just don't like it all that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST BOOK THAT WILL EVER EXIST IN THE HISTORY OF ALL BOOKS!","review":"LITTLE WOMEN BY LOUSY LOUISA MAY ALCOTT( I THINK THAT'S HER NAME ) IS THE UTMOST WORST BOOK YOU WILL EVER READ IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She said I would enjoy it because of the historical setting (Civil War). I took her advice end enjoyed reading it. It gives a look at the social history of the time which is all too often over looked by many authors, something about battles and war being more interesting.

I remember trying this book as a girl and disliking it; I gave it another try now on vacation, at the age of 47. I still dislike it. The characters are caricatures and speak in stilted dialogue unlike that of any real people--much less interesting people. Don't misunderstand--I like good nineteenth century novels. In fact, I love Dickens, Trollope, the Brontes, George Eliot, Mrs. Gaskell, etc. This book is a pale imitation of those--a mere period piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now It Feels Like Christmas","review":"I just recieved this treasured book from my childhood along with Little Men and Jo's Boys and now I am in the Christmas spirit.

Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time.

This book, as well as Anne of Green Gables, are in my opinion among the best literature about girlhood. As I pass through each stage in my life, I find that I understand one of the girls a little more and see more and more of the universality of its theme.

It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not?

The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. \\"About bloody time!\\" I cried.

The more I listened to it, the more I wanted to listen to it. I'm not exactly sure what genre to put this in, but it is wonderful music for an evening with your sweetie...and works well for an afternoon around the house.

Lang at her very best! k.d.'s dynamic voice is definitely the main attraction of this album, as she maximizes it to convey the intensity of songs that are introspective without sounding trite or syrupy. A bevy of musical instruments including the accordion, violin, vibraphone, steel guitar and mandolin compliment k.d. and enhance the quality of the songs without detracting from her beautiful voice. The standout single is \\"Constant Craving\\" but songs like \\"The Mind of Love\\", \\"Miss Chatelaine\\", \\"Wash Me Clean\\" and \\"So It Shall Be\\" add great depth and dimension to the album and are essential to its atmosphere.

Like the fact the backpack straps are hidden. Good size for younger students that don't have a lot of textbooks to move around, but for older students that have to move around a lot of textbooks it might not be big enough. Liked the brown backpack, it makes it very easy to find among many backpacks. Wish it had a few more pouches with pockets for pencils and maybe a webbed and zippered pouch for coins and whatnot. Still new so don't have an opinion on durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased the movie Shiloh to show to my students after reading the novel in class. Unfortunately, while the video quality of this DVD was just fine, the sound had a problem. We had to turn the TV up to maximum volume to just hear the movie. And yes, I did try other DVDs and their sound was fine so it was not the TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wholesome Family Movie","review":"I have an 8-year-old son who is obsessed with animals, especially dogs. This movie does not disappoint the dog lover! Shiloh is adorable and does lots of running around. My whole family watched it (including 11-year-old son) and enjoyed it. The main character does everything in his power to take the beagle away from its abusive master, even to the point where he's willing to work for it. The boy's father is supportive but realistic. The story teaches good morals about honesty, hard work, and of course, caring for an animal and treating it well. Good DVD for a family car trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"a vary good movie","review":"This is one of my top 5 dog movies, this movie delivers action and a vary good story, I suggest you buy this movie you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiloh without a soul","review":"As I watched this movie, I felt like somebody explained the plot to the film producers, but they never read the book. The movie is missing everything that made the book special: the sense of ruralness and poverty (it looks like middle class or higher), the childhood innocence, and most important, the insights into human nature. I don't want to spoil it, but the lesson learned in the movie is unrelated to the lesson in the book, and possibly contradictory. If you love the book, the movie will disappoint you. Having said that, my 7-year-old enjoyed both. Adults may not enjoy it so much. I was sad that they wasted such a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Boy Who Finds a Dog","review":"I think kids would like the book, Shiloh, by Phillois Reynolds Naylor because it is fun, and adventurous. I ike this story because a boy named Marty finds a dog and he named it Shiloh because he found the dog by the Shiloh School Houes. Marty finds out that it is Judd's dog. One day he had to take the dog back to Judd which makes Marty feel very worried aboutShiloh's safety. I think you would like this story because it is Judd's dog and he is mean. You will have to read the rest of the story to find the ending.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD FAMILY MOVIE","review":"SHILOH is an entertaining movie the whole family can enjoy. It especially stresses the importance of children taking responsibility for their pets, and the movie also has a warm family relationship. While it's pacing is rather slow, the story of how a young boy rescues a beagle from an abusive owner should keep even the smaller kids involved. The cast does well in their roles: Blake Heron shines as little Marty, determined to provide a good home for the mistreated Shiloh; Scott Wilson is appropriately evil as the dog's abusive owner; Michael Moriarty and Ann Dowd do well as the parents; and Rod Steiger and Bonnie Bartlett are fine as the elderly couple who befriend the young boy.SHILOH is refreshing entertainment for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor organization and editing hurt useful book","review":"The problem with this book is that it really seems like the author and editor didn't care about putting out a great product.There are lots of problems with this book. There are far too many typos (it's hard to edit a chess book, but come one!) and the organization is horrid. It's easy to miss crucial subvariations, and the lack of proper indexing, combined with poor organization, makes it very hard to find the game you need.Schiller's \\"strategic overview\\" in the beginning is a great idea, but it's executed poorly. A few examples concerning advancing the d-pawn here (rather than just scattered throughout the book) would work wonders.So why two stars? Well, because despite its numerous flaws, I find myself using this book a lot. There aren't any other good books on the Tarasch defense these days, and it's an excellent weapon for the club player. There is a lot of good information in here, it's just so hard tofind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly executed book","review":"The problem with any book by Eric Schiller is that he seems to bite off far more than he can chew or he presents us with superficial stuff. He also seems to have zero qualms about rehashing editing hatchet jobs on books that have been previously written by other authors (see Schiller's book on Kasparov for an example). And here, as others have observed, he quite poorly executes what could have been a good idea -- a repertoire based on the Tarrasch Defense. It's all very frustrating for those of us who wish our chess books to be to be labors of love rather than hurried projects sent to the printing press before they are ready. The Tarrasch Defense deserves far better treatment than what Schiller offers us. I don't recommend this book to anyone. For a far better repertoire book based on the Tarrasch Defense, get Jacob Aagard's \\"Meeting 1d4\\", published in 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll buy the longer one next time","review":"Very good product, got 3 of these around the house or in the pack now, to keep one handy at all times.

This we know is not true. Wayne Stahnke did an outstanding job with his Rachmaninoff discs. Granted, he used computer reconstruction, but Kenneth Caswell, on the small Pierian label, did not, and his Granados and Debussy albums are uncannily realistic. The latter impressed even Charles Timbrell, an expert on French pianists. Equally musical is a more varied collection on the Phonographe label, which seems to include recordings made many years ago. Perhaps the piano used did not have to be \\"restored\\" but had been kept in good condition -- but I'm just guessing. In any event, this Naxos album is, unfortunately, a thumping failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"Purchased these to wear with my fins while snorkeling.

That is until i opened the film covering the book...there is a sticky spot on the cover about the size of my fist and i really see no way of getting it off without damaging the book.

Not for young children and unless they understand French not for older kids either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dream in a dream","review":"As the director Jean Cocteau states at the begining of the film, you have to watch this with the mindset of a child. It started off a bit strange, but as the story progressed, I was totally captivated by this dreamy world. It is black and white, but the cinematography is so beautiful and rich, you forget about the colorlessness. I gave 4 stars, just because this film is not for everyone.

But the transfer for this edition (Criterion Spine #6) is not up to the editor's usual standards : scratches, jumps, blurs and sound hissing.

This film, written and directed by French filmmaker Jean Cocteau, is the very definition of the word \\"fairy tale\\". It's haunting, breathtaking, beautiful, dreamlike, enchanting, even psychological. And the special effects! I introduced this film to some friends one movie night and they were mesmerized by the Beast's castle. In this age of CGI special effects, one can't help but ask out loud: \\"how did they do that back in 1946?\\" But personally that's one question I never want to have answered. A magician never reveals his secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criterion collection film trashed by Disney","review":"This was a great move for the Criterion Collection to rerelease a film and classic story that was ruined by the Disney version.This film is much more true to the original story. Disney even stole ideas from this release to put in their version and never credited Cocteau for what they took from him.The special makeup effects for the beast are nothing short of incredible considering when this film was made. This film is also credited with reviving French cinema which had been ravaged by the German occupation.It was an early attempt to present a child's fairy tale for an adult audience.

It's a must movie for those who want to escape from the ordinary....."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best BatB films ever made, if not the best.","review":"From the opening scenes to the last, this film is what Beaumont's story would appear to be if one could do a direct to film translation. Though in this version Beauty only has one brother and there has been added a suitor (Who IMHO looks almost like Gaston of Disney's.) these two characters make up for the lost of Beauty's three. There has been some minor story changes, most noticbly a less moralistic ending, but over all kept true to the original work. It is a very captivating film, and the extras on the disc help enhance the experience of an already great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA BELLE EST LE BETE","review":"THIS WAS THE FIRST FRENCH FILM OF COCTEAU I EVER SAW.

This is a very interesting movie with surrealistic undertones. It is actually a work of art in the modern sense. It is very creative and dreamlike. The special effects are extremely clever and thoughtful. This film proves that without an imagination CGI really doesn't do much for films. It is a classic and similar in charm to The Wizard of Oz. It is in French and also black & white which both contribute to its uniqueness & obscurity. Nonetheless this is an excellent version of the timeless fairy tale that continues to live on strong.Love can turn a man into a beast,but love can also make an ugly man handsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"Sterling DVD release of a movie that only a heart of stone would dislike; certainly a must-have for Cocteau admirers."},{"rating":"2","title":"If they would let me, I'd give it ten stars!","review":"I just watched my old VHS copy and ordered this immediately. I was amazed at how touched and emotional I became when watching this film which I have seen dozens of times. It works on so many levels and deepens with each viewing.The photography is so beautiful that each frame could be literally framed and hung on a wall. My favorite scenes are Belle's tears turning to diamonds; her necklace turning into rope when she gives it to her sister, the disembodied candelabras and her turning into a princess as Le Bete carries her over the threshold of her room. The list is endless.If you haven't seen this film, just buy it on the recommends.

This book depicts \\"real\\" vampirism, without the supernatural aspect, displaying it as more of a disease than a hellish curse. The plot is like a modern telling of the original Lugosi film, with some original additions and twists created by the author. The characters' names are the same, and at some points in the story it feels like we are not in modern day Georgia, but London in the 1800's. In any case, this was a very enjoyable book, and is by no means cliche or predictable. The ending, in particular was a very creative twist. What I loved most was how different this book would be than what I originally expected. If you love the classic monsters, or are a Dracula fan, read this book.

It is truly memorable... an experience of it's own! I sat down to listen to it and there are a few places on the CD that actually made me physically jump in fright (much to my pleasant surprise!). It's also possible to follow along with the movie in your mind just by listening to key places in the music, and I found myself doing just that unconciously while I was listening to \\"You Know\\" and \\"Forbidden Fruit.\\" Even if you haven't seen the movie, the soundtrack is the next best thing!

Alan Silvestri composed an atmospheric score with some great Hitchcock feel to it. The first half of the CD is pure haunting music you could compare with Jerry Goldsmith's \\"The Haunting\\" and one should listen to it with headphones. But the last three tracks are the reason I bought this CD. \\"the Getaway\\" and \\"Reunion\\" is very \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Cape Fear\\" sounding. The brass section plays a question-answer thing with the strings.

Also great for walking the little one around the yard when you're trying to get him to sleep, without the fuss of trying to peel a regular jacket off a sleeping baby (risking waking him or her up).A newborn or smaller baby would swim in this blanket (it's not fitted at all) but for larger or older babies it's great, with room to grow.The flap behind the head is just that: a flap, not a hood. So that is the one downside since it doesn't really stay on the head (we just add a hat). The arms are also just flaps, and I'd give this a 5 star rating if it only had velcro to keep the arms wrapped over the baby (like a sleep sack). Still, it's a useful item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily large pills","review":"I bought this product thinking that, since it's such a small amount of magnesium and there's no calcium filler and it's a tablet, the pills would be small.

I had heard of this film before but could never find a copy of it until now, and it was certainly worth waiting for! As always, the British really know how to make a great film! This charming holiday movie was made for TV in England back in 1999. All the players here give wonderful performances, especially Elizabeth Earl (who also gave a great performance in \\"Fairy Tale-A True Story\\" in 1997, one of my favorite films of all time), her younger sister, Holly Earl and Dervla Kerwan as their mother.

A college buddy of mine had it in his album collection, and I was hooked after the first cut. San Lorenzo, what a song. Litterally like having sex. Starts off with the excitement of meeting your girl. Then it cools down as if you are having a few drinks. Then the mood of the song starts to pick up again and builds to a climax...then soothes to an afterglow. Am I the only one that hears the song in this way? Not a new concept in music, but none does it as pure as this song. Check it out if you've never heard it this way. As I titled this review. You'll never forget your first.

This album has been around for more than a few years, however, it sounds as fresh as the day it was released. The energy and sensitivity of these then young musicians is apparent on every cut.

More than two decades later, I feel Metheny has never surpassed it. He may have recorded more ambitious albums, but none of them have the sheer spontaneity and sweetness of this one. \\"Jaco,\\" with its bouncy tune and Mark Egan's throbbing bass, is still my all-time favorite Metheny piece, while \\"San Lorenzo\\" and \\"Phase Dance\\" still sound like the musical backdrop for the best vacation you ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Youth - Early Pat Metheny Group","review":"This recording is spell-binding.

Later novels like Menfreya in the Morning and King of the Castle are dull and formulaic. I really like the Gothic, Romantic Suspense genre, but Victoria Holt's later novels begin to lack the mystery and suspense that I love. The House of a Thousand Lanterns, while being very well-written and slightly informative on the English and Chinese cultures, is meandering and slow until about the last 100 pages (382 page book). Then I couldn't put it down. After having read her historical \\"The Queen's Confession\\", I believe Holt's true calling is her historical novels under her Jean Plaidy pseudonym. I recommend \\"The Queen's Confession\\", and you will be hooked on her Jean Plaidy novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Holt Book I Ever Read","review":"I am a huge Victoria Holt fan, but I hated this book. The only reason I hated it was because the man I wanted the heroine to end up with was killed off halfway through the book. I couldn't believe this character that I had grown to love died and that the heroine ended up with a character that I really didn't care for at all. It was shocking.The book itself was, as always, well-written. However, if you want to read this book, I suggest reading the beginning, because it certainly was the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.....are we done yet?","review":"I am a huge fan of Victoria Holt, but this storyline isn't her best. You spend most of the book waiting for Jane to move to Hong Kong to live in the House of a Thousand Lanterns. Jane was the only protagonist that I felt would deserve her demise due to her blinded devotion to her first husband. Oh...her second husband was not old...in his early 50's.I also found the book filled with stereotypes against the Chinese and women in general. I don't think it was on purpose.Read this book to add to your Victoria Holt collection, just don't expect too much from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing work by Holt","review":"I have forced myself to finish this book.

You see,Erika's last show was this one and it happened to be Pamela's first.This is also Nicole's debut episode. So,that's a little Baywatch trivia i guess. Anyhow,decent story with awesome scenery as it takes place away from the beach (mostly) and is set somewhere on the Sacramento river. It'll make you wanna go camping watching this. The only sour parts of the show for me was Hobie constantly singing that gold miners song (you wanna strangle him after the 2nd time) and the fact that Erika (Shauni) cut her hair at some point and has it short.

However, as a piece of hilariously inept production, it's a real winner. The plot is ludicrous, and the acting is equally poor. Still, some of the scenes are rather good, particularly the bizarre sequence which takes place in the village of the lunatics. Of course, the greatest lunatics are the people who produced this silly little film. No stars for quality, but 2 stars for pure comedy value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofy!","review":"This film marked the singularly unspectacular acting(?) debut of champion gymnast Kurt Thomas, and attempted to cash in on his Olympic fame. However, good athletes don't necessarily make good actors, and Kurt's performance proves it. The rest of the cast isn't much better, and the script is dreadful. However, there are some fun moments in this film. The scene in the village of the lunatics is pretty bizarre, some of the extras are truly creepy-looking, and the sheer lunacy of the plot provides some good laughs.

The idea only works if every time Thomas gets into a fight there just happens to be a piece of gymnastic equipment nearby (parallel bars, pommel horse, etc.) and of course the bad guys attack one at a time, but I guess that's just a martial arts movie tradition.

This movie has it all, karate, bloodsport, a gymnast, crazy balkans people, an old guy that waves a sword and of course guys wearing black hoods holding flags. Kurt's wooden acting is astoundingly bad. Perhaps they should have hired Bart Conner too. Imagine 2 tiny gymnasts kicking ninja butt!

I actually used this movie to *win* a bad movie party competition. The acting is made laughable by the fact that everybody in the movie seems to be taking this trash seriously.My personal highlights are when Kurt Thomas (a diminutive Olympic hardbody) fights the baddies in the town square using a well placed (and poorly disguised) pommel horse so he can show off his only real skill while kicking the bad guys who continue to attack him rather than simply waiting for him to make a mistake. The Romainian judge could have simply given him a 5.65 which would have just killed him.The other (dare I ruin the suspense) is when Kurt discovers that the uber bad guy is really his long lost father. Arrrgh!

The argument that maybe its so bad its good doesn't work. This movie is smallpox. This movie is the plague.

You can decide for yourself which version you prefer. There are some terrific performances in the British film, and brilliant directorial flourishes. Walbrook's particularly good as the cold-blooded husband pushing his frail wife (Diana Winyard) over the edge.

A true classic! One of George Cukor's best -- and he directed a lot of great movies! Based on the play, this taut drama brings us one of the great villians of all time. Boyer is not some scenery-chewing, soap-opera villian shouting and throwing tantrums. No, he's a soft, purring villian, a loving, concerned husband who is in truth driving his wife mad. She never looked better and Cotton is at his best. Check out the young Angela Landsbury too. Wonderful movie. I don't want to give it away. Just buy it -- you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Between us all the time were those jewels.\\"","review":"About an unscrupulous man (Charles Boyer) slowly and methodically making his wife (Ingrid Bergman) think she's insane. Years earlier Boyer had murdered Bergman's aunt for jewels she owned, but he was never able to find them. When he learns that Bergman has inherited the aunt's house, he turns on the charm, gets her to marry him, and moves into the house with her. On the pretense of going to a room every night to write music, he sneaks upstairs to the attic, which has been sealed off, to search for the jewels. Meanwhile he torments Bergman, hoping to have her committed to a madhouse after he finds the jewels. But thanks to Joseph Cotton and Scotland Yard, all comes right in the end. Both Boyer and Bergman are excellent (Bergman took the Oscar), and they bring off the very tense climax powerfully. Angela Lansbury makes her acting debut as a servant girl, and plays her part to the hilt. Great entertainment; definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'Mon Baby,Light My Fire","review":"One of the old black and white classics,never seen by most.Boyer plays an all but forgotten jewel thief who marries Bergman to gain access to the house in which she lived as a child. In the process of jewel hunting, Boyer deliberately tries to drive his bride insane; he loves only hidden wealth. Enter Cotten to help save the day,and Bergman's life.Look for Angela Lansbury, age 17, in her first movie,doing all her shots barefooted because of Boyer's 5ft.5in. stature. \\"He was such a dear, but Charles was just so short\\", Lansbury recalls.Watch also how quickly Lansbury ages; she was only in her mid thirties in 1962, when she played Laurence Harvey's mother in \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\".

The older movies far surpass most of the new movies made these days. Gaslight was gripping and entertaining from the beginning. Well acted by these legends of film. The picture and sound quality was great, clear and precise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bergman at her best","review":"Ingrid Bergman received a Best Actress award from the Academy for her performance in the 1944 version of Gaslight. As anyone knows, the Oscars are not necessarily a good guide to fine acting but, in this case, she deserved it in spades. This taut, suspenseful production, superbly directed by the great George Cukor, also features fine performances from Charles Boyer, Angela Lansbury (17, going on 18) and Joseph Cotten. But it is Bergman's performance which elevates this film out of the ruck, so that it takes its place among the best of its type. The DVD transfer, on the whole, is good, although the print from which it was made shows considerable signs of wear in the first 10 minutes, and the whole thing could do with a restoration/clean. The special feature, hosted by Bergman's daughter, Pia Lindstrom, is well worthwhile - and on the flipside of the disc there is also the 1940 British version of the Patrick Hamilton play. A DVD worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I HEAR VOICES IN THE NIGHT, BUT I AM NOT GOING MAD!\\"","review":"Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman star in this dazzling mystery about two newlyweds who move into the wife's family mansion.

While seeing Paula nearly frightened to death at a concert he knows that she is not mad, she is being driven mad. If this macabe nightmare continues Paula could be placed in an insane asylum.

What are they thinking?! These films were released in glorious black & white, which, along with the casting, direction, story, cinematography and editing, made these films classics. I can't imagine a studio with any sense of pride stooping so low as to release their classics in anything other than their orginal versions. If this is true, all I can say is I'm glad Warner Bros. isn't in charge of the Louvre. They'd probably recast the Mona Lisa with Britney Spears sporting a big, toothy grin. Smarten up, Warner Bros.

Boyer and Bergman are both excellent, and the foggy London atmosphere is perfect. Only caveat - Joseph Cotten, playing a British detective with an American accent !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aha!","review":"After seeing this movie again recently, I know what the real shortcoming is. It's simply that the subclimactic scenes are treated with the imposed impact of a climax. In other words, since so much terror is trying to be throttled out of every decisive individual scene, the impact of the climax is let down. If maybe the handling in these vital--but not climactic--scenes had implied the terror more subtly, the denouement would have taken on the power of a crescendo, thus making it much more effective; and thereby, satisfying. Everything I stated below about this picture still goes. (Except maybe I was a little too harsh on ol' Joe Cotten. They just don't give him much room to make an impact.) All told, this is still one of the most terrifying movies ever made, a real masterpiece of atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance by Bergman","review":"The reviewer from Auburn, WA gives a fine summary of this film. Although I enjoy watching this movie, it is primarily due to Ingrid Bergman's performance. The acting overall is good, with tips of the hat to Boyer, Joseph Cotton, and Angela Landsbury; however, I believe that Bergman really shines. To me,the storyline requires a little bit of a leap of faith, and the \\"suspense\\" is mild compared to other films of the suspense genre (e.g.Hitchcock, \\"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\\"). Basically, good acting, but a little short in the script and directing, resulting in a film that falls just shy of the \\"classic\\" label. If you're a fan of Ingrid Bergman or the black and white films of the '40' and '50's, you'll enjoy this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know I left it there,I know it!","review":"This is THE version of \\"Gaslight\\". Forget any pretenders,including the British version. Ingrid Bergman is at her best as the mystified woman who thinks she's going mad,little realizing that it's her husband that's trying to run her 'round the bend. And Charles Boyer is at his silken meanest as the husband who is slowly but surely causing his fragile wife to doubt her own sanity! And look for a very young Angela Landsbury(she was seventeen) as the sluttish Nancy,the chambermaid. She brings a note of quiet meanness to the part and plays it like a seasoned pro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best thriller, mystery, horror combo's I've read.","review":"After reading The 6 Messiah's I came looking for more from Mark Frost, and was stunned to see less than 5 star ratings.

I've heard country music can be depressing but I didn't expect nearly the whole CD to be depressing. The title track is the only song I liked.

I think her very 1st cd is still her best"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too bad!","review":"\\"Never Again, Again,\\" Lee Ann Womack's first hit single, cut through the pop mush usually played on so-called country radio like a hot knife through butter. Here, I said to myself on first hearing it, is a woman who understands where country music came from, and wants to keep that traditional sound alive. Her first two CDs generally reinforced my opinion.Unfortunately, I must agree with John Morthland's review for Amazon.com of \\"I Hope You Dance.\\" Lee Ann has been \\"de-twanged\\" in this collection of songs, both in her vocals and in the songs' arrangements. Fiddles have given way to violins. She's gone pop, and from her manifesto in the liner notes, I doubt if she'll ever return to the hardcore country sound.Yes, this is a well-written, well-crafted, well-produced, well-sung record--but it's a pop record. If you were attracted to Lee Ann, like I was, by her seemingly deep country roots, you'll be bitterly disappointed.It's too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Ann.........Reconsider!!!!!!!","review":"How's the line go? \\"When you come close to sellin out reconsider\\". Well Lee Ann should have reconsidered. I was a huge Lee Ann Womack fan. All I heard her talk about was how she wanted to stay true to country music. SHE SOLD OUT!! This is CITY music, not country. With the exception of \\"I feel like I'm forgetting something\\", there are very few songs that I consider real country on this album. They are all too pretty. I love the way Lee Ann sings true country so this album was very dissapointing to me. I know Lee Ann will sell more albums this way, but she will do it by selling out and not staying true to country music. Please Lee Ann, on the next album; don't let your producer and record label talk you into selling out again. Your voice is made for traditional country. Please don't rob us of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product review","review":"Product was exactly what I ordered. Got this Cd,, Exactly what I wanted.

The music transends any prejuduice one may have about a particular style of music. I realize there is what many call a crossover of some C&W; with Pop but I didn't feel that was the case here. You will clearly hear the bands instrumental \\"twang\\" and the inflection in her voice that is distinctly C&W;, but it does not detract from the music, quite the contrary. The message is one we can all appreciate. Inspirational with a great melody make this one to add to your Eclectic collection.CA Luster"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Great Song","review":"The title song of this album is one of the best works of the year; I expect to be listening to it well into the future. But I was very disappointed with the album; the title song was almost the only thing I liked in the whole record. Even the musical style of the rest of the album was different. My experience has usually been that, if I like a song, I'll find other gems on the album. You may be different, but for me a single would have been enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good country for a non-country listener","review":"Well, I cannot give it 5 stars because country music is definitly not my cup of tea, but a 4 star rating from me would be equivilent to a 5 star rating from someone who loves country music. I bought this CD because the title track was the theme to my prom. I didn't really expect it to appeal to me past the main song, but I listened to it anyway, and I actually kind of liked it. LeeAnn has a good voice, and the songs are all strong. The music somehow appeals to people who normally don't listen to country because it only has a light twang to it, but it still definitly keeps to its roots for those hard core country listeners. So if you are like me, and like a different genre of music and are not sure whether or not to buy it, I'd go ahead and give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"After listening to the title song on the radio for weeks, I decided to purchase this CD. I really liked \\"I Hope You Dance\\". What a disapointment it was when I first played the CD. The title song on the CD is VERY different from the song on the radio. The radio version is very hip and non-country. The CD version is VERY \\"country-fied\\". Complete with many \\"twangs\\". I only played it twice and sold it to a used CD store. A classic case of \\"Bait and Switch\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS!?","review":"Lee Ann Womack should be ashamed of herself. After promising to stay true to country music in the inspiring \\"Murder On Music Row\\" that she performed with Alan Jackson and George Strait, what does she do? She goes out and records a POP album of all things. I'm sorry but there's little difference between her and Faith Hill or Shania Twain now. And have you seen her new video for \\"Ashes By Now\\"? It's DISGRACEFUL. She's obviously more interested in selling her body just like Faith and Shania. I nearly got sick watching her dance around in skimpy,tight outfits. I hope she's enjoyed \\"selling out\\" because she obviously didn't \\"reconsider\\". She needs to live by her own words.

It's also a modern country album, but retains a little bit of traditional country. \\"Ashes By Now\\" and \\"Does My Ring Burn Your Finger\\" are traditional, but not too traditional for me to enjoy.\\"Does My Ring Burn Your Finger\\" is the best song on the album and my favorite; the opening guitar work in the beginning is so magnificent that I keep putting that part on repeat, and her drawl expresses the attitude in the song. I love sassy attitude songs. :)The rest of the songs have enjoyable melodies except for \\"Lonely Too,\\" which doesn't stand out. \\"The Healing Kind,\\" \\"Why They Call It Falling,\\" and \\"Stronger Than I Am\\" are especially touching ballads.This is a very smooth album and it keeps the mellow mood throughout, even on the faster tempo songs. It's a fantastic album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Good, Just Not On The Same Level","review":"I have to agree (mostly) with Mark H. Dunkelman's review of Ms. Womack's new CD. It's wonderful, it's lushly orchestrated, and Ms. Womack has a voice that was meant to sing country music. But in having only recently discovered Ms. Womack's music, I must say that her first, self-titled album is the most \\"country\\" of her three projects. The newest title cut, \\"I Hope You Dance,\\" brilliantly straddles the fence between commercial potential and emotional depth. But if you really want to hear Lee Ann's Jacksonville, Texas roots, listen to \\"Never Again, Again\\" or \\"The Fool.\\" This latest album should not be missed as part of a collective body of her work, but she certainly has lost a little of what made her so comparable to Dolly Parton and other greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Even though this album isn't totally country, it still gives the amazing feeling.

In its place are smooth pop/alt arrangements with all the edges sanded down, lively and nice but sliding right past the ears. The few obviously country tracks are grouped in a ghetto at the end of the CD, starting at track #9, like someone was ashamed of them. Still, Womack has a magnificent voice, and the high concept title track (with Sons of the Desert) is possibly the year's best song; it could make up for the rest of the record. There are a few good moments, like the acoustic-based opener \\"The Healing Kind,\\" but overall I Hope You Dance is a deep disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECEIVED!","review":"Negative Stars!!!

This version has no connector on the unit, just a couple feet of 4 individual wires terminating in the 4 pin trailer plug. I understand that it's cheaper to manufacture this way, but it just looks cheesy, and now instead of the nice 4 wire flat cable I have 4 individual wires that I had to wire tie every 4 inches to keep under control exiting the vehicle.I would happily paid the extra dollar to have the decent cable with a connector on both ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"I was getting just over 9 volts to the brake lights at the trailer connector on my motorhome before I installed this unit.

Of Love and Shadows was pretty good, but then things started going downhill when Eva Luna came into the picture. And this, Daughter of Fortune (Hija de la Fortuna) has to be the low point. It is little more than one of those pink-jacketed historical romances you can buy at the drugstore. Just because the author throws in a ghost or two and some Chinese medicine doesn't make this book magical, spiritual, or deep. It doesn't even feel particularly historically accurate.

My sons are getting into playing with the footbags of their friends and requested some for Christmas. I saw the picture of 12 and thought that was what I was getting. Now, I'm just frustrated. One footbag is not enough and I'm going to have way to much invested in them. Wish it would have stated with the picture that you were only going to get one and at their selection. Can't comment on the quality since I know nothing about them...just know that is a lot of money for a bag of sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun... for a While","review":"I've only used a few footbags and sand tends to be my favorite.

It provides very broad coverage of the items on the exam objectives, and I had no problems passing my test with this book and plenty of Exchange experience.That said, the organization of the book is odd, the CD provided tests are long and behave strangely, and it seems the last chapter was added as an afterthought.Even so, I recommend this book.

I agree with all the other positive reviews so I won't repeat their content. One other thing to add, though, is how well this encyclopedia of information is indexed in the back of the book. It's very easy to \\"look something up\\" when you need to. I also read Redmond's Exchange Server 5.5 book, also a good resource but (in contrast) suffers from poor indexing (but goes much more in depth, as well), and also the MS Exchange connectivity guide. I completed a major Mail to Exchange conversion before taking the exam (good education in itself), and referenced these three books often.The excellent questions on the cd make this book not just a bargain but a steal. I had the new 30 question exam (no more easy adaptive questions), and scored well. I like what MS is doing to make this exam 'respectful' again."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST STUDY THE PRACTICE QUESTIONS","review":"As far as content, I found this book to be mediocre, ambiguous, and redundant.

I read the book from cover to cover, and have to say is quite compreensive.The author is no mark minasi when it comes to putting the words together. but i think he knows the topic very well though.Like the other reviewers said, the it lacks a chapter on disaster recovery, which is something you come across very often when working on a day to day basis with exchange like I do.overall, well done James Chellis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome reading for all ages","review":"When I picked this book up to read, I didn't put it down until I was finished.

Arguably a theme album, the mood achieved by Burdon is that of solitude and experience. The economy and holes of the music make more from less and art out of darkness. Great cuts include the title cut Winds of Change, The Black plague, Hotel Hell, San Franciscan Nights, and the beautiful Anything. Who would think that Eric's copy of the Stone's 'Paint it Black' would be so riviting. When I think of Honky Tonk Women, I think of Mic, but when someone says Paint it Black... well. If you've loved Eric on other albums when he said 'Bring it to me' or 'I'm Mad!' or if you appreciated Love Is... You'll have to have Winds of Change. It's a classic. Glad to see it on CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good ex-animal burdon outfit!","review":"Eric Burdon will be usually remembered as the singer of \\"THe house of the rising sun\\"... and his post-animal works are less mentioned... hey, this album, \\"Winds of Change\\" in 1967 surprisingly change my stereotype on him... a weird psychedelic album, half-spoken spontaneous lines with superb backing... title track, \\"Winds of Change\\", Burdon shouts a list of singers... a spoken mini history of rock and roll. \\"It's all meat\\" is a tricky work that he name lots of famous rockers (e.g. eric clapton) and commented \\"it's all meat...in the same bowl\\". Haha. THe best cut is \\"Hotel Hell\\", reverb trumpet sound fits the moody melody very well. A romantic song. Also, this album is with the hit \\"Sancisco nights\\". The only weak moment is the cover of Rolling Stones' \\"Paint it black\\". Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Animals in the summer of 69.","review":"The blues/rock style of the Animals changed in the summer of 69. Influenced by Jimi Hendrix, and the West Coast scene in Califonia, Eric Burden and a newly reformed Animals embarks on an experiment. The result is a classic mood piece of the times. Haunting in some aspects and rocking in others, this is truely a collector's item. The Animals interpretation of the Rolling Stones' 'Paint it Black' alone makes it a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Albun With Great Passion & Texture.","review":"Winds of ChangeThis has a good collection of happy & soulful songs. \\"San Franciscan Nights\\" is my favorite, \\"Hotel Hell\\" is a real soulful tune, and Eric Burdon does a great job on \\"Paint It Black\\" (which was done by the Rolling Stones). This kind of stuff would be a \\"breath of fresh air\\" if they played it on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airport lounge bookstore novel which did the trick","review":"'Spin' is not a good book in a literary sense, but it fulfils the need for a compelling read when you are trapped with a plastic tray in front of your knees at 30,000 feet.The story was suitably lurid, the narrative fast-paced, and the plot overly ambitious and somewhat unbelievable. The resulting combination therefore did the trick one dull weekend. It worked for me.For connoisseurs of the airport lounge bookstore novel, this is certainly not in the ranks of Michael Crichton or John Grisham, but it certainly does work well in that genre, and I didn't close the last page feeling that I had wasted the time I was trying to waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any soccer player","review":"I bought this for my nephew for his 7th birthday.

I'm sorry to say I did not know all this ship did for our great country in WWII. These types of lessons should be taught in the school system but sadly this and many other WWII history lessons of the great United States are not. I recommend this to everybody, young and old. It is a complete history of the Enterprise and her courageous men fighting the Japanese. The graphics are great and they explain each battle in easy to understand detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost unwatchable","review":"The whole show has this weird compass and chart text overlay pattern moving and zooming over all the real film scenes like a kaleidascope. As if you have to tell people they are real and old film clips as opposed to the cartoon recreation animationsthat make up the other half of the vido.. duh and really annoying flashes of 3-2-1 old movie end trailers like the film just ran out, lame lame lame. It hurts your eyes and makes you seasick.I would give it zero or one star but it has a FEW redeeming values, such as pretty good accuracy and the real film clips are \\"usually\\" from the battles they are talking about (but not always.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Show, Disappointing DVD Set","review":"I'll save space and say that I agree with the other posts that laud the show for it's quality and usefulness.Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ration as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But, just as the History Channel did with the Dogfight series, the DVDs are actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap direct to video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent show for getting kids interested in History","review":"When this originally aired on History Channel, my 10 year old son was glued to the TV every Friday night. He learned so much about the Enterprise and LOVED this show. He had tears in his eyes after the last episode when they scraped \\"The Big E\\". He really liked the music, the action, the CGI graphics, but the best part is he retained everything he learned. We had an opportunity to spend a Saturday afternoon with a local gentleman who was on Enterprise during WWII and he and my son really hit it off - all for the love of a ship. I just bought two copies of this series, one for my son and one for his new friend - the WWII Vet. For myself, I grew tired of seeing much of the same CGI and the constant music, but my son learned so much and became interested in other historical accounts of WWII that buying this is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle 360 season #1","review":"I've enjoyed the whole season and my only complaint isn't so much with what it presents but rather what it doesn't present. We certainly made blunders and didn't have the battle experience of the Japanese in the beginning. The quality of our torpedo's left a lot to be desired.(The controversies of the war are not shown maybe they are right.) I wish it showed more, that generation was simply amazing far beyond our widest dreams but there was racism in their too all the foibles of man and despite it they ended it in a charitable way.

Unfortunately, I was never able to get the thing to work properly. The software it comes with is really, really lousy to begin with. Bad doesn't just mean it is hard to use. It means it crashes in the middle of downloading to the player very, very often. You HAVE to use the software they give you as far as I could tell. One time it downloaded an MP3 and it crashed the player so that it wouldn't start-up properly anymore (it would hang as soon as it'd turn on). I've given up and returned the item. It's too bad because the player's design is super nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but it's badly designed","review":"Pros:The music sounds great and the amount of storage is sizable enough that you don't need to update/change the tracks frequently. The metal casing is very stylish and the dual use as a audio recorder really helps (ie. college lectures)Cons:The software is difficult to use because it collects a \\"database\\" of music by scanning your hard drive. Music can't be uploaded until the mp3 is in the database. If you're like me and download new music all the time, it becomes a hassle to update the database. The leather carrying case isn't designed well for headphones. The auxillary battery hangs on the edge and is a bit awkward.OVERALL:It's a good mp3 player if you're not going to walk around with it. Definitely NOT designed for athletic activity. Mine broke after 7 months (as many people have cited similar complaints). Consider the new smaller Mp3 players if you're an active person, or just wait and hopefully Samsung will come out with an improved version"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Mac-supported","review":"I bought this player for two reasons - 1) it came with an FM radio which I want when I travel 2) it is supposedly Mac-compatible. After an hour of messing around with it, I called support (and got help on the second try). The guy said that they were not going to support it for iTunes 2, so if you've stayed current with the Mac software, you cannot use this player. I found an old version of iTunes, which did work with the player, but you still cannot use the 2x compression, which was another selling factor for me. Too bad, I liked the unit, but need one that will be supported!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific product","review":"The Samsung Yepp 700H is, simply put, awesome. Everything about it is simply great. The sound quality (which you can change using the Equalizer), the look (sleek), and just about everything else.Still, there's a problem with it. A small one, but nonetheless very annoying:The volume. The default is very low, and it always resets when it turns off. I checked in the manual and it doesn't have anything on saving the volume default. Now this may seem like not a big deal, but it's annoying going into your pocket and taking it out of it's case (which is very tight on it), just to increase the volume. And the next time it turns off, you have to do it again. Boo...Still, all the positives null the only negative.Great product. I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I was looking for a mid-range mp3 player; what I got was a piece of garbage. I've had it a year now and it already doesn't work. If I press the power button to turn it on, it just cycles through powering on and off. Eventually I have to pull the battery out to make it finally shut off for good. Its not like I've abused it either. I would use it may once or twice a week to and from work (maybe 40min a day); when not in use, it would sit in a drawer. The battery life is not that great either; 128mb is not enough; the accompanying software must have been written by amateurs (beware XP users). At one point the software said I needed to buy a license to use it further; this after crashing multiple times during uploading of songs. Why would I want to waste more money?If you want a good player, spend the money for an ipod...I hear they're great; as you can read, I would give the same review for this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 Player","review":"This is a great MP3 player. It has great funtionability and an easy to read screen. It comes with 128mb on board, which is just huge and has the option to expand that memory with smartmedia. The compression option seems to work well and vastly improves the amount of music you can put on the player. I don't think the rechargeable battery quite reaches the advertised 20 hours of use and neither does a duracell ulta AAA reach the 12 hour mark. The voice recording function is neat, but I don't use it. I don't use the FM tuner much either. Download speeds are acceptable with USB 1.0 and beign compatible with USB 2.0 download speeds should be exceptional.All in all this is a great player and it is well worth it's price.

The Yepp is downright useless if you're listening to the thing while jogging; it's easy to hit the wrong button when trying to rewind or fast forward and I often find myself having to stop to set things right.2) Shoddy materials and construction. Mine has been subjected to fairly light use, but the finish on the corners is worn through and the battery compartment is held shut by a piece of electrical tape. Battery won't hold a charge.3) Sorry software. Limited, clunky and unintuitive.This is the first electronic item that I've reviewed on Amazon.

The pouch is also not designed to accomodate the earphone jack, so you have to walk around with the pouch flap hanging open all the time.

I also have great affection for the protest singers of the 60s and 70s, but this is not that, either. Gee, war is bad, Nanc? Thanks for pointing that out. The lyrics on this one have all the profundity of a slightly slow 12 year old. As someone with degrees in English and Women's Studies, I was insulted by \\"Back When Ted Loved Sylvia.\\" The track where Nanci tries scat-singing sounds like she is being poked with a sharp stick. Throughout, I was very surprised someone on the staff producing this did not point out that changing your vocal timbre and volume drastically in the space of three notes is jarring and unpleasant. Very very unimpressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Looking...","review":"I first heard \\"Last of the True Believers\\" maybe 5 years after it was first released.

This cd is garbage- Nanci must have given up the beautiful,painful,joyful,longing,emotions that spilled off of her wonderful albums,from the haunting, \\"Late Night Grand Hotel\\" or the longing, \\"Flyer\\",or the playful,\\"The last of the True Believers\\". No,what we have here is a self imposed , self rigtheous ,and sadly to say,self serving lefty! . SAY IT AIN'T SO NANCY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical Beauty, Rhythmic Grace","review":"This is a wonderfully fresh work, filled with lyrical and rhythmic grace and beauty. You will not find a single note of angst here. It is light, airy, and at times gently serious, but it never takes itself too seriously. It strikes a delicate balance between being serious modern music and music meant for pure pleasure. It is a truly enjoyable experience to listen to this symphony. This album can serve as an excellent introduction to Glass's work, and also a gentle way to inspire someone's interest in exploring more serious modern works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic and familiar, surprisingly so","review":"As an avid Brian Eno and David Bowie Fan, and being only marginally aware of Philip Glass as a contemporary composer, I was surprised by this recording. I expected the basic melodies to be either missing, obscured, or altered beyond recognition. I was wrong. The originals are easily recognizable in Glass' composition. In fact, while it was lovely to hear full orchestral arrangements of the compelling Eno/Bowie melodies, by the end of the Symphony, I found that I wanted Glass to take more liberties. Regardless, this is a fine recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Glass world.","review":"Although Bowie and Eno form the 'start point' for this album, Glass (as he explains in his notes) uses this as a point from which to develop ideas of his own, which gradually cohere into a complete symphonic movement. Although there are clear echoes of Bowie/Eno, this is very much a classical piece, with Glass' trademark pulsing, driving rhythmns, and slow, rolling melodies. Rich, relaxing stuff, well performed and recorded. Just not exceptional enough to deserve the full five stars. Well worth acquiring if you enjoy Glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE OVERLANDERS","review":"I'm probably prejudiced a. for being Australian, and b. for having seen this movie soon after it came out. Chips Rafferty was always one of my heroes! To modern eyes, the movie is probably stilted and old fashioned, but the story behind it is true and the photography and scenery is great. It's an early Australian classic. Ignore the appalling cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spencer Brade, MD","review":"I was so happy to get the copy of a book I had read 60-some years ago.

The first few chapters explain the thought process behind the rating process and provide an introduction into the structured finance world of thinking. The second half goes into more depth about actual rating processes. The third part addresses asset specific issues (auto, airlines, etc...) While the last few chapters of the book review more advanced methods of analysis.For people with little or no knowledge of the structured finance field, the first half of the book will provide a good understanding of the subject, the 2nd half of the book will probably required more time and effort to fully appreciate its value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a must have!!!

It's almost sad to read a review from someone who just read the cliff notes. Come on now, do we really need to hear from you? This is my favorite Dickens novel so far, and though I haven't read them all, I loved everything about it. Though the ending is happy, it is by no means a Hollywood ending. Would recommend to any SERIOUS reader that wants to read authentic period prose and a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"my recommendation","review":"I thing Great Expectation is a great book in many way such as the Themes, the Character and the Writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The character of Pip made me feel quite sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve himself and become the gentleman finally. There are many character of this book that also made this book very interesting follow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to love this book","review":"and I very nearly did.For the first half to three quarters I was utterly and completely amazed. The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get entertained with Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my high school years. Get entertained with Mr. Joe and her violence towards Pip and her husband Mr. Joe Gargery.Also, Pip travels to France to become a gentlemen, which is one of the best parts of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but riveting end","review":"Great Expectations is hailed as a one of the great masterpieces in literature and for good reason. However, it does drag in the beginning and current audiences may not be able to fight through to reap the rewards this book gives out. Also, the language used in the book is not used currently in use and may throw off some readers. Midway threw the book I was enjoying Great Expectations, but disappointed in the pace and flow and ready for it to quicken. But it did and I was enthralled with the final 200 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - if you read it all.","review":"This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting. So much irony and so many twists is what really kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one of those books that you look forward to the end but when it comes you sit back and wish there was more. It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobo Philosopher","review":"This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style. He is the Master.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Free Kindle Edition","review":"Enough has been said about the book itself by others who are far more qualified--I've read it and I like it. I'll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Kindle books (especially free ones) can be very hit and miss. The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic that never fails","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in high school and also enjoy watching one of the old B&W; movie versions if it happens to come on TV.

Thanks to a great teacher, we were able to get through this book without too many difficulties; however, I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not want to invest a while in reading it! I took us the whole second semester to finsh this book, doing most of the reading at home. While most everyone was engrossed in the storyline, it was like pulling teeth to actually read! I really enjoyed the story, but I would raher just remember the story than refresh my memory by rereading it because, face it, the story is just too long!P.S.Since I feel this is such a great story, instead of reading the book, might I recommend watching the movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class.

I was forced to read it for freshman honors English, or I would have stopped reading it. It has a good plot, but because Dickens was paid by the word, he added too many useless details. I really didn't enjoy dinner scenes that lasted for 17,000 chapters without revealing anything remotely important. However, the way the characters intertwined was fascinating. If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape. Only read the book if you're going to be quizzed on it the next day. I don't know if all Dickens is this bad, but I'll not read any more of his books until I'm forced to for my next English class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Bestseller","review":"Great Expectations was not that great of a novel.

I was made to read it in English and I soon realized not far in that it was very boring. It's not a good book for highschool readers. It is written in very dull and boring text. I mean the theme is great and all but the language and storyline stinks. I would not ever read this book again and if I had a choice to get this book or nothing i wouldn't get anything.

It is a timeless story of a young man (love-stricken from young childhood) growing to adulthood by means of a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Jaggers, John Wemmick, Biddy, Matthew and Belinda Pocket, Bentley Drummle, the Aged Parent, and Miss Skiffins are just a few of the absolutely marvelous characters that Dickens created for his story. And how could I forget Estella Havisham, the object of Pip's (christened Phillip) affection? Mr. and Mrs. Joe get a fair part of the story, and they are both delightful - one, because she is so horrible, and the other, because he is so good. A few of the more minor characters (the aformentioned Miss Skiffins is one) such as Trabbe's boy and The Avenger are superb even though they may only speak a few words. If I could give it ten stars, I would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My honors english class read this!","review":"I reallly liked this book, though it made me tired to read it and I could not have any distractions while I read, I am really glad I did. This book was a good challenge if you stick to it. The book all comes together at the end if you keep reading. The characters are really deep. My teacher says the best thing about Great Expectations is it has a twisted plot line and the worst thing about Great Expectations is that it has a twisted plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the book, except the last two chapters.

While I think it is better suited for the college level, I can't say that I found it much more enjoyable the second time. The story revolves around the coming-of-age of Pip, the main character. Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman. There are some interestingly eccentric characters, and the book relies more on the characters themselves than the plot. However, this is an example of Dickens' wordiness becoming too cumbersome; it simply couldn't maintain my interest throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I have undertaken to read as many classics as I can, and this one is one of my favorites.

I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!

I think only ONE subplot was actually straightforward, and that would be Miss Havisham and her ex lover.Basically, I got halfway through this book, then fled to Sparknotes. I wasn't going to read it.

Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained \\"classic\\" status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Estella in Great Expectations.","review":"After doing numerous analysing on the novel, I find Estella the least developed of all the main characters in the book.

Unlike most of the people in my class, I read the whole book and liked it. The book is about a young English boy named Phillip \\"Pip\\" Pirrip living in 1800s England. He is the son of a blacksmith and then is invited to play at an old woman's house. The impression Pip gets from the old woman and her daughter is that Pip isn't good enough. From then on, he grows up and tries to get better for his life after getting a fortune, but things go downhill from that as he gets deep in debt and becomes ill. This book is by no means perfect and has plenty of flaws. The book is way too wordy and could probably be half as long as it is and still get a good point across.

Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not. Further, it makes me wonder what else in the story was horribly wrong......Great novel, but don't buy it from Aladdin.

What I found is that giving Dickens my full attention (vs. listening while e.g. doing yardwork, driving, etc.) really made a huge difference in my experience of this book - because there are do many delightful nuggets throughout this book! It was rewarding and fun to see in my mind's eye, and take pleasure in, the huge banquet of tasty and very often humorous nuggets offered.

I have taken great joy in reading Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and even Tolkien. At least Tolkien went on and on, it was with purpose and there was a point.

But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good. But even the best of author's can have a mess-up every now and then and \\"Great Expectations\\" is certainly not one that I would recommend reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a Dickens fan","review":"I know, I know...I'm just a stupid high school student who's brain has been fried by television. I was forced to read this novel in 11th grade and I couldn't finish it. Must be because I play too many video games, right?I'm a freshman in college now, and I still hate Dickens. Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" was a page-turner for me, and \\"Huck Finn\\" is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer. I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I'm surprised that this book is a requirement in highschool.

I've read Jane Eyre before this and it was a real page turner. This is plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many COINCIDENCES!!","review":"Great Expectations has a few interesting characters. I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book.

The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students).

Along the way he meets a cast of character who represent the entire range of human nature: devotion, strength, treachery, level-headedness, and brutality.\\"Great Expectation\\" is a classic because of its relentless exposure of truth about the human condition--the condition in which decency and sanity are maintained at a high price, and innocence not at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"BY FAR ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS","review":"I think this book is so good, it doesn't need to be explained.

While Pip's maturation and moral education forms the heart of novel with his usual array of unforgettable characters, such as Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Jaggers, and of course Pip.

We had already started the novel when the cd's came in. Because the cd's were not marked according to chapter, it was difficult to find the starting point each time we used the cd's. I would have liked to have chapters to correspond with the tracks for easy listening. On the up side, it was easier for the kids to follow along once we did find the spot, and the animated voices brought the story to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations Review","review":"Is it an understatement to say that Great Expectations is a Classic? The variety of characters weaved within the story would be interesting enough, but the concept of the story is fascinating as well. Dickens also is a great writer and it is seen in every one of his stories, and especially, here, with Great Expectations. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to read or would not have","review":"My daughter had to read this for an extra credit assignment.

First of all, if Estella hit me like she did pip, I would have hit her back!! All the women in this book seem like stuck up b****es! Even the movie wasn't the best. I figured it would have made more sense than the book did, but I was wrong! You can barely understand what they say! Well, I just don't like the book, or the movie.

In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly. The plot speeds and dies down, goes somewhere sometimes and goes nowhere even faster more often, and brings up characters who have no real purpose. Dickens is accused of being \\"wordy,\\" and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories. No wonder so-called classics like \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\" is heaped in a drudgery of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was better than i remeber...","review":"I was forced to read this in school and despised it with a passion. I read it again recently, for some reason, and was surprised at how much I liked it. I guess the reason I didn't like the first time was because I was forced to read it; it's that 'Peace forced is tyranny' mentality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations is pretty good.","review":"This novel was pretty good. I liked how everyone's lives in it were somehow connected. I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"i am sorry but this book was boring, in my opinion of course. i was forced to read it in english. this is one of those books that i had to physically sit myself down and force myself to read it. i didn't like a majority of this book and i'm glad we are done reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I read this book for my Honors English class and it was terrible! There were so many irrelevant things that were going on that I had to force myself to read 2 chapters a day. The test for Great Expectations was hard because no one could understand the plot. Just imagine a bunch of straight A students getting an average of 75% on the test. This book is outdated, and old English seems as if it is an entire different language. I would give this a negative rating if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"I was required to read this book for english class and I must say it is by far the worst book I have ever read.

I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a very big disappontment","review":"This book was a very big disappontmet. I thought this book could have had a couple minor plot changes. I also thought the way the main charictor, Pip, transfored through his expectations was shallow and padanthic.

At the end of the first phase he goes to London to become a \\"gentleman\\" because that is what his benefactor wants (Pip doesn't know his benefactor). At the end of the 2nd phase, he finds out who his benefactor is. Those two phases in the book are really boring, but I think it gets better in the end. If you read this book I suggest that you just start in the third phase because the rest is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage by Dickens","review":"Boring, pointless story of a pathetic imbecile whose life seems to be not much more than a bizarre journey through an insane asylum.

I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alpen 788","review":"This scope has very good optic which only shows signs of blurring at very high magnifications.

Besides being very expensive, most of the book covers other subjects other than XML, with little relevance to XML. Although there is some useful information on using XML with Java, there is way too much information on the Microsoft implementation of XML, (when the book actually gets around to mentioning XML) and the standardized W3 version of XML seems to be included as an afterthought. The reviewers who gave this book such a high rating probably didn't read the book very well, or are hired by the publisher. A much better book is the Liz Castro Quickstart guide to XML (for a fourth of the price of the Deitel!), although it is centered around the W3's standard for XML, and doesn't mention Microsoft's implementation. Castro text, however, is more suited to learning from the ground up. The Deitel text is a disaster and I wish that I had just kept my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complimentary book to E-business and E-commerce","review":"I bought this text thinking it would compliment the E-business and E-commerce How to Program text (it was recommended that way).

However, if you are someone who likes games with a story or purpose, I wouldn't recommend it. Nintendogs is sort of a \\"live your doggy life\\" game. It's not a game where your on a mission or have to complete something.

I have studied Forrest for the past 20 years and though I am a Southerner I have come to very different opinions than Mr. Ward. I just don't have the temerity to publish those opinions as facts. What bothers me most about this work, besides the historical untruths, are Mr. Ward's comments about Shelby Foote, a very recognized author and historian of the Memphis area.

Cannonball, the apparent precursor to the comedy movie series \\"Cannonball Run\\" stars young David Carridine as Coy \\"Cannonball\\" Buckman as he embarks on an illegal trans american race to bring his racing career back. This film has great chase sequences and a good story to back itself up. Cannonball is the perfect popcorn film for any gearhead or action fan. Granted it was made in the 70's and has those 70's style moments, it still is a top-notch car film on par with the classics like \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" and \\"Vanishing Point\\". Buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth your time","review":"I'm a big fan of the car chase/road trip cult films from the 1970's, so I thought this film would be worth checking out. I wasn't expecting anything Oscar-worthy or mind-blowing from the script, the dialogue or the plotline, but I was hoping for some decent car chases and/or crashes. I got neither. 'Cannonball Run II' was more enjoyable than this, and HB Halicki's films had better acting and dialogue than this puppy did.It's only worth seeing to cross off the list.

David Carradine, Veronica Hamel, Bill McKinney (forever famous as the deranged hillbilly rapist from DELIVERANCE), Mary Woronov, Gerrit Graham (so funny in USED CARS), Robert Carradine, Belinda Balaski from THE HOWLING, Sylvester Stallone, Dick Miller, Martin Scorsese (yes, you read that right), Paul Bartel (also the director), Carl Gottlieb (JAWS)...quite a line-up for a 70s drive-in movie!And the cars are awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hit the gas,Grasshopper!\\"","review":"Before David Carradine experienced a career revival of sorts in Quentin Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill\\" movies&crossed; swords with The Bride,Uma Thurman,he was Cannonball,A Man on the Run.The plot is completely nonsensical;it involves a cross-country race.David Carradine gets helped by car geeks,has a strange convenience store brawl,shows off his chest for no reason whatsoever&a; squeaky voiced Marilyn Monroe lookalike goes to bed with an unpleasingly plump bad guy.Okay,it's a cross country race,David Carradine has to win to clear his name--it's good dumb fun.Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for anyone trying to understand socio-economic class in the U.S.","review":"Like \\"Framework for Understanding Poverty\\" this book was a paradigm-shifter for me.

If I had to pick my favorite Scopions recording it would be Lonesome Crow. Featuring then 15-year old Michael Schenker on guitar, \\"Lonesome Crow\\" is a hypnotic journey into a richly- textured soundscape. The mystical songs are washed in a myriad of swirling, ambient tonal colors and shades. The bass and drums work expertly to blend jazz and rock influences to provide a vehicle for Schenker's enigmatic , classically-influenced solos. If you are a Scorpions fan and you like the older ones like \\"In Trance\\" , get this one. You'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"Waiting for years for this release on CD. This is the best Scorpions. It is crued but it still surpasses anything that they've done.

Sometimes a young mind is the best creative mind. Innoccent & not mainstream. Expressive & not polished. Check out the lineup. Both the Schenker's are here. Get it raw & right from the young Scorpions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Sound From A Familiar Band","review":"Having been turned on to this band many years ago by an album called \\"In Trance\\"; I wanted to experience their earlier releases. They had two albums: \\"Fly To the Rainbow\\" and \\"Lonesome Crow\\" of which I had purchased both. It is true what people say, the first album is like nothing you have heard before. At first, you wonder what the hell are they playing. But after hearing the whole album, you realize that they have created a unique sound based on that time period. Think of the music Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin were playing around that time? The Scorpions just added their German influence to that medium. If you are a true fan of Scorpions' music - this is a must have album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music But CD Doesn't Play Loud Enough","review":"Scorpions \\"Lonesome Crow\\" is a great album. But this version of the cd does not play loud enough. I have three other Scorpions cds: \\"Fly To The Rainbow\\" (Japanese Import), \\"In Trance\\" (Japanese Import) and \\"Virgin Killer\\" (France Import). The three cds play 2 or 3 times louder than the \\"Lonesome Crow\\" cd when you put it on the same volume of the cd player or mp3 player. It is unfortunate when a record label does not do a good job with recording a cd with full volume like a cd should play. Especially with 24 bit remastering available to use. Japan is re-releasing \\"Lonesome Crow\\" on a SHM (Super High Material) CD. Hopefully it will play much louder than this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"what the scorps really sounded like.","review":"excellent packaging version of the 1982 reissue version from heavy metal worldwide label, excellent artwork, excellent remastering, and hey finally lonesome crow with lyrics, although I still wish they would rerelease the original full cover ,with rare photos and maybe bonus tracks from those sessions,(unlike the cheap import copy with bonus tracks from virgin killer)this version of lonesome crow is a must get for music collectors and scorpions fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonesome Crow","review":"This album was released in 1972 only Germany.Klaus Meine and Michael Schenker had just joined his brother Rudolf's band that he had formed in 1965.The album was rereleased in 1983.A rare find in original form with an awsum picture on the front and back The album was also recorded on clear vinyl.The music is definatly scorpions rock however it is primative ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Years before Kenny Wayne Shepard, there was Michael Schenker","review":"This is the first and most distinctive Scorpions release. Before they reduced themselves to being German hard rock balladeers, the Scorpions actually had considerable musical chops. In their first incarnation, the Scorpions effortlessly fused early 70's heavy rock with jazz and classical elements. Given the fact of the music's depth, it's hard to believe that Michael Schenker was only 16 years old when Lonesome Crow was initially released (1972). What I'm about to say is probably going to offend a lot of rock fans, but I think Michael Schenker compromised his musical integrity by joining UFO. Needless to say, the Scorpions also undermined their integrity after Uli Roth left the fold. Lonesome Crow represents the Scorpions at their progressive hard rock zenith, a point they would never reach again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The one-star rating is for the Kindle product, not for Steiner's writing.The Kindle product is not the 220-page text as advertised.

It is a story of a middle-aged basketball coach and his last chance for redemption. It is suppose to be loosely based on a true story (whatever that means). Gene Hackman does a great job as the coach with Dennis Hopper as a supporting actor.Of course every body knows that all Indiana boys play basketball, just nail a basket to the side of a barn and start shooting, right? Unfortunately basketball is more than simply shooting the ball through a goal.The movie is set in Indiana in 1951, a little before my time as a high school basketball player. It does raise some questions with me such as how much difference can a coach make at the high school level? Mine made all the difference in the world, but I was fortunate to have Coach Jerry Wayne Shelton. I suspect they can make less of a difference at the colligate level.Highly recommended for any one who played high school basketball.Gunner March 2008"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underachieving film about overachievers","review":"This film starts out promisingly with some beautiful photography showing Indiana in the fall. It soon bogs down to repetitious basketball footage and cliche characters going about their wretched lives pointlessly.

To me, it was like being hit in the face continually with a basketball for the better part of two hours.Oh well, it beats watching the NBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mon Dieu!","review":"This must be the worst, most pathetic film I have seen. I bought this movie because I like Gene Hackman. The movie is boring and slow moving. I have never been to Indiana, and now I am sure I NEVER wish to go there. The movie is full of drab, dull, lifeless and bleak scenes. The acting is okay, and the music is good. What is so exciting about a school winning a state championship? This happens all the time. Why do they make a movie of this? I highly suggest NOT purchasing this movie. This movie is a total waste of time and money. I would have rated it with zero stars, but it would not let me do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the 2-disc Collector's Edition, not the Blu-Ray","review":"Buying the blu-ray of this cherished film is a veritable waste of money.

As a high school student athlete, I played ball in some of the gyms that were used during the filming. So it is a little hard for me to be objective.The VHS copy of Hoosiers I bought several years is ago was always fun to watch, but until I saw the widescreen DVD, I'd forgotten what a beautiful film it really is. The movie is loosely based on, or inspired by, a team from tiny Milan (MY'-LUN) that won the Indiana state championship in 1954. In fact, one of the players from that '54 team has a minor role in the movie.With an Oscar-nominated performance by Dennis Hopper as \\"Shooter\\", HOOSIERS may be what basketball fans, even those not from Indiana, will enjoy watching as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray transfer is awful","review":"This Blu-ray transfer is just awful for such a great film. The colors are all washed out and the color contrasts are no different than what I would see on DVD.

You want this little David team to beat the big, bad Goliaths so bad you can feel it. This movie is not just about a little team that beats a big one; it works because it humanizes each player on the \\"little\\" team, and so we cheer when each one rises to the occasion to overcome his particular short-coming: the shorty, the preacher's son, the son of the drunk, the doubting Thomas.

The boys, in a sense, need a chance to enter the state basketball finals in the spring of 1952. The town people of the small Indiana town do not respect him at first. The female teacher, (played well by Barbara Hershey) the first he meets, is cold toward him as well. And yet, he is able to push his boys to the state tournament. Sheb Wooley is a \\"good ole boy\\" principal who is very encouraging toward his long-time friend. Having grown up in the 50's, (I entered the first grade in the fall of 1952) while living in a small central Kentucky town, the gnostalgia did affect me positively.

I enjoyed it most thoroughly, and my only regret is that there are only three more to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the series reader, but not the most exciting.....","review":"Not the most action packed of the novels, however, the storyline and history are as always fun to follow..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully disappointing","review":"I am an absolute devotee of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series. I have read all of them at least three times each. But \\"The Yellow Admiral\\" appalled me. I was certain within fifty pages that it had been written by someone else who had picked up all of O'brian's turns of phrase, but none of his wit or heart. I wrote an indignant letter to the publisher demanding my money back, but then never sent it. It's embarrassing to admit how passionately I feel about this - I mean, it's only a book, right? But this book was so poorly done it would have been funny had I not been so eagerly awaiting it. Diana's pronouncements on sex! and Sophie's transformation to a shrew! Sir Joseph's tortured explanations re: Stephen's character to a clerk! I would have been far happier had it never been published - it was like watching close friends disintegrate before my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"O'Brian is running out of steam. So what?","review":"There is an awful lot of recycling going on in this book. The research is still prodigious, but I suspect at this point O'Brian has the topography and culture of early 19th Century Europe so much a part of him that he is now on automatic pilot. Well, he's entitled at this point. As usual, situations and characters are introduced, then never heard from or of again. Maturin's naivete is a more than a bit tiresome at this point. Nonetheless, I look forward to the next one and see how Jack deals with Napoleon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so much action, but still satisfying.","review":"Yes, it's true there is a bit more description of the rights of English landlords in the nineteenth century than I would have liked. There is less actual sailing than in previous books, so this volume doesn't have the sense of motion that O'Brian portrays so well. Yet this remains a fascinating book. True to form, O'Brian describes life in it's nitty-gritty detail, whether it's the horrendous personal violence of Bonden's boxing match, or the consequences of Jack's infidelity, yet the eloquence of his description and the sympathy for the characters that O'Brian evokes keeps the reader deeply involved. It's not as much of an adventure story as previous books, yet there is an agreeable sense of community and familiarity when all the characters are staying with one another on land. And of course the ending makes you want to read the next one immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivetting, yet the \\"happy ending\\" must come next book","review":"In typical O'Brian fashion, the current state of our heroes is reversed in this book. Here we find Aubrey on the downgrade, while Maturin is repairing the damage done him in the previous episode. Certainly a rivetting story that is a pleasure to read, yet the real \\"happy ending\\" is left 'til the next installment (we hope!) For those looking solely for naval action, this book is not the best of series. Most of the plot involves Aubrey's difficulties on land and admiralty politics. Personally, I couldn't put it down and am yearning for the next installment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conrad O'Brian gets lost","review":"This last in the series was obviously thrown together. I believe that O'Brian said he was not going to write any more than 21...this is an afterthought. The story is erratic and themes are left un-solved. Apart from that, for afficiandos its worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleasant experience","review":"While a more than adequate insight into everyday life in the England of George III, this book serves the uninitiated reader of O'Brian's work poorly. Nothing much takes place during the story, and what little as does, takes place offstage, as it were. Characters and events are introduced that lead no where and serve no purpose other than to fill the page. While the real world is often like that, works of art are not the real world, and novels are not documentaries. I was grossly disappointed in this book, as I had read such wonderful things about this series, and I will give O'Brian another chance, but I did not find any charcters other than Aubrey and Maturin to be given any definition, and their characters were more described than shown. Reading The Yellow Admiral (a pretentious title providing no insight into the plot nor encouragement to the reader) was not a pleasant experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imprescindible para ubicarse sensatamente en la vida","review":"Teologia y Sensatez (Theology and Sanity).

If you are interesting in learning a little about theology, I would read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book that I Use For My Catechism Class!!!","review":"The late Frank Sheed (a Roman Catholic from Australia) wrote this book in the 1940s during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII. It was later republished by Ignatius Press and remains one of the most essential and unforgetable Catholic books in America.He talks greatly about free will, the creation of Man, the test of Angels and Men, the difference between free will and predestination (the Protestant Calvinist notion), the Sacrifice of the Mass, and more importantly---WHO IS GOD?I love it because it is a great in depth book of understanding Catholic Theology. The Scripture quotations are from the Douay Rheims Bible and the Revised Standard Version: Catholic Edition.I recommend this book for all Catholics and non-Catholics as well. It was one of the best textbooks I used for catechism class in my parish church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overview for the Catholic world view","review":"This is the most comprehensive overview I have read regarding the overall Catholic philosophy. If you are not Catholic, you may be offended by the basic assertion that the Catholic view of the cosmos is the sane view.

For this purpose, this book is even better than the Catechism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Haven't finished the whole thing quite yet, but I'm very impressed by the book! It takes a very logical approach through theology and attends to many vital fundamental issues. If I could make one criticism, it's that Sheed seems to assume a certain amount of theological background at some times, but then later proceeds to discuss (in detail) things that such a background would presumably already contain. That's nit-picking to the max, though.Once again: great read, great theology, great stuff overall.

You really never know with Sasha...his sets can be either very emotional trance or dark twisted progressive...this album, amazingly, intertwines the two into a sonic masterpiece. Listening to it as a whole is a journey. It's slow yet twisted, upbeat yet soft, a sea of conflicting emotions...pure Sasha! You don't know whether to be happy or sad or neither, but you know you should be moving!

I'll say it again...my FIRST listen to it was disappointing. Each successive listen has improved dramatically. This is not the DJ in Sasha...this is the producer. The album starts off with an airy 80's sound to it...very mellow, no beats. By song 5, it really picks up.Sasha's brillance shines in this individual sounds. They are spectacular! Each song has a raw energy sense to it.Oh! I forgot to mention...there are a lot of breakbeat tunes on this album...intermixed with ethereal chill tunes. I like the way he arranged the album. The breaks are similar to BT's Fibonacci Sequence, if you want a slight perspective.Listen to this album late night..after drinking a bottle of red wine (which you drink all for yourself)..and you're lost in Sasha's world!Worth checking out.Again, this is not the DJ in Sasha..but the producer.

You can't even dance to this..The CD is not even mixed, each track is separated.Very dissapointed in both SASHA and John Digweeds new releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Sasha I know.........","review":"Consider this one in the chillout category. You won't hear any Xpander, Global Underground, club type sounds you would expect from this master. This is his first artist album and it shows how much he experiments with lots of almost ambient type of soundscapes. Really beautiful music but just really not my type. That is why I only gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"I was very excited about this disc. I have all of the Sasha/Digweed and Global Underground CDs and I knew what to expect. At least I thought so. Sasha seems to have reverted to 80s synthesizer music that has no purpose. A decent beat doesn't make itself known until the 4th song. I can't get rid of this CD fast enough. Normally I give these CDs some time to \\"grow on me,\\" but not with this one. My suggestion--give this CD some serious thought before you purchase. I'm very disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring!!!","review":"I don't know what most people who rated this album gave such a awesome rating.

Just very disappointed in Sasha."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE drool WHIPE cough ROLL OVER sigh!","review":"This is just horrible! It's so harmless and un-offensive! There is nothing here that rocks or \\"moves\\" me. It is totally void of hypnotic and trippy progressive trance tunes that fans of Sasha have become accustomed to. It's like easy-listening elevator electronica or something! And anything that tries to rock sounds so unoriginal and repetitious. I don't know. I can't say exactly what went wrong here. It's just awful and anyone that says otherwise are just loyal fans trying to be nice.But, let's be more accurate! Even if this was meant to be a \\"chillout\\" CD , even then it should still have some music on it that \\"moves\\" you...and it doesn't. It just makes me yawn.A great DJ doesn't necessarily make a great producer. Having the skills to create euphoria by mixing similar records together is entirely different than having the skills to produce great records yourself. ......still a great DJ but this wasn't ready to go out the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Deep Trance, great trip...","review":"I was eagerly anticipating Sasha's next CD since he hasn't released anything in almost 2 years. This CD is very trancy and deep, it is definitely the Sasha that I know. I agree with the other reviews that mentioned that this CD is not really dance music. I listen to most of my CD's when I drive, and in my opinion, this CD is great driving music because it's very spacey and makes you feel like you're on some journey to nowhere. I usually dont listen to dance CD's in my car because I really cant dance in my car, especially when I'm behind the wheel; makes sense if you think about it.Anyway, it's a great CD. Well worth the wait :-P"},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est le meilleur du trance","review":"Pour ceux qui sont amateurs du travail réalisé par Sacha sachez que c'est probablement ce qu'il à fait de mieux.

Requiem, Golden arm et wavy gravy sont absolument jouissif! une femme, un spa, du champagne et Airdrawndagger pendant qu'il neige... c'est génial :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy Electronica For Those Who Can See Past the Glowsticks and Strobes","review":"Disputeably, Sasha's most controversial album amongst his fans. Airdrawndagger has Sasha exploring the dreamier side of electronica versus pleasing those on the dancefloor. The album is not a true mixed set when condidering Sasha's choice to minimally blend (and sometimes not at all) the featured tracks. Defintely not for the tastes of all, but should be appreciated by fans who support a broader spectrum of electronica and by those that realise it doesn't always have to be about popping a couple of pills and dancing to an uplifting set at some nightclub.4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow & Low (That Is, In Fact, the Tempo)","review":"A great price for an album that I thought I'd never see again (lost in a move). Do not judge him by his partnership w/ Digweed: Sasha's debut solo is the chillout lounge you go to after wrecking the dance floor, only to find yourself bobbing to the infectious beats with an energy you thought you had already expended. This album is in my opinion a modern classic.Favorite Track: Mr. Tiddles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic North Is Amazing!","review":"There is something soft and beautiful about Magnetic North and the rest of this amazing album by Sasha. It's very different than his previous original work the excellent Xpander EP. The album has floaty ambient qualities which takes you on a trance journey. If you are looking for full on trance like the Global Underground or Northern Exposure stuff then this CD is not for you. If you are looking for something to make you feel good then definitely check this release out."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is quite simply the best single electronic album I have ever heard.

Although it has some brilliant moments, I was dissappointed that no where in the album did I say to myself \\"that's freaking brilliant!\\" If your looking for a more subdued sasha...this is it, but it lacks the sasha \\"stamp\\" of trademark boogie. Borrow a friends but not worth your investment dollar...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Sasha?????","review":"I don't know what went wrong, but latest albums from the best djs like Sasha and Paul Oakenfold are really far away from the \\"magic music\\" they used to play for the global underground series, they became kings in the field of progressive house and for any reason they started to explore in others different fields.This new album from Sasha unfortunately is not what we all his fans were expecting, be ready for chill out, the party is over!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleeds potential....but needs work","review":"I was kind of looking forward to this album ,considering everything i had heard about it, so i listented to it 2 times all the way through and wanted to break someting. It is overall a very relaxing album that peaks nicely with spots of genius, but the whole album seemed choppy from song to song. The Quiet parts were too long and tempted me a lot to fast forward,and the worst part is that the good parts are so good that it almost seems like two different people were making this album. Who ever made this album obviously has enough talent to do a little better. Part of me thinks that this was just some exrcise in editing and production to try to push the boundries of what one could call an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no...","review":"Well, I guess this is just not my cup of tea.

This is a trip that i will never forget... sasha manages to take u everywhere in this journey... melodic breaks and smooth uplifting symphonies bring to mind the peaceful and serene atmosphere of mountain raves...where its just u and nature...and the music..so take of ur shoes...get comfortable and relax...cause u dont know where ur gonna end up this time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best original album by a DJ this year","review":"The great thing about this album is that I would be able to put it on before and/or after going out to a club.

Makes oakenfold's attempt to write an original album seem laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say the least","review":"This is far by my most favorite CD. It fits into all my favorite kinds of techno. I loved Xpander but this just tops it. It seems more complex and it just sounds cooler than any of the other techno CD's I own. So if I could I'd give this a 10.The CD starts out with a interesting yet peaceful start with Dremples.Then goes into Mr. Tiddles and has kinda a sneaky game type music. The it folds into a spacey kinda song, Magnetic North.Then the pace sorta picks up in Cloud Cuckcoo. Things just get faster and more ravish like from there, but never hits the point where you could really dance to it. Immortal-Bloodlock are like that, then it takes a sudden twist into a soft almost romantic type song, one of my favorites. Then speeds things up to end the CD, by going into Golden Arm and finishes perfectly with Wavy Gravy, my favorite song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell's book is best read in tandem with Garrard's book.","review":"I plan to use both the Bissell and the Garrard book on Artemisia Gentileschi in my Baroque Art History class this Spring.

While not at all hostile to feminist interpretations of the painter, chiefly Mary Garrard's, Bissell is refreshingly skeptical and respectfully critical of many of their key points. Bissell is a more traditional art historian than I myself prefer, but one can't find better art history than this.

The chopped up versions usually shown on TV are pretty good, but the real thing is like a completely different movie. The parts cut out are key to both plot and character development. Maybe the best example is Madonna's role, which is far more nuanced [and likeable] than the flat one in the usual TV version.

I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes the idea of women in major league baseball, or comedies. Great movie, 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"This film drew attention to a largely forgotten footnote in the history of American baseball, the All American Girls Professional Baseball League, a league of female players who began when the major league men went off to fight WWII and who managed to endure until 1954. That is perhaps its greatest achievement. As a film, it is a pretty formulaic story of reliable stock characters bonding and enduring adversity with a big showdown at the World Series at the end. Penny Marshall's direction is efficient, the cast is very good, and the script by Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz provides some good laughs, resulting in an entertaining if conventional Hollywood film. I was touched more than I expected when the players reunite after many years at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown at the end. Rather than putting aging make-up on the actresses, the filmmakers found some remarkably similar doubles to portray the characters as older women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family Favourite","review":"The first time I watched this movie, I sat down prepared to hate it. I don't like sport, especially baseball, and I'm not fan of Madonna (the actress). However, I sat through it, and boy I'm glad I did!! I love this movie!! I could watch it over and over (and I have). It's really good - Tom Hanks is so funny in it, and I loved Geena Davis as Dottie. Madonna was perfect for her part, and Rosie O'Donnell provided her with the perfect sidekick. From start to finish, this movie is packed with laughs - and some tears. It's a real girly movie, but my brother and other men I've known like it too. It was a must-have for the DVD collection in our household."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, But One Problem","review":"All in all, an excellent movie. Definitely one of the best movies that summer. It glorified the 1940s, while at the same time, tells a charming story of The All-American Girls Baseball League. It has an all-star cast which makes it even better. I don't know what else they could of done in its place, but I thought that the rivalry between the sisters, Kit and Dottie, was a little corny and a waste of film. If you ignore that, it's definitely worth the watch. A truly \\"feel-good\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Classic","review":"This movie still holds a special place in my movie collection.

Don't bother with the Special Edition","review":"I have liked this movie for a long time, and when I cued up the director's commentary for the movie, I was looking forward to hearing some of the thoughts and feelings related to especially moving scenes such as \\"Dottie\\"'s dropping the ball. However, the entire commentary led by Penny Marshall trivialized each scene by irrelevant discussions (example: the director talked about ladies' underwear during the next to last scene between Dottie and Kit) rather than decent analyses and their thinking.So, if you like the movie, please buy it, but forego the special edition. It wasn't worth it.A League of Their Own"},{"rating":"2","title":"strong message","review":"This movie is filled with strong references to the accomplishments of women in the 1940's,but is so relevant for men and women today.

The singer is in rare form in her film debut. I wish she'd given up singing, and become a full-time actress (don't get me wrong; I like Madonna and her songs, but this film proves she can definitely act). Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Rose O'Donnell, Jon Lovitz (in a hilarious cameo), Bill Pullman and ESPECIALLY Madonna do an excellent job in this thrilling movie. \\"There's no crying in baseball.\\" The music (by Hans Zimmer) is brilliant. The directing is spot-on. Look for a brief appearance by Tea Leoni (\\"Deep Impact,\\" \\"Jurassic Park III\\") and a rare on-screen appearance by Garry Marshall (director of \\"The Princess Diaries\\" and its sequel). The comedy meshes very well with the dramatic moments.

The second concerto is excellent but inferior to Michael Ponti's magical interpretation. Nevertheless a welcome addition to the genre. Tanyel's performance of the third concerto is also excellent and reveals many beautiful nuances of this outstanding but hitherto forgotten work.Scharwenka was one of the most brilliant and influencial composer/performers of the late 19th century, whose best solo piano compositions were equal in quality to those of Chopin and whose concerti were superior. Afficionados of the Romantic Era will share my gratitude to Tanyel for her pioneering efforts in bringing Scharwenka's music back into the repertoire. Bravo Seta!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music from the Romantic Period...","review":"I had to find out for myself if there really existed some unjustly neglected piano concertos from the romantic period.

The first time I heard it, it felt like it was a classic song I had loved for years. \\"Sunset\\" and \\"I Can't Stop Falling Apart\\" are as beautiful as music gets. \\"Til We're All Together\\" sounds like a mix of Neil Young and The Flaming Lips. Usually, I stay far away from bands that are hyped as \\"the next big thing\\" but I have to say this is one huge exception. \\"Daybreak to Sunset\\" is a classic. And Endgames deserves all the acclaim they're receiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic you knew was coming...","review":"\\"Daybreak to Sunset\\" is a bona fide classic.

That is NOT the message of anthropology. As an anthropologist, I resent this book profoundly. Anthropology is based on tolerance for other cultures, interest in their own ways of being and believing, and the concept of cultural relativism--that a culture's values and morals can only be understood in their own terms. The one thing we do NOT do is try to impose our own \\"truths\\" on others. If missionaries want to learn what anthropology really is, then read an anthropology book. But this text merely steals from anthropology in the most primitive way and turns that stolen material into the guidelines for cultural judgment, invasion, and destruction. It is arrogant and misguided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's What I Say","review":"I love the underdog, the underappreciated and the underplayed artists, primarily from the 70's.Thats why I like to write these reviews, to keep their music alive. Norman \\"Hurricane\\" Smith is one of those artists. He was a producer with his name on Pink Floyd and Beatle albums. His biggest hit musically of course was \\"Oh Babe, What Would You Say\\", the almost vaudvillian vocals reminiscent of \\"Winchester Cathedral\\". This is a good album, you just have to familiarize yourself with the tunes to appreciate it. The first step is to have samples available. The next is to add it to your collection.

I'm not really happy with the coffee either, there is a strong plastic taste to the drink. I thought that would go away after awhile.

Shame on Keurig management for a corporate philosophy of \\"SORRY, WE DON'T PROVIDE SERVICE.

I talked to 3 other friends who owned a Keurig and purchased theirs at around the same time and they had the SAME EXACT ISSUE within the same time frame.Keurig's remedy was to give another machine at a discounted price since it was past the warranty period. I am sorry but a total of 4 people having the same exact problem within the same period of time means that they clearly have an issue and are well aware of the issue with their product. I will say, when it worked, anyone who had a cup of coffee, loved it!

I couldn't find the part on Keurig's website and didn't feel it was right to return it to the store since it really was my fault.

It heats water rapidly and is relatively silent. Using regular coffees, I am finding that I need to use 2 k-cups on the smaller setting to come even close to the taste (robust) that I desire.....That is until I sampled Green Mountain extra-bold coffees!

The content - when viewed with a magnifying glass - seems like some of the best I've seen and I've looked at quite a few children's Bibles recently.

It was a larger book, looked great - nice pictures, easy to read (large print). Used an amazon app on my phone to scan the bar code and compare the price to amazon. Amazon was much cheaper, so ordered it from Amazon. It was the same book, except half the size ( a miniature version). The small version is practically unreadable, unless you want to get a headache or use a magnifying glass.

I have used the original, full-sized edition with older kids for many years. It's been especially useful in helping older children who have had little exposure to church or Bible do some learning before they are baptized.Recently I ordered 4 copies of the compact edition. It turns out that the type is so small as to be almost unreadable, even for children. The body copy is printed in 7 point type--smaller than phone book text type. The type in the notes under the illustrations and photos is 5 point. This tiny typeface will discourage most children from reading, especially those that are not eager readers to begin with. It will also make it hard for parents to read with their children.I returned the copies I ordered.Rev.

I am returning this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for size of type, 5 stars for everything else","review":"I ordered this book because of the positive reviews and the \\"fits in a child's hand size\\" comments. What no one else mentioned is that the typeface is commensurately small--so small that it is a strain to my 42 year old eyes. By bedtime with my 2 and 6 year olds, I'll be so tired I likely won't be able to read the type. It is about the size of the small font used in paperback Penguins from the UK---about a 6-point on my computer's Times New Roman, where a 12 point TNR is the norm for letters. If you have strong eyes, the book is lovely, and it is an easily held size. The illustrations, contrary to somewhat lackluster reviews by some readers, were lovely. I plan to return the small version and will order the full size."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great except for some major spots...","review":"This is really a wonderful edition of Bible stories for children. However, the author ends up taking too many liberties with the text. The worst example is Jesus teaching the Lord's Prayer. He says, \\"Our Lord in heaven.\\" Ack! It is \\"Our FATHER\\" and the difference is tremendously important. Many of the parables Jesus tells are introduced by saying something like \\"Jesus told a story about the kingdom of heaven to say such and such...\\" Many times the author's interpretation of the parable is debateable. These detract from the reading in my view, though a child would hardly notice. Discernment is called for by the parents! But the side notes and illustrations are very helpful and there are helpful articles on life in the various stages of Bible history times. A good Bible for bedtime reading (or any time really), but you may have to ad lib in some spots a more correct translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Grade Fantastic","review":"When this arrived, I was surprised by the smallness of it, as I was hoping for a large picture book suitable for reading to my preschooler.

They had solid settings, and in depth characters--without needing 10+ books to accomplish it in. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I thought that Stephen's Hunter, Gilliam, was a fascinating character and deserved more pages for his POV. Evayne, too, was a hit--simply because she tends to lose her mysterious airs in the Sunsword books, which is disappointing. All West's books are worth reading, but HO and HD are definitely more enthralling and well-written than any of her later 6 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"If fantasy is your genre of choice, then READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Continues, and builds upon the promise of her first bookin this duology, 'Hunter's oath, definitely a solid read.

Told in true storteller fashion, one which twists and turns language into something alive and personal, Woodie Guthrie recounts his life, from Oklahoma to all around this great big old country. And by the books end, you feel you've rambled the whole way with him and seen what he had. This is an American classic on par with the Autobiography of Mark Twain. No American history book or teacher or what have you can give you a tenth of what this book can---i.e., the ethos of the American people who suffered many trials and tribulations, depravations and hardship, and yet managed to still be beautiful. So forget your Beatnicks and your New England Transcendentialists, and pick up a book worthy of being called an example of the American Bardic Tradition. You most certainly won't be an inch disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great way to get to know woody","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Woody writes with a unique perspective and style.

It'll have you never wanting to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"English Review By Cindy","review":"This book just seemed to amaze me as i went on reading it. The characters you came up with, and how so many people can relate to them. Especially, Tom Olsen. He's just a real person like me. He has emotional and physcial problems just like any other person on this earth. So if anyone says they dont like Tom Olsen, i can't believe why. I'll admit i didn't like the ending to the book because Mary and Tom didn't get together. But after i processed that more, i thought that maybe that was for the best. I'm tired of the old happily every after. That's not how life is. And that's not how it should be taught. You taught me that just because you didn't end up with that \\"special\\" someone, it doesn't mean your life will turn out bad.

It seems I'll be in the minority in the reviews of this book but I found it difficult to read, quite easy to put down (though I determinedly slogged through it), with characters who were maddening and an ending that was, as others have noted, a disappointment. The writing - turns of phrase and so forth - however, showed real skill and I think Ms. Hunter will someday write a very good book. This just wasn't it.If the other reviewers have been truthful and this book gets them reading others, than a public service has been done and thanks to Ms. Hunter for helping create new readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I am quite impressed by this book.

Waiting for the World to End just wasn't a book that I would tell someone else to read because it was boring and didn't really make me want to turn the page.

I look at this book as a really bad soap on television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Crafted, Immensely Enjoyable","review":"Waiting for the World to End is a beautifully crafted first time novel by Nicole Hunter. From the very beginning, I was intrigued at the richness of the story and complexity of relationships among the characters. Being a lover of poetry, I found the descriptive imagery in this book thoroughly enjoyable. This novel is a realistic portrait of the struggles of the human heart; I found myself stopping and thinking about the choices I had made in my own life. I would read, pause, and ponder.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys beautiful literature and thought provoking characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salve for the Soul","review":"The prose is fluid and beautiful. The characters are like people you may know. These are life stories, told across time and place, successfully drawing you in to consider various perspectives and possibilities. Like a prism, the book reveals many colors; no situation is black and white.This is adult and young-adult fiction at its best. Finally, a book that invites discussion across the generations on real-life topics including moral dilemmas. The \\"open\\" ending is a reflection of the overarching theme: people write their own life stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding first novel","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" by Nicole Hunter was a joy to read; one of those books that you can't put down once you've started it. I've never been to Ohio, but I felt like I was visiting as the story of teacher/basketball coach Tom Olsen, who is haunted by his past, unfolds. It reiterates that no matter how ideal a person's life may seem, they may be suffering from secrets they harbor. Several real-life issues bubble up that make the reader think while reading the novel, and long after the last page has been read. I think it's a home-run for a first-time novelist, and I look forward to reading more books from the talented Nicole Hunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring Novel","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" was a real touching novel. The characters could relate to so many people that I have met in my life. I liked the conflicts in the book between Tom, Mary, and Ben, between Tom and his mom, and between Tom and himself. For example, how Tom was falling for Mary, and how Tom and Ben were very close in and out of school and basketball. The relationship between Tom and his mom wasn't a great one because his mom always thought he could do better in life than what he had already done. Tom's conflicts with himself caused him to have a hard time dealing with the fact that he had an abortion a while back with an old girlfriend Alexandra, when to find out now that he does want a child of his own. Tom did not deal with that problem so well, so every night he would come home and he would try to drown his memories by drinking, and that caused him to have a hard time to keep a relationship with anyone. Over all I thought the book was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Ending","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" starts slow but soon turns captivating.

Very seldom do I find a book that is as captivating as Waiting For the World to End. So many times I found myself relating to either Tom Olsen, Mary, or Ben Wendling.

I guarantee you will be able to relate to it in many differeny ways, and that you will find yourself savoring each page. 2 Thumbs Up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Lessons","review":"Waiting for the World to End, in essence, is what we all are doing. Nicole Hunter has an amazing book full of intrigue, mystery, and fasination. Having only lived for eighteen years and reading this book I've found I can relate to almost every aspect, especially Ben. His character has helped me grow in ways I didn't even know I could, from a book. Mary and Tom's relationship has made me question those whom I feel close to and respect in their perception of me. The life lessons that were discussed in this book can have a real barring on today's culture and society. It can especially help concentrate on the morals and values of life in the twenty-first century and even life as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to buy a second copy for a friend","review":"This is the type of novel that stays with you and compels you to share it with someone who has either been a \\"Thomas\\" or knew a \\"Thomas\\"...particularly liked the plot twists that held my interest.

He makes remarks that only men in sappy movies make. If you don't understand what I am trying to say read the book, however, I don't recommend buying it. Pick it up at your local library.

This short, yet powerful film is well done and can easily be used in classrooms across America to help explain the problems facing this region. Clooney's star appeal is used to truly do go and shed light on the tragedy.

Sam Curzon, the author, creates characters (such as the nurse, Mary Bogan, with whom Legs supposedly had an affair) who simply never existed, and the dialogue contained in these pages is questionable at best.

The information is valid and you can learn chord theory from this but it is really boring to watch and there is hardly any qualifying information.

First, there's the title: What comes, after all, 'east of the night'?--well, sunrise, of course (think about it for a moment...). Then there's the music itself. The two twenty minute plus works that make up the album are primarily guitar pieces, but they are played on 10- and 14-string guitars, respectively, and after an initial eruption (just like sunrise) drift dreamily along with lots of notes played in the lowest register (a reflection of hypnogogic imagery?). The second piece is a solo work, but in the first the guitar is accompanied by a flute that provides just the perfect airy, and sometimes dancing, meditative complement. I'm not sure this is one of Micus's best efforts overall, but if you like any of his others you will surely like this one too. Score this one a '4 plus.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious and meditative","review":"Not for everyone, and far from the maddening crowd, this is Stephan Micus at his uncompromising meditative apex. If you seek depth and stillness, this music will aid you. Stephan Micus must be one of the most underrated artists in contemporary music. An aquired taste, his music is more deserving of the label \\"timeless\\" than any of the more spectacular \\"new age meditation music\\" that abounds in later years. His music is even more introvert than usual on this recording (which is saying a lot), and his use of ethnic rhythm instruments more sparing.

Whether people agree or disagree with the verdict, people are supposed to be convicted on fact and not opinion.

Cornwall is one of my favorite authors but I was disapointed. Instead of the normal two three or more battles in a Sharpe book, there was one. The battle although good was not spectacular, I have read better in books by CS Forester, Dewey Lambdin, and Alexander Kent. Too much of the book was devoted to Sharpe's romance with a high born lady. The book in general was just not up to Cornwall's usual excellant standards. In conclusion I say boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell is losing his touch","review":"Sad to say Cornwell is losing his touch. He's still trying to get as much money out of the \\"Sharpe\\" character as possible. To do this, he puts Sharpe in just about every battle of the Napoleanic Wars. If you've read the previous Sharpe books, or watched the films, you'll be disappointed with this book. There are even some rumors that Sharpe will see action at New Orleans in 1815 (Sharpe's 'Gator) which is a MAJOR stretch. What next Mr. Cornwell; Sharpe Goes to the Alamo ?

Still a great read if you're into this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next Patrick O'Brian?","review":"Like some of the reviewers, I felt that it started much too slowly for a Sharp's adventure and I also felt that it had far too much on his love(?) interest. The last 1/3 or so was equal to his other books but I get the feeling that Cornwell has generated a book to prove to his agent or to his publishers that he can write \\"sea stories\\" to take up the Patrick O'Brian flag.

Killer Angels is the only book I can think of that comes close to it. But I believe this book is better, because Sam Damon puts his duty to his country ahead of everything. This should be required reading in schools so that the citizens in our country will know that war is possible and horrible. The only remedy is preparation and vigilance. It is apalling that our military cannot even enlist the required number of men it needs to keep up to strength. It is apalling that our country lacks a missle defense system to protect our shores. We can thank the ultimate Courtenay Massengale-William Jefferson Clinton and the other ignorant social welfare planners of his ilk. We all need to do our duty as citizens to force the politicians to do what is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Novel About Leadership and the Military","review":"Right from the start, I was engrossed in Sam Damon's character and the storyline of this novel. It starts with a small town boy who decides to make his career in the Army and follows him through WWI, peacetime, and WWII. Damon enlists and then is made an officer through a wartime commission. Its a compelling storyline, but most of all I found its inner-woven leadership lessons to be the most interesting aspect of the book. Sam gets presented with tough choices over and over again and finds a way to make the right decision each time. Yes, its not realistic, but it does teach important lessons. For a young military officer, this is definitely worth the read. For a very long book, it does go fairly quickly. However, it was about 300 pages too long. I lost interest about 3/4 of the way through and couldn't finish. Overall a very good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good book","review":"This book is not just for military buffs, it is a very useful book to study corporate culture. I've worked for Sam Damon's and Courtney Massengales, and unfortunately more Massengales than Damon's. I just read the book for the second time and learned even more from it. It should be required reading in business school as well as West Point. You'll have choices in life, to be someone who works hard, cares about people like Sam Damon, or to be a self-serving s.o.b. like Massengale. Hopefully this book will help you make the right choice, as well as being a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for those who would lead American Soldiers.","review":"This novel is a classic of the military genre. It takes some literary license, but basically it's the study of the development of two officers, one good and true to his oath and duty, and one careerist, ticket punching self serving typical 'REMF'. As a career enlisted soldier, I recognizes both protaganists and the stage on which they play. It's a great exposition of the trials and tribulations of the Army in peace and war, and of an officer's struggle to survive long enough to make a difference when the balloon goes up.

This book is war-lite, an attempt by a novelist of limited means to create an unrealistic hero who is never wrong in his decisions. Readers of this novel will be edified in no way: the main character is a cardboard cut-out of what Army officers should be, and his antagonist is portrayed as an effete snob. If you want propaganda reading material, read this novel. That's why the Army/USMC likes it so much: it stresses the core values of the modern military. This novel fails in every attempt to create real characters in real situations: the main character, Sam Damon, is a man who does no wrong (and we all know how false a premise that is). If you want to read about what WW2 was really about, pick up something by Wolf Heckman."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's boring. The dialog is insipid.","review":"If you are in a position in the military where you are forced to read this book and you wonder why you find it boring when so many others love it, you may rest assured that it truly is boring. I slugged it out to page 137 in the 938 page hardcover version and I give up. I cannot stand to hear another word from that corny character named Raebyrne. Here are the problems with this book. The dialog is insipid. The character development is shallow, much like the science fiction genre. There is not much action. It is a pokey, slow moving book that offers little else except perhaps a depiction of military life and action that is accurate enough to please those who have been there. I have not been in the military, but I have enjoyed many books on military history that are far more stimulating than this novel. If you love this book, fine. If you don't love this book, you are not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, No...","review":"Courtney Massengale is a douchebag, Sam Damon is the hero. Got it all. In one sentence. Not about a thousand pages or so. Bleah. Damon also takes too much crap from Massengale, can't police his zipper and doesn't kick his cheatin' wife Tommy to the curb. Mind-numbingly dull and long for a saintly martyr of a hero who could be improved. If you're picking this off a professional development reading list, pick Starship Troopers instead (it's shorter, actually entertaining and more informative)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I was required to read this book several years ago for a class at Virginia Military Institute, and it has stuck with me ever since. I've re-read it twice, and I will again.

It's pretty simple and easy in some levels. In the main story, you are searching & collecting chests in each level. The stylus isn't really used in this game. You can use your finger to select the items you want and the buttons for controlling Kirby.This game isn't too easy nor too hard. Some levels are challenging as to where are the chests located or how to get to them and some bosses are kinda hard to beat. With the right power, the bosses are easy to beat.I've beat the game 100% and that was exciting! I've also beat Kirby Canvas Curse but by 99.7 because of the cart run. I can't get a medal for that one but I did beat that one too on the main story as well. Both are excellent Kirby games for the DS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirby Squeekity Squad","review":"It was the most fun game of my ten year old life.

Because you can beat it in one day instead rent it. this game is the worst of them all, why dont they make a remake of kirby superstar instead of this crap. canvas curse is better than this. The controls are good but i expected something like kirby and the crystal shards which you can also beat in one day also but at least theres 3d graphics to come back to.Pretty much if you're going to get it rent it dont buy it.This should be done with almost all kirby games because most are short except for air ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can use it in PAL DS?","review":"Does it work in PAL DS?

By the end, I was actually angry and felt ripped off by the publisher, who should never have put this thing in print!Vague, self-contradictory, confusing, and generally inarticulate, \\"Malinche\\" reads like an early draft that needs to go through many, many revisions to be publishable. I'm afraid the translater can't be blamed for all that's wrong with this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a novel","review":"Interested as I am in the subject matter, I was very disappointed in this book. It would be better labeled \\"Meditations of Malinche,\\" as the book is overly heavy in giving us the interior thoughts of this historical figure. And these hemorrhage in rhetorical questions. What I most missed was that the novel failed to make the larger than life characters and events of this period of Mexican history come alive in three, palpitating dimensions. The language often turns lyrical, poetic, symbolical and/or abstract, removing me from the events narrated instead of immersing me in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I can't believe this book was written by the same author as Like Water For Chocolate.

The author, Laura Esquivel did a good job, but of course Malinche does not come close to \\"Like Water for Chocolate.\\" However, Esquivel brings life into the ancient story of La Malinche. Nevertheless, Esquivel and Mendez make a great team. Mendez is a wonderful actress. Congrats to both.

As previously mentioned it took the writer 15 years to write this book, well I feel like it took 15 years to read it.

But for what it is it is entertaining, easily watchable, and the ending is kinda sorta predictable but ironic, but fits for this sort of film. It's quirky. It's not horror, more dark comedy... when I watched it it was a horror recommendation.

But if one could imagine what an ashtray taste like, it would be this coffee. I know all those who gave this rave reviews probably want to shoot me, but I think it is only fair that anyone contemplating this magic extra bold coffee, needs to be prepared for possible disappointment.

He gives great analogies, and specific examples of card play. All the odds, and intricacies of the game are covered, including how to spot \\"tells\\" on your opponents.

The paint is not bright and solid like I had imagined finger paints to be. But they do wash off the tub, tiles, and fixtures very easily and do not stick to our grout like the packaging said it might.

Perhaps its only intention is to be an encomium of 60's pop. There are moments of brilliance. (Cellophane and Spoke of a Whirled Wheel being representative of that.) Does this cd draw me in and cause me to listen to it again and again as say Sgt Peppers or Pet Sounds does? Of course not. Is it entertaining? I suppose.

It was difficult to gain an overview of the regiments role within the larger conflict (which I anticipated) due to lengthy explanations of specific individuals movements. The details were thouroughly researched and presented in a very logical manner, but the importance the 19th played in this pivotal battle was underscored by long-winded explanations of each death that occurred during the three year period being studied. Approximately 1/3 of the books contents were detailed footnotes and this made the reading somewhat difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality!","review":"This is the same filter that the manufacturer uses, so it fits, it works as designed and is priced good.

There is way too much description & not enough conversation. Contrary to what several reviewers said, I found the character development weak to nonexistent.

He had never heard of the book, though he was familiar with the author.I commended the title to him, and have since re-read it myself. It remains one of the most fraught and depressing, but extraordinarily compelling, novels of naval warfare I've read. MacLean's character development - like the detail and minutiae of the wartime nautical world on the Murmansk run - is intense and complete, even as the characters die from the myriad perils that surround them.This is an epic story of men's ability to endure, the indifference of the sea and the weather, and the stark cruellty of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best MacLean book ever","review":"H.M.S.

With its shallow character development and infuriating conclusion, this book only emphasizes the ease in which a controversial subject, no matter how well or poorly it is handled, now makes for 'good reading.' What about giving readers a believable ending to what had been, up till the very end, an intriguing story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fine beginning, fair middle and no ending!","review":"If I could have given this novel \\"0\\" stars, I would have. Ms. Sloan has shortchanged her readers. The story began with endless possibilities that were introduced but never brought to fruition - including the ending. I have never read a novel with so many unfinished subplots - incomplete and unfulfilled relationships (Ginger and Ruben, Stacy and Danny); the murderer left undiscovered to murder and commit incest again with his spouse having full knowledge; the ruination of the Frankel family also with no closure; the anti-Semite group headed by Kyle Breckenridge; no to mention the ambiguous role of Mr. Purdy.

A must read-great entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only this book WERE more isolated","review":"The author had good intentions, but needed a much lighter touch for this book. The premise of an isolated island community rocked by a shocking murder is very intriguing. Unfortunately, the author didn't bring any new ideas to the mix. The killer is obvious from the first few chapters, and the rest of the book is comprised largely of heavy-handed caricatures and anvil-dropping. I don't like books that talk down or preach to the reader, and this did plenty of both."},{"rating":"1","title":"killed by the ending","review":"I read this book and thought I had an understanding of the characters.

Ms. Sloan showed how difficult it was for the few sympathetic townsfolk to stand up for the \\"outsiders,\\" as well as to stand up against the popular view about whodunit.The book is so cleverly written that it is almost impossible to tell who the culprit is until it is revealed in the last paragraph - then the true depravity of the situation hits home and the book becomes horror, in essence.

This homicide, the island's first, rocks the community, shaking loose endemic anti-Semitism and racism.

The ending is unsettling, poorly written and unfocused. I will never read another Susan Sloan book.

Very unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible ending","review":"Until the ending of this book, I was sure that it was going to rate a 10. After finishing it, I can say that I do not remember being this disappointed in a books conclusion in my life. This book left me depressed, and wishing that I would have never read it. Certainly one does not have to tidy things up all the time but to purposely have people act out of character is unforgivable sin for an author. I very much cared for the individuals in this book and at the end felt very manipulated by the author. Do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful","review":"I always thought the idea behind successful fiction was suspension of disbelief, and I'm usually willing to make allowances and accept improbable plots or wooden characters if the writer makes me believe the story he/she is telling. In the case of Sloan's book, however, she has managed to mix an improbable plot and wooden characters together with a prose style that is, frankly, amateurish. I didn't buy it. Furthermore I wonder if she is really at all interested in spinning us a good yarn, or is there some sort of murky political agenda here? I can even accept agendas if they're presented well, I would even be inclined to sympathize with this one, if it's there. But it's all so over the top, and she leaves too many loose ends in the plot: the most glaring is why the teacher's car was seen at the murder site (she's managed to eliminate every similar car on the island, so it must have been his). Maybe Sloan should try another line of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating book, end falls a bit short","review":"A great read.

I am a non-white person living in a small community in the Northwest (about 2 hours from Seattle) with very little crime. While I have never experienced blatant racism, I have encountered some innocent/ignorant comments from people who were not hatefull; I'm assuming they were just not very culturally aware, so I can relate to many of the situations/feelings in the book. This is not a story with a happy ending; rather, it was sad (police chief and detective's relationship) as well as disturbing (altering crime evidence, guilt by association, hidden racial and militia agendas). It would seem to be a book to spark discussion groups on these multiple themes. I will read the author's first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Ending","review":"Sloan is not a lawyer and needs to get her facts straight, starting with real life. This book keeps you guessing until the end which wasn't pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Mystery","review":"While the author has a fine ability to describe the setting and an interesting array of characters, I knew the murderer very early in this book--and I rarely can do that. Also a main character acts out-of-character two-thirds of the way through which distorts the plot. But my biggest disappointment was with the ending. This is not a mystery to solve but a drama of prejudice and racism, and I found the ending left a bitter taste. I live in the Pacific Northwest and to characterize it with such unrelenting--and unresolved--bigotry is unfair and untrue. Such a shame that an author feels readers want that kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a mystery at all...","review":"I had guessed who the murderer was after about the first couple chapters but kept reading thinking there had to be a twist - which never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORSE book I've ever read.","review":"I feel that its my civil duty to warn people not to waste their hard earned money and precious time reading this book. I bought this book based upon the author's name. I LOVED her first novel, and thought this would be along the mystery, emotion and suspense would be of the same level. Instead, I found myself half-way through the novel wondering if I should discard it, or hope for the best. It takes forever to start, the characters, once developed are so flawed and unlikable that it simply turns to a disappointment. The \\"good\\" guys turn into a new form of \\"bad\\". BTW, this is a murder mystery, and when she finally gets to wrapping it up, the ending and the motive for the murder are swept under the carpet. You are more then welcome to try to get through this horrid novel, but again, I highly recommend spending your time and money on either her first novel, or something new altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small town bigotry and a murder paralyze police","review":"Thought I reviewed this a month ago but do not see it.

I also would have liked more in-depth information relating to Hasbro instead of mostly the kind of information that you can get from a list. The book tells you when everything was released, what year, who did what, etc. But it lacks any human warmth, and there are really no warm stories of the original creators sitting together and working on GI Joe. Sadly, most of the GI Joe books totally ignore the human factor, aside from giving credit to the names of the people who designed, invented, patented, painted, funded, etc. The book is great for photos, and lots of interesting information.

Theere was a lot of information on how to make patterns, but all of the examples and projects were not true Mariner's compass, they were odd variations. And most of the directions were for foundation piecing, in which I was not at all interested. The flying geese borders and info on circular borders was fine, but the stuff on Mariner's compass, for which I purchased this book, was not at all helpful, or inspiring, especially for someone such as I, who wants to hand piece and hand sew the antique patterns.

Admittedly, it was an experiment of the type you would expect from ECM; but it doesn't work for me. There are sections when Jarrett just plays his keyboard unfettered and these are interesting and enjoyable. The saxophonist, Jan Garbarek, however seems to be an acquired taste-his horn sounds like a loon across a frozen lake. Be that as it may, I didn't enjoy his solos as I normally would any other sax man. The normally dependable Charlie Haden is almost inaudible here.

Would that Marsalis had the same breadth of vision as Keith Jarrett. Arbour Zena, an orchestral work released in 1976, embodies the aesthetic that Jarrett was to carry forward in the decades to come; cool but not disengaged, experimental, but not inaccessible, complex, but not eschewing lyricism. There is a masterful talent and a visionary mind behind this work; the coupling of Garbarek's artic saxophone with the warmer strings, Jarrett's stunning piano work place it among the better works of the time.From the first statement of quivering strings on Runes, to the nearly triumphant Solara March, Arbour Zena is a sustained and cohesive vision that nourishes the mind and replenishes idealism. If this is bad Jazz, then I am a fool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Jarrett may be eccentric, but he is good.","review":"The first time I heard \\"Solara March,\\" I played it 14 straight times.

It has gone through numerous printings, and so has seemed to capture the respect of a good number of Anglo-American professors. However, Reichenbach's reading of the history of philosophy is wrong on every count; it is no wonder that Einstein, whose student he once was, ridicules Reichenbach in \\"Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist.\\" Although I endeavored to keep my view out of lectures, my undergraduates were able to point to Reichenbach's superficiality and his errors at every turn.So, one might ask--what is its attraction? For people who would like to avoid the considerable labor of studying the great thinkers of the past with seriousness, this book gives them an easy excuse not to.

But this book was completely disappointing! Compared to her other novels, this one was sorely lacking, in terms of underdeveloped characters and ridiculous plot twists. It just didn't pull me in; the novel is definitely not up to par. Sorry, Teresa, this one just doesn't cut it. Here's to hoping your next novel maintains your usual excellent standard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!!","review":"I am a big fan of Teresa Medeiros' books and when I heard of a sequel to \\"A Kiss to Remember\\", I had to go out and buy it when it hit the stores. Although I read it in a few hours, I thought it would have had a different plot and ending, but I still love it like I do all of her other books. The main thing that annoyed me about the book was that Hayden was still kinda stuck on his dead wife while Lottie was trying so hard to make him love her. She even made his daughter like her. I loved that Lottie's personality hadn't changed from \\"A Kiss to Remember\\" because if it had, the book would have turned out dull. All in all, I think that fans will be pleased with her latest book as I was and if they haven't, they should read all of her others."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"One of Teresa Medeiros better reads a book that is difficult to put down. Definitely a good read especially on a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the discriminating romance reader","review":"I just don't understand all of these positive reviews. This book is way below average - definately NOT a keeper. I've enjoyed many of Ms. Medeiro's books but this one is so poorly written that I could barely finish it. Hayden St. Clair is supposed to be a lonely, brooding, dark character but the book is so flip that it destroys any intensity he might generate. As a result, the chemistry between Hayden and Carlotta doesn't work and the plot just doesn't make sense. At one point - when Carlotta feels she's betrayed Hayden - she flees to London for four months! Why? Then she supposedly redeems herself by publishing a sordid novel about their life story - one that puts her in a bad light. However, we're never told exactly what she has written about herself. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Juvenile","review":"While reading this book I continuously kept thinking I must have picked it up in the tween section of the library. Pretty much everything about this book is foolishly unrealistic and completely childish. I actually had a bigger problem with Lottie than I did w/ Hayden. No 20 year old woman living in that time period would have behaved in the way she did. She was idiotic. So was her friend, Harriet, who chased her to Cornwall and became a servant in her home instead of asking to see her and ask to stay there. Even the way they collected cats was weird. This book is just plain dumb. Everything is cliche, drawn out, boring and while I did enjoy the 2 love scenes in the book, they are near the end and it's just not nearly enough to save this mess of a story. I whole heartedly recommend skipping \\"One Night of Scandal\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and dragged out","review":"I usually read a historical romance novel in 2 days.

Hayden was smitten to say the least...Lottie was also intrigued and curious about this dashing, murderering marquess. The characters were instantly likeable that I was sure that the rest of the book would be equally so. That is until he marries her and takes her home and things turn really bad. His kid made me nuts, his emotional scars was so convoluted it was ridiculous. I was so sick of this guy and his problems by the end of the story I was hoping she would high-tail it out of there. Grrr...this could have been a great book ...man was I disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tender, delightful romance!","review":"I enjoyed this book so much! It made me grin and it brought tears to my eyes. I like that Theresa Medieros has both laughter and tears in her books because real life is like that too. It's what makes her stories so real and so unforgettable. I wanted to be like Lottie and I sure wanted Hayden to be my man! And the ghost made a great story even better! This story is one I will always cherish. I'll be first in line for her next wonderful love story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I'm not going to write a synopsis, since that can be found elsewhere. I have to say that Teresa Medeiros never disappoints, and this latest novel of hers proves to be just as worthy as her others. I'll admit that I have my favorites among Medeiros' work- Thief of Hearts, Once an Angel, and Nobody's Darling being, I think, the best. This novel encompasses Medeiros' notorious beautiful writing, yet it isn't one of my favorites. I'd place it on a par one down from some of her best, along with Lady of Conquest and A Whisper of Roses. However, if you liked either of these two above mentioned books, perhaps One Night of Scandal will tickle your fancy. However, anyone who loves Medeiros' work and appreciates truely beautiful historical romance will cherish this novel along with her rest. It will be a nice addition to any collection of historical romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"loved this book, couldn't put it down till I finished it!

It read differently than most of the romances out today, as it had a bit of a twist to the story with a surprise ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it too quickly, because I was sad when it was over. It didn't take forever for this couple to realize they were in love but there was a huge obstacle in the way that held them back. The book involves children and the author did an excellent job with their personalities. So many books have children four years old talking like a high school student. The dialog that came from the children fit their ages. I'm off to find another Medeiros book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case","review":"Awesome case to go with my new stabila levels.

I know it's blasphemy, but this production outdoes the film by far. Lea Solanga and Peabo Bryson are simply amazing in \\"We Kiss In A Shadow\\" (my fav track). Hollywood Bowl Orchestra are perfection in this production.Cannot recommend this piece enough for music lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You ...","review":"An all star cast in sumptuous Philips sound ... but ... At the center of the story is Anna and it's good to hear Julie Andrews giving it a game try but, after all her well-publicized vocal trauma, it's about twenty years of vocal wear too late. It's not that it's awful, it's just sad to hear this once crystal clear voice in this rough (1992) condition. On the other hand, in the original Broadway cast, Gertrude Lawrence also had vocal issues so I guess we are ready to accept a less than perfect voice in this role. I am.The rest of the cast all acquit themselves well enough and conductor John Mauceri with the Hollywood Bowl Symphony play this familiar score beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music...but","review":"How could you not apprecite the music? And, it is the music that matters! Still, I wanted more...more about the story and the history of the times, the conflict, and the context that would extend my understanding of the lyrics.

I've always admired her and her work.Ben Kingsley was an interesting choice, but he surprised me. He did a pretty good job I thought.Peabo Bryson was good too, but it's a bit odd hearing him sing Musical Theatre. I'm not sure he's right for it. But he did pretty well on this CD.I learned to enjoy my 2nd fave Rodgers and Hammerstein Musical all over again, thanks to this CD.If your a fan of R&H;, Julie Andrews or particularly Lea Salonga, I'd highly recommend this CD.BTW, the recording quality is superb as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lea is great...the others are NOT","review":"Lea Salonga is the only reason anyone should buy this cd!

The 1977 revival cast recording is superb, as is the 1956 soundtrack from the film, at least the gold cd version released with the 40th anniverseray laser disk edition. Alfred Newman's arrangements are indeed spectacular and are obviously preserved for eternity on the soundtrack, so why do we need this rediculous imitation? If one is going to go to the trouble to make a new, complete studio recording of a classic score, do it from the composer's original score, not the movie version! It is indeed a shame that Julie Andrews never played the role of Anna. It was a perfect role for her. Ironically while the acclaimed revival was playing a few years back with Donna Murphy, Julie was plodding through the travesty that destroyed her voice; the stage version of \\"Victor Victoria.\\" Go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instead................","review":"I feel that if you like Miss Andrews, then you will love this cd.

With Julie Andrews playing Anna, Lea Salonga and Peabo Bryson playing the doomed lovers and American mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne guesting to sing \\"Something Wonderful\\", the musical was brought to great heights while making us more understanding of the Asian culture interspersing with the Western ways. The musical is worth getting just because of the duets of Salonga - Bryson. Andrews' singing is an added ingredient to this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Best Buy!\\"","review":"This version is a perfect reincarnation of this well loved musical. Julie Andrews' voice fits Ms. Anna perfectly. This album is a welcome change for Lea Salonga and Peabo Bryson in that Lea beautifully sings in a soprano voice and Peabo's versatility just shines.

It is the only movie that doesn't have Michael Myers in it, and the only movie in the Halloween series that doesn't have Donald Pleasance in it besides Halloween:H20 because he died after filming of the sixth movie.

The third Halloween could have been about anythin, just as long as it was based on the original series. Look at Friday the 13th: A New Beggining, it still was based on the original series.

At least they had the theatrical trailer to the first Halloween film in the movie shown on the TV at the scene where that main guy is in the bar. They should of just named the title Season of the Witch instead of naming it Halloween 3. I think that's really messed up when they came up with that title and not have Michael Myers in it. Now if it was just named Season of the Witch then it would be an okay movie but I don't think this is a good sequel. Trust me, IT'S NOT A GOOD SEQUEL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish","review":"No Michael Myers this time.

It's one of those underrated little gems of the 80's which I came to enjoy. The plot lacks a bit and the acting is pretty bland but the overall idea was awesome. Not very creepy but obscure enough to appease people who like a little mix of Sci-Fi and Horror. The soundtrack is really good also. Minimal electronic music with synths before it morphed into underground club music. If you're a fan of Halloween as a holiday, you may like this film for its seasonal appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"potential lost","review":"Halloween three did something great that the later halloween movies stepped on...it tried to change the series. I am a long time fan of the halloween michael myers series (1-6 that is), bu i can honestly say it was dragged on a bit too long. Halloween three trie to take it in a new direction which could have given the halloween series far more potential for future great movies. However fans of Halloween three over look one small fact...the movie sucked. It had a nonsense script with a failure villian who had the worst way ofattacking his victims...selling thewm halloween masks. had this movie been done with a little more style then maybe we'd still be seeing new, original halloween movies roll out, but face the facts people original or not good idea or not this movie was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have been made!","review":"A movie about a man who manufactures halloween masks which will kill all the children who wear them on Halloween night.For the fans of Michael Myers, don't expect to see him here! This movie has no ties to the previous two, or to the future installments of Halloween. As for the movie itself... The plot wasn't very good. The only good thing about it was the ending, which was quite suspenseful. The other thing I didn't like about the movie was the stupid jingle from the commercial that ran on the TVs of the unsuspecting children. The jingle got stuck in my head and I found myself whistling the tune for several days!Don't waste your money on this one! TV stations seem to play this movie every halloween, so you can always catch it then. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trick, no treats!","review":"No Michael Myers, No point!This film is totally oblivious to the original series as this should not really be titled as a halloween sequel. It may have worked better if it had just been called SEASON OF THE WITCH minus the halloween 3 title. I'm collecting all the halloween films, but I will leave this one out. Very unimpressive. Fans will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I the olny one who likes this movie?","review":"Halloween 3 is one the best of the halloween saga, but everyone bashes it because it doesn't have Myers, well I found it fun and somewhat creepy, if you're an open minded person see this movie otherwise I think you'll just think it's a bad film like everone else because there is no Myers, of corse it's not as good as the first 2 but hey it's better than the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scream Factory is phenomenal!!","review":"This film is not perfect. It's a little bit laughable at points. But it has always been one of my favorites, particularly to watch around Halloween time. The new Scream Factory edition is so great. For me, trading in my bargain basement Video Treasures edition for this one was beyond an upgrade; it was a revelation. It was almost like seeing the film for the first time. The special features got me wondering what might have been. Can you imagine if there had been a string of anthology-like unrelated sequels all set at Halloween instead of the pile of crappy Michael Myers sequels and remakes that followed? It was a grand idea, but the marketing alone seems to have sunk this film. Billing it as Halloween III set up improper expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine dark symbolistic horror film","review":"This is one of my favourite films of the 1980s. It is a fine dark horror film with a symbolistic fairy story built into it which depicts TV destroying childhood and children's minds. The symbolism has adults as robots conspiring with the commercialism behind TV. The film makes great use of halloween imagery and is very atmospheric."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's different","review":"ok so it doesn't have michael and it is misleading us by saying halloween 3 but oh well the movie itself is pretty good i mean it's better than a lot of the other cheap slashers that came out in it's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The odd one out of the Halloween series","review":"If your expecting Michael Myers, Donald Pleasance or Jamie Lee Curtis, then this is not the film for you. It really does not belong alongside the others and just cashes in on the fame the original achieved.

Don't watch it because it has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the series. Michael Myers isn't even in it! The plot centers around some pumpkin but I don't really remember because I fell asleep during it.This shows that the people making the Halloween movies are really confused.

I personally think the sequels should of died off after Halloween 2, but that's just me.I suppose the storyline was \\"OK\\" but a bit too predictable when you start getting torwards the middle, atleast too me it was. The only thing I liked about the film was the annoying adverisement for the masks.. I think they spent too much time on that and not enough time on the storyline...

Throughout the entire film I was waiting for Michael Myers to somehow enter the scene. I thought he might have been one of their henchmen things, but nope, the credits rolled and I wondered how far you can Frisbee away a DVD.Don't waste your time with this one.

Okay. Fine. I don't really care of MM anyway.So, knowing all THAT, I saw the movie.And honestly? I thought it sucked. You're waiting and waiting.. and okay yes, bugs are gross.. There's just so much that's unexplained.And.. yeah the ending is bizarre and creepy a little bit.. but not as much as I would have liked.I actually can say that I liked Nightmare on Elm Street 2 better.

If they are going to abandon the Micheal Myers storyline, can they at least come up with a more creative storyline.P.S. the only reason that I am giving this movie two stars is because it is slightly better than sequels 4, 5, 6, and 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"HALLOWEEN?????","review":"This isn't a Halloween film and the plot was absolutely horrible, this film should get one star instead of two."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie really puts a damper on the series.","review":"This movie wasn't as good as the first two Halloween movies.

Why didn't they just call it something else like \\"Terrible Horror Movie With Misleading Title\\"? Basically it's a movie about some guy that makes halloween masks that melt kids faces off.

This movie is separate from any in the series and shouldn't be counted. Still, it ain't awful but it's ok. For a 80's movie it's okay but still, not quite good nor enjoyable.

First of all, I really feel a lot of the people here underestimate the movie. If you just look at the acting, of COURSE you won't like it. You'll think it's \\"trash\\" or \\"Crap\\". But remember the old adage: 'It is the story, not he who tells it'. This film contains a very provocative view of the media today. In fact, if we stop and examine, has it all ready happend? The plot is of mind control killing through television. Have we not seen a perfect example of this in all the high school shootings. I hardly think the film would be at fault for that, but it does demonstrate it perfectly, in a \\"horror\\" genre fashion. And just for the record, NO, I am NOT the director.Buy \\"Halloween 3: The Season of the witch\\" . If you start with an open mind on the film, and take it for all it's worth afterwards, you'll find it to be a entertaining, as well at provocotive, film. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An attempt to do something different, but just plain bad","review":"It's been a while since I've seen this film, so my memory is rather foggy. The plot has something to do with masks that have become the latest craze among children. What the children (and their parents) don't know is that these masks were crafted by a madman bent on destroying children. On Halloween night, these children have been instructed to watch some commercial or program or something; they haven't been informed that when they watch it, the masks will horribly mutilate their faces or some crap.I really appreciate the effort from John Carpenter to turn the series in a different direction, but this movie really is just plain bad. It's extremely campy (not in a good way), the actors are a bunch of bland no-names, and the plot is just silly. Only see this if you really have to view the entire Halloween series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"This is a really good, solid horror movie. If it had been title something else, like Masks, or just Season of the Witch, it probably wouldn't get trashed so much. But it will live in infamy because it carries the Halloween title, without Michael Myers. If I was John Carpenter, I would go back and shoot a couple of insert shots of Michael Myers skulking down a street and insert it back into the film,and call it a SPECIAL EDITION. \\"HERE's YOUR FREAKIN MICHAEL MYERS!, you Brats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This movie is horrble. Basically the fact that it has nothing to do with Michael it has a bad plotline and bad acting.

Halloween is my favorite horror movie and Michael myers is my favorite killer. When i saw he wasnt in it i was very dissapointed.The movie is about the silver shamrock company planning to kill every kid wearing there masks on halloween.

It's not even a horror movie, in the true sense. The first two Halloween movies were very good and I expected the same out of the next one when I bought it. To find out that it has nothing to do with the other movies, in fact, it shows the first Halloween movie on the television as an actual film and not something that would have happened, as a sequel should be. This is more like some cheesy, stupid, 80's sci-fi movie and should not even have the Halloween name. If you have this movie, you should burn it and if you don't, don't ever see it or even waste money on buying it (like I made the mistake of).

My money was being looked after by a higher power back then because this movie for lack of a better term, BLOWS! I don't chuck that phrase around often but WHY is it even in the Halloween series of movies???? There's not a SINGLE element of the other movies in it!Call it Haunted Halloween or Masks of the Damned or something but to call it Halloween 3 has to be some kind of illegal slander. The concept of the movie is interesting to some degree but the blatant deception in which this movie is presented, which is to make you think you're going to see Michael Myers, Jamie Lee or anything remotely similar to any of the other movies in the franchise before or since, is a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"This is unbelievably horrible! This movie dosen't even have anything to do with Michael Myers. Why would anyone keep the name \\"Halloween\\" and make it about some man making mask???

A month ago, I watched the whole thing for the first time and thought it was interesting. I know Michael Myers wasn't in it and that's ok. But still, John Carpenter produced it and if anybody's a fan of John Carpenter as I am, it should be part of their Carpenter collection or Halloween collection. One of my favorite things about this movie is the music. I thought John Carpenter did a great job. I bought the soundtrack and my favorite tracks are #1-(the main title) and #9-(the rock). I just didn't get the ending of the movie and as far as the dvd, I was disappointed there were no special features, not even a trailer, but at least the picture and sound are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different But Still Scary!","review":"I seen this movie with my husband in 1982 in the theatre and Ithought it was good and scary then, and I still think it's agood and scary movie. It doesn't have anything to do with thefirst 2 Halloween movies, but it was really good. The music isgood, and the very beginning of the movie when a man gets hisforehead ripped out, that's a scene I never forgot! I thoughtit had a good, surprising ending, also. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween III: Season of the Witch","review":"For those of you who have not seen the end of Halloween II (1981), I will not spoil what happens if you're planning to see it. For those of you who were around in '82 and saw HIII and thought Michael was gone forever, you were wrong. Because when HIII came out, you thought they were going to move to more scares and call Michael yesterday's news. In this wasted second sequel to the Halloween series, you may be disappointed. HIII is a little predictable and somewhat a bit gruesome. On the plus side, it's my second favorite Halloween movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I commend the makers for letting Michael Myers R.I.P","review":"I give this movie 4 stars, mainly because they left well enough alone with Haloween 2, and didn't try to bring back Michael from the chared gates of Hell. They used a very interesting plot, surrounded by the elements of Halloween. Too many fans wanted Michael Myers again, and looked past a very interesting story. I say let Michael R.I.P in Hell. Expand your thinking. There are alot of stories that can be told around the elements of Halloween, without Michael being turned into some out of this world cult pawn. Michael was pure and simple humanistic evil. He wasn't the creature that parts 4-6 try to make him out to be. Hopfully H20 ends the Myers saga forever. Lets move on people. There is nothing wrong with exploring other horror aspects under the name \\"Halloween\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael , come back , but not right now !","review":"\\"Halloween III:Season of the Witch\\" does not Have Michael Myers in it, but it is still a good movie to watch during the holiday. It deals with a madman toymaker making millions of booby traped masks to harm millions of innocent children on halloween night. But he has to ship them out before Dr.Dan Chilless (Tom Atkins) foils the party! The movie contains: Gory Violence,Language,Adult Situations,and Brief Nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally Hilarious","review":"I first saw this in the mid-80's, and even as a pre-teen just laughed myself silly at this ludicrous departure from the \\"Halloween\\" tradition. Michael Myers, whose relentless earnestness made the first two films horror classics, is conspicuously absent, instead replaced by a ridiculous premise about children being converted into monsters by wearing \\"Silver Shamrock\\" Halloween masks. The final twenty minutes or so of the film inundate the viewer with a thoroughly annoying, synthesized jingle for the Silver Shamrock company that is memorable because it is some of the most pathetically cheesy music ever to be captured on celluloid. The only things that are scary about this movie are that John Carpenter put his name on it and a movie company actually mass marketed it. Otherwise, everything about the film, from the acting to the special effects, is downright laughable. File this one under \\"unintentional comedy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever made","review":"This has to be the best movie ever made, anywhere in the world. Remember to watch it with all your friends, not once, but many many times, over and over again. It's really fantastic so much going on in this film, even things that you dont see. I highly reccomend this glorious masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"clearly the other reviewers saw a different film","review":"Are you kidding me? If I could give this film negative stars I would. I bought this because I am a huge fan of the Halloween series and I even share a tattoo with Michael Meyers, but Season of the witch is a terrible. There is little to no plot, the acting is poor at best and Michael Meyers (the Shape) only appears in one scene and that is in a TV ad for the first Halloween. This wan't Carpenter's attempt to get the series to take a new direction, this was his attempt to kill the franchise for good. Halloween 3: Season of the witch has nothing to do with the rest of the series and sadly the Halloween name is the only reason to even give this pile of $#!% a glance. and after that glance never look at it or admit that it even exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG This is a bad Movie No Michael Myers Skip It Please!","review":"I don't know why this movie was made. Michael Myers is not even in it, what a waste of time! This is not a part of the Halloween movies. The beginning and the end are interesting but everything else is a complete bore. It is really bad. I don't recommend it unless you want to figure out why or how people die after seeing pumpkins on TV. If you want to know that than I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL WHERE THEY THINKING","review":"(...)

Other Halloween movies are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs two things, Michael Myers and an ending!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is extremely violent and gory. I pity myself for seeing it. It has no ending at all. Michael Myers is not mentioned or shown even in the Halloween 1 clip in the movie. This movie was OK but it needed to tone it down a little on the violence and gore. When that poor kid had snakes come out of his head, I felt like I had just seen the worst movie ever. They shoulda juss stuck wit Myers. Here's my advice to the creators, MAKE A SEQUEL! Finish this movie off once and for all, and try to add Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much better","review":"Although the Masked michel is not in this moive if it was just titled soemthing els and not even in the series i would still have to say this movie was pritty bad. ITs plot could have used much more developing and well it just wasnt that sacry. The only good part was when the masked turned into snakes and stuff but overall it lacked as a movie even without michel myers i would say to get this movie only if you want to complete you collection but i wouldnt recomend actualy whacting it lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only good Halloween sequel","review":"All of you close minded freaks whining about no Michael Myers, shut up. Myers is a laughable villian (except in the original Halloween, of course, which I cannot praise enough). Thanks to you idiots, we have a played out and tired series of below average movies (even by slasher standards!!!). We could have had a creative and frightening series. If Halloween 3 had been successful, this series would have never been played out. It would have never gotten tired. But noooo, we have to have our precious Michael Myers who cries in part 5 (LOL, I couldn't stop laughing!!). But, I can look on the bright side, at least I have this one. This is a highly original horror film and deserves more credit. Shut up about your baby Michael Myers. No one likes him anymore anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"completed my series","review":"I purchased this movie to complete my HALLOWEEN series. it was the only one I didn't have.

I know my man thing thought it was some other movie, at least. Now this is not master cinema. This is another film where the original concept of the film was not adhered to in the sequel but was in the third. Halloween was intended to be about different stories about the spooky holiday. For that reason THIS should have been Halloween 2. It wasn't so people's expectations were set and that cannot be altered in part three. This was an okay film. It is about a druid follower who seeks to commit mass murder using Halloween masks and technology. Children are the primary targets. Those who say it has nothing to do with the Michael Meyers franchised film Halloween don't understand. This DOES follow the original idea. Michael Meyers DOES NOT. Sadly, as already stated, this one came one sequel too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie even without mike in it","review":"i kept planning to rent this one for weeks but i didn't because i heard so many people said it was a bad movie. so one saturday i rented it and watched it that afternoon. i was amazed. it was good. i was surprised because i heard so much hype about it. if mike would have been here it would have been better but it was still good even without him in it. take it from me give it a chance it is not as bad as you might think it is. rated r for violence, brief strong language, and brief nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Sucks!","review":"I wanted to review this movie because I hated it. I watched it a long time ago and care not to see it again. This movie may have been OK if it wasn't part of the Halloween series. In fact, when I think of the Halloween series, I count III out. I think of 1,2,4,5,6,H20. It had nothing to do with Michael Myers and should have been named something original and not be concidered a part of the series. Now if it wasn't part of the Halloween series, just an independant movie, I'd rate this movie maybe a 2 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST horror movie or movie since House of the Dead","review":"Halloween 3:Season of the Witch has to be the worst movie since House of the Dead and this one isn't even a sequel to Halloween 1 or 2 but instead borrows a plot from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. An evil toymaker makes masks for children and the masks cause kids faces to turn into bugs,snakes,and blood and it takes a doctor and the victims daughter to stop the toymaker and destroy those masks. The gore effects are mediocre and the acting is terrible but what really confuses the fans of the Halloween series is the title because this one dosen't star Michael Myers or Dr.Loomis. Please view at your own risk but do not buy. Rent for at least 2 dollars but stick with parts 2,4,or 6 because those are 5 star movies. and the other flaw is what witch are they talikng about because there is no witch in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD,THIS MOVIE WAS SO STUPID","review":"i bought this movie before i rented it thinking it would have michael myers but after i watched it,i felt like killing myself for even RENTING it! this movie has NO michael myers!it doesnt even have anything to do with any of the halloweens! they really shouldnt of made this movie.do not waste your money or your time watching this movie.skip it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really part of the Halloween Series?","review":"First of all, I am a huge Halloween fan, I have the entire collection (including this one).This was the worst movie in the history of horror movie!

This movie ignores its roots, which are suggested in the title, and travels along a bizarre path. There's no Michael Meyers in this movie. It does have is share of creepiness, but suffers from the absence of John Carpenter's directing and creative force.Rental only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A throwback to the old Hammer Studios Films","review":"This movie never found the proper audience because they included it in the Halloween series. People came looking for Michael Myers and were disappointed that they didnt find him. This movie stands on its own as a Halloween type film and I like it better than all the other Halloween films as it reminds me of the old Hammer Films from the 60s. Rumor has it that a former Hammer writer wrote it. I dont need to go into detail of the film as others have already done that, but I have to agree about that tune staying in your head forever. It's been 20 years since I first saw this film and everytime October 31st gets near, automatically that tune in my head is revived. \\"3 more days to Halloween, Halloween..\\". One feature of the film I do want to point out is the extremely hot babe Stacey Nelkin. She never made too many films and I cannot understand why. She is beautiful. It is worth watching the film just to see her."},{"rating":"1","title":"whacked out plot!","review":"There's not many positive things to be said about this movie, except that, in my opinion, it does have the most revolting death scene ever in a horror movie. (the scene where they show the woman's face after the chip shoots a laser into her skull--GREAT make-up work!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween III in Blu Ray??","review":"I have always thought that this film was meant to be something very special from John Carpenter. I think that after the original Halloween success that he wanted to move it's direction off of Michael Myers and just onto maybe a kind of very creepy type of series where each film is a stand alone.I think that, like almost all of John Carpenter's films, this one is a very original idea. I have grown so tired of the same old same old cookie-cutter horror films. I mean really. Friday the 13th part 17 or Nightmare on Elm Street 15 or, yes, even Halloween 20! Where will it end? At least this film tries to be different and I believe that it works. It's a good fun scary ride.But why is this the only Halloween not given the Bu-Ray treatment?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Add To Cart.... NO!","review":"This movie made me want to scrape turd-shaped photons off of the back of my retinas. Anyone who praised this dogpile is either struck by the popularity of the title or saw it when they were 5 years old and are still trying to hold onto a simpler time in their life. The plot was paper-thin and the acting made me want to wear one of those Silver Shamrock masks in the hope my life would end at any second while watching this shameful reminder that ANYONE can make a movie.I love the Halloween Series (most of it, anyway) but this is crap. Pass on this one, kids!Edit: This movie has nothing to do with John Carpenter or Michael Meyers! Isn't this helpful info?? This movie isn't good. Cult classic maybe, but it is no Evil Dead. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks","review":"wow. this is bad. you are expecting another mike myers, but instead its some cheesy story about some dumb mask company full of robots trying to turn kids' faces into crickets. this movie isnt even scary, in fact, i laughed at it because it was so stupid. if i was paid a million dollars to watch it again i wouldnt. stupid movie this one is."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS WHY AMAZON SHOULD HAVE A 0 STAR RATING","review":"Horrible movie about a stupid company called Silver Shamrock that likes to kill kids using a dumb chip in maskes derived from stone. The acting is horrid and John Carpenter even laughed during an interview and said originally Halloween was going to have different little sub-plots,so basically this movie was going to be recalled since Michael Myers became the main focus of the series. The is one scene where a guy has sex with a women and at the end she is really a robot,which makes absolutely no sense at all. The movie is just a disaster from start to finish,other scenes come to mind like the stupid scenes where a horde of bugs come out of this boys mask and snake later appears out of nowhere.

You're basically waisting 2 hours of your life watching this pathetic showing of images, it breaks my heart that this film has to be assiocated with Carpenter, becuase he produced it. I just wish they would make this film become OOP and replace it with our hero Michael Myers in a prequel. I can go on & on about the cons of this film, but I won't. I think I made my point crystal clear....DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE! DON'T EVEN RENT IT! IF EVERY CHANNEL ON YOUR TV WENT OUT AND THE ONLY MOVIE/SHOW THAT WAS ON WAS H3, STILL DON'T WATCH IT. I'm serious it's that bad.

The original Halloween is great, but this movie... ugh! I'm someone who usually enjoys cheesy low budget pictures as long as they are amusing. This movie seems like it would be amusing: the story involves killer robots and a mad scientist who wants to kill everyone on halloween. But it is far from amusing. It is extremely bad. Not bad in a goofy way, but bad in a nasty, unpleasant way. It is needlessly and excessivly gory, it has nothing to do with the rest of the series, and the guy who plays the hero looks like a gorilla. There are no words that would describe how horrible it is. To find out, you have to watch it for yourself - but please, don't! You will regret it for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the Die Hard Halloween series fans","review":"I honestly dont know what the deal was with this movie at all.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but very disorganized","review":"I experienced this book in audio format and had quite a bit of difficulty following any sort of logical thread; so much so that I wondered about the viability of audio (something I've only recently started dealing with). It was therefore comforting to see so many other reviewers commenting on disorganization. Apparently, it's the work itself, not the format.That's a shame. The topic is a fascinating one. I wish it had been more cogently presented. At this point in time, I would say Jared Diamond is still the author to read if you are interested in this field. It appears that 1491 aspires to stand next to it, and might have succeeded with better editing. But as it stands now, it doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating review of new research","review":"The best way to sample this book would be to read the original essay: [...] I saw that at the time, and found it pretty fascinating already. The book expands massively on the essay, as it should, but the basic thesis is there.1491 falls into the genre of authors telling us what we know is wrong, which is interesting but makes a skeptical reader ask if the claims are overblown or even true. (Cf. Gavin Menzies's _1421_, which does not seem to hold up.) Charles Mann provides so many references that his books turn out to be rather shorter than they first appear, but it's comforting that his claims are also consistent with various news articles and other facts. E.g. [...]And claims that Indians managed North America with fire are made more plausible by my having read Stephen Pyne's books on the use of fire in land management, including by the Australian aborigines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"The book challenges practically everything I thought I knew about pre-conquest native american culture.

Now I need to do more research and read more about things I read. I only wish I had this 40 years ago when I was still in school. But never to old to learn. Read and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh air in a stale closet","review":"Charles Mann's history is unquestionably one-sided, but it provides a necessary antidote to history-as-usual. Popular knowledge about pre-Columbian America is often little more than a cartoon image of teepees and rusticity. The scale of civilization on these continent, the enormous number of denizens, the holocaust visited on the people by contact with European greed and disease, are only vaguely considered, if at all. If Mann has tilted too far toward the challengers of old histories, he has yet done a service in prying open the minds of readers. In conjunction with other recent books, including Jared Diamond's GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL (W.W. Norton, 1995) and COLLAPSE (W.W. NORTON, 1999), we are being given the tools to better understand an important and under-reported piece of cultural and ethical history."},{"rating":"1","title":"product summary","review":"I purchased two books.

It's not a novel or page-turner but you will definitely have a pretty authentic idea of life during these times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your School Lessons","review":"This book draws on many resources that are not easily available. It paints pictures of mature cultures that thrived and died before Columbus \\"discovered\\" this land.

Failure to do so spells the end of cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"An extremely interesting account of the Americas before Columbus. I learned of accounts of peoples that I had never heard of in my history classes. It caused me to think very differently about the continent we inhabit.

I was intensely interested in the book and the overall themes were hit with large amounts of info and sources. The only major complaint I have is the way he structured the book. He jumps around time periods and at some points it was confusing if you didn't have prior info on the subject when events were happening. Besides that it was a solid book that satisfied my need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing attempt at an interesting topic","review":"Rambling story with no logical progression. I really enjoy historical books such as this (esp. by Richard Zachs), and thought this would be a great topic for one. That being said, this book is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct speculation","review":"Pre-Columbian Indian societies were, for the most part, made up of stone-age hunter gatherers. The few who made it to urban God-king organizations, Aztecs, Incas, were interesting but bizarre. Sacrificing 16,0000 humans at a religious ceremony by cutting out their beating hearts and feasting on their bodies is more than just a curiosity. This book is just another in a long line of guilt-ridden nonsense(see Diamond and his germs). Instead read Thomas Sowell on Conquests for a balanced view."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rocky Foundation At Best","review":"\\"Mann is well aware that much of the history he relates is *necessarily* speculative.\\" This says it all: speculation = non-scientific/unreliable.

But as a detailed and well-written summary of all the theories you never heard about Native American culture, it's a pretty fun read. Mann actually does a pretty good job of letting you know exactly how speculative each of his ideas are; some of them are certainly true, some are almost certainly wishful thinking. But as long as you don't forget not to believe everything Mann says, this is a great collection of Wicked Cool Ideas.Sidenote: I do wish someone would come up with a plausible excuse for MesoAmericans' failure to use wheels for anything other than toys. I get that they didn't have appropriate draft animals and all, but...really, no one thought to make a wheelbarrow?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Although I did enjoy part one, it was not about pre-Columbus, but post Columbus America. I could not finish parts 2 or 3, as I found them entirely disorganized and confusing. The text seemed to skip back and forth between peoples and times. The content seemed based on speculation rather than fact. I did not have a feeling that the author was really knowledgable or credible. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"In this beautifully written book Charles C. Mann recollects his journey to old tribal communties in what is now America. This book holds many facts that are amazing and your idea of what the US was like before Columbus will change drastically. Charles Mann tells lost stories of lies and betrayal between the Indians and the early explorers who landed on the coast of America. Many assumptions about what the Indians were like are completely contradicted in this book, although bold at time all of the facts are true and seem to line up perfectly. Although lacking cities of gold the Americas did have sophisticated technology in some tribes, even more ahead than their un familiar rivals in Europe. Early interactions between the first people to land on the United States are extordanary and just imagine how complicated it was with almost no communication possible. These early trades were great but also left some American Indian tribes in ruins. 1491 Changed everything, and it will change you."},{"rating":"2","title":"1491","review":"Excellent documentary of pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas. Well written and thoroughly researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"information for now!","review":"Just finishing up a course in permaculture when I found this book, and was thrilled to find that pre-Columbian Indians knew all about this, and fed their enormous populations without damaging the land, indeed leaving it with practically no trace except for the suspicious orchards in places like the Amazon and the forests of the North American East coast- and with perfectly engineering terraced mountainsides in Peru that still function. What a revelation! A thoroughly enjoyable read also, I was sorry to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is fantastic, at least for me. Extremely informative, easy to read, factual. Every high school history class should be required to read this book. Any American should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worlds that went before us.","review":"Given our technologies, we may be falsely complacent about our level of knowledge about the native populations of our own continent. I think there is a certain amount of parochialism that dictates our feeling that a big enough, advanced civilization cannot just vanish. Therefore, we wistfully assure ourselves that our own time will not just vanish. This book takes a different view and discusses a number of societies that had established organized, technological worlds. Technology doesn't just mean computers. In the past other tools and knowledge were used to extend the reach of man, sometimes past our current ability.

I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionism at Its Best","review":"Mann's book, while entertaining, is nothing more than speculative revisionism. The book does not read very easily because it jumps around from one topic to the next without warning frequently. Mann's intentions may have been good, but it doesn't excuse the fact that you can't rewrite history simply to promote an idealistic view of native cultures based on circumstantial evidence. He offers no hard facts to promote his patronizing image of Native American civilizations prior to Europeanization. Nonetheless I enjoyed the book because it does offer some new or \\"fresh\\" perspectives into Native American cultures prior to (but mainly after) 1492, but I treated it more as fictional entertainment rather than an authentic historical account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy handed thesis ignores the majority of North American environmental history","review":"With his characterization of the entire American ecosystem as a garden carefully engineered and managed by Indians, Mann leaves out the environmental history of most of the North American continent. The dense forests of thousand year old redwoods and sitka spruce which greeted European immigrants in the Pacific Northwest were not products of American Indian slash and burn, or other agricultural management techniques. It seems that by ignoring the greater portion of North American environmental history during his narrative, it was easier for Mann to make his somewhat remedial, politically motivated point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good summary of new thinking on pre-European Americas, BUT...","review":"As many reviewers have said, this book does a good job of presenting modern thinking on the state of the Americas before European \\"invasion\\". However, I find it to be a thinly disguised anti-wilderness polemic fitting in nicely with the current Republican movement against wild lands preservation, the Endangered Species Act, and other environmental efforts reversed during the last 6 years. The political undertones make it hard to accept much of the undoubtedly true recent anthropologic and archeologic work presented and ably discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ponderous, insightful read","review":"I was facinated by this book early on and couldn't often put it down for three days before I polished of the last appendix. Mann has done an impossible/ yet convincing job of bringing the pre-columbian world alive -showing it through a lens that magnifies and brightens. All sorts of opposing views are treated with respect - letting the reader sort out the wheat and shaff given the evidences presented. I lapped it up!Occassionally the book bogged down into so much detail that it was distracting - I wanted to shout \\"Get on with it!\\" I think the points could have been made in half the space. Yet, Mann has walked a delicate balance between a pedestrian world of interested people and the myopic and stuborn world of the university/smithsonian know it alls. Bravo to C. Mann.

The first 1/3 of this book is about what happened to native populations in the Western Hemisphere AFTER the appearance of Europeans. It is not about the Americas before Columbus.

Mann writes very well, and the book is not dull; but it's not what it purports to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"1491 Not Exactly what you may think !!!","review":"The book cover and audio book cover can be a little misleading. Some phrases the author uses are not in the average readers linguistic base. I thought this book would be a historical examination of America before Columbus came here. I failed to realize at the time that Columbus went to Cuba and the Dominican Republic. He didn't go to America. For us who are not well read in this era the references to \\"The America's\\" can be a little misleading.The book is a true scholars work. Lots of information. It is primarily about the Aztec and Incan Indians and their cultures. It does mention North American Indians but only a fraction of the book. Most of this book deals with the Indians in South America. If this is your area of interest then this book is for you! Otherwise it may not be exactly what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized, semi-coherent, useful insights carefully obscured","review":"Mann offers some fresh insights, some or all may be valid; however, the wandering style and lack of scholarly approach makes the book next to useless for one wanting to understand pre-Columbus America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winner of 2006 best book award by national academics","review":"Whenever the new thought upsets previous ways of thinking,its attacked and criticised.Charles C. Mann got tremendous amount of criticism for this book,but Im glad there are also circles who recognise importance of this work and how it might change our opinion about when American history begins.Not only because of what it says,but also because writting style is so engaging and easy to follow (reads almost like detective novel,without a trace of usual academic boredom where other writters often overwhelm reader with too much reasearch & dates) I have found this book impossible to put down and in fact,what was just a library book found a place in my own library as private copy to be cherished and re-read.It might very well be the one future generations will learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was one brilliant epiphany after another.","review":"I am a professional archaeologist, schooled in anthropology, the study of humans. With 37 years experience I had not expected the mind-altering material that Charles Mann synthesized for this book. The book deals with native cultures of the New World from before and after the arrival of Europeans. He gathers together the most recent discoveries and theories regarding how and why native cultures were essentially overthrown by the invaders from across the Atlantic. He brings in lessons wrought from archaeology, biology, epidemiology, horticulture, history, ethnography, geography, you name it. I blazed through this book and Mann left me wanting more when I was done. This is truly a magnificent work from a leading science journalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew?","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Got home from work and read all weekend... Back at it when I'd get home. Couldn't getenough of these new ideas and information that explains so much about the abandoned structures and misunderstood native cultures of the Americas. I love the new way of thinking about our history that seemed so obvious as I read. One of those times I'd like the author to know I'm grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb book that makes a good point","review":"So many reviews of this book miss the point: before Columbus and other Europeans arrived in the New World that there were tens of millions of residents here, with all the trappings and problems that so many people cause. By the time European settlers arrived perhaps more than 90% of the residents had died due to the influx of contagious diseases spread among them. And much had changed in the century or so as farmed forests became overgrown and formerly heavily hunted populations of animals, such as bison and pigeons, grew way out of hand. The settlers never realized that there were so many people formerly resident and that so much was already \\"managed\\". Great fun and great stuff. I especially liked the section on the Amazon, which so many thought was uninhabitable by large groups. Check out \\"The Lost City of Z\\" and \\"The Ecology of Power\\" for more on this interesting subtopic. There's great food for thought here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A change in perspective","review":"It's really hard to under estimate how different my perspective is on the Americas after reading \\"1491\\". Being an enthusiast of the Native American culture in the Desert Southwest, I was shocked to read the evidence for extensive advanced civilization throughout North and South America. Had I not read various articles in Scientific American and books such as \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", I think I would have doubted most of what is in Mr. Mann's book.The book flows fairly well and is not too technical. I would guess it appeals mostly to people who like details and stories that dive far below the surface. The author does this well and introduces us to people on the way. The second half of the book engaged me much more, with the stories of specific characters in the whole story. The book kept me engaged and it was hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necesary Revision","review":"Every teacher of American history, every history text book writer, should read and take seriously this reassessment of the condition of America before it was America.It is important that we quit using our schools to teach students that they are naturally superior and spiritually entitled to rule the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"1491","review":"Absolutely excellent! Mann reviews all of the scientific findings and gets first hand information from researchers in the field about what the different societies were really like in the Americas before 1492.

Unfortunately, the book has little focus. It is hard to tell whether this is an anthropology survey, critique current anthropology research, or the authors personal travels. The reading is very slow and tedious. For me the book went too far when when drawing connections between a current day tortilla shop with pre-columbian peoples. I had to call it quits after 200 pages into the book. The reading is agonizingly slow, and includes assumptions with little or no supporting evidence.

This cd simply rocks! Being an avvid clubber myself at Twilo (NYC) and at some British clubs when I'm traveling, I look for the uplifting trancey sound that The Judge puts out. I bought this when I travelled to Italy over the summer and I fell in love with it. The track selection has some of the best songs of the summer with great mixing (some mixes were a bit off, hence the 4 and a half rating, but they're minor). Being a DJ myself, I strongly suggests buying this compilation, it's well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Me Insane, but I Wasn't Feelin' This","review":"My taste in dance music is as diverse as anyone else's. I really dig soulful house, trance, two-step, and drum and bass. MoS has been one of the few labels that has consistently steered me in the right direction in terms of good dance music, but their winning streak ends here. I really liked the 2002 Ibiza guide, but this mix by Judge Jules didn't do it for me. We get nondescript, hyperactive trance numbers that start off promisingly but don't take off well. It would have been nice if we got more vocals and more variety, but I guess that doesn't really matter if this is blasting while you're at the club severely intoxicated. I'm actually VERY glad I got this used because if I paid the full import price, I would not have been a happy camper. While I'm sure this will appeal to some, this guide to Ibiza was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good disc","review":"This disc is good don't get me wrong, but rather like the clubbers guide to 2000, it just doesn't have enough of \\"those\\" tracks, the ones you just keep going back to. There are some scorchers on here, but I've heard better, perhaps it's the fact that Ministry seems to be moving away from trance, more into house, because over here, trance is becoming very commercial and poppy. Highlights for me included: Hi-gate - canned and unable, Sandstorm - the return of nothing, and Storm - Time to burn. Overall a good disc, however if you love trance you may want to try Trance Nation 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I must admit that the reviews regarding this CD are highly unreliable. CD 1 is just terrible, mundane and boring tunes. CD 2 is a little bitter but almost each song is played for a mazximum of 2:30 minutes! SO you don't even get a chance to really hear the tune. I would definitely not recommend this CD for fellow DJs- not enough length per song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies perpetuated by the logging industry","review":"This little booklet, sponsored by the logging industry, tries to be a response to The Lorax in every fashion: literary, visually, morally and all. And it fails. The prose presented by the protagonist, Truax, consists of lies and falsehoods that reveals an extreme lack of understanding of basic forest ecology. The message is clear and completely wrong on every count.So no, editorial description of this book, it is not \\"...dedicated to perserving [sic] our forests and saving the trees.\\" (Might want to turn spell check on!). It is dedicated to convincing young kids that the environmentalists are in error about their claims and that the logging industry is actually a benevolent entity, saving the forests from themselves.

It started out promising in the first few minutes with him carrying it around and dropping it - we thought it was the saviour for our hardwood floors. But in another few minutes, he started chewing on it and started taking off chunks of rubber. We took the toy away and probably won't let him have it again because he'll only continue to rip off more rubber chunks. I would not recommend this as a solution for a strong chewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable at All","review":"I got this toy (size large) to keep my 25lb corgi/sheltie foster dog busy in his crate post-neuter. 10 minutes in he was ripping chunks of rubber off like it was nothing. He is NOT an aggressive chewer by any means and actually uses a puppy kong because he's such a mild chewer. I figured something like this would be okay but not even close. I'm glad I found it on sale because if it'd cost me the full price I'd be really sad.If it didn't withstand the chewing of a very mild chewer who is less than 25lbs it shoudln't be given to any moderate or heavy chewers... MUCH to my dismay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A QUIET Bone that my dog loves!","review":"My two dogs have been addicted to theNylabone Dura Chew Bonesfor quite a while. I have ordered them multiple times, and try to always keep two or three available to them at all times.HOWEVER, I decided to try this Rhino Bone as a special little present for them. Not only do they love it, but the obnoxious \\"dog chewing on a bone\\" sound is completely eliminated. No matter how much they gnaw on this bone, they do not damage it or make a peep.I won't say it completely replaces the standard bones, but it sure is nice when they pick up this bone to chew on. After all, shouldn't every dog be spoiled with a little chew toy variety? ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Bone","review":"It takes about a year for my mastiffs to go through one of these souper bones.

The film is full of small 'events' none really leading into the other, but not scary either. In the end, (and this is not a spoiler, because there is nothing to spoil, and besides it's in the trailer) the house blows up, but the lights stay on in the front doorway after the rest of the house is gone.

But too bad, they started to rip off The Omen. The trailer for Amityville 3-D is undoubtedly one of the worst I've seen. It starts off like this: a reverse explosion of a house, Amityville 3-D logo appearing, and a forward explosion of the house before ending with the line A Dino de Laurentiis Production.

Scheeres' cool journalistic style adds to the brutality of the racism, sexism and arch hypocrisy that propel the plot and the narrative voice down a deep hole of psychological misery.It reminds me a lot of Scott Heim's \\"Mysterious Skin\\", another tale of lost childhood set in the heartland.If you read \\"Jesus Land\\", it will make most accounts of dysfunctional families and tortuous childhoods pale in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This book was a huge, sad eye opener. I happen to be from the same small town where the author grew up, and my parents knew her parents (in fact our fathers were both physicians and were in the same professional circles). Although I don't know the family personally, I know from my parents that these secrets were kept completely under wraps - they fronted themselves as a very strong family unit and major do-gooders. My heart goes out to Julia, and hope that writing this exceptional book has allowed her to have some healing. What a strong woman, with such a strong talent for the written word. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival through humor and love","review":"I could not put this book down! Although it was difficult to read at times and incredibly sad due to the abuse inflicted on kids by so-called \\"Christian\\" adults, its overwhelming message is of hope. If Julia can survive these horrid experiences with a sense of humor and the bond with her adopted black brother, then there is hope for all of us to move past bad things that happen and create the future we want.Great message for teenagers who hate their current lives for whatever reason.It is a wonderful tribute to the author's brother David, who truly touched my heart with his sweetness, survival skills, and desire for a loving family.Talking to Julia on the phone at our book club meeting made the experience of JESUS LAND even better... she is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Land","review":"This true story is very compelling and frightening.

I have read alot of reviews on this book that were negative, and can not understand why readers bash it. After reading this wonderful book, I am left with two new bestfriends, that left the book and are with me. There are not enough words to describe how great this book is.

Angry at Julia for letting her brother be treated the way he was, and that she reunited with her family apparently readily if she went to Calif. with her mother to check out colleges.

I mean, nobody writes epic stories anymore so we end up looking at microcosmic stuff that may have cosmic import and I assure you that Jesus Land does. If it is true, you know more than 50% fake memoirs, it is a fessing up I suppose. But when I look at literature, I look towards something else, this is just a good read but nothing that I see carved into my life as a reader. I read it quick and easily and think you should if you want a quick and light thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well written","review":"I read the entire book in three hours. This book seemed to have too much fluff added to it to make it worth reading. She seemed to say the same thing over and over. I pretty much skipped 3 of the end chapters. I'm guessing the last 5 or 6 chapters have deal with her time at Escuala Caribe. Unfortunately, the are all pretty much the same thing. Mental abuse, physical punishments, etc. Ok we got the point after the first two chapters at the school. They were abusive and you wanted out.This book definitely made you hate her parents. In the acknowledgement she talks about her sisters, but she never mentions what happened to her parents or her other brothers. All in all it had interesting parts, but was definitely not one of those books that you just can't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the book, but...","review":"I liked the book but the portions about The Program went on a bit long. I would have liked to have read more about what all went on after The Program. Her love for David was pure and real throughout the book, yet she waited until the Epilogue to tell the readers what happened to him. At that point, I felt robbed. Also, Julia's hatred for her family seemed untrue after you read that she graduated from college; college (at her parents' alma mater) that was paid by her parents. I found that obscene. Otherwise, it was a good trip down memory lane in the early-mid-1980's in Central Indiana for me. She painted Central Indiana during that time vividly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold and emotionless writing","review":"I am halfway through this book and I'm not sure if I plan on finishing it.

There is multiracial representation. There are horses, pets, furniture, and all sorts of different characters. My daughter has a collection of well over 100 Groovy Girls and animals. They wash well too. I would recommend these dolls for any young girl from three up to twelve or thirteen years old. It is a fun collection. Also, the secondary market for these dolls is quite active.

Deeper speaks to the sould, the yearning to be better, but that we can be nothing without Christ. Sanctify is a Psalmic cry for help from God. White Ribbon Day asks how there can be God in an evil world, yet does not give up on continually callingon His name. These songs are honest and they are real.

Though not as rugged as their taller counterpart, they certainly pack the same amount of punch. The leather will wear out long before the sole does. They are also insanely comfortable.

After reading David's sister, Margaret's, book on their family and David's mental illness, I will never be able to view \\"Shine\\" in the same way. I believe Hollywood should have ethical boundaries in terms of what they portray as true or as a biography when the fictionalized account defames living people and misrepresents actual people and severe mental illness. I recommend people read the book Out of Tune to correct misconceptions about real people portrayed in this film. The cast for this film was first-rate and it would have been a boxoffice hit without stating that it was true or an actual biopic; without it tied to actual people in this distorted way I would have rated the movie 5 stars.

The son's genius is recognized, and he is pushed toward realizing it, but simultaneously held back, creating tensions in the son which ultimately lead to a breakdown. We understand that they are Jewish. The scene of the father looking over the fence, is at once foreboding of, and reminiscent of, peering through the fence at Auschwitz, or some other Nazi extermination camp. The son's decision to break away in deciding to pursue training in England, saves him from the Holocaust, but can only increase the guilt feelings that he experiences. The use of Rakhmaninov's Third Piano Concerto, profoundly comples and beautiful, gives a rich texture to the tapestry of this moving film biography. Art is redeeming, and after years of breakdown and suffering, the master pianist finds his own salvation, and his ability to accept love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shine shines (original, eh?)","review":"Shine is a masterpiece, showing with great integrity and courage the journey of renown pianist David Helfgott.

A bank manager's 16-year old daughter perishes while inside a tent in a forest fire and, seven years later, as the result of the robbery of the his bank, the manager discovers documents in one of the safety deposit boxes (hence the title) that relates to his daughter's death.In the meantime, the corrupt former police chief becomes aware of these now-missing documents. The two men each independently track down those linked to what they must find, and this tracking down is the core of this excellent thriller. Involved here are the Mafia, corrupt officials, a sick wife, and a helpful reporter. The relentless momentum of the plotting is truly gripping and hair-raising; this is a film that can easily stand as a brilliant model of how to write and direct a thriller.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal to 'Panzer General' or 'Advance Wars'","review":"No resource gathering in this game !You start with an army and capture train station, factories, airports, which you can then use against the enemy!A pc/dos classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Czechoslovakian Miracle","review":"The idea,the dialogs..everything here are clever and original...Hasek gives us a funny hero who you don't know if he is stupid or pretends the stupid in the chaotic disorganised Austrian army.The book is so entertaining,that actually cannot leave it from your hands...the most interesting is that \\"stupid\\"(?)

Her influence is enormous, from Aretha Franklin to Macy Gray and on this album we catch her 'au naturel' with a backing band worthy of her presence. From the sublime melody of \\"Summertime\\" to the swinging standard \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\", the results are uniformly fantastic.The two standout performances are the beautiful ballad \\"There Is No Greater Love\\" (eat your heart out, Whitney) to the peerless \\"You Go To My Head\\" which is eleven minutes of musical viagra. As Dinah slips in to the last verse of the latter song, you just want to jump up for the sheer joy of the song. This is a truly exceptional album by the unique and wonderful Ms Washington."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome kid tent!!","review":"Love this tent!!!

Its their favorite toy. Its being used indoors. Very easy to assemble and disassemble, roomy and sturdy - my 22 month old has pushed and pulled at it, run into it, toppled it over, bulldozed her way into it and its holding up very well. Provides hours of pretend play opportunities. It allows them to feel like they are on an 'adventure' - they take their toys into it, their pillow and blankets, their snacks...roll down the window, zip the flap and they are in their own world (even though the tent is in full view of the grownups in the room). The mesh panels on the top make it easy for a grown up to check in on them without 'intruding' in their space. One of the best toys I've purchased for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but beware--it's BIG","review":"My three year old son received this tent as a Christmas gift. I had asked for a smaller one, but my dad insisted on getting this one. It's really cute, and seems to be made of durable material. I'm able to set it up by myself in under five minutes (though not without some serious wrangling). It also folds down to be super compact, so it's easy to store away. My one complaint is that it is way bigger than most play tents I've seen--it takes up most of the available floor space no matter where we set it up in our house. To be fair, we live in a small condo with somewhat small rooms, so if you live in a house with good sized rooms, this may not be an issue for you. That said, my son certainly seems to be enjoying the tent. When I told him I was thinking about exchanging it for a smaller one, he said, \\"No! I can fit a lot of toys in there!!\\" So, I guess if he's enjoying it, we'll keep it. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Support rod broke","review":"Support rod broke through in no more than 4 months of light use by our 3 year old, and by light use I mean mostly sleeping in it.

I would suggest keeping it inside as the outdoor elements warped it after 3 or 4 months--and also the sun faded it quite a bit. It was pretty sturdy until the wind and rain got to it. I think if you plan on keeping it outside, consider it disposable after one season. If you keep it in the house, it would last a long time. Great fun and a great deal for the money!

Thusfar no one has mentioned any strange blue streaks in their Kleenexes when they sneeze etc but since 2 of my kids have had problems with bronchospasms and wheezing in the past I am taking this tent down until I hear from the manufacturer as to what is going on.

My husband is a very avid camper/backpacker so my daughter wanted a tent just like Daddy's. This is it, just a smaller version.

After looking at it and mounting it to my brother's car, I realized that there is only one \\"point of contact\\" holding the bike to the carrier. All of the other bike racks I've seen have 2 arms, thus holding the bike securely near the seat post and the handlebars. This holds your bike somewhere in the middle, sandwiched between 2 metal plates. The problem is if you're only carrying one bike, the plates don't seem to clamp down properly. But if you carry 2 bikes, the plates clamp down properly, but then they flex because of the load of 2 bikes. I honestly don't see how anyone could trust their bike to this design. We never tried and now I'm looking for a new bike rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Lock 2896AT Bike Carrier","review":"Well I Bought This Bike even tho I read some Of the Bad Reviews that people Left And I must Say I was Very Pleased Im not sure what kind of bikes these other people have but I have a Schwinn Avenue hybrid my Wife has a Ladys Schwinn and my son has a dirt bike and this is perfect for me and not alot of money im very pleased and im sure alot of others are as well they just did not leave a Review."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works but...","review":"It fit extremely loose.

I plan on sending the product back since it is worthless to me, but I really don't like to buy products and then spend countless hours taking them back apart, boxing them up, and then waiting at a post office.

Don't they inspect these Items at all before they send them out to customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read, regardless of worldview","review":"Even though this book is not perfect, it has more than enough philosophical and historical value to qualify as a must read.The one thing that bothered me about the book is that Paine lets anger get in the way and it shows through in some of his weaker arguments and ad hom attacks. That aspect robbes him of some credibility, which is a shame because this book should be read and talked about.One of the most striking aspects of the book is not in the book itself but a reflection on it. Anyone who is exposed to Christianity in America is made aware of heroes of the faith who have accepted persecution and even death because they spoke out for Christianity. Well, here's a Deist who literally risked his life by writing this book. Did he do it for a heavenly reward? Apparently not because he wasn't sure that there was a heaven. He did it because of principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I have just gotten around to reading this and it is amazing how modern it is. Still Paine uses a few words that have different connotations like \\"fabulous\\" as meaning \\"as in a fable, meaning unbelievable\\" whereas its modern usage is more positive. All in all, this was quite illuminating.This is a must read for freethinkers everywhere, and especially those who think the founders of this country were all fire breathing Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"for believers and nonbelievers","review":"one of the things thomas paine sets out to do is show you that the bible's authorship is spurious. another thing he will do is ask you to consider the plausibility of miracles. is it more likely nature would go out of her course or that man would tell a lie? thomas paine's main message in the age of reason is this: the bible disgraces god. it is full of lies, contradictions, errors, and doubts. and since doubts are the opposite of faith, of what value is the bible anyway? in the end thomas paine embraces science since the only way we can honestly know god is to study his creation.i think this book is valuable to believers and nonbelievers alike. paine is a believer himself, so there is no disrespect, yet he crushes believers' oldest weapon while advocating science which is something nonbelievers can take comfort in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book T. Paine really opens peoples eyes","review":"\\"The Age of Reason\\" really well open your eye on Christianity and it's beliefs.

It has helped me feel better about being an agnostic. When I confront Christian friends with the arguments Paine raises, they never are able to give a solid answer. This is without exception.The amazing thing to me is that Paine wrote this before Darwin, before the space age, at a time (around 1800) when it was almost unthinkable to attack the Church. It shows that Paine had guts, as well as an abundance of brains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype, not enough meat...","review":"I was challenged to read this by a friend and thought it would bring up some intersting questions to debate. I was hugely disappointed with the quality of Paine's arguments. It was written before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and without the benefit of modern scholarship, so the arguments are antiquated. It is more of a rant than a scholarly essay on reason. It's probably something people should read simply because Paine is so well-respected, but I recommend something by William Lane Craig instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the reviews?","review":"This is the place for book reviews-- Not religious or non-religious opinion airing.

His reasons for doing so are rather weak as he attempts to validate his work by apparent contadictions.

As a huge fan of the first two films in this series, I was excited to see the return of Jet Li to the role that made him famous. Also, I had hopes that Sammo Hung behind the camera could only improve things...I was wrong. The story is uninspired, a mix between that Star Trek episode where Kirk loses his memory and ends up living with Native Americans and...well, bad westerns. The fight scenes, which are supposed to be the hallmark of any HK actioner, were weak and shot poorly, missing whatever art may have been there. If you are interested in the genre, avoid this picture and rent/buy the first two. You want Cowboys and Indians with martial arts...well, watch old \\"Kung Fu\\" episodes, if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star too many in my book...","review":"It's hard to figure out what is the worst part of this movie. The Chinese, the Native-Americans (or Chinese), or the white people. The native-americans, or bearers of national socialist propaganda, seemed more like Chinese people dressed up as 1950's Hee-Haw style Indians. Jet Li looked like a more convincing Native american than the \\"real\\" indians. The fight scenes were terrible, but the romance made me cry. By which I mean the incomprehensible love triangle made me cry in agony. But the first one was good, which makes this all the more disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing chapter in a great series - thanks Sammo","review":"The biggest flaw in this flick is it's director, Sammo \\"I'll do anything to make you laugh\\" Hung.Leave it to Sammo to do a great job of disrespecting a great Chinese folkhero by making him look incompetent and stupid. While the fight scenes were descent, I could not get over the fact that all credibility of the character had been destroyed. Sammo just didn't do this whole saga justice.On a side note, the DVD version that I saw (and reviewing), the ChinaStar version, had about a 2-3 second delay in subtitles. Also the aspect ratio manually changes. Not a very professional job.I would rent this first. If you decide to purchase it, make sure it's the Carnival version, as pictured at the top of the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie was REALLY BAD","review":"This has to the worst OUATIC series.

The only problem is that in all the Wong Fei-Hong movies combined, Fei-Hong has almost never been hit during the fight scenes. Every adversary prior to this movie seemed relatively skilled. But in this one none of these guys stood a chance! None of them had any skill at all! If you just wanted to watch fight scenes, you'll be sorely disappointed to watch Jet beat up a bunch of Americans. I suppose they were trying to focus more on the story line (which was dreadfully mediocre!). The previous Once Upon a Time in China movies are much better. If you can't get enough of Wong Fei-Hong movies, try Iron Monkey! It's a much more exciting movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Hit in PRC","review":"We watched this movie while travelling in the PRC.

Some of his advices are dead wrong, for example converting color to b&w: his method gives far inferior results to proper techniques (there are more than one). The method he suggests is definitely the fastest - probably for this very reason almost every book or Web Tutorial (there are dozens of them) will tell you why you should avoid this method. I returned the book and won't recomend it to anyone, beginner or intermidiate. Check other books, like Scott Kelby's \\"Photoshop 6 Photo-Retouching Secrets\\" or Martin Evening's \\"Adobe Photoshop 6.0 for Photographers\\" (this one is for more advanced readers) and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Do Better......","review":"What a difference a year makes in digital photography! Or 5 years come to that. Having bought the book, 50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques, it was immediately clear that the techniques and tips were aimed at beginning photoshop workers. Nothing wrong with that. However, by today's standards, there are many more attractive books on the market that do the same thing so much better and with much better quality illustrations and colour photgraphs. I found the tips a bit 'old hat' and the illustrations very old hat, the sort of tips and techniques you could easily pick up in an hour's search on the net, AND with better colour examples.Still, to keep things in perspective, the book IS 5 years old and it shows.Buy it if you want a cheap second-hand book for your shelf.

Useless book, unless you are an ABSOLUTE BEGINNER and have never seen a digital camera operated before, buy something else. Oh, and the included software is only good when you uninstall it.I don't like getting ripped off, and after purchasing this book, I'll never buy anything who was associated with this obviously slapped together POS.

It is a touchstone of familiar and provocative images from film, literature and the arts that symbolize the dysfunction in our relationships. It is about looking hard at one's own complexes.

If the theology/morality wasn't so pointless, affectated and plain ridiculous (more on that in a second), it would still be a crime against humanity on the part of the publishers.The writing style is banal, flat and unimaginative, the characterisation is poorly thought out and unbelievable (Dairine suddenly transforms into a different person halfway through the book, and the parrot/goddess...don't get me started. Nita and Kit are as they always were, in their ways and in their relations with each other, and the Lone Power, unbelievably, goes through a completely ludicrous character change.) Also, it has a falsely sentimental overtone, the jokes are childish and- well, it just ... all round.About the theology.

Written one year before he became world champion, this nice book describes in Capablanca's own words 35 of his greatest games at the time. Among Capablanca opponents in these games one finds Alekhine, Niemzowitch, Janowski, Yates, Marshall, and Berstein among many others.Each game is fully commented and annotated by Capablanca himself, and you can find suggestion that can help improve any reader's game in almost every paragraph.Capablanca includes at the end of the book a short concluding essay on the basic precepts of opening, middle-game and end-game strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for chess hobbyists and connoisseurs","review":"Out of the 20+ chess titles in my library, My Chess Career, by Capablanca, remains my favorite.The first hand explanations from the eventual world champion are useful, but sometimes abrupt. Nonetheless, the value of any of his commentary, in combination with games showing his historical development and clean elegant playing style, is simply a joy to read.This book is more historical in intent than educational, yet my playing improved more through reading this chess book than any other, including those intended as educational.Not meant for the beginner, yet, not much skill is required to enjoy it. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tragedy","review":"Othello is now one of my favorite Shakesperean plays, right behind Romeo and Juliet. The play contains many universal themes which could be applied to life today, such as jealousy and revenge. The book is sad at the end, but it is very well-written and is effective in evoking emotions in the reader. I recommend this book for anyone who has to read a Shakesperean play or for anyone who wants to read a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"othello classic books on cassette","review":"The reading is very monotonous as the reader says the names of each part before the part is read.

Most are really first rate and are quite enjoyable to listen to. Hamlet, MacBeth and Julius Caesar are very well done, complete plays well interpreted. Which is all the more baffling as to why Othello and Merchant of Venice are so notably bad. The overall productions and main players seem to have been chosen to project caricature rather than serious adaptation. That may be a fair point in a class room, but these two plays deserve a serious presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arkangel's Recording of Othello Disappoints","review":"I bought this recording with high hopes. What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right? Well, not with this recording. The cast is made up of \\"distinguished actors,\\" the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school. Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line. The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce! When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out. For audio recordings, you need the best voices. Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this. My advice? Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"Look, here it is. I know everyone says how great and everything Othello is and that this Shakespeare guy is like a genius. But what it comes down to is it is just like this white guy from Ireland who never went to Italy and stuff and like all his plays all take place there and stuff. I mean, did Shakespeare actually know someone named Romeo? But that's not the point. This whole play sucks. I didn't get involved at all and I couldn't relate to none of the characters. Plus when my teacher said that Othello is actually black, I, as a white person, took offense to it. So to all you out there in cyber space, just avoid this no matter what. And if you were like assigned it for class say that you won't tolerate racial prejudice. Or read the Cliff Notes, like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Iago ever","review":"Knowing Cyril Cusack from his affecting performance of Egeon in the BBC version of 'The Comedy of Errors', I'm suprised by his laughable portrayal of Iago here: the silly whining and hammy delivery of the lines throughout is a trial to listen to.

Drawing upon Luther's 1st of 95 Theses, he maintains that Christianity does not just begin with an act of repentance, but is marked by an entire life of repentance. In addition to helpful bibilical analysis, he offers a warning to the contemporary church against lapsing into Medieval religious practices. All in all, a clear and warm balance of truth and grace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince Hal grows into his own as his father passes away","review":"One of the more influential Shakespearean histories. Because of the inspiration it provides for any latter work involving a young male with 'daddy issues' (like \\"The Lion King\\") this play has had enduring power.The Prince of Wales, Hal, son of King Henry the IV is being thrust into power as his father dies. Conspiracies and the Crusades, a hysterical hostess and Falstaff, and the elevation of profanity to a high and refined art all add character to this play. I would argue that it is almost as much comedy as history.The most moving aspect of the play is Prince Hal understanding the reality that his father's death is thrusting upon him. From trying on the crown as his father lies unconscious but not dead to disavowing the rogues he had been a delinquent with, his growth is unmistakable.A very moving play and one of the more rewarding histories.E.M. Van Court"},{"rating":"2","title":"History as Art","review":"The young Hal and his instructor in the art of living the good life , Falstaff cavort through the first half of Henry IV as if life were going to be one long , irresponsible entertainment. The dramatic transformation of all of this , and Hal's casting off of Falstaff, and moving to kingly responsibility will come in the Henry IV Part II.What is present here throughout is the tremendous richness of Shakespeare's imagination in his creation of character, and inventiveness in language , in his ability to create so many different moods and feelings.'Falstaff' is one of Shakespeare's most beloved characters, and one of the great figures in the Comedy of world literature.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I saw Richard Burton play this at Stratford in 1952","review":"Not the most exciting Shakespeare but a good and interesting transition from Part I to Henry V. I wish I had seen all three plays, in sequence, but would I have appreciated them at that stage in life?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Sequel to \\"Richard II.\\"","review":"To get as much as you can out of this play, you MUST read \\"Richard II\\" first. Shakespeare deserves much credit for making the villain in \\"Richard II\\" (King Henry IV) the hero in this play. It is in this play that King Henry IV realizes political gratitude is short lived and Richard's prediction of Henry IV's trials comes true. Not only does King Henry IV realize that his seizing the crown came with consequences. but he also has to deal with his riotous son (the eventual Henry V). 3.2, where King Henry IV confronts his undisciplined son is quite memorable. Besides all this, Shakespeare introduces us to his comical Falstaff. So we have an interesting turn of events, dramatic confrontations, scenes of war, and comical touches. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best!","review":"Of all Shakespeare's histories, Henry IV, part I is the best. It is the first of three plays that examines the ascension of the great King Henry V. Here, we see a young Prince Hal as a troublemaker and a \\"royal pain\\" (pun intended), who hangs out in taverns with drunkards and derelicts. But we also see a young man who realizes his destiny and knows that the time will come when he will have to be a strong king for England's sake. The play is more than just one person's rise. It examines English society in atime of great instability and civil strife. It examines the role of family (fathers and sons, brothers, and uncles and nephews). This play is a reflection of Shakespeare at his finest and everyone should read at least this play, whether or not they love Shakespeare or not. It is worth the read. (and it is a rather simple read, too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy for gross motor","review":"My kids love this!

A Wizard Abroad is a stupendous read, but I would recommend reading it prior to reading High Wizardry, or else it will leave you wanting more.

While most of the series takes place in odd, uncommon places(under the ocean, far away galaxies), this one takes place in Ireland(with a few side trips to the land of the Sidhe.) When Nita's parents decide she needs a vacation from her magic and her friend Kit, they ship her off to Ireland to visit her Aunt. Her magic(and the Powers that Be), however, has other ideas. Nita manages to get mixed up in yet another battle with the Lone Power--this one, however, parallels Celtic mythology, probably one of the reasons I found this one so fascinating. NIta and Kit are here, along with some new, very interesting characters--including a cat bard. It's a fast-paced, enjoyable book that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wizard Abroad","review":"So predictable...

In truth this should have been his story, and He, not Nita, should have been the one to tell it.As it is we get the view from the outside, with a narrator who isn't quite perseptive enough to give us the whole story. And if Nita's place in this story is somewhat periperal then the other young wizards from the previous books are even more so.Kit is the proverbial 3rd wheel, and Dairine is used as nothing more then a convnient power source.I loved the first two books inis series, was disappointed by the third and am sad to say that the story line hasn't recovered in the Fourth. Like its imediat predesor this book feels like the darkness has delibertly been toned down, and frequently omitted, preferring to report the fighting with passages about what Nita remembered rather than dropping us into the thick of it.As a result I just couldn't find anything to get involved with in this story,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even 2nd-level Duane is better than first-rate from others","review":"Number 4 in the Nita and Kit series is perhaps the least of the group, but still a good read and just about the best young-adult fantasy stuff going.It occurs to me that Duane has written herself into a corner. The young human wizards of this world suffer from diminished powers as they grow older, so as Nita and Kit mature they become more interesting as characters but less interesting as wizards. In fact, they do very little wizarding here (as in HIGH WIZARDRY, Nita's little sister Dairine remains the champion power spellcaster).Nevertheless, Duane's picture of contemporary and legendary Ireland is fascinating, as are her incidental characters. Did anyone else figure out who Aunt Annie is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"I found the fourth book of this series a sad departure from what made the previous books great.

Since most of us could never afford such a collection or FIND some of these gems, this is a great coffee table book. Again with putting values on collectibles, any kinds, is a matter of supply and demand.To me, Ebay is where I usually can find recent values.

We got her a Keurig machine for Christmas, and so far have had fun trying the various K-Cups. Mom is leaning towards Wake-Up Call as an everyday coffee, and my wife and I (who drink Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster or Longbottom Black Gold as our morning cup) think that's good, too. So, to keep this short, Nantucket Blend doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't have much flavor. If you like your coffee very mild/weak, you might love it. If you like stronger, bolder, darker blends, forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishy Washy","review":"I wouldn't consider myself a coffee connoisseur, but I do know what I like and this is not it. I found this coffee weak and watery. I ran it in the smallest cup size that my machine makes and it was still weak.I will admit that the flavor wasn't bad, but there just wasn't enough of it. It tasted like I got a half packed cup. This was one that came as a sample with my Keurig system. I normally prefer French Roast, Sumatran Reserve, Dark Magic - you know something with a kick. But even the Breakfast Blend that I purchased had more flavor. Suffice to say this should be very low on your list if you want something that has a reasonable volume of flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginners book.","review":"This book is great for beginners. This is what the school wanted.

The adhesive is not sticky at all. This is fine if nobody is going to touch it, but if anybody is going to be stepping on it or rolling over it (especially on a tiled area), I recommend something stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"of merit","review":"Most argue that the late Sinclair Lewis works shows an author whose powers have seriously declined. Though I don't disagree, I still think Cass Timberlane is worth reading. It serves as an interesting contrast to the earlier novels. Lewis still has his acrid and acerbic view of American life - he skewers Minnesota and New York City with equal ease. However, he seems to see, at the end of his career, that there is some redemptive moment in life. True, you might find this rather sentimental, but I see it as a synthesis of his earlier Menckenism with the later romance of the swing era. Indeed, this book has many elements of the twenties, but they are tempered by the forties. Having just read Wolfe's Of Time and the River, I noticed that Wolfe was apparently influenced by Lewis. Even as Wolfe surpassed Lewis in achievement, he also brought his novels to a resolution that left an impression of hope and survival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"A truly awful CD. If you feel the need to hear \\"96 Tears\\", the one high point of this effort, look for one of the greatest hits packages.

Steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snyders Know Knots","review":"I'm impressed by this somewhat small book on knots. Clearly, it was written by someone who has used rope and understands the topic. (Sadly, many knot books seem written by much less qualified authors--some spitting out quite a few!) The book's illustrations and guidance are good and clearly given. I recommend this book for those needing general or sailing-specific knot knowledge; for climbers/cavers, fishers, this book isn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Undergraduate text in Topology","review":"I was very disappointed to see that this text is out of print.

One of the more exciting novels in the series, but this miniseries is just dull and boring. The acting is amateur and I discovered recently that Camilla Power who plays Jill in this miniseries, was known in the Czech culture for a dubb voice in the Czech movie, \\"Alice\\" by Jan Svankmajer.

It was so slow and boring that me and my two boys, ages 8 and 6, could literally not sit through it. The \\"special effects\\" are so bad its just funny. But the worst part for me was the voice and manner of Aslan -- he looks and sounds like an angry, mean, horrible beast (the voice is that of an angry, ignorant, stubborn old man). I didn't mind that my kids weren't interested in watching the whole thing since I didn't want them to have that image of Aslan in their heads!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad I bought it","review":"After watching the Disney versions of Chronicles and Prince Caspian, I didn't realize the Silver Chair was not a Disney film. I was so shocked to see such a bad production of a story. The acting was so bad, the entire thing was so poorly done. If you have seen the Disney films, you must know just what I mean.

I don't reccomend this movie to anyone that loves to watch movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the *worst* acting I've seen","review":"Don't waste your money. Thankfully I borrowed this from the library. This is some of the worst acting I've ever seen, and a complete insult to a great book and a great author.If the intention was to find a cast who is completely incompitent, than the goal was accomplished. Since it was made in 1990, the poor special affects can be forgiven, but not the acting.There's not much more to say. This was disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The BBC Series Of The Chronicles Of Narnai","review":"I found this series to be quite disapointing. The BBC version seemed very plastic.

That is the beauty of these videos they basically put pictures to the book. They special effects are dated but they don't distract from the beauty of the story.The \\"Silver Chair\\" is a wonderful movie.

Morrow begins his collection of essays with an insider's look at the therapist' role. He concedes most folks come to therapy convinced of their own rightness and are waiting for the therapist to discover this and announce the obvious winner. They will first have to endure an episode of active listening. Admitting a bias in favor of marriage and the sustained relationship, Morrow, who is an ordained minister as well as a therapist, urges his clients to bring openness and courage to the therapy. Viewing relationship as a solid ship within which one is better prepared for both the joyous and the dire consequences of living, Morrow urges patience and committed listening to all participants."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starting place to learn about the dairy industry.","review":"A couple of months ago I began a new career as an economist for the USDA-AMS Dairy Programs.

If you need proof, watch Trilogy. But to call Robert Smith the only poet of our generation? Robert Smith is a storyteller, not a poet. He is in fact the greatest lyrical storyteller of our generation, but not a poet. I think that as far as poetry goes (and we are talking lyrically), Morrissey has no equal. Morrissey is the greatest lyricist of all time. There are many great poets in our musical generation. Check out Robert Pollard's surreal, poignant lyrics and delivery.

The rhythm of the train and the steadfast bond between Holmes, Watson and Lestrade creates one of the most relaxing murder mysteries ever put on film.

The film print quality is very poor and the sound is very muddy. The DVD box falsely states a running time of 60 minutes -- but the running time of film they put on the dvd only runs 53 minutes!

I'm glad I found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 MONTH OLD LOVES HIS TUNNEL","review":"Not exactly sure why the recommended age is over 3 years old. My son is 10 months old and as long as your child is playing with the tunnel under supervision there is no reason that they cannot use this product sooner. Love the fact that it slinks up so compact when not in use and for travel. My son will play peek-a-boo and then crawl through the tunnel to come get me on the other side. He can also sit up inside the tunnel without a problem being that he is still younger. He did get mad however, at the fact that he tried to stand up inside the tunnel and could not, guess we will have to get him the tent that attches. Which brings on another good point, this product can be fit to many other products for increased fun (tent, another tunnel, etc.). Leads itself to many options. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased this for my 21 month old and she loves it.","review":"The giggles never stop. She never get tired of playing in and on it.

All of the children rush to play in it which is why I purchased this one for my child. If your child is younger, a brighter color might be more inviting than the dark blue one but overall, they are sturdy and easy to use. It shipped quickly and matches the product description/photo online."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKE AFTER MINIMAL USE","review":"I purchased this item for my 1 and 3 year olds. The boys loved it but within a few weeks it became unusable. One of the velcro tabs used to keep the coils together when storing it fell off so it no longer folded up flat. I think that led to pressure in part of the fabric so the metal that creates the coil shape tore through the fabric. Due to this sharp protruding metal we can no longer safely use the tunnel. I would not recommend that people buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaska Ice","review":"Perhaps winter in Northern Michigan brings out my desire to prove to myself that there ARE people in the world who are colder than I am, and that's why I have been reading mystery novels with Alaska settings. Whatever the reason, \\"A Deadly Quiet\\" is one of the best I've read in recent months. Christopher Lane's prose is masterful, and evocative of the shivering stillness and sheets of snow. The characters are sharp against the landscape, and the setting is unusual and intriguing. I recommend this book: it's well written and suspenseful. Perfect for a quiet evening by a fire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality.","review":"I bought this shelf because it was the only one I could find that was (a) wood, (b) white, and (c) less than 20 inches long. Most wooden shelves on the market are longer.The shelf does not sit well on the wall. To install it, you first have to attach a wooden peg to the wall, and then you push/slide the shelf onto that peg. The problem is that the shelf does not fit tightly to the peg, which makes the shelf a little wobbly. It slopes down towards you instead of being perfectly straight. That is, if you put a marble in the middle it would slowly come back to you instead of sitting in the middle.Also, I bought two of these and one was defective. The peg didn't fit into the shelf because it was not cut properly. I called customer service at the company to request a new peg and they said they would ship a new shelf. That was weeks ago and I haven't received anything yet. I'm not holding my breath.So steer clear of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing remastering of historic recordings","review":"This 2001 Allegro/Classico D'Oro CD offers disappointing remasterings of Elgar's 1927 recording of his Second Symphony and his 1928 recording of his Cello Concerto (this with cello soloist Beatrice Harrison). My guess is that Allegro used secondary sources and applied excessive filtering, robbing the original 78 rpm sound of its immediacy and bite.For a better remastering of the 1927 recording of the symphony, try transfer engineer Mark Obert-Thorn's recent release on Naxos Historical (available from Amazon.com.uk). For the 1928 recording of the Cello Concerto, EMI's own remasterings are better than Allegro's."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Yet again another boring book written with all the flair and emotional insight of the list of ingredients on the back of a shampoo bottle.

I guess when she became a franchise! This is the only book of \\"hers\\" in the past 15 years that I have not purchased (HINT, HINT).

I know this was not suppose to be a girly movie, but it could of had some drama to it. Plus their was no substance to it. It was just laid out on the table for the taking. But if you like to see worthless people getting murderd in a ring of tigers, this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant flaws","review":"Having seen this movie i must say that is was a waste of my time.

Crowe's character was made up along with the whole story. Any man or woman that knows anything about Roman history should be offended by this movie. I guess the producers and directors thought by showing you good costumes and battle scenes assumed they could trick you into not thinking for yourself. The sad part is they probably were successfull with a minute exception of viewers.The movies finale speaks for the entire film. A roman emperor doing battle with the gladiator in the colliseum. The absurdity of portraying something like this shows Hollywood's true arrogance.

There's so much talk, talk, so many long, long shots of facial expressions that you want to scream: okay, let's have some action! Even the action sequences are akwardly handled.

Why do accomplished people in the present want to watch this again and again? Besides the fact that the movie is wonderful on many levels (acting, costumes, action, music(too evocative for words) sets, etc)and is layered thick with details missed on first and second viewing, there must be more. I think it could be a search for transcendence in a secular world where nothing is really worth dying for, especially not your self respect or honor.

But this one, is the top of the pile. Russelll Crowe is excellent as Maximus. He is physical enough to be believable. The special effects rival any of George Lucas film. And this one is directed by the god of all directors Ridley Scott.The level of attention to detail is amazing. And the special second disk in the set has several very interesting documentaries. I'd say the cut footage included is not too important, but good to be included.I saw this one at the theatres and had to have it anyway, special features or not, but it doesn't hurt to through them in.

Gladiator, in my opinion, is without a doubt the best movie i have ever seen. It has everything you want in a movie, a wonderful cast, big action scenes, and a kind of drama that leaves you with emotions you've never felt before in a movie. The main character, Maximus, (played by Russle Crowe),is the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an empire. Enough said. Russle Crowe gives an absolutely outstanding performance, he makes you believe and feel everything Maximus goes through in the film. The DVD is of this movie is awesome. Its loaded with tons of extras and is the best sounding DVD yet, with both dolby and DTS! Everyone must own this DVD, even if you dont have a DVD player, go out and buy one just for this movie! You wont be sorry! This movie rocks! The best movie ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I saw this movie when it came out and it was good at the beginning and the tiger arena was cool; but then it dragged ALOT.

And he is because HE KILLED HIS FATHER. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece.

I have seen it four times and am not planning on stopping there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T WATCH THIS ONE WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND","review":"Rousing fight scenes(watch out for those tigers);the story well let's say that it is adequate for this kind of epic movie.RUSSELL CROWE is ideally cast,what else can i guy want?Maybe a virtual collesium can convince you that this is actually ROME.I had a hard time to convince myself that JULIUS CAESAR was actually this guy who plays him.Somehow whenever JULIUS is on the scene,i was inclined to laugh.Remember the old saying:they don't make them like they used to do.Well, sometimes they do, but curiously we discover that we didn't missed them that much.If you invite your new girlfriend to watch this,i'm sorry for you, but you may not here from her again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"A very educational movie with stunning effects and a great script allow this movie to be one of the best of the year. Try watching it with you children (teens and above) so that they can learn about the Roman Empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific extras and excellent quality","review":"This is the movie I'm never tired of watching. The special features are so numerous there's a whole disk dedicated to them. Making of, deleted footage, montage of extra footage, documentary on the history of gladiatoral combat, and much more make this purchase worth it. Excellent quality and in wonderful widescreen format not found on the VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough For Both Sexes","review":"Gladiator has plenty of violent parts. If you do not like the bloody scenes, don't watch it. I thoguht it was a great movie, though. It had a lot of action and plenty of suspense, not to mention, Russell Crowe."},{"rating":"2","title":"But which version is amazon.com shipping?","review":"Though I appreciate the recent reviews of how good the remastered version of Gladiator is - the question for me is - which version is amazon.com shipping now? I live in Canada and have yet to find a single copy of the remastered version, so I would order it in a heartbeat if I knew that was what I was going to receive. Anyone know what is being shipped by amazon.com??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridley Scott Did It Again!","review":"If you are a big fan of Ridley Scott's movies, Gladiator is another film that you should add to your collection. This movie depicts a story of a great man who fought with his life for the glory of the Roman empire and was betrayed by the new reigning Ceasar. Great story line and wonderful casts. Russell Crowe portrayed Maximus, a warrior who became a slave and defied the Emperor by winning the hearts of the people of Rome as mighty Gladiator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad picture quality","review":"Very bad Picture Quality!I was excited to buy this blu ray, but then I started looking at the reviews. The picture has been treated with EE (edge enhancement), (DNR) digital noise reduction, and other filters which make the picture quality much worse than it should be. Looking at screen captures, this is very obvious. One such glaring errors is a large numbers of arrows are erased from a shot because of what is believed to be a scratch removal filter. I await a good transfer and will most likely buy that day one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended version tells so much more of the story...","review":"Obviously one of the greatest films of all time, but have you seen the Extended Version? It's got a few scenes that weren't in the theatrical version and they add so much to the story. Definitely worth watching. Definitely worth watching on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator","review":"In the final days of Marcus Aurelius' reign, the aging emperor angers his son Commodus by making it known that he wants Maximus, a fearsome and respected Roman general, to be his successor. Power-hungry Commodus kills his father and orders the death of Maximus. But the latter flees, only to discover that his wife and child have been murdered by Commodus. Crowe proves he is a world class star with his versatile, passionate and physically virile performance. This movie engages the senses and the mind and lingers in the memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator - The Epic That Will Outlast Cinema","review":"I had to watch the film Gladiator for a school project. I was hesitant because I knew it would be gory. What I didn't know is that Gladiator is a movie I will love for the rest of my life. The imagry was moving, the mood exlemplary. This film is the greatest example of cinema at its greatest. I felt the emotions of this movie before I even registered them. In good movies, I recognize that something is sad, and then feel the emotion wash over me, but in truely great movies - like Gladiator - I felt them immediatly. I usually don't yell at the television, but I literally shreiked, begged and cried along with the charactors. I am glad that I chose Gladiator for my project, because it's easier to write about something you really believe in."},{"rating":"2","title":"way better than \\"Troy\\"","review":"i saw \\"troy\\" in the theaters four times with my friend. i thought it was the greatest movie. then i rented gladiator and i changed my mind about troy. gladiator is an awesome movie with wonderful acting and good action sequences. troy defienctly doesn't compare to gladiator. i recommend gladiator over troy anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the remastered blu-ray - one of the best","review":"Most people have seen this movie so I am not going to go into the plot.I ordered this blu on 12/ 28 / 10 and recieved the remastered blu -ray edition the next day.Picture quality is fantastic and there are no negatives that I noticed that should keep anyone from buying this blu-ray for the first time, or anyone who wants to upgrade from their DVD.This movie is about honor and loyalty. Two qualities I believe are most important in life. Violent, moving, and a great story. One of my top 3 favorite movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, with slight apologies to history","review":"Gladiator is a great film, a must for anyone's library if they call themselves a student of film, history and/or entertainment in general.The film is a beautiful representation of the Rome of our dreams and a brief period, the age of Commodus, within that grand vista. The film did take several liberties from the truth:1-Commodus was not a scheming adult but a bit of a lad when he became emperor; there is no evidence he did or could eliminate his father.2-The man that killed Commodus was not an erudite military general but instead a crude brute wrestler, hired by conspirators to do the job.3-His sister was not a victim of Commodus; indeed, she conspired to have him killed; he caught her 1st and had her exiled from Rome.4-Far from being treacherous, Commodus was a relative \\"babe in the woods\\" who was assailed by conspiratorial senators who \\"missed\\" several times until that \\"wrestler\\" ended his reign, in a hot tub of all places."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to definitively know you got the remastered version","review":"Pay very careful attention when trying to determine which disc you actually received from Amazon. There's conflicting information on the internet as far as the telltale signs of the remastered disc versus the original crappy transfer. For example, most people tell you the packaging for the new version has a yellow UPC....not always true. Other people tell you the copyright on the back bottom right of the box says 2010 DW Studios LLC instead of the original which says 2009, also not always true.It seems the only definitive way to tell if you have the new version is to look at the innermost rings on the underside of Disc One itself. Hold it up to the light, and at the end of a string of letters and numbers, you should see \\"B1R2\\". If you have anything else (i.e. B1R1), you have the original version and NOT the remastered one!If so, exchange it promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Mess","review":"This review refers to the blu-ray picture quality only. The movie itself is an absolute classic. Unfortunately this blu-ray was a victim of considerable DNR and EE that has actually removed and distorted picture detail. Here's a good example. At the beginning of the movie where we see Maximus as a General leading a final battle, you see an amazing wide shot of flying, flaming, arrows. It should look amazing, right? Wrong. The picture was DNR'd so badly that it actually removed arrows and the ones you can see are a blurred mess! Absolutely terrible. Don't waste your money on this. Wait until they release a quality blu-ray because \\"this is not it!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic movie - defective release","review":"The version about to be released on 2009-09-01 is defective.

I would advise waiting until an updated release is made available, don't let them make you pay twice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"Gladiator was one of the most anticipated titles on Blu-ray, but this release comes from an old master (used for the DVD in 2000) and suffers from too much DNR (digital noise reduction, which smudges detail) and edge enhancement (outlines around edges). In fact, there are details present on the DVD that are missing from the Blu-ray. On the other hand, Braveheart (released on Blu-ray on the same day) has a fantastic picture and makes Gladiator look even worse. The best thing to do is to pick up Braveheart (if you like the movie, of course) and wait for the eventual re-release of Gladiator."},{"rating":"1","title":"overprocessed video look on Blu Ray","review":"Instead of giving us the existing HD master with a high bit rate we get a reprocessedversion on Blu Ray with thick halos from sharpening and a waxy look with fine detailgone thanks to digital noise filtering.

It embodies the days when honor and victory were pure and untainted ideals. You may not like actio films very much, but this film will captivate you with the action, as well as the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR..........FOR SURE!","review":"Gladiator is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a very long time. It is the kind of movie you don't expect it to be soossoso good, but when you finally are watching it you experience every emotion there is for you to experience in a movie(tension, sadness, happiness and fear). Although it does contain some bloody and intense scenes of war, it gives a message of life that is too special to miss it. How love can conquer all and remain in ones mind forever. Gladiator is a movie that, especially in my experience, the viewer feels like it's living the story. Russell Crowe does a fanstastic job in this movie and well deserves the Best Actor Oscar. I hope Gladiator wins the Best Movie!!! HIGHLY recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is GROOVY!","review":"This movie ROCKS! Very realistic!

More like a million.","review":"There is no way you can not enjoy this movie. \\"Gladiator\\" is the greatest movie I have ever seen. Russel Crowe makes the perfect Maximus...he's incredibly sexy and talented. Making the leading man complete. He'll give the others a run at the academy awards, lemme tell ya what. There is no part in the movie that anyone would consider \\"slow\\" or \\"boring\\", in the movie you have something for everyone...violence, drama, romance...its all there. The fighting scenes are edge-of-your-seat-pee-your-pants exciting. You have your gore and your glory; your villains and your heroes. See this movie, and I *assure* you that it will soon be in your video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"It is nice to have this movie on my Kindle...easily portable. I would highly recommend it for your Kindle. I like having it wherever I go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Classic","review":"Ridley Scott has given us a lot of great movies, like Blade Runner and Alien, but Gladiator is probably his biggest mainstream hit and for good reason. The story of Maximus is a human, entertaining one, the depiction of Rome is the best we've yet seen (thanks to some digital imagery)and as a result, as viewers we really do feel transported to that time and place. I think some of the history is flat out wrong, like the ending which suggests that Rome will become a Republic again (yeah, right!), but hey, you can't have everything. I will say this, for all it's glories maybe the movie is a tad overlong, but that's hardly to be mentioned when compared to the magnificence of the opening battle sequence and the tension of the rounds in the colosseum with the gladiators fighting for life and death. I hear there's going to be a sequel, but it will have to take place in Tartarus..."},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE WAS A DREAM THAT WAS ROME","review":"SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER. I GROW TIRED OF CRITICS WHO PAN FILMS LIKE THIS BASED ON THEIR HISTORICAL ACCURACY. IT'S A MOVIE PEOPLE. ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS. RUSSELL CROWE TURNS IN A SPECTACULAR PERFORMANCE. EVERY GLANCE AND LOOK TELLS THE AUDIENCE THAT THIS IS AN ACTOR IN A PART THAT WAS MADE FOR HIM. WONDERFUL SOUNDTRACK FROM HANS ZIMMER AND BEAUTIFUL VOCALS BY THE SINGER OF THE DEAD CAN DANCE AND YOU HAVE A MOVIE THAT BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF LAUDED OSCAR CONTENDERS LIKE ERIN BROKOVITCH AND PAY IT FORWARD.

It has everything: eye-popping special-effects; a fast and exciting plot, interesting characters, and did I mention awesome special effects?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strength and Honor","review":"This is a remake of the embarassing 1992 Gladiator, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Ridley Scott deserves his own series of games to honor him for making us forget that previous dreadful embarassment.Russel Crowe (in the Gooding Jr role) is terrific as General Maximus. His fine acting chops are supplemented well by his James T. Kirk-like build. Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, and Ollie Reed are more than entertaining, and the special effects are nicely done.The supplemental material on the DVD (with a nice behind the scenes documentary, and cutting room footage) is worth the price. The best thing about the DVD? You can fast forward past all those painful to watch Joaquin Phoenix scenes. Whew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly the Best","review":"Okay, no. This is not the \\"greatest movie ever made\\", nor is it anywhere up there with a \\"movie of the year!\\" This was an average movie plagued with clichés and themes already covered by better films.I loved the first battle scene. It was beautiful, despite the death and destruction taking place. However, once that scene is over, the movie takes a steady nose-dive through the rest of the film. From the death of his wife, the gladiator imprisonment and \\"Spartacus-esque\\" training sequences, the villains idiotic decision that taking on the most successful gladiator in Rome could be a good idea (not to mention he's got the jones for his sister), right down to the \\"I've seen that so many times before!\\" ending, there wasn't really an original idea in the whole picture. Top that off with what literally looks like dirt and dust the director forgot to wash off the film reel, and you get a ho-hum movie that's probably only worth watching for the fight scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strength and Honor!","review":"An outstanding portrayal of the barbaric customs of the Romans! From the opening battle scene to the climactic duel in the end, you're on the edge of your seat! Nonstop intense action and excellent acting make this movie a top-5 for me and my dad.A clear line is shown between just plain revenge and duty to country- going along with a dethroned General's motto: strength and honor. A classic, good guy vs. bad guy movie where the protagonist is someone to look up to, someone with leadership qualities.A hand also for Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, who did the score for this film! Bravisimo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Many Flaws and Yet So Good.","review":"There are two ways to be able to enjoy this move. The first, be completely ignorant of the history of the Roman Empire and enjoy it for the great heroic epic it is. The second (and way I chose) is to just ignore the errors, suspend disbelief, and enjoy it for the heroic epic it is. Either way, as action, Gladiator can't be beat. I even almost forgave that dog Crowe for messing around with a married woman (believe me Dennis, you're better off without her). Crowe is close to perfect in the title role (if a bit flabby - Arnold would have been too big). Richard Harris makes even over acting look good. And Oliver Reed is a joy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix . . . well, let's just say he was supposed to be unlikeable, not laughable. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if Gladiator ends up with a little bald gold man for both best picture and best director."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What we do in life echoes in eternity.\\"","review":"It's true that this isn't really historically accurate, but who cares? This is an ACTION film, and we're supposed to be entertained by its action-packed images that would have our adrenaline overflowing. Ridley Scott sure knows how to mix action with drama. I was greatly inspired by not only the battle scenes (both in the forest and in the coliseum), but also the visual spectacle that is Rome. Yes, it's CGI, but it looks so beautiful. The acting is also a plus. Crowe, Nielsen, and Phoenix are excellent here, though I was devastated to see that Crowe won the oscar instead of Tom Hanks for Cast Away. But anyway, they're all brilliant I enjyoed watching this film very much. Grade: A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cow","review":"I must say that this DVD is the best I have ever seen. The only thing Director Ridley Scott should not have added was the love tale. I kind of died. The fight scenes in this movie compare to any war movie including Black Hawk Down and U-571. The only down part of this movie is that you will be sad in the end. BUt thats the way all great movies finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem to be added to any collection","review":"Although I think that Russell Crowes performance was Oscar worthy, his perfect performance in A Beautiful Mind was the part that should have won him the golden guy. He was robbed! Enough about that; this film did deserve picture of the year. I saw if 3 times in the theatre alone, because it captivated me. Everytime that I watch this film I am transported in time. I feel that in the end my breath is taken away. The score is superb and one of the best ever. It helps to move you through the film from scene to scene. This is what movie making comes down to; a masterpiece in it's own right. Love it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid actioner","review":"This is a movie that's grown on me over the years.

Spectacular action sequences and special effects - not a bad watch at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my usual type of moving but just had to have it!","review":"I am really not a fan of blood, guts, testosterone driven movies, but I do love this movie. Perhaps because there is an actual story line or because there is some inclusion of real (not to say strictly accurate) history of the Roman Empire, it is one of few modern movies that is a 'go to' when broadcast on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

Why? Because amazon had it on sale for $10 dollars, AND the Blu ray comes with a coupon so that if you own the original DVD release, you get $10 dollars back (so basically I got it for free, so why not?). The transfer is absolutely atrocious. Yes, people who don't know any better won't notice it, but if you have a system properly calibrated and have seen a better transfer, the comparisons are ridiculous. It is impossible to watch this blu ray and not be distracted by the lack of resolution and all the haloes around every single strand of hair, every spear, every building. Why call this a \\"Sapphire\\" series? Let's hope Joe six pack (most of those who think this looks acceptable) buys as many copies as possible to watch between Nascar races, so a better version can be released ASAP.

He did for Roman epics, what Alien and Blade Runner did for their respective genres. In this movie, he brings the fanatic and edge of your seat excitement that Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart had to the epic roman battles. This film had it all, from a great cast to wonderful cinematography and editing. The only fault I could find was the somewhat anti-climactic ending, but I heard that it was due to some storm that destroyed the sets for the grand epic battle. I wonder if they will shed more light on that subject, but still it was a great movie. It made a star out of Russell Crowe, a great actor who has been in some very good movies, among my favorite, is LA Confidential.The special edition DVD is defiantly worth a look at, I can't wait to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I have just a few things to say. Stunning. The CG in this blasts Titanic out of the water. Where in Titanic you can tell where the real people end and CG begins, I was stunned to find out that Gladiator had CG. I liter5ally could not tell. As a computer arts major, I pride myself on being able to critique the cg, beind able to tell when they haven't used enough layers to make it the CG look real, or whether the peopl in the background aren't quite as smooth as they could be. Gladiator stuns and mazes you with not just a brillant story , but Ripley Scotts legendary amazing viewpoint and telling of Maximus' story and the landscape surrounding him- reminiscant of Bladerunner's majestic run down dark city it's run down hero, Decker.It's a movie worth it's cost and is somethign to be watched along with Spartacus and Ben Hur. Just Glorius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridley Scott selfishly deleted his girlfriend's scenes","review":"You see less of Gianina Facio in this DVD than in theatre.

Now Facio's scenes were cut, you can hardly see the drives in Maximus' revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"I am astounded by the rave reviews I read of this film. I am flabbergasted that it has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. My only explanation is that people who like this movie have never seen one before - yes I mean have never seen any other moving picture or television. Cliche after cliche - horrible acting - every scene stolen from another film or 19th century painting - every storyline stolen from every salacious thing you ever read about Roman History. A travesty. I can not say enough bad things about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: This film is NOT historically accurate","review":"My son was bored in his history class, so I told him to toss aside those stupid books and watch GLADIATOR with us instead! This movie looked so authentic that I had to assume it is historically accurate, and told little Steven not to bother studying anything other than this film for his test on the Romans, or whatever. Much to my surprise, my poor Steven received a D-! I think it is irresponsible for the film industry to tout this film as a complete and accurate history of Rome when, in fact, it may be incomplete. Before you buy this to help you son get out of reading those silly books for history class, look into whether it is historically accurate or not. I have not read much about the Romans.

Maximus(crowe)leader of the roman army led the opening battle against the goths(early germanic tribe). His great leadership puts him up for the seat as the emporer of rome, but before he can decide, the emporer's son kills the emprorer making him the immeadiate heir. He orders Maximus to be put to death but Maximus escapes and gets put in to a gladiator sept.The movie is very historically correct with nothing historians could criticize. The film is moving leaving you with goosebumps and a sense of pride. I recommend this movie to all history buffs (LIKE ME) or to anyone.

While I was never bored during the films lengthy running time (even when so much of the time is spent fawning over unimpressive CGI shots of the Coliseum), I was absolutely enraged that the film is basically a remake of The Fall of the Roman Empire and the screenwriter's of that far superior film are not even acknowledged. If you want a roman epic, rent Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Robe, Fall of the... or countless others. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get into this one","review":"This movie didn't do anything for me. I thought the acting was 'wooden' and the plot simplistic.

Then there's the female role who's all nice and we all have to like her. Then there's the kid who's just annoying.The only good thing is Russell Crowe, the special effects, and stunning overall look of this movie.

The Signature DVD was DTS which came out about 3/4 years ago, why on earth would they re-release Gladiator (for the 4th time) without including the DTS soundtrack. My advice would be to but the signature series if your gonna buy Gladiator, unless you dont want the amazing sound to go with your cool movie.PS. I cant stand when movies are re-released over and over again (Donnie Darko, Army of Darkness, Mallrats,Gladiator.....)Will ther ever be a 'final edition'?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator rules","review":"If you\`re looking for a great satisfaction in a movie, then you have to collect this DVD.

With its special features like the making of Gladiator, interview with the star cast, and also with score mucisian Hans Zimmer, Gladiator DVD provides you the best entertainment in your home. Feel the thrill and the action of this movie. The story is about a General whose family were killed and himself betrayed by Commodus, the son of emperor MArcus Aurelius. The General must become slave and the slave must become gladiator who will defied an emperor.

Please....","review":"This is a perfect example of how Hollywood politics often influence the Academy Awards. Because despite the enormous marketing muscle behind it, this film is essentially a B movie with grade A special effects. The acting is okay and the story is alright. But come on. This has to be the longest film ever made that contains no character development whatsoever. In a nutshell, after spending gobs of money producing it, the studio executives commanded that this movie win the big award. And \\"the people\\" obeyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator","review":"A spectacular, brilliant movie, Gladiator is certainly my favorite of the year. Surprisingly deep for a supposedly action movie, it can easily be put in the drama section as well as the action one. Russell Crowe puts in a fine performance as a Roman general out for revenge, and Joaquin Phoenix surprisingly brings a complicated and human side to his villain Commodus. Crowe may have given his role power and heroism, but Phoenix certainly gave his depth and charisma. Aside from the two leading actors, however, the movie itself was surprisingly close to history. Though an improbable story, it was certainly a possible one; and it certainly brings back memories of a by-gone movie era. The epic picture may not yet be gone from the movie industry. A job well done by Ridley Scott!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ressurection of the epic movies","review":"For such a long time, the roman empire kept off the silver screens. But it returns in a majestic way. This huge producton is one of the best movies of the year, with espectacular sets, a wonderful plot, amazing visual effects and a Russel Crowe like we've never seen before. Who would imagine Russle Crowe as a gladiator? Ridley Scott adds another great movie to his sucesseful career. Gladiator is also one of the possible nominations for the oscars of best suporting actor (Oliver Reed) ,for example. I'm not making publicity but, if you can, buy it! Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence","review":"A superb and convincing acting job by Russel Crowe, well detailed and executed action sequences along with a strong plot and story created an emotional movie succeding that of Titanic and Armageddon combined helped produce the correct recipe for the best movie of the year.

The acting, story, costumes, and backdrops are great, you can tell a lot of effort went into this.Overall, it really is a good movie telling the story of a soldier who falls victim to the jealousy and intrigues of other people, and the story is nicely paced with some great scenes, like when he talks with the new Emperor's nephew, or the scenes between Commodus and his sister, or what happens between Commodus and his father near the beginning of the story.

Hats off to the amazing work that the crew and visual effects people have done for this film.Winner of Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Costumes, Best Visual Effects, and Best Picture. You cant go wrong with this picture. And who could argue with the themes of the work. Fighting for family, love, honor.

I could not say which edition but the tonal background music was in a pitch that was giving me a headache. It tended to overlay the dialog, which in some cases seemed to come out like a mumble. I could have done without Hollywood's idea of background music. It is really not necessary to have tonal music running through an entire motion picture.

Every scene in the first half of the movie is so protracted I had to stop myself from yelling, \\"GET HIM IN THE COLISEUM ALREADY!\\" The film is well structured and a good story but there's not enough meat on this bone for a film well over two hours. And so it feels s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with pretty visuals, pretension and unnecessary talk-talk-talk. If we could get a 90 minute cut of this on the DVD set, I'd buy and treasure it.

He antagonizes emperor Commodus and there is a kind of rivalry between the two throughout the whole movie. It is a heart wrenching tale of one man's struggle to survive against all odds with the only thing keeping him going is his hope for revenge against the one man that destroyed his life. The historical accuracy of the movie is amazingly good in reference to how the Colosseum was composed and some of the methods of fighting. Of course as in all other movies everything is dramatized to fit entertainment value but even with that Gladiator is a striking example of ancient Roman construct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some promise but just boring!","review":"After I read the reviews I was expecting action and tons of it or a little gore.

There is plenty of gory action, but (dare I say) it is \\"tastefully\\" handled -- Scott doesn't drench the screen in blood and guts and body parts, though he does enough to convey the nature of war in the day.Where Gladiator falls short is in shortcutting some important elements of the story. While the characters are detailed, there isn't much depth. Detailed exploration of personality is sacrificed to keep the narrative rolling along at all too swift pace. And the transitions are swift.But I am not complaining too much. It is an enjoyable movie but not an inspiring one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GLADIATOR","review":"This movie is simply... PERFECT. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are oscar winners. This is rhe kind of movies you must see more than once. The more I see it the more I like it.

I didn't think the action scenes were that impressive. The first battle, you couldn't see what was going on in it. Russell Crowe's character was never really challenged throughout the film. I did think Crowe did a good job in the film. It was to expected after standout performances in LA Confidential and The Insider. The story just did not draw me in. Everything looked too easy for Crowe's character (I know I am repeating myself here). It is just disheartening when a good director and a good actor get together and they make a mediocre film. A similar film is Braveheart. Braveheart is a much better film than this. That film thrust you into the battle scenes and made you care about William Wallace. That film had heart, while this film seemed cold and distant. I am sure Scott and Crowe will bounce back with their next projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Ordered this item before Christmas with enough time to ship.

I was extremely disappointed. Is everyone blind to the plot? It is so simple-minded and crude. I have seen better cartoons. Certainly, a couple of action-sequences are interesting -- but is that all you expect from a movie? And the ending is corny. And now some people are actually hopeful that this movie will get an Oscar for Best Picture. How sickening! But then these are the same people who gave Titanic two dozen Oscars. I say don't waste your time or money: get a movie by the Japanese directory Akira Kurosawa if you are interested in similar themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just more hollywood.....","review":"You could get the same effect of watching this movie by playing Enya at full volume all the while stabbing your leg with a fork. This movie falls way short of Braveheart by focusing too much on wooing the audience with digital effects. The soundtrack mimics Titanic by pulling at the heartstrings with cheesy vocal sonets that overlap every interesting part in the movie. It doesn't get anymore melodramatic than Gladiator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of everything...","review":"The effects maybe great but I couldn't stand watching all that voilence. I know it's a true story but they could have avoided showing all those heads coming off.

Take a beautiful story, try bringing it to life using CGI, bring on some very un-talented actors, and this is what you get. Granted, I admire the effort, but it's not good enough. The sound track is the exact same soundtrack used in 'The Rock', with the addition of the talented singer from london (who actually did do good in this sound track). Poor work with the CGI - you can see when the image is real and when it isn't. This movie is certainly not the 'epic' it promised to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor movie in the guise of an epic","review":"Gladiator is a poorly directed movie with a weak script. The opening battle scene is horribly stylized and crude, consisting of scenes repeated at different angles and obvious use of computerized graphics. The gladiatorial combat scenes consists of quick cut-aways and unneeded close-ups which hide detail. A non-action scene in the movie involves a sequence of long, weary, and meaningless dialogue. The characters, especially Commodus, are poorly written for while the plot lacks structure. Russell Crowe does give a strong performance, which somewhat saves the movie. Ultimately, if we compare Gladiator to a good movie in the genre, such as Braveheart, its shortcomings become apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great visuals","review":"Impressive in Blu-Ray, you really feel like you are a part of the action.

Not only is this film boring, but the sound effects drove me nuts. The music is way too loud, the voices are so soft and muddled that I couldn't even understand what was being said half the time. Lots of violence - if that is what supposed to make this film great, it doesn't do it for me. (A headless horseman, big deal.) Parts of it were very confusing and hard to follow. I still don't understand the poisonous snake scene. Maybe if I could have heard the dialogue over the background noise I'd have a better opinion of the movie.

Reason #1: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and all the others are all at their best. Reason #2: Gladiator is not one of those kill, kill, kill movies where all you think about is who will die next. Although there are some of those \\"I think I'm gonna hurl\\" moments, there is a lot more to this movie. Reason #3: Ridley Scott & Co. do a good job of recreating Rome as it might have been back in 180 A.D. This is a movie that, I think, will win these Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor-Russell Crowe, Best Supporting Actor-Joaquin Phoenix, Best Director-Ridley Scott, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, and Best Choreography. That might sound like a bit much, but once you see the movie, I can almost promise you that you'll agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAXIMUS! MAXIMUS! shout the crowd","review":"\\"Husband to a murdered wife, father to a murdered son and I will have my revenge\\" So take that bad guy!This was the message delivered by Maximus to the Emperor during the 150 day Gladitorial Games. It is this bit of dialogue from the film that has been going over and over in my mind ever since. On the whole it's not an emotional film, which I found quite surprising, but if you like action and you're a lover of history (without casting too much of a critical eye on the accuracy of the history), then you'll love it! The special effects are brilliant and the storyline is good for what could potentially be a very boring film in the hands of the wrong director.The only complaint I had having seen the DVD, was that they left out a couple of really good scenes, which would have completed the film quite nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple addendum","review":"A spectacular movie with wonderful extras on the disc, this is one for the collection. Without recycling the same ideas already stated some 500 times before me, I'd like to add that what is wonderful about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in particular is that he doesn't simply make his character fall into the typical villain stereotypes, but rather provides his Commodus with a depth and resourcefulness that make him truly understandable. Treacherous and menacing he may be, but the new Emperor is also wounded, emotionally, perhaps more deeply than any other character in the film. His character might have been the focus of a movie which aimed at creating Shakespeareanesque tragedy rather than heroic epic. The plot, of course, demands resolution in traditional style, but Phoenix does not allow the complexity of Commodus' character to be lost. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD is worth owning!!","review":"Beyond the movie, this DVD offers a TLC documentary, behind-the-scenes, and \\"cutting room floor\\" extras that make it an outstanding value.

All the arrows, crisp colors, etc are there.Now trying to figure out which blu ray is which is the difficult part as the box, from what I can see, looks the same. I don't know if you are going to be able to get it right going through Amazon. No offense to them as I love the company but the only release I see that they are offering is the 2009 edition. It looks like the 2009 edition is known as the first press and the 2010 edition is known as the remastered edition. blu-ray dott comm has a more extensive review of the better copy if you are looking for specifics.The makers that be screwed this up big time as I avoided the blu-ray edition like the plague until someone pointed out to me that the true blu-ray for Gladiator was released in August 2010."},{"rating":"1","title":"They choose never to hear you.","review":"No, I will not buy this so called Blu-ray version of Gladiator.

The opening battle scene is impressive, but the movie takes a nose dive from there. The plot is incoherent. The action sequences are edited in such a way as to completely obscure the action. The acting is not terrible, but the script is simply ludicrous from beginning to end.This movie wasted two and a half hours of my life that I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood's Roman Empire","review":"The only thing that really makes this movie worthy of wasting our time is Russel Crowe's acting as \\"Maximus\\", a Roman general. I have to say, however, that this movie was a brave attempt to make an epic like those of Hollywood's golden age. Unfortunately it didn't work out and one of the main reasons for this is probably the arrogance of the filmmakers that literally distorted and changed the entire Roman history so it could fit in there movie, as if the history of the great Roman Empire was not interestig enough for hollywood. The worst of all is that Hollywood underestimated the audience's intelligence by filling the movie with frenetic scenes of battles and putting aside the real roman story(wich is much more intersting)as if the public could only be impressed by scenes in wich someone's head is cut off and not by the amazing history and legacy of the Roman Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"I expected way more from this movie. I had heard all the buzz, and when I finally saw it, I was pretty excited. But much to my dismay, this film fell flat. Impressive as an action movie, but lame as an epic film in the same vein as Braveheart. Russell Crowe acted only a little, but did not deserve the Academy Award. The movie was too slow at times, like after the battle in the beginning. The whole time afterwards I couldn't wait for Maximus to become a gladiator because I heard so much about those Colesseum fights. Too much talking, and I really was not interested in the story at all. I do have to admit, the fight sequences were very well done, and the technique Ridley Scott used to give the film that look of quickness ( I don't know how to descibe it) works extremely well. Gladiator is nothing but an action movie. I really did not care for the characters, and it certainly did not deserve best picture. I would have voted for Crouching Tiger."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong cvountry","review":"What I mean by that is I can't play the D.V.D. It was the Europeon verssion. I have returned it.

It is a well thought-out action movie (yes, it really is technically an action movie, as one would say Fugitive is an action movie) with great acting (particularly from Jaoquin Pheonix), add an honor theme, great scenes, and a thrilling plot, and you get a movie that feels like an epic and is a wee bit more than an \\"action movie.\\" As I'd say, and lots of Hong Kong movies realize this, action shouldn't feel like action more than an extension of character, which I think works here. Movie sure seem to know how to make the Maximus character seem heroic. As for the DVD itself, I'd have to say this is a very excellently composed DVD. It has lots of great extras such as extra videos and interviews and storyboards. The audio and video quality is quite excellent. One of those rare DVDs where I felt I got more cool stuff than I paid for. ^^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reason I bought my DVD player","review":"I bought my DVD player just to get this film!!

That was not needed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Woman's Perspective","review":"You wouldn't think so from the title and the expected action and fight scenes, but this is a beautiful epic. The love story behind it is lovely but bittersweet. Ridley Scott makes the characters come to life and he makes ancient Rome come to life. Now, I am a teenage girl. I went to see Gladiator with my friend for two reasons: 1) extra credit in Latin IV, 2) Russell Crowe. By the end of the movie, I had forgotten the extra credit, but I hadn't forgotten Russell Crowe. He is marvelous. I was wary of the fighting, I didn't want to see all the gore. Okay, there is some gore, but nothing I couldn't handle. The first battle scene is amazing. When the Barbarians are heard rallying in the woods, it sent chills down my spine, it still does when I watch it on DVD. So, for the boys: you'll love it for the fight scenes. For the ladies: Russell Crowe, he needs no further explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the quality control???","review":"As others have mentioned already, the studios pretty much butchered the Bluray release of this masterpiece.

This movie had one of the strongest cast of actors I have seen in quite some time. I also liked that it did not have a sugar-coated hollywood ending.

Gladiator is one of my favorite movies and I was quite excited about this release. To much dismay, most of the movie visually feels like I am watching an upscaled DVD. There are some moments that shine, but the difference between the great quality of the extended scenes and the processing that plagues the theatrical scenes are very noticeable that it has really made me question why the whole movie couldn't be transferred with the superb visuals displayed in the extended scenes.Overall, the movie is still great with a nice bundle of extras included, but I am still very disappointed with the video quality of the theatrical footage which is what I was mostly looking forward to with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is another case of a well prepared advertisement campaign. Weeks before the film entered the cinemas the world was praising the film as something nobody else had ever seen before. Now, there lay exactly the problem. The 1964 version of \\"The Fall of the Roman Empire\\" (with Sophia Loren) tells more or less the same story but without all the sound effects available now. Take those Dolby Suround/THX effects and you will have a very dull story. That's why I insist watching The Fall of the Roman Empire might lack some technical quality but it beats The Gladiator in most parts. If you like battle scenes and man-to-man fights you get the right movie.

What is the big deal??? Yeah, Russell Crowe looks great with muscles. Here's a tip for ya...he looked good without 'em, too, AND he seemingly could act better (Recall \\"LA Confidential\\" if you will, and the incredible performance he turned in for \\"The Insider\\"). He was sleepwalking through this film. The effects were passable...I did like the overview of the Coliseum on the first day of the Games. But beyond that...yawn.The best thing about this film was Joaquin Phoenix, who proves once again, after the dreadful \\"8MM\\", that he can shine in anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"$10 says Jar Jar is in the missing scenes","review":"Impressive movie with great acting by Russel Crowe and Joachim Phoenix as the tacit Roman General vs. the nutty emperor. There are plenty of fight scenes, some great mano a mano action and some beautiful shots of Rome that make you wonder if you are in the right movie as the grey scale hits big.The problem with this movie is that the greatly hyped special effects are used way too often. You almost expect Jar Jar to show up. And it seems particularly bloodless when a gladiator is cut in half, more than it would be if they used camera angles and visual trickery. Like other computer generated movies, this one leaves you with a headache at the end. So when Russell Crowe gasps \\"your son is safe\\", you don't have time to ponder exactly how safe is a kid whose a member of the Roman royal family where the average life span is 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical flaws are it","review":"There are indeed some historical flaws in this movie, so don't purchase \\"Gladiator\\" as a history lesson. As a story, however, it is excellent, with stellar performances by the entire cast. There is no explicit sex (and the only innuendo is shown as desired by one party and rejected by the other, and not accomplished) and only one or two instances of swearing. There are, however, definitely some adult themes of vengeance, incest (desired by the evil emperor, so it's given proper moral context), and gore. Lots of gore. This movie is as gory as you have heard. If that doesn't bother you, however, and great themes of courage, nobility, and justice float your boat, you should purchase this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, a Roman Emperor DID fight in the Colosseum.","review":"Just to set the record straight, since more than a couple of people here have claimed otherwise---A Roman Emperor (I believe it was either Caligula or Nero) did fight at least once in the Colossuem. Check the history books. I'm sure it was staged so that the Emperor was ensured of survival....But hey, it happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible blu-ray conversion.....","review":"No argument that this is a great movie.

A shame, waste of money for the quality you expect to get from blu-ray video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"The only thing this movie inspired in me was sleep. It was like watching a movie while being high on novacaine, a truly mind numbing experience. The whole experience was a terrific letdown after seeing the previews on television.

I did not like this because after the big build up after the Oscars, it led me to believe that this was gonna be more. The graphics and the recreation of the Area and those firght scenes were alright, but the story line I found kinda boring....not too different from those B Gladiator Movies from the 50s and 60s starring Victor Mature or Chuck Connors. I am one of the few people on earth who is unimpressed with Russell Crowe, he of the same pompousness that created Richard Burton--you never saw Burton in a comedy and you never will see Crowe in one because each takes/took himself waaaaay too seriously. Case in point, this product. My wife paid for the tickets so I was forced to keep my eyes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending Needed Work","review":"It was way too long of a movie to have such a stupid ending. One minute, he was going to get his army, the next, he was fighting the emporer in hand to hand combat. I didn't get it. It was like they ran out of money and couldn't pay the army, so they had to slap together a quick ending. And Russell Crowe's acting? Please. He plays every single role the same: the self-proclaimed inner hero, but with a hard outer shell. So now all of a sudden he's this artist? I personally enjoyed the death scene: picking up his head, gasping, then falling down. My ten-year-old sister could do better then that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best movie? Nah!!!","review":"I realise I am voicing a minority opinion here but I just did not enjoy Gladiator. For me, it was an ok movie and nothing more. It certainly does not compare favourably to classic Roman epics like Spartacus and Quo Vadis. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre at best. I certainly did not feel any sympathy for Maximus in his time of sorrow. Derek Jacobi's senator was a waste of screen time. Commodus came off as a whiny cowardly brat.The best movie of 2000 was Titus. The acting was first class , the directing superb and the movie had a dialogue from a true master, William Shakespeare. Too bad the academy did not agree with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 % Brutality","review":"Well, the movie itself is brilliant. Cameras, scenes, shots, actors, everybody did a great job. However, it seems to me that the movie's a little bit too brutal. In almost every shot you see somebody getting killed or somebody dead. After an hour or so, I was really bored by this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway there.","review":"I've been a big fan of Crowe since Romper Stomper and thought he was great in LA Confidential, but in Gladiator there's really not much for him to do but grunt. The opening battle scene was a mess and early on set the pattern for all that followed in the arena. Scott seems to have gone for the typical high gloss form of Hollywood filmmaking, employing quick cuts with something flying into the camera every second (the latter seems to be the action norm ever since the Twister trailer). The ending is the very definition of anti-climatic. Bottom line, Gladiator never figured out if it wanted to be Braveheart or 13th Warrior, and as a result ended up stuck somewhere between an epic film and a fun movie. Too bad it couldn't make up its mind. Still, I'm looking forward to the DVD's commentary tracks; if nothing else, at least it looked pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste 2 1/2 hours of your life","review":"I didn't find this movie that much of an attention grabber. The storyline was very slow and very long. You have to really be interested in ancient Rome to enjoy this movie. Or just be into Russel Crowe. I also found the storyline hard to follow. One of the only good things that caught my eye, or my ear I should say, was the soundtrack. The composer did an excellent job with the soundtrack.The other thing that caught my eye was some of the special effects.The acting by Joaquin Phoenix was just atrocious. I can't believe they made this guy such a cry baby. His mellowdramatic scenes were some of the worst that I had ever seenI would only recommend this to someone that really likes Russel Crowe. Women, I have to tell you, you don't see that much of him. In fact, they must have run around everywhere wearing armor, because that's pretty much what he wore the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess my expectations were too high. Disappointed.","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time is Braveheart and I had heard such glowing reviews of Gladiator and often comparisons to Braveheart that I couldn't wait to see it.

Joaquin Phoenix did make a pretty good \\"bad guy\\" but overall I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture???","review":"After this movie won best picture, I can no longer give any respect to the academy awards. The story line is completely predictable, the character development is nonexistent, and the movie is filled with gratuitous gore to make up the difference. Some of the acting is humorously terrible (like the scene where Commodus kills his father, oh dear...) Crowe's performance is decent but certanly not an Oscar winning one.The film probably deserves two stars on account of visuals, soundtrack and passable acting by Crowe but I'm giving it one star because it has been so ridiculously overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore Fest","review":"This movie was boring and too long.

On the DVD, the picture is so dark the whole time, you can only see half of what's going on. DUMB.

That ought to tell you everything you need to know. I will never cease to be amazed at the amount of praise that was heaped on this movie. The story dragged on and on; historical verity was pure Hollywood, so far as I could tell; and nothing seemed so important as pretty scenery and luminous cinematographic effects. Finally, the dialogue was nothing short of embarrassing--towards the end, my friend and I gave up all efforts to conceal our laughter. Neither Crowe's bedrock solidity nor Joaquin Phoenix' Fiennes-like homoerotic flamboyance could save this film (check out the latter's 'busy little bee' tirade).

I compared the the screen shots and it is the not-as-digitally scrubbed version.That said this version does sadly suffer a bit (IMO) from a change of color (vs. previous release and dvd) as it is has been updated to the match the newer Hollywood trend of making everything more blue/teal & orange.

Universal just did an upscale of the DVD transfer creating artifacts, noise and blur over the picture. I really don't know what they're thinking with this one. This movie should have a re-release with a proper picture quality.Besides that, the movie deserves a better sound mix like the first DVD release.Shame on you Universal :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Shroom-Ray","review":"Honestly I thought the reviews on the blu-ray version were a bit harsh. But after seeing the HD version myself I cannot fathom why anyone would fork over their hard earned cash for something so sub-par. Honestly, Ridley Scott HAD to have known about this..or maybe he just doesn't care about his products anymore? The faces honestly look like something out of a wax museum. Yes, the arrows in the beginning are GONE. Facial close-ups resemble a painting. My Open Matte version is light years aheads of this drek. Please do not give in to such shoddy marksmanship..whomever mastered this abomination should be fired immediately and replaced by an agent who knows what they are doing.Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear","review":"Steer clear of this Blu-Ray title as it is a very bad transfer and is DVD quality and maybe not even that to some eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened","review":"Well, Amazon did it to me too - the picture shows the remastered version and I ordered on that basis, but today what do I receive? The original version. Sending it back today for a refund. BestBuy, here I come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE","review":"I don't know what these other people were watching when they said this was just a good movie becuase when I saw Gladiator it was a GREAT movie. And the Academy of Motion Pictures must agree since it gave Gladiator 5 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actor (Russell Crowe.) It is a great epic film with sweeping views of Rome(should have won the Cinematography Oscar over that Tiger movie), and a good storyline. The battle scenes can be a bit violent, but NOTHING like the likes of Saving Private Ryan. This is perhaps the greatest DVD in my collection, and one of my favorite films of all time. The DTS sound is incredible. The Special Features will keep you entertained for days. If you are a DVD buff, you MUST own this movie. If you just love movies you MUST own this movie. JUST BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAXIMUM MAXIMUS","review":"Russell Crowe really is great in this film, he exudes charisma and you totally buy that this guy would be be a threat to anyone wanting to be Caesar, since the Caesar's didn't have to be blood relations. Pheonix is also really good, he plays his sadistic character with gusto, and if you know anything about the history of the Caesars you know they were usually stark raving mad....as for Harris, he was just an acting icon, and he steals every scene he is in. The film itself is beautiful, whatever you think of Ridley Scott as a director, he does know how to shoot a visually spectacular film, the openning battle scene is fabulous. This is an action packed winner, I really don't know anyone who did not like this film in some way and most loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLU RAY VERSION IS WORTHLESS-SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"The BLU RAY version is a mess. The flaming arrows disappear, the other details in the opening scene are destroyed due to improper use of noise reduction, the faces look as though waxed over, EXCEPT for SOME of the extended portions that were added to the theater version, which are okay and better than those portions in the original release shown in theaters. Appearantly, this movie done without re-creating a master version from using actual ENTIRE film. Cancel your pre-ORDER ASAP, and keep your regular DVDs as the upscaling standard DVD is MUCH better.Gladiator in blu ray a rip-off, and those resposnible should be fired. Maybe a class action lawsuit should be filed (however Braveheart is a good one in blu ray)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray review: Sapphire Series, really??","review":"This edition of Gladiator on Blu-Ray is a joke. I'm a huge fan of the film, and was really looking forward to this movie getting a picture quality overhaul. Instead, we are treated to an old transfer of the film, with a bunch of image processing slapped on. They tinkered with the picture so much that some of the scenes are actually missing details seen on the original DVD!!!!! Some of the flaming arrows are missing from the battle scene, every close-up shot of a character has a halo around the actor (due to a process they applied call Edge Enhancement). These studios need to wake up, we don't want the film altered! We just want the cleanest conversion of a movie possible, even if that includes film grain!This is just really disappointing as one of the first Blu-Rays to be dubbed \\"Sapphire Series\\". They need to fix this, or Sapphire will just become a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch actual Film Elements being removed on the Blu-ray","review":"Checkout this comparison, when the mouse is off of the picture you see a picture of the HD broadcast version, when you move the mouse over you see the blu-ray version.

Well as soon the video edition came out in my video club i only rent it because of the oscars it had won and i was courious. The first 5 minutes was enough to change my mind. Almoust perefct in every way : the director (THE great Mr Scott)did a great job (the action scenes are great and also the flash backs); good plot; Russel is the perfect heroe : a man tormented by the death of his Joaquin family trying to avange them, in the oposite corner is Phoenix the \\"vilan\\" who is fourious by the chose of his father to give the power of the empire to a a general; one of the best soundtrack i had ever heard; and excelent psecial efects: I really recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!","review":"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time!! This movie is NOT just a stupid action movie, it is MUCH MUCH more!! The plot, acting, script, music, scenery, effects, directing, etc were all the BEST that I have ever seen!!

I realize the negative reports of this BD movie and have seen some imperfections in this film. However, IMO I do not feel the movie is as bad as people are making it out to be. Alot of people are basing their opinions on screenshots. To actually judge a movie one must actually watch it. This is what I did, and I feel this movie is completely watchable. Most of the movie looks very good and would give 4 out of 5 stars for the picture quality. If I had to make a decision again to purchase or not, I would purchase this movie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic film of epic proportions","review":"Gladiator definitely deserved to win the Oscar. The film is magnificently put together from beginning to end. The drama and action compliment eachother quite well in this film, which is often hard to find in recent movies. The fight scenes are amazing, but are made even more amazing because of the drama and emotions that flow beneath the action. Russel Crowe is amazing in this film and definitely grabs the audience and brings them into this ancient civilization. Great on DVD as well, sound is impressive as well as the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best and rightfully so","review":"This was a great movie! Russell Crowe made Maximus totally believable and this film gives you an insight into Roman history. Except for a couple of things, it is true to the historical happenings. It brings the animalistic side of humanity to the forefront while balancing it with the spiritual side of the main character. Well written, well acted, and not a trace of sex or 4 letter words, even the battle scenes are done as tastefully as possible. I was on the edge of my seat during the battle scenes, cringing at the actions of Commodus and cheering for Maximus when he proves what it is to really be a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with Ebert","review":"I agree with Roger Ebert, this [was terrible]! I thought Crowe would be great, like he's a great actor! He [wasn't]! Pheonix had no depth like he did in Signs! He showed no enthusiasm, he was dull and his character was in love with his sister, how dumb is that? The sister wasn't any help! The hero was a gladiator, no problem there, only a dull gladiator, problem! The only one I liked was the slave that helped out Maximus(Crowe), he was pretty good! And of course, I like Russel Crowe but he was bad in this movie, get another one of his, any other of his is better then this,..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating what computer graphics can do these days ...","review":"What fascinates me about this film was the heavy use of computer graphics in the making of the film, including the stunning remaking of the Colosseum. Believe me, <Titanic> has met its match.Unlike <Titanic> however, this film is actually blessed with good performance, a decent script, and a fair amount of historical research. In fact, the second DVD is mainly a documentary about the role of gladitorial combat in Roman society in those days, which I heartily to classical history teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notable... Especially thanks to the talented Mr. Crowe","review":"I saw this movie not knowing what to expect... A remake of a classic is almost always a disappointment. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this Gladiator stands on its own two feet quite well. Russell Crowe is appropriately meloncholy, and you can really cheer for his battle to regain the dignity taken from him.This movie may seem long by minutes, but the time flies. You'll be at the edge of your seat wondering how the players will resolve their conflicts until the last bittersweet moment. Definitely one of the best written movies of the year.ONE NOTE: There are some scenes during the gladiator matches that may make some squeamish, thought the director and editor have kept the gore to a minimum."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Just Plain Out Kicked!","review":"WOW, this was a great one. The scenery was absoluty amazing. The Roman Collesium brought back to life! The fight scenes for all you action junkies were the best I've seen in a while! The plot was well made. Not enough can be said about this movie. One of the greatest of all time. It's your duty as a movie watcher to go out and see this one or pick it up on DVD! The DVD has great special interviews and a lot more good stuff. Hooray for Gladiator!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GLADIATOR OF A FILM","review":"Well. While I saw it last year, films such as Caesar and Cleopatra, Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Quo Vadis? and Cleopatra rolled in my head. But this was different. A real characterisation of a person who longed for a family reunion in Valhalla. And even better; the action/spectacular scenes never interfered with the story but served its purpose... It is a magical piece of work and a good swansong for Oliver Reed."},{"rating":"1","title":"why would they even sell VHS?!","review":"I clicked on DVD, it brought me here, I was tired didn't pay attention and got the VHS, no one watches VHS why would they put gladiator on VHS? best movie ever but craziest thing ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This film made the Roman Army real.

He is betrayed by the dying king's son, who kills his father(The King!) before word is told to the population that Crowe is to be king. All sorts of bad things happen to Crowe, who is sold to a merchant to become a gladiator. A great ensambel cast rounds out this incredible battle of heart and spirit vs. evil and jealousy! Get it on blue-ray and cheer on Crowe in all of his battles to the end. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not play","review":"Im sure there was nothing wrong with the company itself but the movie they shipped me, which was marked as \\"good,\\" did not play on three dvd players as well as an xbox and ps3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy at Best","review":"The only things that saved this movie from mediocrity were the acting qualities of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix as well as some of the excellent editing achieved in some of its scenes -- particularly the initial battle scenese with the Goths and in some of the gladiator scenes when in Rome. Otherwise a historically inaccurate depiction with set designs resembling Ceasars in Las Vegas than Rome in the distant past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, But No BEN HUR","review":"There's lots of spectacle here, and a reasonably compelling story dealing with honor, love, and revenge. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as the villain, and certainly deserves his Oscar-nomination.Yet, I must say that when I saw this film last summer, I ate my popcorn, enjoyed the picture, then went home and quickly forgot about it. The film did not linger, and I had no desire to see it again at the theater--possibly because I followed it up with BEN HUR, an infinitely better Roman epic.GLADIATOR is undoubtedly one of the year's best, but if the Oscars are just, it will not beat CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON... which is, quite simply, one of the finest films in the history of world cinema (AND which has far better swordplay)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detestable","review":"Just what we need. Hollywood has outdone itself. A new low in bogus history and gratuitous ultra-violence. It appears that our kids haven't yet been fed enough ignorance and callousness to human life. Excellent technical production, very good acting, corny script, and criminal intent by our commissars of popular culture. In a more enlightened society, the purveyors of this poison would be dragged from their Rolls-Royces and shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"High gloss, thin content","review":"For the Gladiator enthusiast, this DVD set does it proud, supplying almost everything you could desire in a collector's edition. It's a pity that the movie itself does not deliver. The production values are gorgeous, but the storyline is so thin that its straightforward unfolding contains no surprises, and in essence the movie devotes its more than two hours of running time to a story of just three characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Ending","review":"The movie Gladiator was a very good movie; right up to the last 20 minutes. Director Ridley Scott did a very good job at making a Rome, let's not take anything away from him. But I must say that I didn't like the ending. I like history, and I do not like how Hollywood is re-wrirting history. First \\"The Patriot\\", and now this. When people come out of the theater, they really think that Commodus was killed by a slave, general then slave sorry. Hollywood is filling people's, espically kid's, minds with flase information that they think is true. I mean, come on, where were the historacal adviors in these movies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"I did not buy this from Amazon.com but I must say that this DVD is defective. I have already gone through 2 of them and they have severe video problems. It wasn't my DVD players fault. I wouldn't suggest buying this until they recall them and fix them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't begin to tell you how dissapointing Gladiator was","review":"Ridley Scott's made TV commercials before feature films. I never saw that style in his films (Alien, Blade Runner) before. In commercials there is not time to develop an idea so commercial makers get you aroused with style rather than substance. So it is with Gladiator. The fight scenes are exciting but meaningless. I couldn't really tell what was going on but it was exciting. Some of the transitions reminded me of a car ad. The dialog was not good. There was no economy in developing the characters so the movie is 20 minutes too long. If you want to see a great spectacle then rent Ben Hur."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best movies of 2000","review":"I think Mel Gibson might want to step aside from doing historical movies and let Russell Crowe take over. This is the first Crowe movie I have ever seen and I am impressed. Very impressed. This man can act.I also think Jocaquin Phoenix is an excellent actor. He plays a character that you just love to hate and he is really good at it too. If it comes down to talent, I must say Phoenix did a wonderful job and he is a much much better actor than his brother ever was. I think Hollywood should keep an eye on this man ~~ he is talented. Between the two of them, I can see why they took over the world by a storm. One classically noble and one pathologically weak. This is a movie between good and evil, for the greater cause and for love.Gladiator is a movie for both women and men ~~ it really shows humanity in its best and vilest forms. And the photography is just stunning. This is a movie that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator","review":"The Story was a little weak at times, but that hasnt stopped me from watching it for the fourth time in a week.

The story is gripping, with the fallen leader rallying his fellow gladiators to freedom.Action scenes have great replay value. Sometimes I just fast forward straight to the epic battle scenes. Amazing film work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of 30 minutes","review":"What is all the hype about this movie. After 30 minutes I was so bored that I turned it off and watched Battlefield Earth, good movie BTW. The video quality is awesome, the sound quality is ok. This movie is too predictable. Too much time was spent getting a million different shots on the battle seens. This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched in whole or in part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with PC DVD","review":"I bet it's a great movie, but it won't play on my new Asus DVD ROM drive which other DVD's I've rented play on just fine.

However, after seeing \\"Gladiator\\" last night, I have been unable to keep away from giving the world my opinion.From start to finish, \\"Gladiator\\" is a fantastic epic with a powerful storyline and awesome acting. Before seeing it, I was skeptical as to it winning the Academy Award. However, after seeing it I would put it up against any of the Best Picture nominations SINCE TITANIC.After watching it at my uncle's house, I am going out to buy it today. I urge you to do the same. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply GREAT!","review":"I bought this video sight unseen. No, never saw it on the big screen but I got such a great deal and I do like Roman Gadiator type movies so I thought \\"what the heck\\" and bought it.I am SO glad I did -- and so sorry I didn't see it on the big screen!It doesn't matter what this film did to history. What's written in history is mostly made up anyway. This movie probably came closer than we think. Who cares? Russell Crowe is spectacular in his understated performance as Maximus (he deserved the Oscar he got) and Mr. Phoenix was also superb. As a matter of fact, the entire cast was well suited, including Derek Jacoby, Richard Harris and the always wonderful and (much missed) Oliver Reed.And the end - well - it was moving and so well done. A very happy unhappy ending if you ask me.GLADIATOR is a movie for people who like heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's hope it sweeps the oscars!","review":"Gladiator is a movie I saw a couple months ago and it still holds up in my opinion. Russell Crowe does a great performance as Maximus, a roman general who becomes a slave. Joaquin Phoenix is an excellent villian who is so evil you just want to gouge out his eyes with your bare hands. Like alot of epic films that get nominated for Best Picture at the oscars, Gladiator is long and a bit boring. But spectacular battles at the roman colosseum and great acting will keep you riveted right to the end. This film however should not be viewed by the weakened heart, due to graphic violence. But anyone who has a big set, is interested in the roman empire or who just likes great movies should watch this cinematic masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Christmas Gift","review":"I bought this from my son's Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy with the gift wrap I ordered.

Russell Crowe is the hero in the story of Maximus, a former Roman general who seeks revenge and redemption for Rome.The characters are pretty broad, but the cast is enjoyable to watch. Joaquin Phoenix chews plenty of scenery (\\"I am vexed.\\") but gives a twisted, juicy portrayal of Commodus, the ruler of Rome.The disc is a good value, with the commentary track by Ridley Scott and others being worth the price of admission. The transfer is pristine and the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack will rock the house.

Unfortunately, Amazon is still sending out the old version at least in my case. I called Paramount Home Entertainment (888-889-9456) and they verified my copy I rec'd on Aug. 10 was the old version. They also indicated the old version had been pulled & discontinued. Verification was done by asking two questions: 1) What was the color of the UPC label, yellow not white is the new version, and 2) What is the ID number on the back side of Disc 1 near the center. I had to use a magnifying glass to read it beginning with the letters \\"NA\\" and ending with \\"R1\\" for the old version or \\"R2\\" for the new.

No other movie, especially one as long as Gladiator, has held my attention by the second. I sat on the edge of my seat throughout. My girlfriend liked the movie, however, not as much as me.

While the movie is wonderfully done, the opening battle scene became the \\"show off your sound system\\" scene that those of use with DTS 6.1 systems used to impress our friends with. So naturally, when the 3 disk \\"extended edition\\" came out, we had to have that too. Only, WHERE'S THE DTS 6.1?. This is soooo frustrating. Do I stay with my original 2 disk (no additional 17 minutes but DTS 6.1) or do I forsake that great sound for the additional foottage. AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN THESE Two. Come on people! Can't someone get this right?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why no DTS!?","review":"When I first saw Gladiator in the theater I was somewhat disappointed. Watching it on DVD caused my appreciation for it to grow. It can now be listed among my favorites. So much so that I was very much looking forward to the extended version... til I got it. While the additional minutes add to the story, and make it an even better viewing experience, this movie is also a delight to the ear. That's why I am dismayed by the lack of a DTS soundtrack, which is available on the original DVD release. Why not put each version, theatrical and extended, each on their own disk and give us that remarkable SOUND EXPERIENCE too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"The most overrated and disappointing movie in years. Cheesy special effects, lurid overracting, ponderous, cliche-filled story. I have rewatched it several times, thinking, \\"It can't be that bad. I must have missed something. There must be more to it.\\" Well, it is that bad, I didn't miss anything, and there's nothing mroe to it than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Budget Bomb","review":"I thought \\"Gladiator\\" was remarkably uncompelling. The much ado about its CGI effects only made everyone think virtually every scene was computer generated. The effects themselves look totally unreal and strangely prototypical, as if they hadn't quite figured it all out yet. And the DVD is reverently packaged like everyone involved was confident they'd made a masterpiece. They didn't. And the last shot of Russell Crowe walking toward his wife and son reminded me uncomfortably of that idiotic walk into the clouds at the end of another preposterous Roman epic,'The Robe.' Kubrick's 'Spartacus' is nearly 40 years old, but it's infinitely more advanced than 'Gladiator.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea - bad implementation","review":"I went to see Gladiator knowing that it wouldn't be historically accurate but expecting at least a good movie. Unfortunately, the movie dragged. If it had been shorter/tightened up it would have been better. The biggest surprise and disappointment was the bad visual effects. The transitions between computer-generated images and live action were obvious and sloppy. It would have been easier to forgive the freedom with historical fact if the overall effect was better. All-in-all, I was very disappointed with the quality of the movie. Russel Crowe did a good job, as did several other actors, but they couldn't save Gladiator from mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet, that is, until 4K Hi Def?","review":"Superb.

Russell Crowe excelently plays the general maximus a simple minded yet important man to the emperor of Rome.Forced to fight in the arena after the emperors son commodus kills maximus' wife and kid Gladiator doesn't run out of action.

I am not a person who goes to the movies frequently. Even a good movie I seldomly see more than twice on the big screen (Saving Private Ryan was a two-fer), but Gladiator I was draw to three times. Russell Crowe did a fantastic job establishing his charactor. He commanded respect and admiration because he was so humble and sincere, yet extremely skilled and courageous as a soldier. The cinematographing was well done and the battle scenes and story line gripping. Historically, it takes some liberties here and there. The biggest weakness of the movie is Maximus' transition from fugitive to slave, but other than that, Gladiator is a movie you'll walk away from thinking about your own moral fiber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough Said","review":"When is the prequel coming out???If you have not seen this movie you must live in a cave - must see on DVD - VHS does not give the same result for the Unlease Hell track !BUY IT, Borrow it or Rent it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in a long time...","review":"This is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time. It has all of the criteria for a great epic film, betrayal, revenge, romance... well, not so much romance unless you have an appetite for incest as did the Prince in the film... but more importantly, the majestically depicted never tiring story of the struggle between good versus evil. Of course, there's a fair share of gore in the film, but the emotions brought on by the film far outweighs the Hollywood \\"Terminator\\" style of photography. In short, this was a film that brought my family and I to a standing ovation in front of our living room television set!!! Surely, it will do the same for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Epic For the Ages","review":"For a while I thought the \\"Sword and Sandal\\" movies were over, until I saw \\"Gladiator\\". The movie changed how I see great epics. A little bloody, but after all that was the way of the world back then, right? Ridley Scott again amazes the audience with great scenes, excellent plot, script, and acting, and dazzling special effects. Like the movie \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" the main character is a man that is not normally violent, but has a killer instinct, and isn't afraid to use it, that to me, is a true man, and Maximus, is a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mess","review":"Agree with other reviews - the disc is a mess and no better than DVD - in fact with DNR and EE on blue ray - the processing shows up even more!A disasterWhat were they thinking?Paramount, please do this right and remaster the movie for true 1080P - no processing is fine; film grain is fine - just give us all of the detailDo not buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great ACTION!!! film","review":"This is an action file. Russell Crowe is excellent as Maximus, but the film has an overly weedy villain who lets the film down. I have no doubt that most people will enjoy this and for good reason: Fantastic battle set-pieces, Exciting, it doesn't really seem three hours long, stunning backdrops and realistic locations, Great performance by Crowe, probably deserving the Best Actor he received, So enjoy but don't expect much more than a fantastic three hours fun with little to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLAYER IS INCOMPATIBLE","review":"The movie Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray] gives error \\"THIS PLAYER IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH REGION MARKING OF THIS DISK\\" while playing on Sony BDP-S380.It works perfectly on my laptop's blu ray disc drive.

I will avoid Paramount discs in the future as the way they handled this entire exercise was a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Plot?","review":"After hearing all the hype about Gladiator, I was dissappointed to see it for myself ( DVD version ). I was told that the fight scenes were good, and they were, but the rest of the movie is just filler. There is almost no plot whatsoever, and what little there is is so incredibly predictable it's almost sad. The best part of the 2 disc DVD set is the real history of the gladitorial games on the second disc. Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but eye candy","review":"Here's the way I see it: all movies get at least one star, because that's the lowest rating. Gladiator gets two stars: one for existing, and the other for being nice to look at. The cinematography is excellent, the CGI effects are amazing, and the action is good. The problem is, Gladiator is nothing but a loosely strung together series of money shots. The plot and dialogue fail to hold interest for more than a few minutes at a time. You can sleep through all but ten scenes or so, and you won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with your VHS Copy","review":"VHS? Of course I'm kidding (but not that far off). I know nothing about all the technical bruha about this transfer and that transfer and this quality and that quality. But it doesn't take a technophile to see how bad it looks does it? Just got my copy in the mail today. I ignored all the hate mail and bought it anyway as I love the movie. Don't we all. Ummm, yeah it's bad. Kinda off putting. I can see the Dreamworks Execs foaming at the mouth. Fortunately I live in Japan and Blu-rays here are $40 ~ $50 a pop so I can sell it again and get my money back. Too bad though as I really love the movie. I like these Amazon forums. Very helpful for my next purchase. 2001 is in the mail. Hope its good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator (Extended Edition) is Great","review":"Truly a masterpiece. This DVD belongs in every collection. The extended edition has some additional scenes which were not in the original release. Worth a little extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful disgrace to consumers/supporters of BLURAY","review":"I have seen both Gladiator and Braveheart on blu-ray as of street date Sep 2. I watched Braveheart first and was pleased with the natural film like quality of the transfer and the amazing level of detail, kudos on Braveheart! Gladiator, on the other hand, was a disappointment in all areas. When the level of detail is taken to this extreme with DNR and EE it results in a very artificial and harsh picture. This is the case with Gladiator. So extreme is the \\"scrubbing\\" of this film that actual parts of the movie are missing, as reported. This is unacceptable. Any QC could have easily spotted this before production. To make matters worse, this is part of their \\"Sapphire series\\" which apparently means...we dont care, just give us your money you idiots. Not me...not a chance. Not until this is is re-issued and confirmed. Shame on you Universal and Paramount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for Gladiator Blu Ray","review":"Note that this is a review for the Blu Ray release of Gladiator (Sapphire), NOT the movie itself. Watched it over the weekend having picked it up a few weeks ago when it was on sale at amazon. The negative press this release has been getting is WELL DESERVED. I am not exaggerating in the least when I say the video looks like a 480 source scaled to 1080 resolution with overly aggressive sharpening and digital filtering. Edges look enhanced and fine details get blurred over throughout, all of which takes away from the viewing experience. In my opinion, it is marginally better than the Extended Edition DVD scaled on my Toshiba HD-XA2, and nowhere near the quality that the Blu Ray medium is capable of. My recommendation would be to stay away from this release unless you absolutely must watch it in \\"high definition\\" today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended what?","review":"This is advertised as an \\"extended edition\\", but your technical information does not mention the length of this \\"extended\\" edition as other listings do. Is it an extended edition because it's loaded with extras, like commentaries etc? Or are there deleted scenes included in the movie itself. If you're going to advertise an \\"Extended\\" edition you should at least explain what the extensions are! I want to buy this movie but not until I see further explanation. I'm sure many of your other customers feel the same way. Your marketing people should be more on the ball. You're losing a lot of sales due to their lack of expertise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie EVER","review":"If you liked Braveheart as much as I did, you probably thought that it would never have an equal. But guess what, Gladiator has come out, and although hard to concieve, this movie is every bit as good as Braveheart, but the battle scenes and intensity of the plot are even better. This movie is not for people with a weak tolerance for violence, but if you bring yourself to see it, you will understand, as many others do, why this movie is the most intense film ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its one of those movies","review":"this is one of those movies that when it ends you sit there and think about it and how amazingly good it was. most movies you leave the theater with your friends and forget the movie 5 minutes later because there are more important things there like girls and food. anybody who gave this movie under 4 stars was probably sidetracked when they saw it or was some history teacher that cant stand innaccurate movies. and theres always the people that are obsessed with chickens and whatnot who should be ignored anyways. this movie just seems like its on a different level than all the movies being pumped out today for cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've ever seen","review":"This is one of the best movies out there. It has awesome effects and the gladiator fight scenes are sweet. I know the movie wasn't true and most of it didn't happen in ancient history but that makes it even more exciting. I know that nobody expected the ending but in a few ways it makes the movie better. I think this is one of the coolest movies there is. If you haven't seen it you should rent it. If you like it as much as I do then buy it, you'll want to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad history. bad costumes. just plain bad.","review":"This is one of the worst movies to come out in years. The history is appallingly bad. It's down right offensive to anyone who knows anything at all about the Roman Empire. The costumes (which won an Oscar!) are even worse (note that the emperor's sister is wearing a Victorian corset, complete with busk, over a sari in one scene!). It's criminal that Hollywood gets away with such travesties, and is rewarded with praise and adulation for them, especially when these so called \\"historical\\" movies end up in our children's classrooms as study aids. Why can't the entertainment industry spend the extra five minutes to check their history, or hire a consultant? The ONLY reason to see this film is if you're a die-hard Russell Crowe fan (and even then in falls into the same group as the quick and the dead: Watch the Russell scenes, and fast forward through the rest)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snail is faster","review":"The one star is for Scotts use of that much film without losing his guild card. The pacing of this movie, with the exception of several fight scenes, is leaden. Regardless of what is happening, everyone moves at the same slow pace. Even when the bad guys are hot on the trail, the good guys just sleepwalk through another scene. This might be because this 2.5 hr movie only has 1.25 hrs of plot. Even with all this extra time, nobody thought to add a little dialogue to clean up all the loose ends. For example, after the early battle, he says he wants to go home to his farm & family. If he had said his farm was in Spain (easily done)then it would make sense that he was called the Spaniard when he was a slave. This is just one of many examples of this films many failures.Save your money or buy some porn. The dialogue is almost as good and the acting is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did this win best picture?","review":"It is a great action movie. Keyword there is action. Best picture is supposed to be a drama, and Gladiator is far from and excellent drama. In fact all the dramatic scenes were pretty bogus. I cant even believe people voted Gladiator the best-best picture of all time. Gladiator should never have won best picture. If action movies won at the oscars than why hasn't Arnold won an oscar. Arnold's action beats Ridley Scott's any day. Another epic by another Aussie is 6 thousand times better: Braveheart. William Wallace has chunks of guys like Maximus in his stool. Braveheart is far and away a better best picture candidate. In fact every other best picture winner is better than Gladiator, because Gladiator never should have won best picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"At my signal, unleash hell.\\"","review":"Gladiator was a spectacle that kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time in the movie theater.

Okay, maybe I wasn't. . .but I was appalled. This movie is NOT GOOD! There are some great actors in Gladiator. . .but what a waste of talent. The plot is so hackneyed and Hollywood, and call me female, but I don't find prisoners being hacked to bits entertaining. He's forced to be a Gladiator, so he decides to be the best darn gladiator there ever was. . .Yeah! Doesn't that fill your heart with a warm, rosy glow?? UH, NO!! And the emperor getting down there to fight with him. . .that was the last straw. . .even Caligula would've called that crazy. If we're cheering when people are being slaughtered, I don't see how we're any better than the ancient Romans. Sure, it's a movie, but to find it entertaining. . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every accent except Roman","review":"I got a laugh watching this movie times simply because the actors didn't even attempt to hide their true accents or try sounding Roman. And if you watch the fight scene that includes Tigers, you can see the Tigers lying down (and sleeping) in the background. I doubt that this was intentional humor.Overall, the movie was kind of a blur for the action scenes then slow and plodding during the drama. I predicted the final outcome 20 mins into the movie and was sadly correct. The script just didn't have any life to it.On the positive side, Russell Crowe has a great voice and the non-incestuous sister was very attractive. Although the computer animation was obvious, it was impressive to see Rome in all it's glory.Rent before you buy may be my best advice on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zulus in the Teutoburger Wald?","review":"This movie lost all credibility, and me, after the first battle scene between the Romans and the Germans when the Germans were chanting in Zulu.I'm pretty sure that whoever did the sound editing on this film was high when they inserted that little gem.It sounded great at Rourkes Drift*, but really stupid in the German forest.I assumed that from that point onward the film would go downhill accordingly...and I was not disappointed.* The movie was \\"Zulu\\" with Michael Caine, Stanley Baker and Jack Hawkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just a movie people!!","review":"If I wanted accurately depicted history I would go back to school....I found it be very entertaining, and have watched it several times..."},{"rating":"1","title":"to gag is not enough","review":"Actually, I would like to give this movie a negative star rating. Ridley Scott basically raped the Roman Empire and put a modern socio-political spin on a time when there weren't even free elections. Seeing Maximus throw down his sword and shout, \\"Are you not entertained?\\" at spectators of a gladiator fight had me screaming, \\"Die next time!\\" Of course, Maximus had to be the adult, white male, accepting of all other colors, creeds, and genders (and he loves those innocent little kids). Good stuff, for today to be sure, but that's what makes this movie fiction and not historical fiction. It's odd that this happy, feel good concept is juxtaposed to a dark, gloomy back drop and morose faces on characters. Scott was clearly trying really hard to say something, maybe even something important, which makes this bad movie all the more embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture? Give me a break.","review":"I thoroughly HATED this movie. The fight scene with the tigers was visually spectacular, but that doesn't make up for a drudgingly dull plot & awful acting from Russell Crowe. He Is, in my opinion, the single most over-rated actor in the last 20 years. He has gone above and beyond when it comes to OVER ACTING, none of his roles that I've seen have been convincing OR entertaining. I am certainly not qualified to critisize an actor and nobody may find my review to be helpful, but I have to be honest in my opinions and mine is this: THIS MOVIE IS A STINKER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At my mark, unleash Hell","review":"The movie is pure entertainment with strong actors, mesmerizing music, and stunning special effects. There is no weak part of this movie. The ending is very moving and makes you realize that while seeing this film, you would eagerly follow Russell Crowe, as Maximus, through Hell to get to the Elysian fields. Maximus is a man among men in this Blockbuster epic that is the best movie since Ben Hur. A very stong candidate come Oscar Award time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit on the overdone side","review":"I prefer my flicks to be a bit more subdued. I could have lived without all the floaty nonsense at the end. I knew what was happening. No need to 2x4 me over the head.On the good side, the cinemaphotography is breathtaking. Really lovely shots that I kept imagining framed and on my wall. Acting is well done and Gravitas (Oliver Reed) was splendid. He will be much missed.I was told that this was a very gorey film. I did not come away with that impression at all. I would watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"When I watched this movie, I thought it was going to be a mindless action romp. I was proved wrong. Despite the graphic violence (I had to close my eyes on some parts), it was definitely an amazing movie. It was so beautifully filmed and acted. The characters seemed slightly odd to our standards. That just gave the feel that this really was more than one thousand years ago and almost a completely different world. Even though the fighting was gory, it was always well choreographed. Russel Crowe did a fabulous job as a brave and honorable fighter (he's awesome!), as did everyone. I definitely suggest this movie, despite the bloodiness (if that's a word). I know I haven't told much about the plot, but there really isn't a very complicated one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"Good story. I admire the way the ending was handled. It could have ruined the entire film for me, but instead it was beautifully portrayed. I was awed by Crowe's character's fighting skills. I especially liked that last fight. I'm a big fan of action and horror flicks but I found the violence in this film to be especially graphic. Some may find that realism to be a plus. Parents might not want their younger kids to see this film. I must say that the costumes and the scenery in this film were a definite plus. They did a very good job of recreating the Colliseum. It all looked so real."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not good","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is bad. The sentences run together, the dialogue is confusing, and the plot line is tired.

I definitely would."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book but unrealalistic characters","review":"The book was good but I felt that the characters were extremely unrealalistic. Nita, a thirteen-year old girl is beaten up by her peers. Thirteen!! Mabye for a eight or nine year old but for thirteen! Girls by thirteen have fights of words, not fists. Second of all, Nita's father wants her to fight back? Nita is thirteen and a girl. Why would a parent be encouraging their children anyways? Nita acts childish and her relationship with her sister is plain stupid. They never fight and are always helpful to eachother. In real life, sisters fight. It's a fact of life. I have one myself. This was a good read but Diane Duane needs to create more realistic characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting novel that will thrill all","review":"This novel is about a young girl who finds herself in posession of a book of magic.

The magic in them is much more complex than it is in the Harry Potter books. It's not just a wave of your wand and some Latin words; it's geometric shapes and strange words in Speech (the wizarding language) written in the sand, wizard's knots and paragraphs to say in Speech. I also like the idea of a manual that teaches Nita and Kit (the main characters) wizardry, instead of a teacher. The characters also seem more real than they do in some other fantasy books (at least the human ones do). This is a great series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a grown-up","review":"this is a great book to read with any young person in your life....It truly opens up the imagination.....My husband and i enjoyed it 9 years ago and now we can share it with our son...

It has an amazing story line that only some authors can come up with. I really enjoyed the magical methods of carrying out their tasks. When I read a fantasy book, I really want it to take me away into another place and reality and this book acomplished that well. I thought that the creativity of the creatures and entropy were so clever, with all of the carnivorous cars and the dragon in the subway. The setting on New York City really put and interesting twist on the plot that left me thinking, maybe in all of those deep dark places, maybe there really are dragons and wizards saving the planet and the universe every day. I read a lot of fantasy books and this book along with all of the other three in the wizardry series are definitely going on my favorites list. I highly suggest reading this book and it's three companions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Diane Duane is one of the best writers out there.

Diane Duane, in my opinion, needs to introduce a few more lasting characters, instead of using the same exact people she began with and only a few new arrivals. You shoudl still read then, though, because they set your mind racing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really different, scary in its own way. Very funny!","review":"I think it is very funny. A lot of the characters said things that were funny. I only read one book that gave me nightmares this one didn't. The more the main characters tried to get out of trouble the more they get in it. One thing leads to another. This is a good book for kids 10 and older."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the 9-12-year-olds, not higher","review":"This book is the first in a series about a girl named Nita and a boy named Kit, and their struggles, experiments, and interesting discoveries towards becoming wizards.I must say, however, that I didn't like it very much. The book is nice in and on itself, but this time the suggested age (9-12) actually fits! Usually I don't pay any attention to that sort of thing, but around 120 pages in the book (after forcing myself to read that far) I simply could not turn another page and still respect myself, even though I had told myself I must finish it. I wasn't even interested in the ending. I see the entire book as quite predictable and possibly a bit too childish, but maybe 9-12-year-olds will like it better.So, in conclusion, if you're above 12, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read. There is absolutely no comparison to Harry Potter. The story is about a girl who finds a book in the library called \\" So You Want to Be a Wizard.\\" She soon meets another young wizard in training and together they battle some dark forces. I thought this book sounded really good, so I bought it, but this book is boring, and not at all interesting.It is not creative and some parts in the plot are quite predictable. I do not reccommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unnatural dialogue, forced plot, clumsy writing. A good idea poorly executed. This can't be compared to Harry Potter even a little! Also annoying characters...and the idea that they would risk so much to get back a pen! Ugh...save your money. I can't believe this series has continued for so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"So You Want to be a Wizard - Diane Duane","review":"Although the book had a good premise, the writing style was distasteful and Diane Duane seemed uneducated in the literary field. Duane's voice came through strongly, which I appreciated, but her voice was too childlike and did not sound authoritative or explanatory at all. Too much of the book was \\"filler\\" - like she was trying to make the book longer than necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!!!!!!!","review":"It was a big disapointment! I thought it would be good, but it was boring and confusing. I consider myself a good reader, but this book took me forever to finish! Please trust me and don't waste your money on this horrible book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an old favorite","review":"I first came across this book in the Portland Public Library in almost the same fashion Nita finds the book that opens the door to her beoming a wizard. I was myself a voracious reader, and the aspect of this book that most affected me was the implication that words themselves have the power to change reality. A thoroughly enjoyable read that I have returned to again and again over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!!!!","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I LOVE READING BOOKS ABOUT NITA AND KIT. I ALSO LIKED THE VIVIDNESS THAT MRS. (MS.?) DUANE USED WHEN WRITING ABOUT THE SPELLS. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTO FICTION,ESPICALLYBOOKS ABOUT ALIENS,WIZARDS,OR WITCHES.ALSO, THE CARACTERS WERE GREAT.I LOVE THE WAY SHE DESCRIBES NITA,KIT,DAIRIANE, AND THEIR PARENTS.THEY COULD ALMOST BE REAL!!!! I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"when i first got this book i thought it sounded really good. but, when i actually got it and started reading it i just couldn't get into it or relate to it. the characters seemed kinda fake and the whole plot was very unbelievable. i just couldn't even imagine it. there's this 'person' that they can't even name because somehow that makes him even more powerful and they are talking to a white hole ... and it's like how does he talk? and you can't really imagine inanimate objects talking or thinking or even living, which in the book they do. i mean isn't that why they're called non-living? the book itself was good but if you're looking for something that you can relate to more or imagine or if you just want to get into the book then you probably shouldn't count to much on this one. (the 4th one was a little better though, still not very believable, but better)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to jump start your imagination.","review":"This book means a lot to me, it was one of the first I can remember reading. This book sent me off on a life long pursiut of fantasy and sci-fi reading material. This book ranks in the top ten of the hundreds of books I have read. Diane has spun a tale that completely spellbound me into a world of magic. Best of all the characters were completely realistic, and were people I could relate to in my own life. In the end I was almost convinced that magic could happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best YA series out there","review":"Nita Callahan, perennial geek on the bad side of the school bully, runs across an unusual book while hiding in the children's section of the town library: So You Want to be a Wizard. She thinks it's a joke until she starts learning real magic (or rather, wizardry) from it. But it's not all fun and games when Nita and fellow wizard Kit accidentally end up in an alternate universe that's not at all friendly to humans.Duane's fantasy (with a sci-fi twist) is a joy to read and only gets better as the series goes on. What other system of magic uses terminology like temporal-spacial claudication instead of magic door? The writing is clean and crisp, the worldbuilding is fantastic, and the characters are wonderful and come in ever-expanding varieties. This series is a yearly-reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"I liked this book. It kept me reading at any spare moment I had. It was a page turner and I couldn't predict what would happen next. I would recomend this book to anyone who love adventure/fantasy books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"So You Want to Be a Wizard is the book that the first of the Harry Potter's books really wanted to be, and almost became. While tapping into the universal desire to be somebody Great and Important, the Duane book does it in a way that is identifiable not just by but with every child who has felt like an outsider. (Which is to say: with every child.)Oh, stop reading these reviews and just order the book. It's that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like torture","review":"I bought this book because it had a whimsical title and I thought it would be an easy read during midterms while I needed a break from studying but didn't want to veg out online or watching TV.I couldn't even finish it...The writing is horrible, it's just badly assembled. The transitions between dialogue and internal monologue are like hitting a speed bump. The characters come off as flat and whinny. The mechanics of the world are boring. It almost seems like this book was written by a committee. We need to buy some time to pad the story what should be put here? Oh just some random stuff...I could go on, but I don't care enough. I'm only rating this book because I got the email asking what I thought of it. I think so little of it without the email I wouldn't have gone out of my way to rate it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for 8 and up, more like 11","review":"As you can tell from all of the glowing reviews, with which I generally agree, this book has a lot going for it. I would add the following.It takes a little while to get up to speed on how time works in this world, even with the helpful exposition provided by two friendly wizards. You really have to understand how alternate universes work in this book in order to follow the plot and appreciate the action. That's fine, and the way it all works is very satisfying. However, I think it would be very challenging and probably frustrating for the 8 or 9 year old that the publisher claims this book is aimed toward. I'm thinking more like 11 years old, and probably after having been introduced to some other sci-fi quest books first."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring compared to other \\"wizard\\" books","review":"My two sons ages 8 and 11 have been reading this book and I was pressed into reading it aloud to my younger son for a couple of hours on the plane. I was disappointed. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense after the initial setup that puts the wizarding instruction book in the hands of the protagonist--a \\"white hole\\" star has a conversation with the kids over a period of days for instance, really just out of nowhere. The kids plunge into doing very sophisticated magic right away and the philosophy of the magic that gets done, if you can call it that, is of the sophmoric \\"everything is alive and has feelings\\" variety, including rusting cars. I couldn't bear to read it aloud after a while. Skimming it might be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type","review":"If you are an avid reader but not into fantasy, don't read thisbook. I'm a reader who doesn't particularly like fantasy, but I'veread many fantasy books which people have said are very good. Most of those I liked, but not this one. So you want to be a Wizard is good in the first couple chapters, but as the magic gets more intense, I found it hard to follow. My friends who are into fantasy and sci-fi loved this book, so if you are like them, go ahead, read this book. But if you are like me, and want to try a fantasy book, don't read this. I recommend Harry Potter and Ender's Game instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I picked up \\"High Wizardry,\\" the third book in this series, about two years ago because I was looking for something to read for the few days before Christmas. That didn't last long - I was finished it barely after Christmas break had started! Anyway, I liked it a lot and decided to start from the beginning.\\"So You Want To Be A Wizard\\" was good, but not great. Since I'm not a seasoned science fiction reader (I go more for high fantasy) I found some of the technical terminology that Duane uses somewhat confusing. The magic that the wizards use in this book is a mixture of scientific equations and traditional magic like that we see in Harry Potter, complete with wand-waving. It's an original and unusual way to look at the ageless myths of magic and wizards, sorcery and battles against evil, and I would recommend it to those who like sci-fi and even some who like fantasy. But, if high fantasy is more what you're looking for, I suggest Tamora Pierce's \\"Song of the Lioness\\" quartet."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A BRILLIANT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better than Harry Potter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value!","review":"Due to a past positive experience with Topeak Customer Service (on a broken bike pump - my fault), I was sold on this company.

It is twisted. It is not for the faint of heart. It is PERFECT for vampire."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Darkest World of 'Darkness' Supplement yet","review":"This book, moreso than any other recently released WoD product places emphasis on just how sick, twisted ,and screwed up the World of Darkness is. Ghouls have always gotten the shaft, but now, the storyteller has the materials at hand to properly motivate that unrepetant bloodjunkie,or some smug Ghoul player who cops a quick fix,'lives forever', and moves along. Addiction, what happens to a ghoul feeding off Malkavians or Nosferatsu, Blood Bonds, Revanents, it's all covered. If you're a newer storyteller and are choosing books to purchase, pick up the two core books and Ghouls.

Adult? I don't think so...","review":"This is a great book, but I wanted to comment that a lot of people read it and were scared by it. Some of it deals with rather adult content, but this is White Wolf we're talking about here: almost EVERYTHING in the World Of Darkness is adult, mature, scary, and...well, dark.I didn't find it frightening at all. Then again, this comes from a guy who read Clanbook: Baali without batting an eyelid.So if I had to \\"warn\\" others about the adult content of this book, I'd honestly say that it's nothing out of the ordinary in the World Of Darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"And...?","review":"You don't need this book to play ghouls or have them in your game. The book is based on 2nd edition, spends a lot of time talking about how little ghouls know about vamps, etc. Save your money and time by creating basic rules of your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyranny and terror","review":"Henry VIII ruled his kingdom, at least towrd the end of his reign, with low political cunning, and a mixture of tyranny and terror. Even those closest to him at court could never be sure about the long-term stability of their positions. His mind was mercurial, and often changed by the last person with whom he spoke, but the final decision, good or bad, was always his. This is an extremely readable work that takes us through the last years of his life, when life around him became extremely bad, not only because of his natural inclination to incite terror, but the very real physical pain he sufered from various problems with his often abused body. This is a cautionary tale of how absolute power corrupts absolutely, and a fine addition to the lengthy volumes on the Tudors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title - Worst book ever on Henry VIII","review":"This book was extremely disappointing, especially for a person well read in Tudor History. The title is very misleading. I thought this book would examine in depth the final years of Henry's reign. Theses final years were full of scandal, intrigue and death but the book read like a summary of his whole reign. There are plenty of other books that do this and do it better (Alison Weir for example). It's pages and pages of he said, she said quotes followed by summaries of crucial events that surely deserve more description. If you are looking for a thorough historical analysis of the final years of Henry, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult for a lay person","review":"I found this book was not very reader-friendly.

It is very hard to find information of the type in Walking with Bears, and it should be seriously digested and openly applauded. I've heard what the game commissions have had to say, and deep down inside I already knew what this book has now confirmed. The black bear should be a cherished national emblem in the wild for all generations to appreciate . After all, it is ursus americanus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says that bears aren't human?","review":"This is an excellent read that I highly recommend to any animal lover or for the individual who has ever had doubts that any animal lacks human feelings and responses.Not only is it a great scientific read about the biology and habits of bears, but also takes the whole experience to a higher level. Terry D. BeBruyn takes you out in the forests of Michigan and lets you experience life through three different generations of bears. It is a touching read where one will experience good and bad days and the whole concept of being adopted into a non-human family. It will make you laugh and cry as you experience life through a bear's eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth about bears","review":"This book is a great view into the way black bears really live and view humans. It does a lot to dispel the violent myths propagated by authors like Herrero. Terry has lived with these magnificent and gentle animals, not just reported on a bunch of distorted statistics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break. This teaches almost nothing about Freemasonry.","review":"Albert Pike was a brilliant scholar. Morals and Dogma is brilliant scholarship which is so esoteric that it's nearly useless. (Exception: Explaining the Scottish Rite doctrine rejecting temporal and religious tyranny in the 30th degree, Knight Kadosh.) Pike writes with unexplained Latin and Greek passages, and strange references to Egyptian mythology. (He later explained that he used Egyptian examples because he figured that wouldn't offend any of the modern religions.)If you're looking to learn about Freemasonry, this ain't the book for you. In fact, no book will tell you very much about Freemasonry. I could write about skydiving, describe the rush of the air into the plane, the hesitation stepping out, the freedom of free-fall, and so forth, but unless I've done it, I have no way to REALLY understand it. If you want to understand it, you really have to go through the experience.

But it's fun for everyone. It has the straightforward spookiness of a children's story. But it also has the highly imaginative touch of Diane Duane as an author.You don't have to start with the first book in the series, but I think it's better if you do.

This one was fabulous to begin with, but with a plot twist that was so unexpected, it became an exceptional story. As many books as I have read I am always startled when an author can pull one over on me. Teresa Mediros certainly did. I thought with the book winding down that the plot was going to go in it typical direction, but it didn't! This was a great read, a beautiful story of courage and dealing with the unknown and finding one's self. I highly recommend.P.S. I know that everyone wants a happy ending..that's why we read the books, but just once I would like to read a story about the wounded hero that DOESN'T get better.

She made the story seemed so alive, that I didn't want it to end, even though I read the book for the 2nd time. They way she writes always makes me laugh then cry, then cry and laugh again.

Spoiler alert - how could Samantha be Cecily? There were no clues and it was like I was looking at two different people. It did not make sense. Samantha never acted like she knew Gabriel. It was all business. I am just really upset because the book was so good and had to be ruined by the plot twist. I felt she only cared about herself.

Once she suceeds and gets him mentally and physically healthy she disappears and reappears as his long lost fiance. Gabriel realizes that the two women he loves are the same woman. Cecily explains to Gabriel why she told so many lies and they admit how much they love each other. Its really lovely. I don't like the lies but, she was afraid to admit the truth to him. It makes sense in a weird sort of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I fell in love with the earl. This story reminded me of all the reasons why I read romance.

I will definately buy more of Teresa Medeiros books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like the girl's cowardice & cruelty","review":"I have two problems with this book. First it is a typical formulaic romance novel. It has all the predictable plot, action and characters. There is a nice surprise twist to the end, but there is nothing special, creative or delighting throughout the book. I almost feel like it was written by a computer with all the proper ingredients. My second problem is with the girl. Although the author described the girl as a coward, I found the girl's actions to be cruel. I couldn't get past the hurts she caused Gabriel. When she first saw him in the hospital, she ran away. After they found love together, she ran away again. He suffered and searched for her for months. Finally he gave up the search and decided to rejoin the Navy. She let him suffer far too long before she was willing to tell him the truth. This cruelty overshadowed the rest of the story for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I've had a sick child and been dealing with depressing things for days and then I picked up this book and read it in one setting. this is the kind of book that you buy romances for.

The protagonist wishes never to see or hear about his country again, and instead of being unloaded in, say, France or even Africa - which would get him out of America's hair and comply with his wishes - he is tortured by being carried around on ships for the rest of his life. What the...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book could be a lot better.","review":"This book did not interest me one bit. I thought this book did not have a plot. The book's setting was back in the 1800's and i do not like those types of books. Thos book is a book your history teacher would hand out to read. In this book the action wasn't the greatest. I like books that the action is hair pulling, and stomach turning. I would reccomend this book to a person who likes books set in the old times, and or to a person who does not like to read because there are only 116 pages in the story but the words are double spaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Student - 14 yrs old","review":"This book was very boring until the end.

I read another of Lance's books entitled \\"A Byte of Charity\\" and was hooked from the first chapter. However, \\"Reel Pressure\\" starts off really slow, picks up in the middle, and has an ending that seems to drag on forever leaving me with no feelings of satisfaction once I was finished.

The length of pull on the standard SKS stock was just a bit too short for me to be comfortable and with Tech-Sights installed I kept bumping my nose against the sight when firing. Nothing to cause injury, but an annoyance just the same. This butt pad solved both problems. My sight picture falls right into place as soon as I shoulder the weapon.

Raisins and Almonds is a lullaby! Do they know something about the bride that we don't?! My Yiddishe Momme is a sad song. Not the best for a wedding. Dona Dona is a song of suffering and freedom, a song that dates back at least to the '40s and has taken folk-song status--again, not really for a wedding.

I bought the book at a discount in a small town in the U.S. where I live. I was ecstatic that I could get the book so cheap, for I remember reading Prasannarajan's review in India Today, and I usually like what he says. And if I remember right, Prasannarajan speaks well of this meandering trickle of a terrible tale. I wish I had the patience to sit down and do a serious deconstruction of this \\"plotless plot\\" and \\"clueless narration\\" from a pretend writer who relies on a condensed version of the Gita, the first chapter of Radhakrishnan's tome on the Upanishads and whatever else he could lay his hands on to \\"learn\\" and \\"speak\\" about India. Dilettantism therefore is in powerful and peerless display."},{"rating":"1","title":"culturally interesting","review":"I found this novel fairly non-compelling. It was hard to even get through the first quarter, and I was two thirds through before it became very interesting.

There are too many other books out there to bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I was glad to read a novel set in south India since there are not too many novels out there. My favorite part was reading about the patriarch - Solomon's story at the beginning of the book. I could picture my great-grandfather on his land in Kerala. I really enjoyed the story until the last 100 pages or so. It became wordy a tad boring in those last few chapters. All in all I enjoyed the book and thought the author did a great job of telling the story of a family spanning 3 generations. It would have been great to see a photo of a blue mango somewhere! Good - but not a Great debut novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention Writers","review":"There is such a need for historical fiction on Asia, and this book doesn't entertain the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barf! Barf!! Not tasty...","review":"Some are comparing this to God of Small things...Are you kidding me?The novel is cutout with artificial characters masquerading as historical ones. Some of the characters teach us georgraphy and history lesson on India and sound like a mouthpiece for the author to air his opinion about the Colonial British (White man?), India, caste system, Christianity, Hindu mythology etc..I understand this is work of fiction but the novel is so full of contrived characters and settings detailed in superficial tone. If you liked novels of Vikram seth and Arunadhathi roy...stay away from this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"In the past two decades there have been some wonderful novels written by Indian authors, but none of them were based/set against the background of Tamil Nadu's history. Vikram Seth's tome, \\"A Suitable Boy,\\" was set against the backdrop of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, while Arundati Roy's \\"God of Small Things,\\" was set in Kerala.Publisher turned writer David Davidar's book \\"The House of Blue Mangoes,\\" nicely fills that lacuna. Davidar deftly weaves South history and culture into the narrative that is set in the fictional town of Chevathar located in the southern most tip of India.The novel chronicles the tragedies and triumphs of the powerful Dorai family: Solomon, Daniel, Aaron and Kannan. The panoramic story begins in the close of the 19th century and ends in 1947 when Indian became independent.Davidar's skill as a storyteller is evident and the novel makes for an absorbing read. Also his interest and keen eye for research is reflected in this historical novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"wannabe","review":"Mr Davidar thought he was writing the great Indian novel. Unfortunately, what came out at the end was a schoolboy effort, characterized by Raj cliches, prose that sounds like it is translated, and occasional paragraphs containing personal views on India and Indians which dont mesh with the main text at all. I am glad I borrowed this free of cost from the library and did not waste my money - though I did waste my time reading it. All I can say is that it would make good reading on a long flight - at least the story has tempo and keeps you mildly entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"It feeds the Western stereotypes of India","review":"This is another novel in the genre of the Macaulayite Indian trying his/her best to describe India to the West. The problem is that the synthesis is wanting because the author's understanding is based on stereotypes that muddle where a straighter look would have shown reality for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"I thought this was a very enjoyable book - very absorbing and well-written - not exceedingly wordy in descriptions or narratives that cause you to lose the thread of the story. He keeps a wonderful pace while still managing to create depth with his characters. The writing style is simple yet powerful, managing to evoke vivid images of the places and times described, and not pretentious at all. Took me a little bit to get into it but by the first 20 pages or so I was hooked. It absorbed me completely and pulled me into its world and when it was over I surfaced and felt a little disoriented!! :-) Wonderful bits of history woven into the story of the book seamlessly. A wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche characters and the kitchen sink","review":"David Davidar has apparently never heard of the saying \\"less is more.\\" His book has every cliche that you can connect with India -- the caste system, extended families, wretched poverty, etc, etc. Of course, all these exist, but they should be included in a book only if they further the story. Perhaps that is just the problem. Davidar has a hard time getting a believable story together.Stick to publishing, Davy baby! Leave writing to those who have the talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Buffy!","review":"This has often been compared to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I know the first instinct is to say animated \\"gore\\" is stupid, but it's pulled of well as in 12 Kingdoms. The first volume episode does have one completely unnecessary scene where Yokho is naked and being seduced by a demon. Not sure why it's even in there! The rest of the series is normal and enjoyable. So, unless you happen to be a perverted young teenage boy or a desperate man, fast forward!!Yohko is even a magical girl, she's just...rougher, so girls should like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!!","review":"By far one of the worst animes ever!

The stories are not high drama but fun. The last episode seemed to be setup for a TV series since the animation takes on more early 90's digital effect. The last episode animation reminds me of theBubblegum Crisis TV series.Take it for what it is: an 80's sex comedy similar to a Ranma 1/2 with a more serious tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move Over Buffy... Yohko's In Town","review":"This was one of the first Anime VHS tapes I ever bought back in the early 90's and I was delighted to see it transferred to DVD and preserved for the next generation of Anime fans. The art and animation still hold up today and is done by hand and not by computers like so much garbage anime today. The story is fun as we follow the foot steps of our uncertain heroine on her way to becoming the baddest demon slayer in all of Japan. Good music accents a fun Buffy the Vampire Slayerish storyline with good voice acting on the Japanese part (English no reviewed). Well worth a watch and a keeper for any fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little too absent minded","review":"ok anime but was a little too absent minded with a Buffy the vampire style plot. the anime was also full of some mindless nudity that made this show a little more immature for adults.

The first review for the paperback edition says that there are a lot of commentaries and clarifications; the second review for the kindle edition is more a lesson on Aristotle than a review of this book, but gives 5 stars. But notice that the kindle edition has ONLY the translation: no notes, no comments. In the description of the book there is no mention that the kindle version differs from the paper version, while this should be explicitely stated. Moreover, there are no active links in the table of contents. I give 2 stars (instead of one) only because I respect the work of the two translators, but Amazon should separate the evalutions of printed books and of kindle books, otherwise the average star rating has no meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARISTOTLE","review":"GREAT REFERENCE WORK.

She has been happier with herself and is interacting with other teens and adults much better; she has \\"come out of her shell\\".

However some of the \\"catalogue\\" of mixes was ridiculous. Example: comments on \\"chow-sharpei\\" mix and \\"chow\\" mixes was obviously due to the fact that the author does not like either breed. I have a chow/samoyed mix who is absolutely wonderful - got the best of both breeds. It would have been more fair to catalogue as well the good points of the breed and perhaps explain more as to why certain breeds can have negative points (poor breeding, socialization & training for example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books about dogs","review":"I've read this book cover to cover more than once, and laughed out loud each time. The authors' love of dogs shines through every page, and the humor is razor sharp and based on experience.

Some of the stories and testimonies left me in tears. However, as others have noted, some of the material in this book is not to be taken 100% seriously. Looking beyond that, they do make a great case for the mixed-breed dog -- a case that needs to be made at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was looking for photographs of mixed breeds...","review":"A somewhat interesting book if you do not know anything about mixed breed dogs. I do, and was looking for a book which had more photographs of mixed breed dogs, identified by their \\"parentage.\\" I also know about animal cruelty, and was shocked to find on page 102, in the sidebar, a story about a Confederate soldier who was due to be executed and whose last request to Union soldiers -- that he be allowed to say goodbye to his dog -- was not only denied, but as the Confederate soldier was led away, his dog was beaten to death by the Union soldiers \\"with their rifle butts.\\" I did not expect to find this sort of material in such a book, and wish I had never read it. The story is supposed to illustrate how the soldier was saved by \\"seeing\\" the dog's ghost, but it left me wishing I hadn't known about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Brownie's best ballad work","review":"Clifford Brown was one of the great ballad masters on his instrument. There is ample evidence of this across his recorded work. This collection is not a good sampling of it. Of the 14 tracks, five are from the \\"Clifford Brown With Strings\\" session that was marred with Neal Hefti's schmaltzy, dated arrangements and not much improvisation by Brownie. Another six are showcases for singers Helen Merrill, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. One, the wonderful minor blues \\"Lands End\\" is not a ballad. That leaves just two, \\"Ghost of a Chance\\" (nice) and \\"Time\\" (questionable). Unless you want the female vocals and Neal Hefti, this set is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent collection of ballads","review":"Those wishing for a quick sampler of Brownie's ballad play from across his career will enjoy this collection.

It's nice to see Amazon offering the audio version as my VHS tape has long since worn out.)Phil and Don enjoyed a strong British following throughout their careers making the Royal Albert Hall a natural place for them to reunite. Their voices and harmonies were still in good form and the crowd was appreciative. Traditional Everly Brothers fans will enjoy this double CD.

It gives the opinions of those that actually lived through it, opinions from before, during, and after the war. These opinions are conflicting of course.

She's not exactly \\"mainstream,\\" so why else would you be here reading this? Approach this and other Monk albums with an open mind; Meredith Monk is the musical equivalent of abstract expressionism, so if you're expecting something that resembles any preconceived notions of what music traditionally is, forget it!

The acting is poor; the plot seems to have a mind of its own (like a 2-year-old's); the fighting scenes are some of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. They're so unrealistic, it's more like watching a cartoon. Dennis Rodman does seem to try, sometimes. Most of the time, he's just trying, unsucessfully, to be cool.

It sounds more rock and roll than the 1999 live cd. comparing to the latter, the following songs sound much better here : Hanging on the telephone, Rapture,X Offender, Dreaming,etc. However I have two things to complain about, what happened to atomic and maria?? If people actually requested the songs played in this concert, i am surprised that maria and atomic were not requested!and the Heart of glass version on this cd is very week comparing to the 1999 live cd.Other than that, this cd proves why Blondie is making it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU PEOPLE ALL DEAF OR ON DRUGS?????","review":"The only song that sounds decent on here is Heart of Glass but the guys should sing on it like on the album. Call Me is a mess. Clem Burke is still an awesome drummer- one of the best- but even he can't always save this ensemble. I have seen them twice live and both times I was disappointed. They should make more of an effort to sound like the albums. I was a kid in the 70's and 80's and never saw them back then... but Deborah Harry's voice just isn't strong anymore. I like the fact that they got back together but if I'm being honest they just aren't that great anymore.

Negative stars for lack of legacy ports (I still have to buy a USB-to-Midi converter for lack of a gameport). Negative for the non-standard drive slot (which is too overpriced to consider) - so I still have to buy an external USB backup drive. Negative for the lack of its own power adaptor - have to buy an extra or else unplug junk when I need to travel with the laptop.

Well, evidently, the XB 2000 is not compatible with the voice recognition software. As soon as he installed the base, his VRS crashed, and we haven't been able to recover it. HP phone support quite simply BITES! All the tech could tell me to do in his English-as-a-second-language accent was to run system restore, then blame the software.

The Real Thing comes very close the truth. By unplugging their instruments, Midnight Oil gives us an insight on how their thought process works before they become plugged in at high volume. Midnight Oil has not released much stateside and this release gives us a glimpse that they still have another Diesel and Dust or Redneck Wonderland record in them.

The problems of inequality stem from the lines of governmental forms and corruption, as opposed to increasingly spendy upbeat tourists (which the book focused on). The internationalist movement described had little real power, because the people involved were persecuted by their respective regimes.In short, an older idealism even back in it's day.

It can not be that easy to foul up an essentially good story so badly. There is no narrative drive.Third, this must be Jude Law's worst film ever. He is not an obvious miscast, one can initially believe his character, the young man from an elite background and his mutual attraction with the vulgar politician.

The screenplay captures none of it and rather leaves it to the film's composer to elicit an emotional response with overused scoring.I got about 30 minutes into this movie before I finally had to stop it.

The story, of course, parallels the political life of Louisiana's \\"Kingfish\\", Huey Long. Just in case we couldn't figure that out, Longalike populist Willie Stark sings Long's theme song \\"Every Man a King\\", and the final scene plays out on the bronze map of Louisiana that's set in the floor of the State Capitol. Louisiana history notwithstanding, the movie is a dreadful bore, almost all shot in half-light, and mused rather than spoken by the actors other than Sean Penn, who senses the great overacting possibilities inherent in playing Stark.

Although most often being criticized as not having as much of a literary talent as her sisters, I think that if readers read this book with their heart, they will be able to appreciate the beauty of this novel.I myself find this book a very delightful read, though I can't deny that it's sad at the same time to know that how governess at that time was being so ill-treated by the family.

This is the second book I've read of the Bronte sisters, \\"Jane Eyre\\" being the first one (which was amazing and my favorite of all the classics). But this one I will remember fondly, and I am thankful it wasn't any longer, because I may have lost patience with it. The ending is what saved it from a three star vote, when Agnes was able to see some of the comeuppance with her silly students, and become the wife of the man she fancied.

And as a love story, it has also been compared with the novels of Jane Austen. It even reminded me a little of the cautionary morality tales that had been popular up to that time, such as Defoe's Moll Flanders.Personally, I enjoyed it more than Pride and Prejudice, but not as much as Jane Eyre. It just doesn't have the same scope and depth. Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, on the other hand, does, so I would recommend that over this. That said, this is a nice little novel, and interesting, and sometimes very funny. Well worth reading.And this audio edition narrated by Emilia Fox, who does an excellent job, is very enjoyable to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and easy read","review":"After reading this, I am now quite surprised that Anne Bronte is the least known of the three Bronte sisters. In my opinion, this short novel is as much a literary superlative as Jane Eyre and very superior to the depressing Wuthering Heights. The fact that Anne wrote this book based on her own experiences made it very believable and made the character of Agnes appear very down to earth. Overall, I would recommend this book because it is not as fluffy as the works of Jane Austen, but not as heavy as Wuthering Heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet read","review":"Agnes Grey holds the same quality and charm of many a dusty classic. It's a pleasant read, and not too long to bog down the reader.

The plot is simple, as are the characters.Any fan of the Bronte family will find this book just what can be imagined coming from sweet Anne. It may be a fascination and love of the story of their family that makes me recommend this book. Or perhaps it's the innocent sweetness of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agnes Grey is magnificent","review":"The feeling with which this book is written is absolutely superb. Knowing that in real life Anne's lover died, it's even more painful to read what Agnes says about her marriage, how happy she is.

The young Misses Murray are self centered and thoughtless, particularly the elder (who gets what she deserves in the end).I have been reading a book called the Selected Works of the Bronte sisters, and it's been interesting to compare the sisters' writing styles.

The plot centers around the death and imminent funeral of the village matriarch, seen through the eyes, experience, and relationships of shopkeeper Lucy. Chapters are fairly brief and somewhat interconnected but stand-alone as studies of the way women (often, though occasionally the men are featured) deal with the daily struggles of relationships, making a living, and hopefulness in an unforgiving environment. In some ways it's a 'feel good' book, in that some of the lives/relationships turn toward hope realized. Yet these are stories which unflinchingly, yet with masterful nuance, describe the fallibilities of flawed people.

The author goes back and forth across such varied geographic areas and uses such far-flung place names so quickly that it is impossible for anyone without a PhD in Central Asian history or geography to keep up. Go ahead, I dare you to try. Now, I am not uneducated. I've read some great epic histories by Robert Massie and Steven Runciman that were hundreds of pages long and kept my interest to the very end. \\"Empire of the Steppes\\" barely held my interest at all.There are a few reviews here that say this book is the best on it's subject; surely there has to be one written in the last 60 years that is better...there has to be!!

Central Asia is an increasingly important part of the world but is generally totally opaque to the West. History has indeed flowed through these lands but the West's attention has usually been tied to navigable waters. The historians are of the West and write about the West.

He also mentions the American and European interference in the Middle Eastern oil producing countries after WWII. True. The problem is he talks about it almost as little as I just did. He thinly mentions it in passing to impress the reader with his knowledge. The rest of the book reads like a fictional bashing of America with no basses in reality.

However, the Amazon page for this fan currently lists no brand or specs, so you won't know which fan you will get. I received a 24 cfm Sunon fan with 34 dbA, which is quite loud for a small fan, and is the loudest fan that Alpha and Omega carry for this approximate cfm.

This one, with parrots, monkeys and a tiger, is my favorite, so far. Another plus with Andrews is that you do not get the same plot over and over. The settings and situations change.

It has something to say about disease, about world war two, and even about what it means to be human.The different characters of the novel are fascinating, and their situations stick with the reader long after you conclude reading. Perhaps the most shocking scene, the death of a child in the middle of the novel leaves a big impression.

An allegory is something that can be read on various levels. As such, it can have more than one meaning: a surface meaning and a deeper meaning.The surface meaning is about a plague, but remember where and when Camus lived. Perhaps Camus is trying to say something about living in Nazi occupied France. Maybe the plague acts as a symbol for the Nazis. See if reading the book this way changes your opinion or deepens your appreciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up Call","review":"In this adroitly crafted morality tale, Camus draws the reader to the following conclusion: it may only be by suffering deeply that Man is capable of truly fathoming the gift of life.Painting a wrenching descent into doom, Camus demonstrates through some very clever case studies how Man too often is willing to choose the path of least resistance in daily living. While \\"the only true ideas are those of the shipwrecked,\\" it often takes Mankind too much time to unite for the common good, the author suggests, making obvious parallels to the Nazi experience that befell Europe only a few years prior to publication of this novel.Camus weaves his magic subtly, methodically thrusting the reader into a vortex of dark passion, on the premise that discomfort at best, or pure adversity at worst, may be a necessary tonic against complacency. In this way, Camus suggests, The Human Race may finally inch toward living up to expectations - God's, or its Own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Existentialism","review":"\\"The Plague\\" is the archetypal piece of existentialism. Camus touches upon the human condition which in turn makes us ponder our own existence. Although the book is a trifle long, we as readers must be aware that a key characteristic of existentialism is attention to the mundane, this provides us with long descriptions of seemingly ungermane concepts. However, this book is a must for anyone who is interested in questioning man's existence, the belief in god, and the absurd. This book was translated from French, so at times, the book's sentence structure may seem akward. But the real importance lies in the extended metaphors that do not unfold immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"How people confront extreme circumstances","review":"It isn't trivial that Albert Camus studied philosophy. In this book, the Nobel Laureate uses a \\"plague\\" to explore how different people react to the hardships and incomprehensible nature of what is thrust upon them. It takes place in the town of Oran, where one day the rats start dying off, and the people quickly follow. The town is sealed off, and the characters have to deal with the isolation and and the bleakness of their circumstance, among other things. This is an excellent book about humanity, but if you are looking for a horror story or something filled with obvious bestseller suspense, look elsewhere. Camus keeps the reader interested throughout, but the interest is in the character of the people he populates the town with, not necessarily with the disease itself. I'd highly recommend it, but just know what you're getting into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let love in","review":"In the city of Oran, something very bad is happening. Albert Camus' The Plague is a masterwork of 20th century literature as it examines the devestating effects of a deadly and bloody plague that breaks out all over the city. In the wake of a quarantine, Dr. Rieux and a handful of survivors band together to do what they can. In the long run, the only thing that any of them can really do to overcome the odds, is live. Though there are times when it is drawn out, The Plague manages to deliver an incredibly compelling story that examines human nature in the wake of incredible adversity, and it has never been done better since. The shocking imagery and perspectives presented here only further show Camus' mastery, and the equally shocking poignancy will surprise you even more so. Definitely not for everyone, The Plague is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will stay with you for a long time.","review":"A grim tale and yet when I put it down, I felt elated, alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"A tremendous work that reads like a \\"relaxed\\" thriller.

It is far better than even The Stranger, also by Camus, or even Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter. It is the story of a cluster of characters, each in his own way quite well developed. Of course, the physician stands out as the main protagonist. They reside in a city that is quarantined to prevent the spread of a plague that, while tragic in its own right, brings the characters to new self-understanding and leads each to new behavioral highs or lows. It is great reading, it is not too long so it can be read in a day or so, and it is sure to offer the reader many opportunities for self-examination (which, I found, takes longer than reading the book). I give this an A+ and it is among the works that I most highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detached and clinical","review":"This book has no emotion, depth or human insight.

I have taught classes using several other texts, and, although they had their flaws, the Forbes' text has flaws that are almost unsurmountable for the typical lower-division college student. The explanations, though creative,are not clear enough, and the flow of topics is out of sorts. For example, the exercises which accompany the sections start out too difficult to be any aid in helping the introductory student grasp the techniques. In short, for upper-division courses or for people who already have a logic background, this is an interesting book and might be worth a look, but it fails miserably as an introductory text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tricia Martin Look-alike.","review":"Steven sees a girl who looks, acts,and behaves like Tricia Martin.His true love he lost due to lukemia.

As far as goals are concerned, the defense is much harder this year and while on the easiest level you can blast the ball by keepers from 20 yards out, its much harder on the top skill levels. I think its very realistic because in the actual game of football, i think you see more goals as a result of headers, fastbreaks, and defensive break downs that let a player get behind the opposition and up close to the goal within the 8 yard box more than you will see 20-25 yard screamers. This game shows that as the goalies are not soo easily fooled at long range when you get into the two higher skill levels.If you want a challenge with managing contracts and funds while competing for signings and cups, then pick this game up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worsed than FIFA 05!!!!","review":"While FIFA 05 had some redeeming qualities, they weren't many. FIFA 06 suffers from the same malaise. A perfect example of this would be that a small player like juninho can beat a tall player like Ibrahimovic to a header. Another problem, the entire Chinese national team all play Zidane. It can be maddening!!! These are of course examples of playing against the computer (which is still the best you can do in Manager Mode, bring back FIFA 04's Manager Mode). Also, while in Manager Mode it is nearly impossible to lat half a season with any team, even if you were undefeated up until then!!!!! I've tried to finish a season with one team, but it's impossible!!!! The graphics are worse than FIFA 05 too. Generally I miss the fun of FIFA 04.

You can keep marking/pulling at the opponent player, but he wont give up the ball. Yet when one of my player runs into the opponent defender, he gives up the ball easy. Thats my biggest gripe.Another problem is that this game is very slow on the PlayStation 2. Play can slow down if there are a whole bunch of players on the screen at the same time. It seems PS2 is showing its age with these newer games.Please dont buy this game, as you will only be frustrated with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Fun Factor?","review":"I gave up my FIFA 03 in favour of this one and boy do I regret it. It's slow, the computer chooses your defenders, your passing options, why your headers are on target in easy mode but the same tactic never comes close in the more difficult modes. I bought this to have fun but when you've out-shot, out passed, out-possessed and out-tackled the opposition till kingdom come and still lose 1-0 because you're last man wouldn't tackle despite how many times you hit the button to switch defenders then it's time to swallow your pride and go dig up your FIFA 03 again. A good challenge in easy mode for the first little while but after that just bloody frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bundle of irritation","review":"This, more even than its predecessors, is a lazy game that swaps challenge for mere irritation. Players will run off in all directions without reason, and stop, pause, and turn the wrong way to miss key passes or interceptions; will take ten yards (no joke) to stop from a run; will simply ignore a clear pass to an open player, and substitute a silly pass to a distant player on the opposite side of the pitch; and a through-ball, if too good, will magically speed up halfway through (no joke), in order to get to the keeper before an onrushing forward. In other words, EA couldn't be bothered to develop a clever game - instead, in order to make it competitive, they made it arbitrary, disingenuous, and utterly stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this game is horrible!

I have owned all of the Fifa titles since 2003. The offense is very difficult to control, the players movements are slow and it seems that it takes several seconds for the players to react to your keys when you press a button and by then it is too late (passing, stopping, etc). Also, unlike the other past Fifa titles, I spent at least 80 to 90% of my time playing defense and it's almost impossible to get the ball down to the oppenents goal to score because they always seem to strip the ball away from you. I also own the Winning Eleven 9 soccer series. Although it's more expensive that Fifa 2006, I would highly recommend it over this year's Fifa game.

Amazingly, slaves of very diverse background thrown together under the most adverse conditions managed to somehow reconstruct a great deal of their African culture and transmit it to American-born generations. This courageous cultural achievement has been a major factor in sustaining African-Americans through centuries of tribulations. The author wrote this in 1941 to celebrate the survival of Africanness in African-American culture. It was a pioneering work by someone who was not himself an African-American and subsequent scholars, particularly those from the African-American community, have gone far beyond it. But as you can see from the unfair way that some people disparage such legitimate outgrouths of African traditions such as rap and Ebonics, there is still much that can be learned from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"For years my sister-in-law reused her plastic bags and I thought she was nuts.

While this certainly helped, A Clockwork Orange is a very good film in it's own right. It contains several scenes of graphic violence and nudity, by the media was wrong to claim that it glorifies violence, which it does not. In fact the majority of violence is over within the first 20 minutes or so. Despite it's long length and the fact hat it occassionanly drags a bit, Kubrick's brilliant eccentricity gives this film a fascinating edge, and the storyline is effective in showing the film's powerful moral.8 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Definately one of the best of all-time pictures.

The social commentary in this movie about violence and the establishment approach to a \\"cure\\" is disturbing and thought provoking.

I don't know what it was but this film cought my attention very quikly and I could hardly ever keep my eyes off of it. It wasn't really the films brutality that cought my attention, at first it was the the images were, there were so many metaphores in it.

I was hoping for something to take away from this movie so I could share in its glory with everyone else who I've ever heard talk about it.I have no desire to see it again. I don't recommend it. If anything, watch it just so you can say you've seen it. It seems to come up in \\"movie conversation\\" every couple years or so.

Yes, Kubrick was rarely a user of widescreen film but in Clockwork Orange the ratio is probably 1.66:1. This is a horrendous attack on good taste and a blantant exploitation of the recently deceased Stanley Kubrick. To WB: Keep an artist's work in tact especially if you intend to exploit him selling it at 45 dollars and placing it in a cool new case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Goodbye","review":"This atrocious film began the 30 year decline that sadly closed out the career of Stanley Kubrick. Artistically burned out after completing \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and \\"2001\\", Kubrick wanted to film a biography of Napoleon, but was balked by a lack of financing. Not a man who let go of an obsession easily, he marked time over the next three decades by turning out five movies totally devoid of the committment he had shown in his early work.The author of the original novel, Anthony Burgess, was so sickened by Kubrick's mangled film that he eventually repudiated the book entirely, as well he might. The suggestion that psychopaths should be allowed to exercise their free will to wreak havoc on society is so transparently idiotic nobody can take it seriously. Combined with the terrible acting, cheap sets, and relentless vulgarity and misogyny, the result is about as ugly as moviemaking gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"excessive violence","review":"Too much violence associated hard to stare at the screen or follow the storyline....if one can tolerate, you would enjoy this satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows the power of a director's name","review":"One of the very worst movies ever made with no redeeming value, horrible acting, worthless in every way.

I feel that it was scuppered from the outset by the casting: the actors playing the droogs are plainly much too old to be playing teenagers. What's most bothersome however is the way Kubrick soft-pedalled the more unpleasant aspects of the book. Without exception, all Alex's victims are more 'obnoxious' than they are in the novel, as if Kubrick was attempting to 'justify' their treatment at his hands. This attitude is completely inexcusable. It is no wonder that Burgess was very unhappy with the film and chose to distance himself from it: a book about the importance of free-will had been altered beyond recognition into nothing more than a vindication of its main character.Reading the previous reviews, I am troubled by how this film is almost universally regarded as the epitome of \\"cool.\\".END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Crap and that is Generous","review":"I am sure this movie will appeal to spoiled brats who resent their parents and the establishment in this twisted immorality play.

And OH MY GOSH it was bad.Not bad it a fun, provocative, campy, entertaining way. But bad in a way that makes you question your need for a VCR in the first place. The story was non-existent, the editing was frantic and distracting, the violence was pointless (which some will say WAS the point) and it made no sense.The story of alienation, ennui, post-war angst has been told in so many better movies since CO came out that I guess I might be missing the \\"ground breaking\\" aspects of this film, but I have to say that this movie has not held up well over the year.If you have two hours to waste just saw your arm off with a rusty butter knife.

For the reviewer who claimed that scenes are dark and satirical, I don't agree. The book explores how violence and rape is used to create power over others. Kubrick does not get that across in his movie, so the movie does come across as gratuitous. This film should be given a miss in favor of the book. That is often true, but I think it is so in this case in particular. Also, if you happen to speak Russian, check out the nadsat language used in the book.

After 2001 Kubrick shot all of his films with a standard 3:4 television ratio, and they are often cut to make them widescreen in a theatre. What you are seeing is actually the full screen version. So please ignore the comment on here complaining that it is letterbox. I believe Clockwork is in a slightly wider format that 3:4, although it is possible that it also (like full metal jacket, the shining, eyes wide shut, etc) was supposed to be 3:4 and has been here restored. After you get used to it, I think in most cases it is preferable. It is frustrating for those of us that have widescreen tv's, though.

But how can one ignore the cinematic qualities of this masterful film. A Clockwork Orange achieves what no other film has ever done and that's to get as close as possible to telling a story in a motion picture entirely in the subjective first person point of view. Now whether it achieved it or not, is not the point here. What is the point is that Kubrick succeeded in gracing us with a cinematic point of view so intimate and subjective to the main character, that all else really doesn't matter. Through a cinematic view point, A Clockwork Orange is simply a Masterpiece.

Malcolm McDowell's performance is over the top, no doubt about it.Alexander 'Alex' DeLarge is a vicious teenager in a violent future. At nights, he takes part in many repulsive events including rape and murder. However, after turning on his friends many time, they claim revenge and leave him to the police.

Perhaps it's because of McDowell's acting, which is good. When I saw the film in 1971 it made a big impact: 32 years later it says nothing at all. I'm not shocked by violence or nudity; it's just that it's a very poor work of art, empty of everything except design, ugly, repellent design. I'm beginning to think Kubrick must be the most overrated director of all time. As another reviewer has pointed out, his films seemed to get steadily worse and worse. And all of them have one thing in common: they are s-l-o-w. It seems to me that Kubrick was obsessive and dedicated, but just not very bright. He was also, apparently, intensely depressed about life. Still, it was clever of him to make such a big thing of these disadvantages. I suppose his films are worth seeing, once only.

What garbage can did they pull their master out of?Go buy the \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" Blu-ray instead, which was obviously put together by people who were technically very talented. Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"Novelist Anthony Burgess is obviously a wordsmith of the highest order, and director Stanley Kubrick was able to share that in the dialogue and especially the narrative. The film is itself is one of the most clever and perceptive I've seen, with a sardonic wit, and a sense of irony so sharp it almost hurts. Shockingly violent visuals. Psychedelica gone amok which you must love. This 1971 vision of the world in and my 2005 vision of the world are identical. If you've never seen it, go get it right now.It's very hard to believe this film is 34 years old. It's too damn modern. I'd really hate to be Kubrick 30 years after this film, probably knowing he'll never top it.Malcolm McDowell. I suppose that, for many folks, he'll go down in cinematic history as the guy who killed Captain Kirk. I'd like to humbly suggest that McDowell watch this film so he can remember that, once upon a time, he was a damn fine actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the book, but still a very good movie by Stanley Kubrick.","review":"The film is not as good as the fantastic novel. Mainly because they went a little overboard on the violence and sexuality. I give the film four and a half stars. I could say that this is close to being a classic. I liked they guy who played Alex's father better on The Shining. But still, Malcolm McDowell was born to play Alex he was perhaps the best actor in the film. Recommended to Kubrick fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece.......","review":"This is a love it or hate it movie. I choose the first, I love this film. It was a great book, and Kubrick made it into a great film. Malcom Mcdowell is brillant as Alex, a young criminal who indulges in a new form of rehabilitation. This film changed the entire media business and set new standards in both music and film. Classic Kubrick and Classic Mcdowell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viddy Well, Little Brother. Viddy well.","review":"\\"Clockwork Orange\\" is definitely a striking film. It unforgettably mixes elements of horror, science fiction and comedy, and still comes off as having a lot of chutzpah. The problem I run into with \\"Orange\\" is that we never get a definitive statement about the brain-washing portrayed in the film. The \\"protagonist\\" is, after all, a violent convict, and he subjects himself to the strange treatment he receives. Still, this movie is definitely one of the most important ever, as much for its artistic innovation as for the unflinching violence it portrays."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clockwork Orange","review":"One of the things I liked about Kubrick is the fashion in which he questions the way that society works. In Clockwork, he focuses on Alex, a young man with an obsession for Beethoven who gets thrown in the slammer for murder. Instead of spending his life behind bars, he volunteers himself for an experimental cure. But, as a resulf of this cure, he is robbed of his free willand thrown into a cruel futuristic British society with no way of defending himself. The most brilliantly and most disturbing Kubrickian farce since DR. STRANGELOVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"I'm a total Kubrick fan and decided to pick up this title after not having seen it in quite a while. What an awesome movie, and I was able to get so much more from it than when I watched it as a teenager. The picture quality is pretty great, there are just a few scenes where some of the image right next to whatever is in focus is particularly grainy, but nothing that takes away from the viewing experience. Anyone who likes challenging films or needs an education in Kubrick should definitely pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi hi hi little droogies!","review":"I just viddied it this noochy and I have to admit I was blown away with the image quality of this transfer; I just love this awesome piece of art and watching it in such way made me love it even more, extras are great, I took a glimpse of Malcolm as an old man today commenting on the movie and some lenghty documentary and that's all on the first disc, haven't even touched the second one; if you're browsing this is because you're a malchick looking for some advice and here it is: BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people just won't get it...","review":"You'd have to be a fool to see this movie as anything LESS than superb. I think it's quite obvious that it was not Kubrick's intention to \\"glorify\\" rape or violence. What this film does is force you to come face to face with your morals and challenge them. Any movie that can do that to you is sheer brilliance. While it doesn't even TOUCH on a lot of the issues brought up in the book, it is not fair to Kubrick to compare his film to the book. As a stand alone movie, the film is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kubrick and the aethesticization of violence","review":"Another milestone in cinematic history, the dark, disturbing, iconclastic, humorous, Swiftian/Kubrickian view of society, freedom, and the Jungian shadow. As always, a stunning portrait of human nature. Kubrick at once repulses and makes accomplices of the audience. Do we acknowledge our own shadows? McDowell is compelling as the \\"prime misfit\\" of a degenerate rapidly approaching facist society. True, Alex is dangerous and terrifying, but he is also, for a time, free, and certainly more human than many of the other characters. If anyone should doubt that a government would employ the \\"Ludivico\\" technique, have you heard of the \\"chemical castration\\" administered to rapists? At any rate, a disturbing film well worth watching and contemplating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE FOR EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!!

My only complaint is that the cover art is quite different, featuring an eye instead of the more familiar cover art.

Masterfully directing and producing by Stanley Kubrick and Oscar deserving acting by Malcom McDowell. Recommended for mature minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating but not an all-time great","review":"The first 45 minutes of this movie are utterly compelling, quite shocking in many respects. But it proves difficult for the director and actors to sustain the pace and elements of surprise that galvanize the film at the start. Wonderful music, extraordinary performance by McDowell, and remarkably faithful to Burgess's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this movie gets such ratings. I'm an avid movie watcher without particular tastes. Will watch just about anything even if I've read the book & not judge according to original stories. This movie just plain sucks, but because it was written by someone of notable existence & in '72 I think, he must have been ahead of his time, right? ~ NOT! It sucked when I tried to watch it 25 years ago when I walked out of the theater & it sucked even more when I watched it as an adult nearly a decade ago now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash.","review":"This movie was pure and utter trash. You will be offended and shocked by this films violence and portrayal of rape, and religion. I cut it off after the first 15 minutes or so. I couldn't pollute my mind any further with this junk. There are other great Kubrick films out there. Pick from one of those and leave this one to the dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Is Enough","review":"I'm not familiar with Stanley Kubrick and I wasn't even born yet when this movie came out. All I can say is that this movie was way too long and I had to force myself to continue watching it to the annoying end. There were also way too many phallic images presented throughout the course of film. Just way too many. If you think the government giving a person medication to change bad behavior is controversial, just wait a few years. Soon your DNA will be collected as soon as your out of the womb. Your DNA will be tested to see if you have a \\"criminal gene\\" and then off you go to a facility to be given a microchip and medication to control you. I saw this movie once and I never want to see it again. Skip this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid movie","review":"That was a stupid movie with too much violence and sex. The violence served no purpose and this movie is proof that hollywood thinks they can make crappy movies and call it artistic. What a waste of film and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...looks as if someone went downhill...","review":"The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and parts of 2001: A space odyssey. These are some greats from Stanley Kubrick. I was surprised when I saw his name on the credits for this movie. It is one of the worst movies I've seen. It is just plain stupid. Don't waste $20 on this! Go see anything Tarantino or Tim Burton. The only good part of this movie was the first scene, then it all went downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it.","review":"Ok, so he's a punk. He has a gang, and he's pretty... You know... Alpha male. They go around and raise hell. They apparently raised so much this one time some victims die. Well, he gets arrested and they do this association program where violence, sex, and unfortunately Beethoven will make him sick.So he gets out... And it happens. His friends become cops and they turn on him. He runs into a victim of his and he knows what happened to him, locks him into this room and plays Beethoven and completely tortures him.

Man, was I disappointed or what! I was expecting a risque movie. Instead it was an \\"artistic\\" movie with only about ten sex scenes. I was expecting hot stuff! I was robbed, I tell you. This movie is overrated cal. You guys only like it because you feel smart trying to translate the funny language they use. Stanley Kubrick is lame, watch some Uwe Boll instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe brilliant in its day--but not today!","review":"While A Clockwork Orange may have been a brilliant portrayal of society's ills and problems when it was produced, I don't see it. On the contrary, it reminds me of modern day productions such as South Park and Beevis and Butthead. While they may be satirical in nature and very thought provoking as to society's problems, A Clockwork Orange simply seemed to be portraying sex, drugs, violence, mental illness, and corrupt governmental institutions just to be doing it without any reasoning. Again, when it was first released it may have had some social significane, but it just seemed to be stereotype after stereotype without significance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"Maybe its because I'm a latecomer to seeing this movie. When it was released it may have well been groundbreaking; but in 1999 it's just plain weird. It comes across as pretentious and absurd. While there are clearly brilliant scenes, as a whole the movie is little more than an attempt to shock and offend. Those are admirable elements within a movie but insufficient to suppply its foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie","review":"This movie is brilliant. Visually it is unique, the music selection (mostly Beethovern) is powerful, and the philosophical themes of the movie really will make you think. To me, this is more than just a great movie though. Its a scientific experiment on the audience. As the audience watches A Clockwork Orange, they are seduced into numerous violent scenes, each beatifully orchestrated by Kubrick. Are we all prone to view violence with pleasure rather than sickness? I think the movie proves the affirmative. Chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A study in the ultraviolent","review":"A masterpiece from a master. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE explores the depths of a violence and satyrically is a mirror image in portions of studies and experiments performed in the U.S. during the same time.

That is the only reason I would drop the DVD a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"two oranges","review":"When I first saw this film, I was an adolescent, and I enjoyed it. But now that I'm all grown up, I feel that A Clockwork Orange is empty, and it was probably made for people who don't have a lot going on \\"upstairs\\".Just look at the people you meet in your life who quote this film. Are these people that you admire? If so, maybe you will like this film.But don't be fooled. A Clockwork Orange has nothing to do with clocks or oranges. It is about friendship and betrayal. The main character \\"Alex\\" is betrayed by his friends the \\"droogies\\".Spoiler alert:I'm giving this film a two star rating (instead of one star) because it does have a happy ending. In the end, Alex is successfully rehabilitated. So it gives us hope that doctors in the future will be able to cure people more effectively than they do today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm get sick of violence after watching this!","review":"The first couple mintues,I though this flim is a piece of bullsxxxwhich all about Few teenage dress in all white and keep killin' rapin' people!A meaningless violence flim which people feel it's adorable!But when Alex go to Jail,My feeling start to change!I start to know this flim isn't like what I think!It's a ANTI-VIOLENCE AND ANTI-SEX flim for sure!!!I'm really feel sick when I watch this flim!After watching this flim is just like Alex after doing treatment,I feel really sick of violence!Musically this flim is a masterpiece!Alex havin' a sex party with two girl which know from Record Store,This part is REALLY SHOCKING!I never seen any flim is as shocking as this before!Very Groundbreaking and Very Original!!!A Masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Kubrick drivel","review":"Rant time.SK seems hooked on sex and violence. He uses Burgess' book as a vehicle for his warped mind to work on. It is a sick movie. The themes put forward in the movie could have been done in a less thoroughly perverse way.If he had seriously wanted the world to benefit from his interpretations of Burgess' book it may have been better for him to have toned it down but that's no good because you can achieve notoriety and fame for producing 'art' that appeals to a relatively minor group too with a lot less effort hence Clockwork Orange the movie.The pluses were that Malcolm McDowell did a great job and that the music was awesome shame the movie didn't live up to it. For that it gets one star.Sho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the List","review":"I have to agree with the veiwer who said \\"A Sickening Picture - Bottom of the List!

This movie is totally overrated and weird. The characters, the music, etc., I was thinking what kind of people would enjoy this movie?. I think sadism and madness are not a good movie topic (in most times). If you watched Natural Born Killers and you liked it, I think you will enjoy this one too, but if you hated it (as me) you will hate this one even more. I consider myself as an open mind about movies, I enjoy very different genres but I don't get why anyone could enjoy movies like this one. If you want to compare your movie \\"taste\\" with mine, my preferred movies are: Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Men of Honor.....if you think your taste is like mine...STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repulsive","review":"My class had to watch this movie, and half of us think it's disgusting while the other half thought it was a masterpiece.

The case was open and the DVD was used as evident by the scratches. As a warning, don't believe what is described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kubrick's Worst","review":"\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" has some very interesting messages about criminal punishment, like who's really the victim when the victim wants revenge on the criminal who harmed him(when Mr. Alexander tortures Alex with Beethoven music in the locked house near the end) and what kind of control the government really has over the indiviudal (occuring when the doctors \\"brainwash\\" Alex). But, I can't believe this film is considered a masterpiece. Filled with scene after scene of rape and assault, and later, endless scenes of the criminal, Alex, wanting to be reformed and getting it at a high price. I think people only celebrate this movie because Stanley Kubrick directed it. I'm a fan of Kubrick, but I really think he wasted his time on this gloomy, moody piece of nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible..","review":"Now, first I read the book, a masterpiece of Brtitsh author Anthony Burgess, who creasted the slang featured in the film -- not Stanley Kubrick...-- and, as usual, the movie disappointed me. I generally don't like Kubrick, as he seems pretentious as all heavens, so I can say that this one is probably among the least-bad out of his \\"classic\\" era. There are several things he completely [messed]-up, creating a film of psychedellic eye-candy that seems to \\"glorify\\" the violent nature of the book, and he makes the lead into an even purer [jerk] than he was in the book, where he seemed to have a bit of sympathy for his mates, amongst other things. If you're a fan of violence, psychedellic films, pseudo-surrealism, and / or Stanley Kubrick, you'll probably enjoy this little endeavor from the Bronx's best-loved hack. If you're a fan of Anthony Burgess and / or real artists, you probably won't enjoy it at all -- I know I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD dosen't work on any of my 3 DVD players","review":"The DVD dosen't work on any of my 3 DVD players, i contacted the provider and received nothing in return."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story... interesting; The implemenation....

The sets are extremely tacky, even for the 70's, and the movie moves slower than molasses. If you have a lot of time to waste, go ahead and watch this movie. There are far better movies that express similar social commentary, but do it at a much more palatable pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"prepare to be disturbed","review":"I watched this film knowing that it was considered a classic and that references to its characters were plentiful in modern works.

The movie, however, never made it past \\"disturbing.\\" The performances and direction fell extremely short of what could have been done with Burgess' amazing novel. Perhaps my mistake was in reading the book before watching the flick. Either way, it's obvious that Kubrick was attempting to inject the same level of art and originality into the filmmaking as Burgess did into the book, but, sadly, it was a dismal failure, in which the integrity of the book was lost. Kubrick was a very talented director, but he unfortunately missed the boat with \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ridiculous to be taken seriously.","review":"This movie was far too enigmatic and incoherent to string together. The music lent itself well to the story, yet one that is laughable. I believe that somewhere in its inner recesses lies a meaning as profound as in 2001, but I could not allow my self to see beyond the silly sets, costumes, and actions.

Other than having TRIED to read Burgess' wonderful novel, I had no inkling as to the story-line or its possible treatments. Now, seeing the movie again, whole, as it was intended by the director--and having managed many years ago to finally read Burgess' book--I believe no other treatment of the novel could do it justice. More importantly, it remains as timeless as other masterpieces of film, like Casa Blanca. Although I had not seen the movie since its release, my mind has been ever full of snippets of the film, intersecting sometimes with newspaper reports or clips of video from the news. Not as matches but as proleptic comments, anticipatory criticisms of a world losing its grip on what it means to BE human.

The fast forwarded sex scenes are not sexy, they're actually comic and the violence in this movie are comic too.

And the scene where he knocks the waoman down with a giant penis is actualy very funny.

(...)Not to disparage everyone who likes this movie, but this is the sort of pabulum that posers and pseudo intellectuals enjoy pontificating about. Of course, I have noted that the people who are truly passionate this movie tended to have seen it as a teenager, so perhaps there is something about it that resonates within the callow minds of (particularly) young men? I neither know nor care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonished","review":"Other reviews of Clockwork Orange tell me that I do not like the film because I do not \\"get it\\" or because I am close-minded. Some of the writers insist that the film has value because of the social commentary it contains, or because it is thought-provoking, or because of its enduring relevancy, or even because of its exceptional cinematography. Nonsense. None of these things justify the dehumanizing brutality of this film. I am not a better human being for having seen the film, and I have not been entertained by it (I would be too ashamed to admit it if I had been)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy 101","review":"I really hate to rain on the parade, but feel moved to write a review as an \\"average viewer.\\" That is, I saw the film during its theatrical release, when I was 19; and I was unaware of any controversy surrounding the film, as I lived far from any \\"cultural center.\\" (I was in Arkansas, actually.) This was the Vietnam era. I was a war protester, cultural misfit, and acidhead. My reaction to the film was, and is, one of boredom. That's not to say that there aren't some good bits: McDowell's Alex is an engaging screen character. But to speak of \\"social commentary\\" or \\"philosophy\\" in this film is to reveal an ignorance of the perfectly common and ordinary statements of bygone literary figures introduced to my generation (and, hopefully, others) in high school at latest. The film looked cheaply made in 1972, and that look has only worsened with time.

It's overdone sets and costumes that may have been \\"cool\\" in the seventies look just dumb now. Kubrick didn't go to any lengths to make this film look like the future as he did in 2001, which I think is boring, but much better than this film. It's portrayal of nudity (both male and female) should have awarded it an X rating, and I can't see why it didn't. Maybe because they mixed it with violence (Does that make sense. I didn't think so.)

While, the film may contain alot of nudity and more than its fair share of violence its done in such a way that you cant help but love it. Although, I think the book was better this movie is sure to please those who liked the book. The only problem I had with it was it left out how Alex grows tired of his violent ways. This movie will leave you with a feeling words cant describe. It shows you that a person can be completely evil yet you will still feel compasion for the character.

I don't see how someone can watch 15 minutes of this movie and be so ignorant and immature as to turn it off at that point. You should grow up before watching this movie. It is not a child's movie, because only children would be so infantile as to focus on the violence and sex, and not even begin to comprehend the underlying theme of this film. Stanley Kubrick was a brilliant man and director, and this movie is more than deserving to be one of the gifts he left this world with. The acting and directing are excellent, and this movie features a social commentary that many people are to blinded to see. Watch it and see if you agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I was cured, all right\\"","review":"Certaintly a movie that needs to be seen to be fully realized, Clockwork Orange holds up as a cult classic over time and ages well.

Highly recommended for anyone who desires to be challenged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staring into the face of human nature","review":"This movie was excellent, it makes you think about the petty oppinions that we wedge between eachother. A Clockwork Orange defined what it is to be human, to have a choice of your actions and thoughts, because without that you are not human at all. Without that choice the entire meaning of life is taken away from you, you're a robot. I have read the book and seen the move and I can definatly say that this is a modern classic, who's theme can stand the test of time. It was voted one of the 100 best movies of all time and it was certainly deserved. The questions of human moral and the rights of judgement arise. This is why life is worth living: to be able to chose what you do, what you think and the things that you expirience that make you who you are.

It is not, however, nearly as good as the 1953 Martin Luther staring Niall Macginnis. The later is a classic, which ends up clearly showing the diffence between the Roman Catholic and Reformation faiths simply, and warmly.The newer film has a lot of special effects, and it isn't terriable, but it lacks the spiritual depth and warmth of the former, which is why it is a classic. For heightened special effects, get this film. For heightened spiritual depth, make sure you see the other as well. The other is the one I keep and watch over again, one of my favorite movies. Luther is not as bad as I thought it might be, but it also isn't something on the same plane as the 1953 movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther","review":"Awesome. Go see it. Does not present the whole gospel or all the biblical influences of Luther, but good portrayal of personal integrity, and the hard choices and sacrifices that were made on our behalf.

It hides nothing. Brings the truth about the Gosples of Christ to your face, without error. And Luther has an attitude I can relate to. He wants the poeple to know the word and not fall into the lie that you have to pay to get into Heaven. He don't care who stands in his way, or for what law of the church they put against him. This movie also puts the lies of present day under examination. What we give is our life, because Christ gave his, it was never silver and gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther is passionate!","review":"Luther is the best thing Joseph Fiennes has done in a long time. The movie is incredible. If I could choose one word to describe it, it would be passion. The passion and commitment of Martin Luther was well portrayed in this film. The scenery was also quite wonderful.I will definately buy the DVD when it comes out and I thinking of buying multiple copies for Christmas/birthday gifts.I came away with the feeling that the selling of \\"indulgences\\" is like saying that Christ's sacrifice on the cross was not enough to pay for our sins; that we have to help him. This is a slap in the face to Christ himself and Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flesh and Bone","review":"Joseph Fiennes fine acting has \\"humanized\\" a man that history has somehow had difficulty in fleshing out. Martin Luther is \\"flesh and bone\\" in this film. Fiennes has brought warmth and fire into his presentation and Luther is shown with \\"warts and all.\\" Luther is seen fighting with the devil, cursing him, arguing with him, debating him, wrestling and winning.Fiennes surprises one by his grasp of an incredibly complex man. He easily portrays Luther's many-sidded character: dark and foreboding, humorous and sarcastic, warm and caring, fightened and courageous.This well-crafted film will help explain the life and times of a man who changed the flow of history by his rediscovery of a loving God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Not history but a great factually-based overview of Luther and his life.

Both are based upon the play by John Osborne. Like its predecessor, the 2003 film received modest reviews, but given Martin Luther's (1483-1546) importance as the father of the Protestant Reformation, perhaps historical importance rather than cinematic success will earn this film some kudos at least among believers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther was Anti-Catholic","review":"First off - anyone who has stuidied church history (no, I'm not referring to the revisionist garbage being promulgated) knows that Martin Luther, was Anti-catholic. He started out as Catholic monk, who discovered for himself, that salvation is NOT through the Roman Catholic Church, Mary, the Pope, good deeds, etc...rather, through placing one's faith in what Jesus Christ did for us on the cross. This is what marked Luther as a \\"heretic\\" to the Roman church. Sadly and ironically, our society sees and \\"lumps\\" all of Christianity into a \\"Catholic\\" wrapping. Catholocism never has, and never will be Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"It surprised me how lightly the film treats the most important event in the history of the Christian religion. Nothing is said about the deepest thoughts of Martin Luther, nothing about his writings nor the famous 95 theses he nailed to the door of the Wittenberg Church. Why were they so well received by the people? What was the meanings of them? Why are they considered the start of the reformation? It hardly shows the importance of the invention of printing in the spreading of Luther's movement.What is the importance of having a Bible written in German? I missed this and many other topics in the film. It is not a matter of telling facts, it's a matter of introducing people into the mind of a man and the period where he lived. Of understanding why things happened, not in a caricaturist way, but in a real and human sense.It's just a very bad film about something we could have learned a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boopie","review":"Wonderful movie.

It is well acted and respectful of the history involved. It does not sugar coat Luther or the factions involved with his movement. Some might view it as anti-Catholic, but the actions of the Catholic Church at the time merely reflect the way things were at the time. This is a great historical drama and should be of interest to those who are not particularly religious. From what I can gather, its is quite accurate historically. As a footnote, this is the last major motion picture to feature Sir Peter Ustinov. As always, he gives a gem of a performance. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"exulting!!!","review":"A moving portrayal of Martin Luther and one that people should see.

It's a very good depiction of the confusion that was going at the time of Luther and the reformation. It is very inspiring and uplifting. Made me grateful for Luther and his persistance. Also helped me to understand how it is critical it is that God speaks to man on earth through prophets, and that man cannot do it alone. This world is too complex without a prophet to guide us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stagey, \\"Bible film\\" melodrama","review":"I rented the movie because of a review that led me to believe the movie would educate me and provide some nuance. It's not in any way that kind of movie. Rather, it's a devotional treatment, appropriate for a Protestant religious family looking for a wholesome movie for a holiday. The opening scenes show young Luther to be so pious and important that even straightening his shirt is accompanied by pious grimaces and an entire string section. Every word out of Fiennes' mouth is delivered more hammy than a Hamlet monologue. The movie settles down into a predictable heroism (nothing extraneous to his religious bravery gets a line): all the Catholic Church is full of corrupt meanies who know they're corrupt, and every peasant cheers Luther on. It's a nicely staged Bible type movie, full of all the usual cliches, but it's about as interested in a nuance as Luther was interested in an indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read his books, don't bother with the movie","review":"If you have read Luther, sang his psalms and hymns don't waste your time on a movie written, acted and produced by people who obviously haven't.

The most I expect is relative historical accuracy, while capturing the significant character, objective character, of an individual's life.This was a lovely film presentation of good acting, music, photography, drama, heroic characters from history, at various points in the life of an important historical figure, during a dramatic, important time in history. Can't ask forLuther (2003)much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite five stars...","review":"Historically accurate and shot on location, this is an interesting film. Decidedly so. It even portrays some of Luther's very personal battles with Satan, which surprised me. But the movie suffers where most religious films suffer, it only gives a superficial treatment of Luther's beliefs. The movie is historical moments which hint at the underlying theology only. Having been so bold as to depict Luther striving against the devil during his early years and during his trial at Worms, the film leaves out his greatest fight with the prince of darkness which came as he was translating the Bible into common German. This is the famous fight that ended with Luther throwing an inkwell across the room into the apparition of Satan to dispel it. This omission of Luther's most overt battle with evil and the glossing over of Luther's ideas render this otherwise excellent film a less than perfect, four star effort. Still worth seeing though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther - a must have DVD","review":"This movie is outstanding. It portrays the abusive state of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1500s. It is reasonably accurate, but like any video, it cannot portray all that a person is. It does not include Luther's changes in his later life where he (as did the Roman Church) elevate the clergy to be special keepers of the faith. Nonetheless, what is portrayed is powerfull and certainly one gets the price paid for listening to and obeying God while trying to work within the instutition of the earthy \\"church.\\" It is very much like that today in many American churches, where the gospel has become distorted by both the fundamentalists and liberals of modernity and those who have abandoned objective truth all together in postmodernity. It brought this reader to a new sense of great humility for the blessings and freedoms that we do injoy in the western world and the incredible strength from God as we experience him and live in that relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding history, culture, and crazy religious cults & denominations","review":"As I studied in college courses, I was glad that I had seen this film, and own it. Luther, though a bit of a nutcase, was an important historical figure, and this film explores aspects of the Catholic church which everyone should know about.Whether you care about religion or not, this information is historically important. The movie is enjoyable, and I recommend it. Protestant people may worry a little, about the foundations of their spiritual path, but people often Refer to Luther and they should know more about him.College students can save time by watching this film, as well. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"----Intriguing----","review":"I've been wanting to see this film about Martin Luther for quite a while and I wasn't the least bit disappointed. The story was very interesting.Joseph Fiennes, cast in the role of Martin Luther seemed to me to be an excellent choice for the part. The film presented Luther as an intelligent and very devout Catholic priest. When he visits Rome for the first time, he is completely taken back and dismayed at the corruption that he sees all over the city. He tries to bring about change within the Catholic Church, but a faction of his followers push for a complete separation and eventually, a new order of religion is formed.I really don't know how close this film is to the facts of Martin Luther's life and I plan to read his biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVE OF GOD","review":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE ,I'VE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND COME AWAY WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT EACH.TIME .WELL MADE,GREAT ACTING!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. B's Review","review":"I showed this film to a bunch of middle schoolers.

If you purchase the 1953 black and white film \\"Martin Luther\\" (50th anniversary edition) you will see what is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther with Joseph Fiennes","review":"This is very well done and researched. It connects us with the actual events leading up to the protestant reformation. The acting was fantastic and, though we do not share all of the theological concepts with Luther's followers, we found it to be a part of our historical background as Protestants. This is a must see movie that helps all of us understand our protestant roots. It is actually used by a seminary from a protestant denomination in dealing with the protestant reformation Luther and others started.The video was priced reasonably and well worth the money. We enjoyed it and plan to use it from time to time.James Miner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Luther Movie","review":"This is a well done movie with good acting and nice cinematography. I was impressed by the director's and producer representation of historical events, particularly those that show some of the disagreements between Luther's intentions and those of some of his followers. I highlight this aspect of the movie because oftentimes it is downplayed or ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie Luther 2003","review":"Many people ignore the fact that our culture \\"feeds us\\" so many messages that either don't mention God or don't want anything to do with God. Finally, yet another excellent film that honors the one and true God and encourages faith in Him. The Bible warns to \\"not be polluted by the world\\". This film instead encourages faith in the God and His Son Jesus Christ.This film, is however, not for small kids as there are a fews scenes showing the result of rebels taking Martin Luther's message in the wrong way and causing massive bloodshed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping to Heal","review":"My husband and I just lost our oldest son to suicide.

Lots of things in the movie went unanswered.","review":"I love suspense but unfortunatly this just didn't quite live up to my expectations. Maybe I'm too used to seeing the mom in this movie as the wife of Jack Bauer in 24. I felt like this movie was more for teenagers. Too much sappy romance and not enough real mystery. I fast forwarded most of it just to get to the end. A lot of questions remained unanswered apparantly since the movie quit production after the last season. I was very disappointed with the ending. Their were too many parts of the movie that made absolutely no sense because the events just never got brought up again towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Running","review":"The story was good up until the end.

This alone can confuse the beginner,as imperfections appear on the pictures and may be mistaken for the actual coin. The written descriptions and arrows point to too specific areas. The areas to be scrutinized are much broader than the head of the arrow. A better book for the beginner is HOW TO GRADE U.S. COINS by James L. Halperin.It uses a color code system that is much easier to follow and the pictures have much better detail.

It was heavy and worst of all, the built in pump, didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music for engaging relaxation","review":"I love the CD, the music is very rich and beautiful but can also be engaging yet relaxing at the same time. Competes with my love for the well known classical's such as mozart green sleeves.The downside to this purchase is the cd case itself arrived cracked on the edge, which compromised the ability of the cover to stay in place when opened.I enjoyed the free incense that complimented the idea behind the music. It was a very nice touch to the purchase. Overall i am definitely happy with the music- just wished the seller and/or delivery carrier had taken more care with the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't like New Age Music","review":"But this is good music. I got this to do Tai Chi to and it works great . I've bought Cd's that are supposedly for Tai Chi and the flow required just isn't there. This cd is not only smooth and flowing enough for Tai Chi, but also 'quiet' and soft enough for meditation, and at the same time just nice enough to put on at home or in the car and just LISTEN to. It never sounds repetitive or too minimal , and yet it doesn't change so drastically in tempo or tone that Tai Chi or meditation is adversely affected. I love it and very highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulfully Brilliant","review":"As with one of other reviewers here, I first heard this song on Soundscapes on comcast cable.

This ring is about 2.5- 3 carats. From afar, this ring may look real but it looks very fake close up. The setting is poorly constructed and looks like you'd get it from claire's. The stone is sparkly but the color looks like it is a cubic zirconia. I'm almost too embarrased to wear it because it looks so fake. For those reviewers that stated the ring was \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"looks real\\", they clearly don't have diamond experience. Maybe I'm a snob, but don't get his ring thinking it'll pass off as real. Think about it like this.... what you pay for is what you get.

Gangs are widespread and the violence is escalating because of the pressure put on others who want out of this kind of life.

A good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"This movie was really an eye opener for anybody that does not know what it is like in the streets. The only thing that I did not like was the fact that these girls were not even 15 yrs old yet and the one was already pregnant. Then that you had to get pregant to face out of the gang. One other thing these 14yr old girls chillen at a night club and dancing in hooker outfits. I thought they were supposed to be CHOLAS not PUTAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Well, I've read some other Alan Moore's graphic novels, such as V, Watchmen and The killing joke. I thought those were fantastic, very creative pieces of art.Then I read that the Courtyard will be finally available and that it's probably the best he has done, very intricate plot, blablablah and what do you know? my hopes went sky high.What I got was a short story, macabre, dense, nicely delivered, but that was pretty much it. The plot is very straight forward, it didn't impact me as much as I thought.Maybe I didn't get it, maybe I'm still expecting this to be a serie, with subsequent installments, maybe I need to be more Moore to understand the deepness.Right now I think it was a very expensive item for what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another failed attempt at adapting Cthulhu mythos","review":"This is something you cannot do. The Cthulhu mythos begins and ends with Lovecraft as far as I'm concerned. It's just not scary when anyone else tries it. Don't get me wrong I love Moore's earlier work. From Hell is the last thing he did worth buying and it could've benefited from major editing. If you're interested in Alan Moore check out Watchmen, V for Vendetta, or The Complete DR and Quinch. If you're interested in the Cthulhu mythos go for Lovecraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"a treat","review":"It is an inventive album and I love to listen to it.

He was a convinced believer in Hauptmann's innocence.However, there are three substantial problems with this book. First, it is a tedious read at best. The writer rambles incessantly and one cannot read this book for more than fifteen to twenty minutes at a time without taking a break or screaming. The book is about 150 pages too long.Second, there are enormous factual errors and inaccuracies throughout the book. Mr. Jones was clearly researching and writing with the express goal of finding Hauptmann innocent. Consequently, there is no objectivity.Finally, Mr. Jones has printed numerous rumors and tabloid tales from the 1930's and cited them as fact. The equivolent would be for a writer seventy years from now to claim that aliens visited the Earth during the 1990's based upon citations to the World Weekly News and other supermarket tabloids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, hah!","review":"This book illustrates exactly the reason why decent women need so much help in escaping destructive and exploitative relationships with men."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good education","review":"I got this book today and I opened it and I couldent stop reading it, I read it today from front to back and now I am so amazed by this book that I am writing a review in the same day that I got the book in the mail, read it and now I am writing this in the same day! We are brought up to beleive these things about women which are simply not true! If we take the time out to understand women and look at them from a scientific realistic perspective which is not through society or religion, then we see the truth about women. Once we understand women and our role, we understand God. The truth about women in today's religous eyes is looked at as terrible, but the truth is the truth, if we dont understand women then how can we understand God, A man that calls this science foolish and devilish is a liveing breathing walking devil. A man who understands women is wise, look at king Soloman he understood women and he was called the wisest king ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this cheap and poorly written book. There are MUCH better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy......[...]","review":"First and foremost there is no SYSTEM. [...] He's stretched everything most guys (who aren't total geeks) already know about meeting women into 100 pages. Maybe the author is a player, but he either doesn't know what he does that attracts women, who he just can't describe it, (Most likely the former). He shares deep secrets like Woman love when men cook for them. Is there actually a heterosexual or homosexual male out there that this is a startling revelation to? The other secrets Valentine shares in his book are just as amazing. Do your homework beforehand like I didn't. [...]. Think of one of the best books you've ever read from Amazon and look at it's ratings. My first clue should have been the editing. Simply put, there was none. Misspellings and grammatical errors are rampant throughout. DO ANYTHING ELSE WITH THE MONEY THIS BOOK WOULD COST YOU. You'll be much better off and 100 pages later, you won't be mad at yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"There is nothing of any value in this book. It's only 200 pages long, yet more than 50 pages are devoted to the author telling you how great his system is. As it turns out, there is no system. It's just a guy telling you to be confident. He also talks about 3 different types of women but never goes into detail about how to recognize these types. Overall, a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effort and concepts, but definately not THE system","review":"I only gave this book 2 stars because it felt like a disspointment. Purchasing this book over the internet without looking through the book first at a local bookstore was a mistake. The System had a few good points, but on the whole it basically restates common facts like making eye contact, playing hard to get, and some basic psychology of women. When I first got the book I was surprised that it was so small; easily readable the first time through. Mispellings and typos also caught me offguard for a published book with such a distinguished ranking on Amazon. I wish there were more precise intructions/outlines for do's rather than dont's(ie. miroring a woman's bodylanguge). My advice to you is to skim through the book before you purchase it to see if its of value to you. I am considering purchasing The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene as a necessary follow-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful only to geek virgins.","review":"If you dated in high school or if you've ever had sex, this book will teach you nothing.

This guy writes about how he got girls in Japan, France, and all over the world. I'm a traveler too and I could identify with him on some of these things.So why do we need these kinds of books? Well, if we knew everything about getting girls we wouldn't be reading these reviews. We also wouldn't be interested in books like this. The truth is, I learned more from this book than in years of dating. I went out and tested the SYSTEM and it does work. Well, she was just an average looking girl but it did work - and yes, I was a little surprised. Maybe I'll eventually get that super model with a little practice.I'm not sure if you'll find it helpful if you want to find someone to marry but if you just want to go and and get some action then this is the book that I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I owe a lot to Roy Valentine !","review":"This book is the most fun and educative one that I have read in recent years. I randomly picked it up and now it's my dictionary/manual. I wonder how Roy have collected so much knowledge in one life and put all of it together in a nice way. Roy, I wish that I was able to read your book 15 years ago, when I was a teenager. All my life I sadly listened to my friends sexual adventures hoping that they were mine. Now it's the other way, thanks to \`The System'.Every word and instruction in the book is more than perfect. Sometimes being over confident about myself, I deviated from the rules that Roy listed and guess what I was badly shot down. So my sincere advice is just to follow every rule and just the way he said.Now you know why I said that I owe a lot to Roy Valentine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The System","review":"This is a wonderful book ever I read and worked for me like explained.

The author seems to have a deep rooted hatred and fear of women, tho he claims to love them. He imagines that we have all sort of elaborate games complete with point systems that we use with men, but his whole book is all playing games with women & about knocking hot women down a peg or two. For every \\"sucess\\" story he tells (a tale of how he got some \\"hot\\" women to take her panties off for him in 5 miniutes) there are probobly 50 stories of women telling him to take a hike and laughing in his face at his foolish, cheezy, pick up games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book on picking up women.","review":"This book should be added to your collection.There is a lot of advice here that isnt mentioned in other books and offers us guys more information we need to know.Its about time that women had to make an effort too.I learned a lot from this book.I highly recommend it to all guys.You can find more of these types of books.Search here under \\"dating\\",\\"how to pick up girls\\" and \\"how to pick up women\\" on this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Get Laid Today!

She said my boyfriend had been hitting on every woman in our circle.

My sister said this was the stuff he was trying. We called my girlfriends over to party and we read this silly system out loud. What a hoot! Women can't read a single page without laughing.I found out why my friends were acting so weird. My boyfriend's act was so obvious that my friends thought I must be testing them to see if they would betray me. The Valentine System is so juvenile that every woman who has read it giggles that no one smart enough to read is stupid enough to believe any of this will work.All these rave reviews testify that only dorky men would buy this book. If you need The Valentine System, you need a lot of OTHER things money won't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I read this book because the title suggested that the author had some valuable information to deliver. Unfortunately, the only advice the author gives you is completely worthless. Basically he tells you to go for women that give you eye contact. Unless you are very good-looking, the only women that will notice you are fat and or ugly. In fact, I did an experiment in a variety of venues to see how much eye contact people would give you. It is surprising how often most people do not want to look another person in the face, in the workplace, in clubs, shopping, etc. Don't waste your time here guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenge your beliefs","review":"I'm from a small town and have always accepted the 'normal' beliefs that I had growing up. I found this book to be challenging at first. Not because it was wrong but because I wasn't raised to think like this.The System woke me up to a reality of the way women think about sex and sexuality. I had to test a lot of what was said in the book and am still surprised. I have already seen the positive change in the way women interact with me since I've started applying the ideas outlined in this book. I now feel that I 'connect' with women better than I ever did prior to this. I have to say that socially, this book has had an impact on me like non other so far.I certainly recommend this book to anyone who want to learn more about social and sexual interaction between men and women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money..","review":"This book is only for the most shy,least confident and the most clueless with women men out there. I'll sum up the book for ya....Don't waste time on scoping for girls that don't make eye contact with you, they're not attracted to you. When you notice that a girl holds her stare and smiles at you or gives you a double look, charge on in for a conversation. Once in make her work for your attention, don't give it away that you're attracted to her.

This book tells you the opposite. It's like telling somebody to go skydiving without a parachute. You're bound to crash.Second - it tells you ONLY to approach women who are staring at you. Anyone else isn't interested. This is SO WRONG.

It's obvious that they arent together on this record, it doesent sound anything like the old KISS. Don't get me wrong KISS is one of a kind but even they admitted it's over musically.

Everything else is, at best, mediocre and will never see air-play.Gene has a terrible voice. It is raw without much character. His Solo Album back in the 80's was better than anything he has put out since.Paul is probably the greatest vocalist in rock and roll. He can belt out rock like never before--and of course, the two best songs, PsychoCircus and Raise your Glasses are a tribute to his vocal strengths.Ace and Peter do not add much other than their presence, but I'm glad their back.It could have been a Powerhouse album. . .but Kiss is now, unfortunately, relying on marketing ploys rather than what they are supposed to earn their paychecks doing: good rock and roll.I give this album 3.5 our of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycho Circus - Original members come back as good as ever.","review":"Fellow Kiss fans unite and rejoice.

For the first time in 20 years or so, both Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were back in the lineup. Kiss was back in makeup, and with the lineup restored, things seemed ripe for a great reunion album. Unfortunately, most of the songs come across as slightly weak, and while there are classics throughout, this is no debut album, Hotter than Hell, or Destroyer revisited. My personal favorite on the album is Into the Void, Ace's major contribution to the album. All in all, it beats a lot of the 'unmasked' period works, but only those who really want everything the original lineup made need apply. (The most unfortunate part of the album is that, for the subsequent tour, Peter Criss was again kicked out of the lineup, replaced with former bandmate Eric Singer, who wore Peter's Catman makeup.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"kiss","review":"i really like it and its all the original members ive had psycho circus since it came out i bought this thinking it had the bonous live disc but to my disapointment it didnt but i got it elsewhere later but its KISS so i love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another kick in the teeth for Ace & Peter.","review":"I gotta be honest. I really liked this album until I found out how Ace & Peter were cast aside during recording of it. I've sold my copy of it. At one point KISS became KI$$ corp. They've always been about clever marketing but there was a legitimate feel behind it. I don't know if it's changed or if I just finally started to notice.

But this record should not ever have been made out of respect for the group. I listened once, put it away and that was enough. Simmons has two semi-listenable songs reminiscent of his solo album and maybe Unmasked, but that's as good as it gets. Most of the guitar work doesn't even sound like Ace Frehley and rumor has it that it was actually Bruce Kulick, but he's supposed to keep quiet about it. Pass on this.

Its just kiss trying to make an overblown commercial album with the same producer from Destroyer but sorry folks it doesnt work at all. This is not where kiss was headed at the time. If you listen to Carnival of Souls which was recorded right before this with Kulick and Singer youll hear the direction that Kiss was going. This was basically made for the money because the fact that it was a reunion record made everyone buy it. Too bad its one of the most unmemorable Kiss albums ever. The best song recorded for this isnt even on the cd. Its called \\"its my Life\\" and its on the boxed set. Lord knows why this song was left off here. Its better than the every song here combined.

At times it almost seems like Ace and Peter were just brought in to sell more records (say this can't be so). The majority of these songs are very listenable, however, there are a few exceptions. Paul wrote a song for Peter \\"I finally found my way\\" which I am sorry to say is a weak followup to 'Beth', however, it does have some emotional overtones which were unexpected. Ace recorded better songs than 'Into the Void' on his solo albums. \\"You wanted the best\\" is about as hokey as it gets. However,with these few exceptions, Psycho Circus is a great CD which I am sure that this will develop into yet another incredible tour.

I think there is some good songs and some magic was recreated, but it doesn't quite live up to the original albums. Part of it is because they have moved forward in life and changed a but artistically, and also this album seems more like a Gene and Paul collaboration with 1 song thrown to Peter and Ace to make it seem like they had a part in creating the album. Aside from the horrible \\"You Wanted the Best\\" song, I listen to this all the way through and enjoy it very much. There is a great European 2 disc set that is worth finding since it has 6 live tracks on the second disk. You might also want to find \\"In Your Face\\", which is a bonus song on the Japanese disk.

The various breakups broke my heart. I was so excited for this disk to come out. I like what Ace has done on his own and thought that the original 4 could recapture the magic of the 70's. I guess it wasn't meant to happen. What is with all of these 4 and 5 star reviews. This disk is no better than Animalize or Asylum. These disks were good in the mid 80's but I wanted the best but I got the 80's instead. They still rule in my heart, but theyt need to come up with something that isn't simply done for the money as this seems to be.Bluestar"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Good","review":"I am very surprised to see so many good reviews of this CD. I work in a used CD store and we can't give this CD away. Every time I personally try to return it, we already have too many in stock to take it. I love Kiss but this Cd just doesn't have anything to it. There's no excitement. Most bands fizzle out after there prime time but Kiss was awesome in both the seventies and eighties and this Cd doesn't hold a candle to anything they have done in the past, with or without Ace and Peter.

The dialogue begs the reader to animate the tale by giving a voice to The Hungry Thing, and the conflict in the story is one that even very young children leap to solve, shouting out the answers to the clueless grownups on the page. I recommend this book without reservation as a memorable delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the feeling?","review":"I am a follower of Gloria's music, but not of her voice.

Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale imitation of good tropical music.","review":"Some good songs, except the worthless last track, excellent musicians and the great Jose Feliciano as guest vocalist/guitar player but the annoying voice? of the alleged best latin female singer make this cd unlistenable.

I loved it so much, especially the lyrics, that I went out and bought Unwrapped, which I haven't been able to get into. I love her in Spanish, it's her native language and so much more beautiful. I especially loved the great translations in the cd jacket, as I don't have a big enough vocabulary as I would like in Spanish, and missed some of the meaning.

I must say I find her delivery mannered and very insincere. Her attempt at emotion is very cold. It's as if she has studied Marc Anthony and Celia Cruz a little to hard. She can't swing or sway if her life depended on it. Se me hizo muy aburrido la musica de esta Gloria."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Misleading Title","review":"Being a rabid Gloria's fan from the mid 80's on, I rushed to purchase this album. To my surprise I found myself hitting the next track button more often than not.'Por Un Beso', 'Punto De Referencia', 'Dame Otra Oportunidad' are songs best suited for somebody else. At times it appears that Gloria is struggling to make the notes.When I read 'Alma Caribeña' in a title I espect songs like 'No Me Dejes De Querer' or 'Tres Gotas De Agua Bendita' when I want to hear some salsa rythms or 'Como Me Duele Perderte' and 'No Me Dejes De Querer' if I want just to chill and enjoy Gloria's rich and beautiful voice.I'm still a fan of Estefan's music but this 'Alma Caribeña' sadly isn't my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disco Track - A good way to ruin a Latin CD","review":"This is basically a pretty good CD although I agree with other reviewers that it is not as nice as Mi Tierra. However, I do not understand why the producers or Gloria would want to ruin a Latin music CD by placing a very loud DISCO version of \\"No me dejes de Querer\\" on track 13. When I play this CD, I either have to program that track out or otherwise rush to the volume control when it gets there. I don't understand this at all, it ruins the latin mood completely. I would have rated this 3 or 4 stars if it were not for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloria... que pasa?","review":"I don't know what Gloria was thinking when she made this CD... but don't expect a \\"Mi Tierra\\" part 2! This CD lacks all the great salsa rhythm Gloria provided with both Mi Tierra and Abriendo Puertas.

Dont get me wrong... i love Gloria, but Alma Caribena is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Carribean Soul?","review":"Being Puerto Rican, I love to dance the Salsa, meringue, and music that just makes you swing. This latest from my most favorite diva is misleading. The cover of the CD shows her getting it down and dancing. Well, when I popped this cd in I couldn't dance to a single one.Don't let the other reviews here fool you. If you like a lot of s-l-o-w, and I mean s-l-o-w ballads, then hey, I highly recommend this CD. If you're expecting real latin music, than the best picks are Abriendo Puertas (my favorite, because you can dance to all of the tracks) and Mi Terra (Just LOVE Mi Terra!). Gloria is my favorite singer of all time, and I worship her and all, but Gloria, honey, you really let me down on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"for a true latin music lover, a waste to have bought it, although I am a fan of Gloria Estefan.

Naturally, the Florence in the time of the Renaissance is covered at length, but Levey doesn't stop there. He gives lots of insight into the patronage of art in succeeding periods. Levey's portrait of Florence is also a portrait of the Medici family and their artistic legacy to the city.While this book might be too hefty and too heady for the casual italophile, it should be in the library of every hard-core Italy lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Avoided","review":"As opposed to the general consensus of the other reviews on this book, I found Levey's Florence to be SUB-PAR compared to other works on the same topic. His understanding of Florentine history is poor and often down right insulting (his remarks that the vibrant political life in the early communal period was like the \\"mafia\\" is a fine example). His insistence on the greatness of Sienese art and on Northern Renaissance Art are wholly inappropriate in a book on Florence. It would be like writing a book on the history of the British Empire and constantly making a point to discuss imperial Russia or Rome. Let's focus on the topic at hand and save the other comments for other books. Mr Levey announces his lack of ability as a historian at the beginning of the work and he is certainly accurate. A much better read is Florence by Gene Adam Brucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like....

I love this album and it is enjoyable making every song seem like a love story. Jagged Little Thrill takes the listener on an emotionally stimulating ride. This album is filled with the quartet's trademark heartfelt ballads. This album signifies their graduation into the school of classic R&B acts. This album also showcases undeniable maturity,growth,and confidence as four men who can say what they mean,build on the old,and slide in the new,while still keeping you grooving to each tune-every time.

I only gave it 2 stars because a couple of the songs start to grow on you, like \\"Cut Somethin'\\" and \\"Best Man\\". I keep playing it because I paid full price, right, but it wears out quick. Heartbreak can stay in the changer for weeks though and never wears out. There's nothing that stands out on Thrill, it's a collection of mediocre melodies with that 1 hit. Save your money on this one. I think they rushed to put out a new album after Heartbreak. They tried to get innovative with their uptempo songs (all 2 of them) but then fell back on predictable slow jams. At least these brothas can sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 small problem","review":"This is a very good CD.

No, of course not.

What needed to be said could have easily have been stated in 100 pages or less. I found myself skimming his \\"journeys\\" in corporate board rooms and his endless discriptions of everyone he met. Who cares?! Generally life is about the journey but in this case the journey was monotonous and never was a destination found that was of any value. The author's apperent self absorbed wittiness came across more as an enlarged ego than an entertaining and informative read. If you would really like to consume this book, I suggest tearing out 2/3s of the pages, eating them and giving them 24-48 hours to digest.

On the the last page of 200+, he finally gets around to telling you that there is no Number anyway. It's a illusion, for all you suckers who bought this book. Too late now, no returns are available.If, in the author's opinion, you're a real stooge, you can actually calculate your retirement number. Take your expected retirement income and take 4%.

Although I really FEEL for these people, my financial situation is much more in sync with the run-of-the-mill American, and for us Mr. Eisenberg has barely a mention, let alone advice.

So much of this book is taken up with the author's self-absorbed stories and perspectives. He seems to believe that it's a qualification that he left the New York City ratrace to work in the midwest although he takes a pressure filled job with a major mail order company. Please know that this author has no qualifications to be offering any sort of informed financial advice. And, he hasn't done much homework to be giving the world lifestyle advice.

What I found was a thought-provoking discussion of how many different factors play into your \\"number,\\" including happiness, charity, life-span, etc.Eisenburg rightly guesses that most of us are panicked about whether we'll have enough when the time comes to retire, but few of us are doing anything about it.

THE NUMBER: A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE offers a new approach to the traditional retirement strategy - one which doesn't count on income from other than personal efforts. Here 'the Number' is defined as the amount of money and resources needed to live the retirement lifestyle you want: chapters discover new methods of creating, revising, and achieving this magic Number. Even better, it goes beyond simple math to discuss the underlying values and issues inherent in striving for such a number.Diane C.

Trying to figure out how much $ one needs to retire based not just on costs of basic necessities but also taking into account the lifestyle one hopes to achieve.However, I didn't find it well-written. He rambles, he throws in all kinds of random information and interviews around, but without really making a coherent, linear argument.And, good heavens! Everyone he talks to and all his own thought processes seem to lead to one conclusion: a person needs many millions of dollars in savings to retire in any kind of comfort.And you know, maybe he's right, but I'm not sure it's very helpful to his readers. I mean, surely the people who are capable of both earning and saving $10million dollars don't need a book, and the rest of us... well, does being told, \\"your life will end terribly if you don't put aside at least $3million\\" really help us to achieve that goal?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor \\"listen\\"","review":"This book is simply not worth your time.

The examined life is worth living, but this book adds little beyond some cute stories. It neither does a good job of telling readers how to do determine or reach \\"the number\\", nor does it help much with the bigger point, i.e. that retirement is more than money.

From his own experience and informal interviews with acquaintances, Eisenberg developed this entire book largely around how much people need or think that they need to retire (the Number).Be warned that the author has no experience or expertise as a financial or counseling practitioner and the book, financially speaking, is quite narrow in scope. It doesn't deal with the vast array of financial challenges and obstacles that most people face.Eisenberg worries readers with dire warnings about Social Security drying up and the undependable stock market, which can halve in value as it did in the early 2000s.

Water does collect on the tarp, and often, when you pull it off, the water dumps into the sandbox. But water isn't a problem, since it sinks into the sand (and kids like the sand wet). The problem is all the yard debris that gets onto the sand if you don't have a cover. And for protecting the sandbox from nature's debris, this tarp does a great job. It stays securely on and doesn't blow off. I've been very happy with ours. After six years of being outdoors all through our New England winter, it has worn out (ripped, faded, gotten a bit mildewy).

I personally would not mind the sand getting wet, since it would just drain out the bottom anyway, and wet sand is much better for play and building castles with than dry sand. Dry sand also flies much more easily into eyes. I just want a taut cover that will keep critters who want to use my large sandbox as their personal loo out of my sandbox. This cover does not do that, as the weight of the water pulls the cover in and creates openings where animals could get in. It also does not have very good UV protection, as my cover lasted one summer before fading, and three summers before ripping and shredding apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Disappointing","review":"I found that this cover accumulated water puddles even when tightened, and then started mildewing on the top.

The book goes through the feelings and emotions of growing up faster than you wanted, going through a war, and loosing someone close to you. this book gives a good perspective of events that lead to a war and some supplies and materials needed. I think the book, April Morning, by Howard Fast, deserves four stars. This book is good for people who like to read about war and people living through the hardship of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"April Morning","review":"I read the book April Morning in my 8th grade reading class. I thought that it was a very good and interesting book. The things that Adam went through are not what all kids today go through so it was interesting to hear about his problems. How the author described each battle that Adam was in, was great, you could picture everything that was going on in that scene and you understood what Adam was thinking. When I first started the story I thought it was kind of boring but when the battles started the story became much more interesting. The story came to an end that may make the reader think what Adam would do if there was a sequel. In conclusion, I believe that the story April Morning was a very good story and it deserves four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I was reluctant on reading this book at first because of its genre (historical fiction). The book started off slow, but sped up during the second chapter. I loved this book. It taught me many things and I will always remember it"},{"rating":"1","title":"April Morning","review":"I read this book knowing that the story would go on for a space of 24 hours. Little did I know that the plot would be tiresome and the family relationships stereotypical. I found this book slow and dull and I could not bring myself to read it again. However the character Adam is fun to watch grow as a boy in the Revolution. The description of the Battle of Lexington was precise until I talked to a history whiz and realized its facts were not all true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice attempt, but no","review":"First off, the detail in this story may attract some readers, but its realtion to the plot of the story is quite meaningless. As far as historical accuracy is concerned, the book falls far short of standars. The entire conflict at the North Bridge in Concord was not even covered, even though Soloman Chandler and Adam retreat to that area after the skirmish on the green. This is the pivital part of the entire engagement, and without it, the ensuing ambush would never have been possible. The description of life during the time should have been described in greater detail, so we can fully understand the atmosphere surrounding the family. I can't seem to understand why you believe the story was \\"gory\\". I thought the actual hand to hand fighting should have been described in better detail so the feeling of hoplessness for the colonists could actually be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"This book was booring! There was nothing in the book that a teenager today could relate to. It was extremely sad! When Moses died, that was the saddest part to me. It didn't really incorperate fiction and enjoyment, it was basically all talk. What little action there was, it wasn't really descriptive. The author could have elaborated on other character's thoughts. We all heard about Adam the whole time, what about his mother or his brother or his grandmother? The book should focus on the families in the war as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring for an 8th grader, good for a history lover","review":"When I read this book, I was going into an 8th grade English Honors class, and it was a part of the Summer Reading. I must say, that I hated this book. All of the details were too much, and just made the read slower and more uninviting. Even though it took me two months to get through it, I give it two stars because it did have a good plot. Not a lot of people decide to write about such a short period of time, and especially to base it on history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Historical Fiction of the Revolutionary War","review":"There are two main goals of the book. It is a means to relate the history of the first shots fired at the start of the American Revolution through historical fiction. It is also the story of a boy becoming a man. The book succeeds in both of its goals and is entertaining as well as thoughtful. Apparently it is a common book for high school curriculum; it's easy to see why. The writer does a quality job of presenting history through fiction and creating real-life characters in such a short book. While reading, you feel like you are there in the action. I have only a few minor issues with the book as it gets some of the history wrong. For example, it describes Founding Father Samuel Adams as an atheist--he was actually a believing Christian. Overall worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was so-so","review":"When I first pick the book up it look very interesting. As I began to read it, I almost fell alseep because of the boring page after page with no paragraphs in between. Nothing! Zip! Finally, I was able to make it to the middle of the book. That's when it began to get more interesting. INTERESTING, for once I thought it would be boring through the whole book. I was wrong. As I got closer to the end, it began to get a little more boring, but in a way still interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Review that you can get","review":"This is an excellent book for people 13 and older. The subjects in it can get a bit much for younger readers especialy things that have to do with love and war. This is a good book and it has vivid details about the time period and things going on. This book is about the development from boy to man for Adam Cooper. It is an excellent book and is very emotional. If you like historical fiction or even just a good intense book, this is a very good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"april morning","review":"April Morning is a good and informative book, because it is a story and not a pile of information. I was able to learn a lot about the Revolutionary War and everyday life in colonial times. Not only information about the Revolutionary War was given but also the types of food that was eaten in colonial times. Colonial dress and games that the children played were also explained with great detail. The book was easy to relate to because it was written through the eyes of a teenage and the situations are similar to what teenagers go through today. Being a girl, I would have liked to have learned more about the contributions made be women to the first battles of the Revolutionary War. Overall this book was great and a must read for historical fiction lovers:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever attemped to read. I'm supposed to read it in my English class, and I can't even get past page 30 because it's so boring. It's very complicated too, and makes absolutely no sense to me. I think you have to really be interested in history to like and understand this book. To me, it's highly boring and pointless. It goes on and on about the littlest things, and goes into detail about bread! Plus, the words are hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"april morning book review","review":"i thought that the book was the worst book i have ever read. DONT read it. i mean if you have to for school thatr is one thing but DONT read it for the fun of it. it the hardest book to understand and it was really boring because im so not interested in the revolutionary war time period. i never found history class fun. not that anybody does. sooooooo remember DONT read the book unless you have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is more than enough","review":"The book April Morning was required reading for my eighth grade reading class. As I read this book I liked it less and less. I found the it to be boring and pointless. It uses language and content meant for a more adult audience, yet is written in a style a fourth grader should be able to read. Furthermore I did not think the author did a good job in writng it. He has no substantial plot or interesting dialouges. Because of the lack of creativity and talent Fast uses gore and foul language to attract his audience. A book read in school should be one that relate to the reader and is creativly styled and worded, rather than nothing more than a trashy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard To Read","review":"First, the reason of the book, I think, was to teach young kids tabout the Revolutionary War and how it started.I think it did not do a good job keeping you into it, but if it had been a textbook it would have gotten the point across.Second, the book can just go on and on about nothing to important,like what kind of ingrediant is most used in a dessert. If you wanted to read this book on your own time,you would get more sleep done than the book. If your a teacher it would be an okay choice to use as a learning book, though the novel can get totally off topic and really just dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good detail, subject boring","review":"I think that April Morning is OK. It uses excellent detil, but it draws out the important parts"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this novel, because of it's excessive detail.","review":"I had to read this book for high school summer reading and overall I hated it. There was too much detail and switching from the main character's thoughts to the events going on around him. There were times where the character's thoughts jumped around so much that it was impossible to figure out what he was thinking. The most entertaining part of the novel was the battles. These scenes were well thought of and well written. There was short and good detail about the transpiring events and the main character's emotions as he saw them transpire around him. I do not recommend this novel to teen readers, especially for enter tainment. I only recommend this novel for those who want to see an historical event as it occurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeeuk!","review":"I was forced to read this book for English, and It was not at all as good as the usual high quality books our English teacher has us read. The only plus to the book is that it is realistic. Adam Cooper was very relatable. Otherwise it was very boring. If you are at a 9th grade reading level or higher, I don't think that this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Liked it so so","review":"I liked kind of because of the action and the war. But the book kind of made me fall a sleep in my bed. I would always have to go back and read the rest because I would and not understand. I liked it overall but it is very confusing. It seems like it jumpted from one thing to another thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"April Morning","review":"April Morning was a difficult book to read. If you skipped a few pages, then you would be completely off track. If you are looking for a book to tell you how life was during the struggling times of the Revolutionary War. You might be better of reading this book. I dont think that the ending really ties the book up. It is basically about this boy Adam Cooper who lives with his parents, grandmom, and his younger brother, Levi. He wants to go to war with his father and while he is there something upseting happens to him. He learns to live through it and he comes home from the war to his family alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good piece of revolutionary literature","review":"I think this book is one of the best books i've read. we had to read this book in school for english and social studies. it's a little boring at first but gets exciting in the middle till the end. if you like the revolutionary war you should read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Keep up with but very interesting. <3","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Although it was hard to follow, i got a pretty good understanding for it. It describes a young boy in his coming of age, but also his passion and his fight for his land, his people, his rights, and the well being of the rebel country.April Morning puts out a passion that i enjoy reading about. I guess i am a passionate person. A passionate person would enjoy this book just as i have. The american rebels needed their flower and their grain that the British so gruesomly destroyed. They had every right to fight and that's what was so great to read about.

It is cheap and fragil. The fabric is very poor. I was at a waterpark and was going to be daring and go down a waterslide headfirst for the rush. Because this was against the rules, my friend videotaped the act and also got many spectators to watch. I got by the staff person and went down. As I went down the friction (which isn't a lot) caused the strap to break off. This means I come down bottomless and give some a good show. After about 30 seconds, I notice in horror that I only have half my bathing suit. I couldn't find it. Then I had to go back naked to get a towel.

Those are the differences that collectors will be happy about.I am so happy that my nieces and nephew will be able to finally have a copy of \\"Eloise at Christmastime\\" of their very own and they will be able to pass it on to their children.

Sometimes it makes me wonder what in the heck Kay Thompson was taking at the time! Needless to say, even though it is very good, it's not my favorite Eloise book. I've read all the Eloise books... they provide great maxims for daily living, such as \\"getting bored is not allowed\\" (the first book, \\"Eloise\\"). I repeat this to my friends a lot of the time.

He can't quite achieve the dynamic energy level he once had when he performed these songs on a regular basis. And it seems no one has told him this yet. The result is a mixed bag of familiar tunes, with Joe sounding a bit unconvinced about material he once sang so...convincingly. While the playing is fairly tight, and Joe does show flashes of the old Joe here and there, this is still for me, an unsatisfying album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Three","review":"This is Jackson's first return to his rock/pop origins in a while and it is superb. His voice is strong and melodic. His piano playing is assured and rhythmic. But it is his rhythm section that deserve a lot of the credit. Graham Maby may be the best bassist since Jack Bruce. he plays the instrument as if it was a guitar and as a consequence what is only a trio sounds like a four or five member band. Jackson quite rightly gives him a solo part. As a team, the trio are very together and capture the drama in all the songs. None are disappointing, but for me the highlight is Eleanor Rigby. Jackson has transformed McCartney's stab at classicism into a heartbreaking and thoughtful classic of pop music. The Beatles are hard to upstage (Cocker did it with his A Little Help), but Jackson does it. This should be a single and a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"remember how good his last live cd was...","review":"i'm not a big fan of live albums. i much prefer to see the act in person than hear vicariously through a cd. joe jackson, however, seems to be able to put out live cd's that fill me up with as much joy as the actual concerts.what do i love about them? the choice of songs (covers of \\"the in crowd\\", \\"for your love\\", and \\"eleanor rigby\\" as well as others) and different takes of old chestnuts. plus, he sounds great and somehow that energy that i never seem to get from other live albums comes through here.i've found myself spinning this disc many times since it came home with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"At first I loved it.

Well, I do. \\"Summer in the City\\" and \\"Mood Indigo\\" and \\"The In Crowd\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" are all songs I was familiar with, being a coot, but the new and original material on here is also fine.

Captures Joe's Live Show Personna!","review":"Being a fan of Joe Jackson from his early \\"Look Sharp!\\" efforts to the present day \\"Englishman trapped in New York\\" stylings, I was very impressed with his recent concert this spring here in Milwaukee. This CD, although directed at a New York audience, really does renew his concert experience and exhibits Joe's versatility in a live format.He truly is unique and covers material by the Beatles, Yardbirds, Ramsey Lewis, and my favorite - Steely Dan - in a very novel manner. It would be great to hear more colaborations with another transplanted New Yorker - Donald Fagan - to see what other jazz, pop, swing, or other sounds might ensue.I would give this a 5-star rating, but for the weak finish of the CD - a less than inspiring JJ piece.Definitely a MUST for any JJ fan collection . . . and a great introduction to any new fans looking for a truly original musician with a love for entertaining and the craft of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"a stunning look at love, evil, and innocence lost","review":"This play, which takes place in the imaginal world of the character Quentin, is in a sense an ongoing self-analysis as he bravely re-collects how he has chosen to live, love, and relate to people.

The brilliant text of Arthur Miller is brought to life. Rarely put on, this story of man, searching for himself and for a woman he will not repeat the same mistakes with, is fascinating and sad. It's also disturbing and moving that an author should commit to paper, and thusly to posterity and for everyone to read, his own questions and failings. Because the line is terribly thin.

Unfortunately, this case book only added to it. There are cases after cases that are supposed to help you understand civil procedure, but there is little discussion of the law itself or about why the court decided the first case the way it did but did the polar opposite in a second, similar case. The questions that are provided after the cases are designed to help you analyze the law, but they are of little help when you have no foundation. Most people will probably need to consult at least one other source to understand civil procedure. If your law library provides a hornbook, make it your best friend. It is too late for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil Procedure","review":"Great book for law student studying civil procedure.

Yeazell is another author who sells an un-answered book just so he can sell another book that explains the first one.

The truth is Civil Procedure is not exactly the stuff that made us want to be lawyers, but when we finish law school, who is going to forget Asahi, or Erie!, or World-Wide Volkswagen, or hmm... Gibbs! Yeazell has all the cases you need in here. I do think Semtek in the Erie section is odd because preclusion has not been introduced. And I think it is the odd placement, if you read the book linearly rather than jumped around, that makes some of the reviewers here hate this book. But this is one of the better books. Couple this sucker with Glannon and presto you will be screaming \\"There ain't no subject matter jurisdiction under 1331--it is all a lie!\\" In no time.

As other reviewers have stated the cases have been edited quite poorly, the Erie doctrine section confuses, more than it helps and the overall flow of the textbook is poor. Also the note sections, which usually serve to help students make sense of the case that was just read, are more often than not filed with unhelpful questions with no guidance on how to answer them or what the answer would be.I ended up buying the Hornbook by West and that easily became the text that I used (along with the Fed Rules book) to understand Civ Pro.I fell sorry for you if you have to use this book.*Note review is for the 6th edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much worthless","review":"I actually liked my Civil Procedure class, but I hated doing the reading for it because it meant I'd have to use this book. The layout is thus: You read a case, and then you are presented with a series of questions that apparently you're expected to be able to answer on your own - in effect, you have to teach yourself Civil Procedure as you read. Interspersed with the meaningless (at least to the confused 1L reader) questions are little facts and tidbits related to Civil Procedure which aren't that important, but since they're the only information in the discussion section not presented in question form, you glom onto them in the hope that knowing said facts and tidbits will help to clarify Civil Procedure for you. All in all, easily one of the worst textbooks I've ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needlessly Confusing","review":"This book is basically worthless, except as a makeshift booster seat or placeholder on a bookshelf. I read this book, then I read the Glannon E and E. There is no comparison. Glannon illuminates, and Yeazell simply asks tedious questions with no answers given.

I did fine in civ pro using mainly supplements for learning the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsensical confusion","review":"The author who wrote this book must have had only one intention- to confuse the reader. There is nothing remotely good about this book. It is edited very poorly to the point where it makes absolutely no sense. The author hides the true meaning to the cases. If you don't have a VERY good civ pro teacher, you will have no idea what you are reading. I don't understand why someone would take the time to write over 800 pages and deliver no purpose to the text. It is so bad that if I was an incoming law student, I would probably turn down a school if I found that they used this book for their civ pro course."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst casebook I have ever used.","review":"I think my title sums it up.

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"I gave it 5 stars because it's exactly what it is described as. And it's really neat. I got it for my daughter and I'm sure she will love it for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass cracked after 1 week","review":"I've only had the lava lamp for about a week, and until a few moments ago I was happy with it. I never left it on for more than 8 hours at a time, and I was even thinking about buying another, larger one to put in my living room. About 30 minutes ago I turned the lamp on, and it was heating up when I heard a loud POP, and when I looked at the lamp I could see where suddenly there was a big crack, near the base of the bottle, where the shape transitions. I had the lamp on the same table as my computer and other electronics, and I'm lucky that I wasn't in another room and happened to notice the sound of the glass spontaneously cracking. It would've been a disaster if the lamp had started leaking hot gloopy waxy liquid all over my computer! I love lava lamps, but now my confidence in them is cracked, along with my lamp. BE CAREFUL if you have one of these, and consider putting it somewhere where nothing bad will happen if it cracks and starts to leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked properly","review":"Unfortunately, the lamp never worked properly. When the lamp was on and the liquid heated up, all of the yellow color rose in a big clump, pooled at the top of the lamp and stayed there. The movement of the liquid never functioned like a lava lamp. Then when I shut off the lamp and it cooled down, the yellow liquid clumped into a solid and stuck to the sides of the glass. I made the mistake of throwing away the packaging before confirming it worked properly, so I was unable to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This lamp doesn't flow!","review":"We tried everything to get these to flow (we purchased 2 of them in different colors) and nothing worked. Takes ages to heat up, and then the blob just sits there and doesn't do anything - no motion, nothing. what a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lava Lamp","review":"Received in a timely manner. Everything worked. Takes a little too long to heat up to where it functions properly, but not a problem...just have to plan ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow motion-no motion Lava lamp","review":"I am disappointed in this lava lamp. After waiting for nearly eight hours for the 'lava' to start moving, it finally made a slight move upward. That was it. The lamp makes a nice night light but it is NOT a lava lamp. More like an oil-filled glass container with a blob of wax stuck at the bottom.Do not waste your money on this product. You would be better off going to Spencer's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful colours","review":"It has wonderful colours and a nice light. The girls, 6 and 8 years old, absolutely love it!The only thing is when you first plug it in, wait until the wax heats up and if it doesn't start blobbing, give it a gently shake to put the spiral that is supposed to stay in the bottom of the glass-holder, in its right position. If the spiral is out of the position, the wax will not melt and blob properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lava Lamp","review":"This item was a disappointment to my mom. She was delighted with the idea of a lava lamp, but surprised that this one did not move as expected. As it warmed up, a slow blob moved into place and stayed put. Also we had to put the lamp on a timer so that it would not overheat. She loves watching the movement of things and had hoped this would work all day. It did arrive promptly and as described, but did not function like we had understood a lava lamp would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice!","review":"This is a very nice looking lava lamp. It's perfect for an office desk. Actually, it's perfect for my desk! Prior to purchasing this one I also considered purchasing the larger one but am very glad I went with this one. Anything bigger would have been overkill."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Lava, Just Goo.","review":"I purchased this lamp for my daughter for Christmas '09. We plugged it in and turned it on and waited. And waited. And waited. We left it on all day expecting the goo in the bottom to start moving. It never did. Nice glow but no lava motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped with a bad bulb","review":"I ordered two of these. One worked fine, but the other had a bad bulb (broken filament inside the bulb). There is a warning to not use any bulb so leaves me confused about what type of bulb to replace with.The device overall feels really cheap and you have to be very careful not to top it over. You sit the middle part on top of a bulb in the bottom then cover up the cap on the top with a silver top. The silver pieces on bottom and top are easily bendable. I received mine kind of bent up and re-shaped it back to almost normal.So overall, bad quality and also received a bad bulb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great-","review":"why would you pay for expensive universal remote, this one is very simple to configure and works really good. i was concerned at first that its burguny for our gray car but when i put it in you cant even notice it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong order","review":"When I ordered this I was expecting B6 + B vitamins. Instead I just got B vitamins. So Im pretty unsatisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"They used to call him \\"Demoniovich\\" when I was in college...","review":"This book used to be referred to as the one by \\"Demoniovich\\" and not casually, when I was in college taking Calculus, some 15 years ago. It's plain and simply a classic to master Calculus. Not an introductory book by any means, but definitely a book to go into once you've had your first take on other more basic books. If you can work out the problems in this book, any Calculus test you encounter will feel like a breeze: I am serious about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"too heavy","review":"This already adds bulk to a heavy pda, but if you want to protect it this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book of source materials on the Holocaust","review":"A Holocaust Reader is an excellent collection of source materials. The book is divided into eight sections, more or less chronological, on the different stages of the disaster, starting with German anti-semitism in 1880, and running through the mass deportations of the Jews and Jewish resistance. Each section is preceded by a 3 or 4 page summary that helps the reader approach the documents with better understanding. The book has only two maps, a shortcoming for people like me who want a better idea of where things took place. But on the more positive side, it provides well documented source information and suggestions for further reading. I also found an appendix estimating the number of Jews killed in the final solution by country of origin to be helpful. This is an excellent book for fleshing out other Holocaust readings and by giving insight into the lives of real people during that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true jazz legend.","review":"Listen to her sing \\"Manhattan\\".

This fit the bill ($20), was light, and the volume went high enough without too much distortion. Just be realistic with your expectations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, great sound for the price","review":"You cant beat these speakers for the $20 price tag. Good sound, any little bit of distortion can be eliminated by adjusting the Eq on your mp3 player, along with the volumes on speaker and your mp3 unit. I have to agree with everyone else about the lack of a sturdy stand. I found that if you use the case and fold over one side and rest the speaker on the case you can adjust the direction of sound a bit better. It also seems to make the speakers sound a bit better (that part might be my imagination lol )"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad customer service","review":"I purchased these speakers on December 10th, and it is now December 23rd and still no speakers. I paid for the expedited shipping, but they never shipped. I tried contacting both Amazon and Caiman several times, but have received no reply from either company. I will not be able to give the speakers as a christmas gift as planned. I am very disappointed in both Caiman and Amazon, as neither company has even sent me an email to let me know what the delay is, or when they will be shipped. I don't reccommend this company at all."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-71df73c5"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/12.md","filePath":"drive/12.md"}'),R={name:"drive/12.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
