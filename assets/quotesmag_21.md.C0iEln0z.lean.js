It was the Best digital camera $500 or more and was even better than the 5 Megapixels compared to it. Easy to use and even better- terrific pictures. Set the mode to Auto and take your pictures its as easy as that or for the more adventurous there are manual settings to muck with. The one insignificant problem that I had was with the manual. It comes on CD and you need Adobe Acrobat to read it. Other than that it was a wise choice. I am extremely happy with this camera, it ROCKS! Advice - get either a 128mb or 256mb xDcard. They hold tons of pictures. Also when using the 10X zoom its easier to hold it steady with a Tri or Mono - pod."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable Civil War memoir","review":"Father Corby's Irish Brigade memoir provides a very valuable and interesting record of the Civil War. His testimony gives the reader a first-hand account of life in the Church and in the Army.In some sections, the memoir is not terribly exciting; it is for the history buff who wants to know more than which general won a given battle. The book tells of the great and small trials of army life. Its value comes from the author's testimony about the lives of the soldiers and their experiences.The book will best suit those who possess a knowledge of the war, as Father Corby's passing mention of campaigns and generals' names will be lost on the uninitiated.I strongly recommend this book to those interested in Civil War and Irish history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the size","review":"The necklace is nicely made, but the rectangles are very small and I am disappointed with this.

Taken from her Detroit surroundings she has chosen to represent the Detroit Techno scene with in its minimalist front It is somewhat similar to early Robert Hood (Internal Empire), or lighter work by Claude Young. There are no tracks on this album which represent her more housey output. In fact the album has barely any audible vocals at all, except for the opening track which repeats \\"get ready for the darkness\\".That being said it is not as dark as the deep work of Plastikman (Consumed), but that is certainly no fault.

It is unfortunate Hollywood didn't opt to portray Palin in a more accurate manner, but this is Hollywood we are talking about. After all, they did win a Presidential election--twice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's what the Tea Baggers Hate, Fact--Or Nearly So","review":"No movie can ever be fact. The thoughts and statements of people can never be completely known. But when people that were involved with the event assist in making a movie about that event, then you get something that approaches a factual accounting. That's what this is, the man who picked Palin for the VP spot helped make the movie! And if you followed the events when they unfolded you will remember much of this. The movie is done so well that you really get a sense of who Palin is and how even her own party, and especially her own Presidential running mate, John McCain himself, came to revile her. For the Dems, you will find it hysterical and scary that the \\"loyal opposition\\" could contemplate this woman who had \\"no right being in Washington, much less as a potential VP candidate.\\" (From the movie.) For the Republicans I hope it can be a wake up call to check your facts and your people before you push them on the rest of us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"The acting of the 3 main characters (Julianne Moore, Ed Harris and Woody Harrelson) is just right on.The back story - if it is true....is fascinating.

I've watched this movie, now, about three times. I loved it. It is FREAKISH how J. Moore looks like Ms. Palin. Of course, we don't know how accurate the portrayal is, BUT, it made me squirm. I always felt bad for Sarah Palin--she wasn't qualified to be a weather-girl after taking 6 years to get her college degree in communications from 3 universities--let alone be 2nd-in-line to hold the keys to the nuclear arsenal. To me, the movie was more a reflection on Mr. McCain. This \\"game changer\\" would have likely been one of many political blunders for the elderly stateman. This movie isn't about politics. It is about how we, as Americans, are gullible for a beautiful, not-so-intelligent woman. Sex sells. Sarah Palin is sexy. And, she could have been our VP. Scary. Freakin' scary. Great movie. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story","review":"This book contains a series of compelling stories, woven together in travel.

A lot of down-to-earth experiences and descriptions are presented here.Things to keep in mind: the author mingles mostly with local 'elite' (if you can call it that). The author has mostly negative feelings towards anything Western (culture, people, etc), forgetting that the techology designed (and for the most part) built in the West is running majority of the countries he went through.If you would like to have a context in which to read this book, consider:\\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\", by David Landes and \\"The Clash of Civilizations\\", by Samuel Huntington."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vivid Picture of the Sahara","review":"A travel narrative classic: Mr. Langewiesche provides a vivid picture of the formidable Sahara.

This one is destined to become a travel classic along with the best of fellow pilot Saint-Exupery. Having lived in West Africa, I was on the look-out for a false step, or glibness, and never found it. Langewiesche considers his subjects with fairness and a keen eye. He never condescends. He caught the mood of the desert beautifully without ever romanticizing or demonizing it.

I called the seller and he said that the open packaging was due to handling by the USPS.He said the blisters were broken during shipment. I told him about the incorrect voltage. The seller was very apologetic and offered to correct the mistake by shipping out replacements, but due to the possibility of getting more with the low voltage, we agreed on a refund which was promptly issued through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"What you get in the mail is NOT what is advertised!

Obviously battery life will be lousy, since they've already been sitting on the shelf somewhere for SEVEN years.Looks like somebody dumped a load of old batteries on the wholesale market, and MTA trading picked them up cheap and is slipping them back into the retail chain (at retail prices).I'm sure MTA wouldn't still be selling in the Amazon marketplace if Amazon knew they were selling old/surplus merchandise, and trying to pass it off as new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Items received did not replace A76","review":"Ordered 3-pack and got 3 individual batteries with different packaging.

This disc is a treasure, specifically for the Brahms Sonata, which many great pianists(who were included in the Philips set) dont pull off half as well as Fischer does. I would even say that I didnt ever enjoy the sonata or respect it as much till I heard it hear. This was my first experience with Fischer and unfortunatley I havent seen this disc in stores since I bought it. So I would recommend getting it here, you may never encounter a better Brahms Sonata, or enjoy Bartok's piano music so thoroughly or hear Un Sospiro played with such a convincingly feminine touch-, romantically that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"Recently acquired this fryer after getting burned by a Euro Pro model (the Euro Pro stoped working mid way through it's third batch of food).

Very nice to have a sealed lid as well... most of the fryer smell stays put (where it should!) in the fryer.Things I'd like to improve upon:Removable bowl for the fryer.Another indicator to let you know the unit is on. Currently, the only time the light is on is when the unit warms up. After it gets to the set temp, the light goes out.More robust temperature setting: the slider is fairly loose... could easily get bumped and adjust temp settings without you realizing it.We'll see how it does over time but am pleased so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"t-fal deep fryer","review":"Nice, easy to clean deep fryer.

Sure, there are 2 or 3 scenes that MIGHT actually hold you attention (the \\"legendary\\" sisters shower scene) but by and large this effort is typically high on nonsense and extremely low on actual erotic sapphic content. For example, there is no actual kissing in this video (ok.. maybe 1 or 2 QUICK pecks, but that is IT!)

None of these were here.What good scenes it did have, they were re-cut and shortened from the original video where it may have appeared, like the car convertible segment from Blue Collar Babes. The original segment was maybe 3 or 4 minutes long, but it was 1 minute here.

So I got one for myself!I was constantly opening and shutting my kitchen window because I was constantly starting the gas burner to make a pot of tea. It got annoying and I am sure that they gas burning in the house, even with the window open, is not the healthiest thing for you (FDA says indoor pollution is worse that outdoor).The 9205000 boils very quickly, in stainless steel, with no fumes. Plus the steel helps keep the remaining water nice and hot.The only negative (to me...) is the plastic top and screener.

Not for Moore, but for the stellar accompaniment. Maybe they can figure out a way to bluescreen him out. Here's a guy (Moore) who used to play Hendrix-like (except that he never really learned to tune a guitar), and he's skippin across the stage with an umbrella. Only thing he forgot was the blackface.

The AC adapter gets hot during use, almost too hot to hold. This is not good, and was alarming enough for me to send it back.The adapter does not look like the pictures on the web, and is labeled 'Caution: For Use with Technology Equipment'. What? I don't think this is techology equipment! It *is* rated 12v 5 amps, however.2. The fan operates continuously and emits a distinctive pitched tone (469 Hz), rather than whir. It is loud and can be easily heard indoors from a distance of 20-25 feet. I found it disturbing. No doubt it would be fine in a car, but I intended to use this mostly indoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNIT WAS DANGEROUSLY FAULTY!","review":"On first use (in our car), this unit first began to smell of burning, then began to smoke.

I primarily take it for the increased cardiovascular benefits. I normally get cold feet as the blood flow does not adequately reach the area. By taking Q10 from Natrol or Naturemade, my feet are once again warm and life is good. I tried this brand and Bam! instantly back to cold feet. Its as if I took nothing at all. Problem with Herbs and Vitamins is that their potency is not truly standardized. I would not recommend the swansons brand for this reason. In my experience the potency was not up to par for something I regularly notice. If I was taking this for something I would not notice (such as a heart condition) then I wouldn't have been able to see the non-posative effects. I will stay with Natrol or Naturemade brands from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The start of an upward trajectory","review":"The good bits - Branded and Exiled itself, title track and heavy metal monster, laying down a vicious artillery barrage in preparation for the assault onto the listener. The next good bit, the somewhat diverting Mordor - which alas is in the middle of the album after proceedings have been stunted by a few densely constructed wedges of proto-metal. The third and last ray of sunshine is a lumbering tune that closes out the album - Chains and Leather. Presumably the band have a sense of humour to do a song like this and when your final song on a disc is this cool, well it makes a punter be somewhat forgiving of the lead weighted metal they have staggered through to get to it.This is a band that eventually grew up and away from music this dense, preferring a more cutting technique which allows the songs to breath more. But that came later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly overlooked actress starring in 'Excellent Bio'.","review":"This Bio does not look upon Louise Brooks as sympathetically as other's Bio's do.

When it works, it is a good, solid product that can hold multiple guitars in a small space. However, the legs on the one I ordered are uneven, the welding between the parts looks shoddy, and the whole thing wobbles-- not exactly the piece of furniture that I would trust with holding a few thousand dollars worth of instruments.

Why? Because the authors say absolutely nothing new about the creative process. In fact, they don't even seem to try.The tone is that of a kindergarden teacher: warmly encouraging bordering on patronizing.The book tried for a structure (7 steps, duh) but each chapter sounded just like the preceding one. Apparently, writing is a frustrating process. But then it gets more frustrating. And then, did we mention, it becomes frustrating.I will say that it was an easy read and if you really are so desperate for encouragement as to spend time reading self-help books instead of actually writing, then I suppose this will be the hot cocoa with marshmallows that we all need occasionally.However, for anyone looking for insight or raw inspiration, this will be one big bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Over\\" Defense","review":"I recently purchased this DVD at a coaching clinic. It was rather expensive, most instructional coaching DVDs are. The title says Over, I assumed it was talking about the 4-3 over defense and walking a safety into the box. I am not sure why the title includes the word over, as this was not an example of the 4-3 over defense. The description of the film states \\"the DVD explains how defensive teams can employ shifts to gain an advantage\\" there are no defensive shifts discussed in this DVD. I almost felt like they put the wrong DVD in the box.Futhermore several of the schemes that Johnny Burnett draws up, only have ten players. He leaves you to guess or assume where the other player should be aligned. I would not recommend purchasing this film to anyone. It was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"preschool learning fun","review":"My preschool special ed students LOVE this book, they would read it 10 times each day if I allowed them to.

Other introductory books on intonation (Cruttenden's Intonation and Couper-Kuhlen's An introduction to English Prosody) lack sufficient coverage of this important theory. The book also presents good summaries of intonational meaning and cross-language comparisons. A great, easy-to-read book.

And he may be a decent TV analyst, I can't say that I've ever heard him on the air. But a writer he is not, and he should have gotten a better ghost writer than Gigliotti and where the hell was the editor of this book? I bought this (even paid the full Barnes & Noble price)thinking that it would give me better insight into being a more astute observer of the game, but the Moose fell short of this goal. He is way short on facts and data and way long on nostalgia and personal opinion. And I'm not sure that he ever gave one hint about what to look for while actually watching a game.However, on the plus side, I did learn a few tidbits, which I am assuming are true: the meaning behind the name 46 defense, explanation of the free quick rule and describing the passing tree.Otherwise this book is very basic and superficial and a serious fan/student of the game would be mostly bored reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rah, Rah, Rah!!!","review":"This book scores.

Well, there are many them in this tiny/simple class, but i can just ignore and pretend to think that the author did not have enough time to test his own scripts before he put them in his book...but the algorithm/logic structures of the codes that bothers me!

Haneke creates a unique pace here that, while slow, is never dull. There is always an uneasiness, a sense of malice lurking in the shadows, so that we as the audience are always unsure of exactly what is happening or what is about to happen.As it unfolds, the film takes dark turns, and there are two distinct points in the film where I found myself gasping for breath. There is an air about the picture, a certain malevolence buried inside the celluloid itself, so that even as the story ends and the audience departs, you are slightly more disturbed than you feel you have any right to be.I've yet to put a final verdict on the film, it requires a second viewing. Needless to say, it's definetely something unique in cinema, and for that reason alone it gets my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Based on all the positive reviews here, I expected a good movie.

The story progresses very slowly and this bores you to the point of not caring anymore. After the second half the plot fizzles and the ending is abrupt. So so performances by the stars. A good idea, executed badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtly excellent","review":"This is a brilliant film--many of the scenes allude to a larger metaphor regarding French colonialism and colonialist attitudes, including the more obvious current western/non-western tensions. The director does not let the minority position off the hook either: the Arab son appears to deny what it seems he must have done; and in a movie where nothing is insignificant, a brief altercation between lead character Georges and a black cyclist reveal that both were fantastically out of line. Another time the film makes a subtle highlight of Georges, serious topical-intellectual talk show host, in a film studio editing his own live interviews--he is literally re-writing history and applying power by manipulating information for his own purposes. Scenes like this are throughout \\"Cache\\": nothing can be taken for granted. The director has studied his Kubrick and Bunuel and come up with a very timely classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"Seriously, I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did, I was left totally unsatisfied. Nothing in this film worked for me. The exhaustingly LONG, SLOW, shots of everything. The motivation for the boy from his past to do what he did (won't say...spoiler alert) made NO SENSE to me. The admittance by the main character that he told \\"lies\\" and the lie being he \\"coughed up blood..\\" seems out of character for a child. I kept hanging on, hoping for some type of motivation to be believable, and I was never so disappointed for holding on till the end. It was voyeuristic, with nothing to watch. I saw the White Ribbon advertised on Demand on Comcast and when I saw it was directed by the same director, I moved on. A waste of a couple hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"concise and unpredictable","review":"Characteristic of what I think defines the well-crafted French film: concise, in that it leaves in just enough to keep in coherent, and unpredictable, in that it leaves out enough to keep even \\"clever\\" viewers guessing and on edge. A suspense-thriller without kicks and car chases. Daniel Auteuil is grand, as always, and the rest of the cast is excellent. The actors milk moments of patchy dialogue with convincing body language and subtle facial expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quel navet !","review":"Je me suis presque endormi deux soirées de suite et c'est la première fois que je finis un film en 3 jours !

After I watched it, I felt glad that the first 20 to 30 minutes were intriguing and promising. But the intrigue went nowhere and the promise was broken. Maybe in France it's considered good for a movie to be all build-up, very little plot development, and then end stupidly and abruptly with nothing explained. Not on this side of the Atlantic. I think this got good reviews because American critics want to appear broad-minded and intellectual, and it looks impressive for them to rave about a European film that Europeans are already raving about. But quite simply, it's a stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Hitchcock","review":"Anyone who expects Hitchcock suspense from this will be disappointed. It doesn't translate well into French. It's not scary and you won't be shocked, except by the suicide.

It's a movie that sets out to waste your time, that's it. Why can't we give negative stars? On all of the negative reviews, also note that one guy goes to each one of them and disagrees. Please, get a life and get over it. You created a movie about nothing to waste people's time and this is the reward. Now go write five positive reviews to counter this one.The film is an absolute failure. Read the positive reviews and you'll quickly discern that they say nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slower, Cache!","review":"I always loved the movies by Haneke, and hold him as the best European director right now. I just loved Funny games (both versions). But this one I was just a big disappointment. I can understand that the idea of the film IS that the plot is supposed to be hidden from the viewer, but in the end it's just becomes boring. Great actors help to make it watchable the first hour, but then you start looking for the fast forward button on the remote..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cachet","review":"Liberal guilt, third-world victimology, a mystery fashionably left unsolved, the peculiar and rather Catholic idea that even a six year-old is eternally damned for his misdeeds (at least when their object is a member of a minority group)--all of this makes for a gimmicky, pious, chic and unconvincing film. Well-acted, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long enough for a good nap!","review":"If too long scenes, irritating characters, unrealistic plot devices, and elementary life lessons constitute fine film making, then yes, this film is truly art. But the rest of us will only appreciate this film if they are awakened by their DVD's shutting off having fallen into a nice nap by the first quarter of this plodding bore-fest.There really isn't a story worth telling here. Save your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"I love international films and I was very excited to see this acclaimed one on the shelf of my local video store. How disappointing! I did not find myself interested in any of the characters or their stories- however tragic or deceitful. I struggled to watch it to the end and then I was terribly upset with myself for staying up. I tried to give it a chance to unfold the way the story was portrayed in the description- no such luck.I will say that the idea of examining the unraveling of secrets between two seemingly \\"normal\\" people in times of turmoil is an interesting one but it is not presented in the most effective way in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the human mind capable of enjoying an unresolved story?","review":"After watching the film, I \\"studied\\" the interview with the director.I can see what he tried to say and what kinds of films he wanted to make,but I'm just curious to what extent the human mind is capable of handling the obscurity (i.e., not knowing who actually made the videos and delivered them to the couple). I do not think that the audience will be as cognitively active (i.e., being eager to engage in some abstract moral speculation about the protagonist's guilt over his memory or dreams) as the director wants to think. The more the audience want some closure, the worse their reactions will be to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rubbish","review":"Very dissapointing DVD - had great expectations given the cast - the storyline and manner in which it was directed was dismally poor - do not buy this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment For Sure","review":"Thoroughly disappointing film! I'm not a French film scholar, but I am an avid film watcher. Yes, the film is absorbed in portraying the main character's guilt but nothing else. The suffering wife Juliette Binoche isn't guilty of anything, and she never even learns the identity of the voyeur. The tedium in some of the extended tape recording scenes will put you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled, this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen","review":"I saw this movie at a film festival event and I paid way too much money, $20 a ticket, to see the sneak preview. No one at the festival liked it. It was dry and there was only one part that shocked me and it lasted two seconds. It was dry, boring, and unsuspenseful. The ending will also confuse you and give you no resolution. We go for two hours and nothing happens at the end. It's not a creative ending it's just frustrating. If you want to see a good thriller there is a great Hitchcock collection available online and a much better use of your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could put less than 1 star I would...","review":"Save your money. Save your time. This so called \\"artsy fartsey\\" movie is just that, a load of hot farts. Read other reviews for a description of the film. That is *all* that happens. No answers to why they recieved the tapes in the 1st place, no pay off at the end. Do I sound bitter? I am after sitting thru this stinking pile of dung. I feel like the director should be paying me back for the time lost on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring film ever","review":"This was definitely one of the most boring and pointless movies I'vce ever seen. Half-baked does not even beging to describe it. I don't have a PhD in film studies, but as a regular viewer, I can't find any reason to watch this boring and needlessly prolonged movie. I want my rental fee back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope. Not for me.","review":"This is either a movie that's going to grab you and you're going to watch it obsessively for clues or it's...not.I watched about a half hour of it and started scanning and fast forwarding. I'm sure all the ambiguous scenes of cars and people hanging out on streets and empty streets have great meaning and that those that watch the thing for these clues can be shocked and amazed. Frankly, I was just bored silly. The guy is receiving tapes. He's receiving more tapes. He's getting cards. He's having dreams. Someone confronts him. He claims that he doesn't feel guilty. Big deal.The main character can't even yell at an idiot bike messenger without backing down and showing his tail. I hate these characters. I'm bored with their predicament and any tension I might feel is for a world gone mad with love of stupid movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reaches way too far.","review":"I am a huge fan of arthouse cinema, and I was thrilled to rent \\"Cache\\" after hearing all the positive reviews about it.BUT-- Sadly I will have to say that I disagree with all the positive reviews. And here's why:1. Too slow (I love slow paced thrillers like CHILD'S PLAY, THE RETURN but this moved too slow and had no pulse).2. You don't even care about the characters.3. Ripoff of \\"8MM\\"4. No music6. Too many plotholes (the Algerian guy committing suicide, which DID make me jump, but was pointless)7. Terrible camera work!!!!!8. The \\"Chicken Decapitation\\" had nothing to do with the story.So if you want boring, watch this. If you like tension, watch THE RETURN or Ju-On (The curse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"uneven experitment in existensialist film making","review":"This movie was and uneven experiment in one person's movie making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly interesting","review":"The fact that the story is left unresolved isn't particularly an issue for me... In my opinion, the movie is decent, but the plain truth is that it is simply not that interesting. Of course, it is a good premise... basing a film on the human ability to deal with guilt. The writer has chosen a random and mundane situation, I'm sure intentionally, to delve into for the story, but it just isn't all that good. The acting is mediocre, the pace is painfully slow... It's just not right for everyone. I have a high tolerance for a slow-paced film that eventually leads you somewhere, but this movie was slow-paced and led me to a disappointing ending. 2 stars for the idea, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cache","review":"Austrian director and arch provocateur Michael Haneke crafts a compelling, suspenseful thriller in Cache, deftly suggesting the menace of global terrorism by locating it in the troubled domestic experience of an iconic nuclear family. Auteuil and Binoche are both superb as the couple ripped apart by a long-dormant secret that slowly bubbles to the surface when Georges confronts a horrific incident in his early childhood. Haneke really notches up the tension, relieving it (momentarily) in a kitchen scene that will literally steal your breath away. Intelligent, enigmatic, and shocking, Cache is can't-miss cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Statedly uncerebral...","review":"At more than one moment in this film, I was sure the DVD was stuck. The movie just sat there. And that sums it up - the movie just sits there. There is no suspense, or great puzzle to untangle. There is no slow burn. There just slowness. This family is supposed to be wrung with terror. They barely break a sweat debating the if's, and's or but's of their situation. The husband should be shaken to bits by Binoche on more than one occasion, but there's just a lot of dramatic head turning and respectful door closing. Only Majid leaves an impact. The rest is statedly uncerebral."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the paint is dry now","review":"For those who like long, endless shots of the exteriors of buildings. All others should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars I would.","review":"It was slow-moving to the point of ludicrousness. The performances by the actors were all first-rate, but to laud the lack of ending as showing the audience that they should think further on the guilt themes shown in the movie was annoying to say the least. To buildthe suspense slowly over the 2 hours to absolute nothingness was very disappointing, and to praise the director for his failure to be able to wrap up a \\"thriller\\" is the nth degree of putting a positive spin on an overwhelmingly negative outcome.You have better things to do with your evenings than watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welsh Rockers","review":"This is good collection of Man's early efforts. I recommend it if you do not wish to spend a lot on the catalog of work this represents."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Satanic to Pirate Metal","review":"This german band started out as one of the more decent satanic metal bands to come out of Europe in the mid-80s and changed to pirate metal with this album.This album has better recording quality and the guitar riffs aren't as sloppy but the album just falls flat. The title song is the best song on the album and the rest is not really worth listening to. Great album to play if you're having a metal/pirate costume party but otherwise it sounds pretty silly. The pirate motif makes me think of Disneyland's 'Pirates of the Carribean' and the song would have actually been cool on the soundtrack for one of the movies.The band was ok with their earlier satanic stuff but their later pirate motifs never seemed to make them a greater success in the mainstream of metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running Wild's first \\"pirate\\" album is still their worst.","review":"This album was of course Running Wild's transition album. They went from being a terrible band about rebellion through Satanic worship to a fun band about pirates and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, Under Jolly Roger is one of their weakest albums overall. Repetitive choruses, poor riffs, weak solos, and bad overall recording quality make this album a real pain to listen to. Really if you're looking for a good start to your Running Wild collection, start with \\"Pile of Skulls\\" or \\"Black Hand Inn\\". Their sound really didn't become listenable until 1988's \\"Port Royal\\", and didn't become truly legendary until \\"Death or Glory\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just investment analysis, good reading","review":"This book is good reading for investors who want history about the DJIA.

However, he really didn't get into that until about halfway through side two. Most of the tape was his musings about the current situation with the thirty DOW stocks. Unfortunately, it was recorded in 1990! The majority of this tape was hopelessly out of date. A simplified book or tape without all the discussion of the 1990 situation would be far preferrable. Still, the five or ten stock strategies he outlines should comprise a portion of every investor's portfolio."},{"rating":"2","title":"intro to 1 style mechanical (ie. rigid rule based) investing","review":"O'Higgins writes nicely... and identifies with specificity one generally agreeable style of mechanical stock investing... it doesn't particularly work well recently... but it is a useful text to introduce the idea of rule-based (non-emotional) trading decision making. assumptions of money management particularly out of phase with first tier thinking.. but i like the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good trance set from an excellent DJ","review":"Talla2XLC is a very talented DJ.

I was lucky to come off with a deal that allowed me to spend less than three bucks on the CD and shipping, and if you've got a similar situation, $3 and love trance, don't hesitate to get this CD. BUT...If you aren't familiar with trance, stop reading this review right now, tell me I'm 'helpful' and find a more modern mix if you're looking to get into the genre. This album is nothing spectacular, but it does have some solid tracks that manage to sound good years and years after their debut (which is astonishing for any music).

They were putting forth books of prayer in Yiddish; for women were not supposed to learn Hebrew. Seyder Tikhines is one of these, bringing light to women's spiritual daily life. Women also were writing books to help one another live a full and good life. Jewish Publication Society has done a good service in bringing these out now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile","review":"This is a classic Stephen King novel. The only things I found wrong with it is there are too many typos, plot flow logic errors, not to mention Mr. King's propensity to attach supernatural powers onto Negro people. The study of character building is excellent in this novel, as Mr. King is a true master of character building. But I personally closed the book truly disappointed as the finalization is less than admirable for an otherwise enthralling fiction. I am glad I never bought into the serial novel...I would have felt extremely cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a new side of Stephen King!","review":"Why hasn't this book gotten more publicity? It is by far Stephen King's greatest work! He does an outstanding job of developing each character's personality and tackling the very controversial subject of the death penalty in a touching and gut-wrenching way.I started reading Stephen King novels when I was barely a teenager, and my now 56-year old mother always saw his books as a literary weakness of mine. I bought her The Green Mile and made her promise to read it. Begrudgingly, she agreed. Once she started, she could not put the book down.

That is the Stephen King of \\"The Green Mile.\\" Man, what a great story. But why isn't it singing? It can be Deep -- especially in Part 6 -- but it keeps missing the Heights.

This is the case in the book The Green Mile by Stephen King. Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard at Cold Mountain, tells of the year when John Coffey came to the prison.

This book shows how people can find hope in the most unusual situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Away from Horror","review":"I have grown up reading Stephen King's fiction and now it feels as if we have both reached maturity together (myself in reading tastes and King in writing).

I couldn't wait for each month to pass so I could buy the next installment, and the wait was worth it.

I tried to read the Regulators and when I realized what was the cause of the trouble I could predict the rest of the book. THE GREEN MILE on the other hand, puts Stephen King back on track. I thought the characters were well developed, the plot was intricate, and the story was innovative. You were able to empathize with the characters; hate some (The Kid) and love others (the mouse). You are surprized and moved when you understand that Coffee was not as two dimensional as you're initially led to believe. All in all, a great read. Highly recommended.

I must have landed on the Planet Cornball!","review":"King lays on the corn with a trowel in this limp prison drama full of improbable situations and the tinniest dialogue ever written. Anybody expecting another Shawshank Redemption, be warned. A hulking black prisoner out of Amos 'n Andy is found to have mysterious healing powers while a bunch of dull, interchangeable prison guards chatter endlessly about what to do with him. An interminable sequence where they sneak him out of the prison to cure a terminally ill woman of cancer is sappier than Patch Adams. Seeming chapters are spent on a magical mouse with two names, after which King, having written himself into a corner, spends about a half minute to explain why the narrator, the 'bull screw' at the prison and a seemingly 'good man', would allow an innocent man to die in the electric chair. Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Well written page turner.

Still, there is something to be said for the power of the written word when it comes to evoking mental images. In this respect, King is at the top of his game it providing compelling dialog and poetic descriptions. Of the three dozen or so books by him that I have already read, The Green Mile ranks up at the top of the list -- with perhaps Duma Key being the only other title by King that, for me, achieves the same level of pure elegance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is One Of The Best Books of this Century","review":"This was a really good book. It was so good that it only took me 4 days to finish it, I couldn't put it down! It's a very sad book.

I won't tell you what happens to him, you'll have to read it for yourself. It's a very sad but interesting book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile","review":"I saw the movie before reading this book and although I loved the movie, I enjoyed MOST of the book even more. I was completely involved in the characters and interested in what they would do next. I was enchanted by the way King resolved the conflict at the end of the book but felt very strongly that the information shared about \\"the accident\\" at the very end was completely unnecessary and unfairly painful.

I recommend this book to anyone who can stand not to read the last eight pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's best.","review":"In the Green Mile King has a book that is both gripping and dramatic.

The story was captivating from the first paragraph, and the characters were so well drawn I felt as if I knew them personally. King's use of supernatural events owes more to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's \\"magical realism\\" than earlier works like Carrie or Needful Things.The only flaws in the book were the absence of strong female characters (I loved King's Delores Claiborne) and a tendency to be more wordy and repetitive than necessary. This second flaw, however, can be traced to the fact the story was originally serialized and published in six parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Century's Haunting Story","review":"The Green Mile couldn't have been written in any other form.

This book brought me back into the fold. It is poignant, graphic, sobering, and runs the gambit of human emotions. If it doesn't touch one of yours, you must be totally insensitive or dead !

I thought about not reading another one of King's books after this but I'm glad I didn't because he came back strong with Bag of Bones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"It's funny that another reader made the comment that with this book King was not interesting in selling books but making history, but the Green Mile was divided into skimpy, overpriced parts! Not worth the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"I truly hated the book, which biases my opinion. The main character is not believable, and the story is very predictable -- you need not read past the first half of the book to know it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip On This One","review":"The Green Mile was not scary at all! What the horror in the book is about is how cruel and unsensitive (white) men can be. The book was written well and had a lot of surprising twist in the plot but if you look past the smoke screen this is what you'll find... A black man gets convicted for raping and murdering two young white girls, it turns out this black man didn't do it a white racist did. This Black man was no vicious killer, he was a \\"Healer\\" a \\"Gift from God\\" a black man who could never hurt a soul. Stephen King went ALL OUT on this book to portray this wrongly accused BLACK MAN as Jesus, the electric chair his cross, and the white men as Jews to see to it his death sentence would be carried out. If you know the type of garbage I am talking about I wouldn't buy this book, it would probally disgust you as it did with me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Movie","review":"Word up. What the hell is this. Its like a shawshank redemtion(the best movie) with no action. The movie was good, but this was just peer boaring bull. What the hell people saying its good.

I absoulutley loved it and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I simply did not understand the excitement regarding this book. I have heard tremendous things about The Green Mile, and couldn't wait to read it. When it was put into one book, I started it with great enthusiasm. Only to be completely disappointed. Where was the suspense. Where was the surprise. Where was anything. I am a very big Stephen King fan, more of his non-horror writing than anything else. So when I heard of a non-horror King book getting great reviews, visions of Shawshank and The Body and Eyes of the Dragon were on my mind. This just didn't measure up. I am wondering if I missed something or maybe my excpectations were too high, becuase after finishing it I thought there must be a 7th part somewhere. It just lacked."},{"rating":"1","title":"King at his WORST and that's the TRUTH","review":"The only reason that I can give for submitting a '4' for my rating of the Green Mile is the fact that once again King has found a way to suck his fans pockets dry. Why did he stretch this series out only to let it end with such a weak ending? I know the answer and it has to do with George Washington. Blaine the Train is not nearly the pain that King is becoming to my bank account by dealing us such trash as this. I do however think Mr. King is one of the greatest writers of our times. I also believe he has finally become a victim of the almighty dollar and believes he's worth more than the word he writes which has got to be his biggest mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAWN FLANIGAN'S REVIEW OF THE GREEN MILE","review":"THIS WAS A RELLY GOOD BOOK.

The way Mr. King, invites you through a time hole back to a past memory of human nature. From the beginning my emotions were charged and tested as to weather I should continue down the road Mr. King laid before me. The content was gripping and the story very interesting.

It's one of the best novelsthat Stephen King has ever written. The Green Mile takesyou on a journey into the human soul. No other authorcaptivates the heart, spirit, and corruption of the humansoul better than Stephen King does. The idea of sixmonthly installments was very creative.

There were even a few that would not let me stay at home alone at night. But, never have there been tears until I read The Green Mile. John Coffey,Paul,Billy and even Percy were more realistic to me then the usual demons and strange occurrences in his other novels.

A well paced, well written story with a very human feel to it. As good as the movie version of this story was, the book is even better. And readers will be sure to enjoy the serial cliffhangers at the end of each installment. I would definitely list this in the top 5 of King's works with The Stand being number 1.This is another of King's works that I recommend to friends who do not like horror fiction but want to find out why everyone is so crazy over Stephen King. Others include The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and Dolores Claiborne. Also, be sure to read On Writing for some of King's insights into the story of the Green Mile and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is so beautiful","review":"This book is just fabulous.Not what a lot of people expect from the guy that wrote Maximum overdrive but his true fans know he has a very emotional side.One of the few books I cried while reading.And i NEVER cry.The story is just so original and breathtaking that it can't be fully described here.The only resemblence to Shawshank... is the fact its abut prison.Nothing else.Other than being a tearjerking epic,it also changed my mind about a lot of things including the death penalty.After I read this I realized how terrible it is.Just read the book.You will never forget this touching story of how miracles can be found in places you would never expect.King's finest(and thats saying a lot!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was amazing.

However the reader at first dosen't recognize this until later in the book when John Coffey heals Paul Edgecombe's Penile inffection. It is also concluded that John Coffey was a soft man but at the same time a very large man. As time progess John Coffey is latet electricuted and sent onto the paths of enlightment.The Important scene:The most important scene in the book was when John Coffey had touched Paul Edgecombe and showed him what truly happened.Recommendations:i would recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and a book full of action and out burst. This book is full of surprises. I s also better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can Only Give it 5 Stars?","review":"The Green Mile can be described in one word: AWESOME. Classic, amazing, terrific also do the same job. It's the story of a series of inmates on Death Row in the south during the great depression. Stephen King was at the top of his game in 1996, especially after publishing The Green Mile, Desperation, and the sixth Bachman Book, The Regulators. They're all really good, too bad The Dark Tower 4 and Bag of Bones were wastes of paper... hopes he writes some more awesome books."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"This novel is pure genius!

Even though I have seen countless moives on his books. This book had certain parts in it that brought emotions to the suface I never knew I had.It really made me think about what life is like on Death role. Also the aspect that some people are not guilty is a great thing to think about. This book made me cry of happy tears and sad ones. Such a great book as this will never be forgotton.

With every page I read I continued to like this book more and more. It is about a man named Paul Edgecombe who works in section E at Cold Mountain prison facility. It is called the green mile because of the faded green linolium floor, leading to \\"Old Sparky\\", the electric chair. One day, a giant black man named John Coffey- like the drink but not spelled the same- comes to E block for a disturbing and vile crime. In this cold dank prison Paul Edgecomba is about to discover the terrible and wonderful truth about John Coffey.This book is more suspense then horror, and is an excellent read for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"These books were not what I would call smashing, raging, magnifisent, but they were were still ok.

Mr. King helps you to develop emotions (good and bad) for most of the major characters involved in the story, which is always a nice touch.There some parts of the book that you really have to work your way uphill, but those parts are few and always serve a purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most moving Stephen King I have ever read!","review":"Out of all the books I have ever read by Mr. King, short and long, this is the most heart breaking, most moving, and most emotional yet. I have never cried at the end of a novel, but I must admit, this was a tear jerker. Through his wonderful story telling and great details you are able to actually feel like you are there, get to know everyone personally (even build your own emotions of them), even become attached to Mr. Jingles, the mouse. This is a must read for everyone who loves horror, realism, suspence, and a good tear jerker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding work of fiction","review":"In our opinion \\"The Green Mile\\" by Stephen King is one of the greatest books we've ever read! He is a genious in creating a certain tension and suspense in atmosphere so that the reader can exactly imagine the scenery. As far as language is concerned the book isn't very demanding and the stylistic devices used by King are easy to comprehend. But those two items can't reduce the breathtaking character of this captive novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining","review":"When I think of King I think of horror and having personally had my fill of the horror genre phase I never even considered the series. However, when I saw they made a movie based on the novel and it starred Tom Hanks I took a second look. Like The Shawshank Redemption it was a prison novel. I happened to find The Shawshank Redemption an excellent movie - too bad it only did $28 million in theatres because it's one of the best movies ever made. King does an excellent job of taking you back to the Depression Era and I couldn't help but see Tom Hanks as the lead throughout the book. It's an entertaining story and hard to put down and King introduces some thought-provoking concepts however - they're not life-changing. It's a good read but not a novel I feel compelled to re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie","review":"I never read the book, but I did see the movie and it was the bomb!

It takes place in 1932 at Cold Mountain Penn., and is narrated decades later by a very lovable old man named Paul. This book is a mixture of murder,mystery,magic and of course horror. Every part of the six part novel was extremely surprising at every turn. Kings developed every character superbly by going in depth into every character, one can't help but feel as though he is actually there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I read this when it first came out - it was released in chapter form - I'd buy it the day it came out, then have to wait a month for the next \\"installment\\"It's one of the absolute best books Stephen King has ever written"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Mile is so long...but so good","review":"Paul Edgecomb and his fellow prison guards are profoundly changed when John Coffey, a hulking inmate charged with the murders of two little girls, takes up residence on the Death Row wing where they work and astonishes them all with his extraordinary abilities.Stephen King has written a powerful novel about decent people coping with the pain and existential terror of mortality. Paul may be the most likeable first-person narrator I have ever encountered in a work of fiction, and his basic goodness is appreciated as a filter for the very bleak view of existence presented here. He and his little band counter both the horror they see all around them and the implacability of death with simple kindness. The rambling, expansive style of storytelling King employs presents a fully realized world within a richly detailed Depression-era setting. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Read","review":"I loved this movie and did not realize it was a Stephen King book till recently. I am not a fan of horror but after his latest release of11/22/63I went back and gave this author another look.

It was an excellent read and extremely well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful storytelling","review":"I normally associate King with horror (\\"Christine,\\" \\"The Shining,\\" \\"The Dark Half,\\" etc), and I'm sure most people do too. That being said, I can't put this into the \\"horror\\" category -- to me, it's almost as if Hitchcock's psychological horror/thriller genre was put on paper. This novel, written as a series of almost-short-stories that tie together with common characters and theme, is an interesting read. If you're expecting the movie in book form, forget it. The characters in the movie were complex, yes, but nothing compared to those that King has created in print form. If you've seen the movie, that's pretty much the synopsis of the novel; however, the novel explains a great deal of the story behind the characters (What was Del's crime? What happened to Percy after he \\"went mad\\" and was sent away?). King's work is a great examples of masterful storytelling, with flashbacks merging seamlessly into the present, all the while tying together characters and plot. A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a less than exciting novel","review":"I found the book to be extremely redundant.It did paint a good mental movie, but rambled on too much for my liking.If you like a good ending in a book I would not suggest reading this Stephen King novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm amazed that I'm the only one who dislikes this book.","review":"Okay, so it's not the worst I've ever read. It still ranks far below standard Stephen King. Instead of the killer plots he usually has, this book just wanders without a real point (most likely because he was writing it in parts with a two week deadline for each). This book focuses on its characters, which I guess is good for some people, but it's not Stephen King. There's no real climax at all in this book. Just one man's struggle with his conscience. If that sounds good to you, then by all means, buy it. But if it doesn't, don't believe the other reviews. This is not standard Stephen King. Don't say I didn't warn you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what all the excitement was about","review":"Its a good read, but not that great. The story just didn't connect with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been a 5","review":"Stephen King out did himself on this one. The book is a little over five hundered pages long! That is way too long. If King cut out about one hundered pages of repeat it could've been a 5. Although it was a little long the book still managed to have a great story. I especially enjoyed the way he designed his characters to make you feel what they are going through and how they really feel. He made us want to get up on our feet and fight for John Coffey, made us want to kill Percey and feel for Paul who knew what really happend to those poor little girls. Another thing I enjoyed was the book compared to the movie, the book really adds a lot of detail you just don't find in the movie. All in all it was a great book minus the enormous length of the book I would give it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUCHING, INSPIRING, AND UNFORGETTABLE","review":"When I first saw the trailer for the movie, I knew that my friend and I would be first in line to see it. And after seeing the movie (too many times to be sure of), I knew that I HAD, no....that it was imperative that I read this novel. I had never read any of Stephen King's other novels, but of course I've seen the movies (Cujo, Carrie, Misery, etc....). All I know is that this book is one of those cliche - \\"couldn't put it down\\" books. I was always curious about what would happen next. Even though I had seen the film first, I could picture no one else playing the characters. I could see every character and every situation so vividly. Great description, emotional plot, and lovable characters. I cried my eyes out at the end of both the movie and this book. I was not able to put it down, and you won't be able to either."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL BOOK!!!","review":"I've heard about Stephen King writing fantastic books and wanted to see for my self how good this author really is. I chose \\"The Green Mile\\" because I heard heard the movie was great. I havent seen the movie yet but the book was excellent. It opened my eyes to all the injustices going on in the world. King used many writing techniques includeing forshadowing and flashbacks. The whole story was just set up beautifully. i read this 536 page novel in about 11 days! I wouldnt recommend it if you've seen the movie. The element of suspense is vital to the enjoyment of this book. It will bring tears to your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard It was good","review":"I did not read the book but heard it was very good. Based on the movie, it should be a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try this again","review":"Stephen King suffers from successful writer syndrome. Like many other popular writers, he believes that each successive book requires less editing, that everything he writes is Shakespeare. Thus we get long, boring books that cost a fortune. So what am I to make of the Green Mile? This page turner is written as a challenge, and Steve seems invigorated by it. The prose is mostly sharp, and the book is a quick breezy read. I liked it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cheers For King !!!","review":"Well I must say that when it comes to Stephen King you usually know what your getting...a good read.But with the latest installment in the King terror dome I believe people are going to find a masterpiece thats not Kings usuall style. From the moment you open this book to the long(and lucrative) awaited final installment in the series,King will have your emotions in his bare hands as he takes you on a mystical journey through the eyes of Paul Edgecombe and the tears of a Monstrosity named John Coffey,buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the most moving books that I have ever read!","review":"I could not believe how great this book was when I read it.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the movie, you need to read the book!","review":"Stephen King has proven time after time that he is one of the all-time best writers of fiction. The Green Mile is further evidence of that. This book is phenomenal. Even though I had seen the movie several times, this book kept me turning the pages as if I didn't know the story at all. There are no big surprises in the storyline, but the depth of the characters and the vivid descriptions gives a fresh look at an awesome story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my God.","review":"Let me first say that when Coffey took the Walk, I cried. Like a baby, tears rolling down my cheeks like there was no end to them.I've never seen the movie. I have no desire to, absolutely not. It will ruin my perception of this wonderful, extraordinary novel. I started it this morning at 9:30 a.m. Being the incredibly lazy and engrossed person I am, I just finished it now. At 11:30 p.m. I didn't stop to eat or sleep or take a shower. I just laid in bed and read this book. Please, for my sake, go buy it. I won't rest until I can discuss it with everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King's Best Novel......EVER!","review":"As a fan of King, I have come to enjoy his wonderful story-telling ability. As an English student, I respect his use of plot, character and setting. This novel has all of this and more. The story is so thought-provoking and the narrator is so reliable that you agree with everything he does and says. He seems like your grandfather. In any event, buy this book.

Yes, Stephen King is an amazing author for thr horror genre, but I feel that The Green Mile tops them all. It's compelling and it will grip onto your heart and dig it's fingers in until the very last page. A must read for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Mile by Stephen King","review":"First, I must admit that this was the first Stephen King novel I ever read.My daughter likes horror stories, which I don't, and asked me to buy some Stephen King. I found Green Mile at a bookstore in Tokyo, and bought it back home. Before giving it to her, I started reading. Soon I couldn't stop reading and when I finihed it, I was so deeply impressed that I didn't feel like to read any other book for a while. As far as this novel is concerned, he is never a king of horror or grotesque but a superb observer of human nature with deeper philosophical and, in many ways, quite warm eyes on people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Goood","review":"This novel was wonderful because of the way that it depicted a man wrongfully accused. John Coffey a man wrongfully accused of a gruesome crime. In the end was the best part of the book when Coffey talked about all of the hate in the world. It was very sad when he died, but it made a lesson for all of the characthers in the book. I really loved how Stephen King did descriptions of characthers like Percy and the orderlie that harassed Paul and Elaine and Paul's wife. The comparisons were very well written and it was like you could see each characther as a living being.I would recommend this book because not only does it keep you in suspense, but it is inspiring. In the end, I cried because of what happened, but it is still inspiring for the reason that it happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Moving Books of our Time","review":"I have read three or four of Stephen King's books and his writings are just not my cup of tea. However, I loved this book! John Coffey has a way of making you feel not just humble but of making you hold the simple things in life in awe. We should all have the opportunity to meet a John Coffey in real life, if only for a few moments. There are parts of the book which evoke so much emotion that it is difficult to read. At the same time, it is a book that, once finished, you will never forget. Buy it or borrow it but definitely read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Magic!","review":"This was the first Stephen King book I have read and I can honestly say that it was one of the best. The story of John Coffey was absolutely heartbreaking, and made it hard for me to put the book down. I am now a Stephen King fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best king book ever!!!!!!!!","review":"At first, this book was not very good, but then i got to the second installment. I was amazed by the time I read the second book I could not put the book down. I read one installment each day( I got this book 2 years after the release, dont ask me why)I was so addicted. In the last installment, the story was so deep I was close to tears. Take it from his number 1 fan, this book is a must read!!!!! Peace out"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It was the most moving book I've read in years...\\"","review":"Stephen King has finally done it. He moved me to tears...not from being terrified...but from the absolute beauty and depth of this book. The way he created John Coffey, and made the reader realize that there's so much truth in the saying that \\"not everything is what it seems\\", was fantastic. I think everyone could learn something from this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid King","review":"The Green Mile catches King in great form. Prison seems to bring out the best in King(?)and this book is no exception. Well-drawn characters, an excellent plot and some good King surprises make for a fun read. Only the predictability of many events lessens the impact, if you have read King you generally know where he's going. A welcome addition to the King collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think in more ways than one, good overall.","review":"This book made me think about the things people could do if they were able to use their entire brain. I think Coffey had an ability to use the other 90% of his brain. I have heard theories in which people feel that if that were possible, people would be capable of limb regeneration, etc. This book is about life on death row during the depression, but I feel King uses that setting because it symbalizes the mind being caged. I'm sure everyone gets a different spin from this book, but it opens your mind to new possibilties. I recommend this to people with open minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King shows once again that he is an excellent author","review":"I was extremely amazed when I found out that Stephen King does not only limit himself to writing horror novels! The Green Mile is an excellent book that gives an explicit detail on what happened on \\"the Mile\\". Delacroix's death is a great example. I almost felt as if I were in the group of spectators that were watching him fry. King did a magnificent job on creating John Coffey. This big man with a heart of gold. One of God's greatest creations. While watching the movie, I felt like I knew which character was which, based on the descriptions of them in the novel. The Green Mile is definitely one of my favorite books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"Green Mile is a winner. Whenever King does a prison story you know it's going to be special. The Mile is one of the saddest most heart breaking novels King has ever written. I defy anybody who reads it not to hope that there's some way John Coffey can be saved. Is there horror? Oh yes. The young villain in this story is one of the nastiest King's ever created and one of the scariest becuase men like him walk our streets every day. The characters both good and evil are all strong and all come to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed theory, great as a reference","review":"The book is very descriptive in the area of theory but less so in the area of fully worked problems in use as a classroom textbook. The organization of the book material from one topic to another could be better.The second edition of the book is about the same as the first exept for the introduction of a website about the book and a cd-rom with slides and sample programs for electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comprehensive","review":"I am an undergrad and I think this is a great introductory book. It is extremely comprehensive and detailed. I highly recommend it if you really want to learn the material in detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Just what I was looking for. Could not find a hair dryer with this wattage. Others are much too hot for my curly hair. Love this one and it's a great size for traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications","review":"This a very good book to people that is starting the studies in quantum mechanics, although the book has some mistakes in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me make it through undergrad quantum","review":"We were assigned Gasiorowitz as our textbook, and without Zettili I wouldn't have understood anything.This book explains the material clearly and then offers ample examples to help the reader learn how to apply the concepts to quantitative problems.The only problem I have with this book is that there are errors in the worked problems, but these are usually easy to catch and are to be expected with a first edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love This Coffee Maker!","review":"When I first saw this coffeemaker on Amazon.com. There was no reviews. But, by design the T-Fal coffeemaker takes care of two problems I realy don't like about other drip coffeemakers. That is dumping drippy filter baskets and dripping water as you pour water into the reservoir. I love the look of the design, it's not the average booring look on the counter. It works great! My husband bought this coffeemaker for me and we like it so much we bought another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I simply love this coffee maker. I would like to find another one as back up in case this one goes. I ordered this coffee maker off of Amazon years ago and still love it! I guess the biggest positive with me is you don't use the coffee pot to fill the water reservoir, being not fully awake while I make coffee tends to make me accident prone. I have broken many coffee pots while filling them. I know, I am clumsy. No need to worry about that with this coffee maker, the water holder is plastic! I also like that you can take the pot out while the coffee is brewing and pour yourself a cup of joe, since I need mine now! You can also set the timer on the coffee maker and have it brewing, then it can be ready when you get up in the am. Nice perk! The only negative is that it is big. We have ours on a microwave type stand and it sits alone. Still LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CoffeeMaker","review":"This is a great coffeemaker. It has real style and makes good coffee. I love the carafe, it doesnt leak and I've had mine quite a long time now with no problems at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool looking but thats where the cool ends.","review":"I bought one of these cool looking coffee makers and it quit working two weeks later.The clock went all wacky and the buttons quit working and so I couldn't even get it to make any coffee at all. A complete waste of my money, no wonder they where on sale for $14.99, its not even worth that much money. I should have stuck with the old reliable Mr. Coffee, at least they work a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Great price, great product!","review":"I bought this when it was on a Friday Sale, $5.99!! It looks great on my counter, makes super coffee, is the easiest coffee maker to clean and my friends want to know where I got it, they all want one! Great buy. A++"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 1990's Concert Years","review":"This is a gem recording of the standard Sandi Patty concert format of the 1990's (family members make a special appearance in this concert). It starts with the inspirational pop praise medley and concludes with the Passion medley. The most sparkling moments are the recitation of \\"Sam's Rainbow\\" and the final encore of the concert: the song from Sandi's duet album with Kathy Tricolli (\\"Together\\") \\"The Last Days\\" which is a touching reminder of why Sandi Patty is utterly unique in Christian music and why there will never be anyone quite like her in Gospel music: She is an authentic, talented performer.More than WonderfulSongs for the Journey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While I think Sandi Patti is the best female vocalist in the world, this particular CD really disappointed me. When Sandi sings, she's wonderful as always. However, there was so much talking and the one song with Brian just totally took my husband and I by surprise. I had bought this CD for myself and also to copy to a cassette for my Mother for Christmas, but I gave up on that idea once I listened to it. The one thing I learned from this experience is that I will stay away from CDs that say LIVE! I am still a huge fan of Sandi Patti and will continue to buy her CDs, but this one for me,unfortunately, was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This book is good for the author's first. I expected to be bored as this was my first futuristic romance but i was wrong. you can't miss this!Leonessa dan Ranul has seizures n a limp. Her people despises her but she volunteers to be a live host for the orana virus. Wishing that she will be accepted again by them, she travels to sonama. unfortunately, her spaceship breaks down and a shadower reluctantly rescues her. They find a passion between them, but as Chase (the shadower) delays the trip, she must find a way to escape and get to sonama befors the orana destroys her body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking! I can't wait for Ms. Spangler's next book!","review":"Shielder is a must read for romance fans! I fell in love with Nessa and Chase from the get go. This book has it all: Non-stop Action. Emotional intensity. And sizzling passion. I anxiously await Ms. Spangler's next release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Romance, bad Sci-Fi","review":"I have read 3 books out of the series now (Shielder, Shadower, and Shamara) and I have the 4th one on my bedside table, to be read tonight. Love the books inspite of the bad science. In fact, I find the bad science highly amusing. While sci-fi authors typically think of tricks to deal with problems like gravity, communications and time-debt, this authors handles them by pretending they don't exist. In this universe you can travel between planets in 2 or 3 days. All aliens speak the same language and can reproduce with each other. A tracking device attached to a space vehicle works all the way across the galaxy. And best of all the universe is populated by approximately 12 people who are all conveniently related to each other or continually run into each other by happy coincidence! It's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible cover for a Horrible book","review":"I did not like this book! It has I must admit a great plot. It's about an outcast, Nessa, and a shadower ((bounty hunter)) Chase. Nessa Volunteers to carry a deadly virus that has been killing scores of her people, to a medical base, but her ship breaks down and she gets picked up by Chase. She then tries to let him take her as close to the medical base as possible without arising suspicion. For he is an enemy to her people and if he knew who she was he would take her prisoner. I loved the plot, but couldn't stand the way Nessa was so unsure of herself. Yes everyone is insecure at times, but this was taking it to another level. She never thought of herself as beautiful and couldn't believe till the end of the book how Chase could be attracted to her. She kept asking herself how Chase could want someone like her. I believe that if a person thinks of himself as worthy others will too. So I just hated her long, continuous doubts. Other than that the book was ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"pokemon, their so........","review":"thunder shock and seaside pikachu... yet another chapter in the never ending pokemon chronicles. in thunder shock, ash goes to vermillion city to challange lt. surge to a pokemon battle. he wants to evolve his pikachu so he can beat lt.surge's raichu, but then he realizes he can beat him with his pikachu by using it's speed. and he wins with that pikachu like he always does. and in seaside pikachu, all of the gang go on a cruise on the st. anne. it sinks. and they (and team rocket)are the only ones still on the boat, after it sinks. but don't worry, all will prevail in the end. if you buy these movies, you will see a few hours of adorable pokemon. man, these things are so cute ... that's how cute they are. two stars for keeping the kids quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"I can't believe i'm writing a review about a Daz Dillinger C.D and i'm not giving it at least 4 stars. I think Daz is a very underrated and under used Rapper/Producer, but on this album he did'nt get the formula right. This is the same man who has produced some of Snoop Doggs, 2pac's, Dogg Pound's biggest hits but this album has no stand out cuts. Usually a Daz album has at least one big hitter that you listen to over and over but this album is filled with mellow cuts and cuts using samples from other artists.

I have used Neotech straps ever since they first came out, but it had been a few years since I purchased one. However, upon opening it and putting it on, it felt nothing at all like they used to. It seemed very cheaply put together, and almost like they left off the inner & outer layer of material. They were kind of spongy & bouncy, thus their claim of reducing the feel of the weight of the horn. Well this feels stiff, has very little cushioning, and will take quite a while to actually sit on my neck, as it is now so stiff, it just wants to remain straight. I am very, very disappointed in this, Neotech's quality has gone way down hill, and I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Quality and Delivered Without Packaging","review":"I'm giving the Neo Tech saxophone strap only 2 stars because the one I purchased and received came without any packaging and doesn't seem to be as well made as the Rico Padded Sax Strap (which are both the same price).

You can play hours without feeling sore on your neck and back, somehow this strap makes your sax feel lighter, the foam material it is made of doesn't scrapes the back part of your neck after a while playing, and the hook is awesomely safe, much better than the open ones.The only thing that would have made this product a 5 star one in my opinion is it to be lined of some material, I'm worried the foam part may get torn or something, hope I'm wrong =)Overall, a wonderful strap, best of the market I believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Uncomfortable","review":"I found this to be irritating to my neck because of its width - the edges dug into my neck.

Big mistake. This book stomps on the corpse of one of America's premier writers. I am no big Hemingway fan, but I hoped this book would discuss the man's life and put it into the larger context of his place in the world of literature and the world at large. Instead, I got a load of psychobabble from a history professor with an obvious chip on his shoulder against Hemingway. This Hemingway bio, which ends on the very page after Ernest puts a shotgun to his head, with next to no explication or discussion of consequences, is seriously lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynn on Hemingway.","review":"This is a very coherent, thought-provoking study of Hemingway, especially of his formative years. The recurring theme is that Hemingway's worldview was shaped by mother's penchant for dressing him and his sister in matching clothes. Individual gender roles were ambiguous and not as important as the conflict between a person and his internal animal nature. Hemingway is seen as over-asserting his own masculinity by drinking heavily, treating women as subservient to his own needs, performing dangerous sports, but instead this may be his own lifelong study of this battle between societal roles and nature. Like others who studied this conflict before him, such as Mark Twain, James Joyce, and Joseph Conrad, Hemingway became jaded in his old age, believing that society was not serving mankind equally.As expected, there is a lot of information about writing processes, and his relationship with writers like Joyce, Gertrude Stein, and others, and the influence of Henry James and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hemingway:Life and Work","review":"Book is really beat up and worn out with a lot more marks and damage then described.

You can read the entire book, as I did, and discover not one redeemable thing about Hemingway, amazing since he is still considered one of the most important writers of the 20th century, one who formed many lasting friendships over the years while he was changing the course of American literature.Lynn is one of those critics who, as one writer put it, is like the partisans who come down out of the mountains after the battle and shoot the wounded. Lynn's analysis of the effect that Hemingway's mother had on her son by dressing him in girls' clothes in his youth is laughable, nickel psychology that would embarrass Lucy in Peanuts.I heard Hemingway's son Patrick at the Oak Park centennial celebration of Hemingway's birth describe Lynn as, simply, \\"a liar.\\" I'm inclinded to agree.Read Michael Reynolds' bio instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puddles the Duck","review":"Puddles the Duck is an adorable Ty Pluffie.

My favorite tracks are \\"Mi Perspectiva\\" \\"Escucha Atento\\" \\"Bendecida Pasion\\" \\"Tan Importante\\" and \\"Amar Completamente\\".

I read the directions, but one of the two blenders NEVER WORKED AT ALL, no matter how the jar was \\"seated\\" or the blades installed or the number of \\"clicks\\" heard when putting the blade component together. I took that one back. The other one worked about 6 times, and THEN went dead while blending already-crushed ice and mango juice! So much for the superior power and the special ice-crushing blades!

It is sharp enough to pierce even the crustiest loaf of bread without having to smash the loaf, and then saws through the inside neatly, leaving flat surfaces on both sides. It is easy to keep clean and I love the look of the brushed aluminum handle.I only have two complaints: when I'm trying to cut through the bottom crust of my bread, the knife also cuts into my (cheap, plastic IKEA) cutting board and leaves marks. No stars off for that, it's my own fault and I should buy a wood block so that the marks won't bother me! The second complaint that I have is just that it doesn't come with a sheath of any kind. I had to fashion my own in order to store it in the drawer without risk cuts/dulling the blade. For the price though, maybe I shouldn't have expected that.

Both got my attention right away. Averaging two loaves of home made bread per week for all these years has been a snap not only to cut the bread but also to slice it from end to end uniformity and professionally.Some have said the handle is to small to get leverage, their problem is understanding, no serious hand pressure is necessary, simply place the knife at point of desire, apply slight downward pressure followed by gentle but short back and forth motion.It this knife won't do the job for you, you may want to stay away from sharp things altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife for the money","review":"Low price seemed too good to be true, but I tried the knife anyway.

I intend to always store it in its cardboard packaging sheath since the serrated edge can't be resharpened.I also bought a used heavy plastic bread slicing form since good ones are no longer being manufactured. I guess automatic bread makers aren't as popular as they were only about 10 years ago. The knife is just as good for any kind of unsliced bread like French, Italian and the round loaves. Oops, isn't slicing French bread supposed to be \\"gauche\\" ? Excuse my French (bread)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"I see I'm in the minority here, but I'm really not happy with this knife at all. The blade is okay, but the handle is much too short and thin for me to hold comfortably and control the knife while slicing. It needs to be much beefier.

The one in the bathroom I shared with my brother is still going after three years, no apparent water damage from showers/baths (and the fan in that bathroom doesn't work so well.) I can only recall one time when the battery needed changing, so it must last awhile. Easy functionality, I would change the clock to the seconds mode and use that as a sort of timer to brush my teeth. I've seen no problems with this clock keeping correct time.

Wrong! Carol Miller demystifies a fascinating country, rich in culture and history, and probably the single most definitive force in shaping the development of the West. Syria was at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and the Mesopotamian worlds, then later of emerging Islam and declining Byzantium, and no less important, the clash of Christians and Muslims during the Crusades, a battle many are still fighting, at least in their heads. This book will dissipate the ignorance, inspire admiration, and no less important, fill the reader with admiration for Miller's research and writing style. A worthy gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tool for Home School Instructors","review":"This is a great book that I relied on heavily in teaching my sons to read.

If there was an issue you could soak it in soap/water. But it is not recommended to put it in the dishwasher.Even following their directions I never felt it was clean enough and always carried a coffee smell in the lid, even after washed (I don't add any sugar or cream). I returned it and got theContigo AutoSeal Westloop Mug.The top of their travel cup is designed to go in the dishwasher and it actually keeps the coffee hotter for longer (and it's 2oz bigger!).

I tried soaking it in boiling water with dish soap and other things suggested in the reviews here, I even stuck it in the dishwasher several times, against the directions it came with because I was so frustrated with it.

Ok, so save the last sip for when you are stopped.And when stopped you had better CLEAN the mug. Not later, not back at home, but ASAP.It really cannot be cleaned at all inside that wonderful top that prevents leaks. Whatever you drink will build up a smelly, thick, residue that will ruin anything you dare drink from this mug.Aside from the potenital germs and mold will develop it will ruin the taste of good coffee or tea.It is slick, and handy, and easy to use.

There's a little tea left for a small cup at home or lately I pour more hot water over the tea leaves and fill another travel mug for the car.I have complete trust that the OXO mug will not leak in my briefcase or if it goes pitching out of the cupholder in the car.

My lid has a gross funky smell, even though I always wash it after every use and have tried soaking it in detergents. The fact that it can't be cleaned makes it unhygenic, and also makes drinks taste nasty if you drink more than one thing from the mug.Only buy this mug if you will drink only one beverage from it that has no milk in it AND you will always be able to clean it soon after use AND no dripping is the only thing you want from a mug AND you don't mind a little extra gunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"nasty film with regular use","review":"After using this mug for several months, I began noticing that my coffee wasn't flowing through the sip-hole easily and I wondered what was wrong.

I cleaned for at least half an hour and was still getting nasty congeled crud out of the lid. Even so, I don't believe it is fully clean.

I dutifully scrubbed it by hand after each use, making sure to rinse the lid thoroughly. Despite my efforts, I began noticing what I can only describe as The Stench -- a heave-inducing mix of old coffee, old milk, old whatever else I put in there. No amount of cleaning removed The Stench. I tried rinsing with vinegar, soaking in soapy water, etc. Every now and then I would take the mug out of the cupboard, hoping The Stench had dissipated, but it was still there.Then I read other reviews on Amazon about finding filthy globs of mildewy muck inside the lid, and in one case...maggots!

The one I got as a gift 1 year ago has leaked often since day 1. On some days it holds coffee no problem, on other days it will spew coffee from underneath the black plastic band/rim, running down the sides. Not to mention I almost ingested a large, gunky clot that had released from the inner chambers of the lid a few days ago, causing me to finally write this review. I will buy a more simple mug soon, one that doesn't leak and doesn't have obvious hygiene issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A too-fragile lid","review":"A few points to consider about the lid, besides it being impossible to clean: The top button pushes down a wide plunger to seal off the fluid from leaking out of the sip spout, but the button mechanism is molded to the plunger by a 3/16\\" post, which easily broke when I accidentally dropped it in my effort to clean the lid. The result? A good travel mug, comfortable to hold, with a screw-top sippy lid with a sealing plunger that broke off, somewhat defeating the purpose of the mug's \\"leak-proof-ness.\\" I should also say that there was some (very minor) dripping even when it was new and unbroken. My guess is that there are better designed, less fragile, options for a similar price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsanitary","review":"When I first purchased this mug, I was very pleased: it didn't leak or drip and an added bonus -- it actually kept the coffee hot, not just warm. However, I realized that it was quite difficult to clean, especially if it sat empty in my car all day. I purchased a baby bottle nipple brush to try to get inside the spout (actually I tried two different nipple brushes) and really wasn't too pleased. I soaked the lid at night and did the best I could. Then one morning as I was traveling at 65 mph along the interstate, I took a sip of coffee. As I was returning the mug to the cup holder next to me, I glanced down and saw little tiny somethings on the top of my mug. Because I was driving, I could only glance and I thought I detected that the little tiny somethings were moving. When I stopped and was able to take a good look I realized that the little tiny somethings were some kind of worms..YUK. The mug was a breeding ground for maggots. DISGUSTING!

Because this cup has no handle, there is no need to align the lid opening with the handle. It also has an excellent closing mechanism that prevents leaks. The only disadvantage is that the cup is not wide enough at the top to allow you to reach the bottom to wash it without a bottle brush, unless you have a very small hand. However, the cover of the cup is easy to thoroughly clean because you can easily untwist and remove the closing mechanism to clean underneath it.

Well once I really started inspecting the underside of the cap, only then did I realize the amount of buildup of two years of GUNK! It was absolutely disgusting. Because it was such a small area, I had to use an eyeglass screwdriver to scrape the stuff out - after about ten minutes of scraping layers of gunk out, I finally soaked it in really hot water - only for more gunk to loosen up!I have been VERY consistent with giving this mug a good wash every night - but there is no easy way to clean up the underneath and what you end up with are many layers of who knows what - absolutely nasty.I will miss my mug and the convenience of having hot coffee for awhile after the pour, and the spillproof techonology, but I will be going back to a much simpler design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Clean","review":"I used this mug for several years - until I realized that the inside of the lid cannot be cleaned.

If it is even a tiny bit loose it will leak. I learned this the hard way twice. Yes I said twice because it sometimes is really hard to tell if it is fully tight.(2) on my latest mug the button on top get stuck about 35% of the time. Not a deal breaker but kinda annoying. When it gets stuck I have to figure out how to hit the button just right.BTW -- I run both the mug an drop through the dishwasher every night and it is clean as a whistle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another design flaw","review":"OXO fixed the flaq that made it hard to clean and thus unhygienic.

I'd never considered checking Amazon for reviews on it, but I'm really glad I did because I threw out my first one, noticing the smell was a bit off in the lid. I thought it was just getting old and I wasn't washing it enough. Today while washing my stainless steel mug, I poked around in the bottom seal area with a wooden coffee stirrer and found (like many other people) lots of black-brown gunk. Wonder if this is why I've been sneezing more at work.... I used to rave about this mug to all my coworkers too!

I was so impressed with the design of the lid (spill proof and push button easy open/close) that even though I thought . . . hmmmm . . . how can I clean this lid effectively so there is no build up, I soon discovered you cannot. I read a post on November 3 that OXO has redesigned the lid so you are able to take it apart to clean effectively. I hope this is true because I love my OXO mug but not at the expense of 'taking in' all the gunkies that build up in the lid. BTW, I too noticed recently that the coffee was coming out slower and slower and when I read post where another user experienced the same thing and she gave details of why this was happening, I thought ohhhhh . . . then felt sick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsanitary, therefore unusable","review":"The liquid flow kept getting slower and slower.

While I had it, it was great. The mug sealed tight, kept coffee hot a long time, fit in my bicycle bottle cage, and performed flawlessly. The lid was a bit frustrating to clean, but I cleaned it religiously every day and didn't have any problems. I would leave the lid open and brush it bottom and top with soapy water, then run hot water through it for 10 seconds or so.It was a great mug, now I have to replace it. Maybe I'll wait for the rumored easier to clean replacement from Oxo later this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be 5 stars if I could clean the lid","review":"This cup would probably work really well if you use it for clear beverages. It is NOT good for coffee if you take milk or creamer as there is no way to clean inside the lid.

It makes my stomach lurch to think what's growing in the lid mechanism.It did keep my liquids cold/hot, and never leaked, but it is clearly NOT safe for extended use. You can clean it religiously but things will get stuck and build up and grow some nasty bacteria. Even if it doesn't make you sick, your drinks will always taste strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start but poor finish","review":"I really enjoyed using this mug initially. It did a great job of keeping my coffee warm for hours and it never leaked. Unfortunately it was difficult to clean. I found myself taking a gulp of soap subs after cleaning it even though I rinsed it extremely well. I probably could have lived with that but eventually the push button stopped allowing me to close the spout...so much for not leaking after that. It became so bothersome that I ended up getting a different travel mug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Satisfied","review":"Great product.

The slick stylist look is also nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unsanitary","review":"The mug is great in the sense that it is spill proof, but as mentioned, it is impossible to clean out the lid.

This one is definately the best I've come across thus far. I give it four stars! Drinks really do stay hot much longer than most mugs found for the same price. I've found the contents still at a nice temperature after four/five hours, but after 6 hours it was cool.The manufactors recommends preheating or pre-chilling the mug for increased insulation. I haven't used this mug for keeping drinks cold so I can only review this product for heat retention. This mug is spill proof to boot. A big plus. There is nothing worse than traveling and having your tea/coffee spill all over you or your car. This won't happen with this wonderful mug! We followed the manufactors directions and put it to the test by holding the mug upside down full of fluid. Not one drop escaped. Give it a try. IF your not happy the manufactor will give you a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, bad design","review":"I bought this travel mug because I needed a leak proof mug for work. I liked the idea of a leak proof mug for travel necessity as well since I take a bus and often need both hands.This cup started leaking in my bag after about two weeks. It also never kept anything hot (even when I followed proper thermos procedure and pre-heated it with hot water.) On top of all this it collects liquid inside the lid which you cannot get out nor get in to clean. I cannot imagine whats happening to the liquid inside that lid. I thew it out.I would not recommend this product. If you want an item that keeps your coffee/tea super hot and IS leakproof, try Nissan.Nissan 14-Ounce Leak-Proof Insulated Travel Mug"},{"rating":"1","title":"So close to perfect, but ultimately unusable & possibly unhealthy","review":"I was so excited about this mug until after the first use I discovered liquid trapped inside the top (I could hear it sloshing around when I shook the top). I tried everything to get it out to no avail. This can't be healthy. Then I came to Amazon and read that many others found the same flaw. I should have read the reviews first.This is a real shame because it is an otherwise fantastic product and performs exactly as advertized. I eagerly await a new version with this flaw corrected but for now, sadly, I have no choice but to return it and look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel mug","review":"My wife likes it. It keeps liquids warm, but not hot for hours. I guess my wife thought it would keep things hot like a thermos. Nice look & great ergo feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't clean the lid. Need to know more?","review":"I had one for years. Drank tea with soy or hemp milk. After washing it, I could see crud on the orange ring under the lid, but I could not reach it. After reading some reviews, I popped off the top button, unscrewed the flange and removed the flange. The top of the flange (that you can't reach any other way) had moist crud on it. There is a cavity from the bottom of the lid to the drinking hole; it might hold a tablespoon of liquid. The sides of the cavity had lots of moist crud. It is angled in such a way that I could not get to all of the sides of the cavity with a cloth or a Qtip or a toothbrush. And I still could not reach the crud on the orange flange. I gave up and recycled it. Yuck! How can this thing be on the market?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't clean the mug itself","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had the mug long enough for the top to become gummy and dirty. My problem was that within two weeks of buying the mug, I could no longer clean the inside. It smells like spoiled milk no matter what I do. The stainless part is not stamped out of one piece of metal. Instead the bottom is pressed on, and I believe by leaving coffee and milk in the mug for many hours, it worked it's way into the seams where the metal is stamped together. I hand cleaned it to death, used vinegar and hot water, and finally put it through several dishwasher cycles, but the mug still smells bad.I will look to replace this mug with one that is stamped out of one piece of stainless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other Design Flaws","review":"I filled it with boiling water. The middle button operates a open/closing valve with a reassuring click. The other reassuring thing it does is it takes a volume of the boiling water I put into the mug and spits it right back out in my face while it's still hot. Then pouring it out, the lid is designed not to pour forward but to go into a mouth, so if you need to decant hot water into a different cup it will backsplash. I agree that in other ways this thing looks and feels good, and the sealing mechanism is the only one I'd feel ok about putting into a bag with anything else. But be careful while using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere!","review":"I bought and used 3 of these in the space of a year. Great at keeping drinks hot, leak proof, nice size. Eventually the cap would gum up to a point where it was no longer leakproof. Looking around for a replacement here at Amazon I discovered a reviewer who revealed the trick to getting the sealed top unit open, ostensibly to clean it and thusly restore the click button mechanism. Holy Cow! Looked and smelled like something from a Dean Koontz novel in there! I'm surprised that such an unhygenic product can be marketed. Unless you enjoy bleu cheese with your beverage, buy something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mug... finally!","review":"I bought this mug a couple of weeks ago and have been really pleased with it.

It's my daily partner on the morning commute. It's expensive, but worth every dime. This is the only cup I allow myself to drink coffee from around my son (he's 18 months). So, for safety, as well as for not ruining shirts, it's a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this mug","review":"I had purchased an OXO plastic mug of the same design and liked it. When I went looking for another one I tried my favorite place, Amazon. That's when I saw this metal one, read the reviews and decided to try one even though it was double the price.It really does keep liquids hot or cold, doesn't leak and I use it constantly; not just for travel but around the house. Of course it is perfect for travel.Yes, it is spendy but since that is the asking price and I love it, it's worth it.Of course, my free two day shipping is a plus. It has more than paid for itself. Just wish even more items were Amazon Prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely leak-proof","review":"This is the best coffee mug I have owned in 20 years. It is absolutely leak-proof -- I turned it upside down full of hot coffee and shook it and it didn't spill a drop.

It is a great buy; I am ordering another one to have a spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot, Dry & Gross","review":"The mug doesn't leak and keeps drinks hot for hours which is excellent, but it is impossible clean. The slime that gets trapped in the cap, after several uses, is unimaginable. Pipe cleaners, cottons swabs, you name it..this thing is next to impossible to keep sanitary. If you could take the cap apart and clean the inner workings, this would be perfect, but as it is, it's a breeding ground for mold."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite travel mug","review":"I've owned a couple of versions of this travel mug, and it is trusty. I generally just rinse it with soapy, hot water, and I've never had a problem with it smelling. It seals really well. The lid itself can hold a few drops of liquid, but otherwise, nothing will spill. The design is also really compact and sleek. Even without the handle, it is super easy to grip. I'd definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love gone wrong.","review":"First, I bought a red mug for myself. Later, a grey one for my husband. We loved the size, the good seal, and the sturdyness of the mugs. We made our own lattes here at home.It appeared to be like heaven. We cleaned them by rinsing them (including lid) right after emptying them, and also putting them through the dishwasher each night.Until the other day my husband said he was drinking his coffee and found a \\"chunk\\" come out of it. He was disgusted. So I set about cleaning the little buggers...And there is no way in hell I could EVER take another drink from either of them, or buy another one of these mugs. I used some pipe cleaners and a good pull on the plunger to get up into the lid to clean it out...OMG, it was the most disgusting thing. I seriously almost fainted when I realized WE WERE DRINKING OUT OF THIS THING.Oh. My. God.So I came to Amazon to order new mugs for us -- and happened to look this up and see that we are NOT the only people to have this problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"short lived bliss","review":"I used this mug for about 6 months. During that time it served me quite well. The size was perfect, and it was great at keeping my coffee hot and spill-free. On the downside, the top doesn't disassemble and is extremely difficult to clean unless perhaps you were to soak it in vinegar every week. It is not dishwasher safe. The rubber gasket that makes the valve effective eventually warped, which made opening/closing the valve hit or miss. For a $20 mug I was expecting a long life of carefree operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly hard to clean","review":"I love that this travel mug is airtight, keeps my tea piping hot and my cold drinks super cold for hours. It's also spill proof in the car and easy to drink while driving.However, as another reviewer mentioned, it's incredible hard to clean this mug. I used this mug at first for my coffee every morning and I always use half and half. I would rinse and wash it out every day like I normally do with travel mugs. After a month, I noticed a strange odor coming from the lid. Upon further inspection and cleaning, I too noticed that there was a lot of crud trapped in the lid mechanism. I ended up cleaning it with a combination of steaming hot tap water, q-tips, and dish detergent. It took me about a half an hour to get everything out. But who has the time to do this every day?Now I limit its use to plain tea and cold drinks. This is disappointing to me because this mug is pricey as far as travel mugs go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"I wish I had paid more attention to the reviewers that said their mug leaks from the threads. I agree that Teflon tape might fix it, but I shouldn't need to fix a new mug. It is a minor dribble, but it means that I can't use this product the way it was intended. Also, I've been using it for a month and I can still taste plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean, plastic taste","review":"This mug keeps things cold or hot well, and the seal is easy to work with one hand - you push a button, which shows a red border when open, and then push it again to close. It hasn't leaked on me.But - the lid is just impossible to clean thoroughly, for the reasons cited by several other reviewers. I would never put any liquid in it that tended to spoil including coffee or tea with milk or cream or, for that matter, sugar. And when I have mildly flavored tea or plain water in the mug, it has a distinctly unpleasant taste of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gunk build up","review":"I was pretty happy with this mug at first - it really is spillproof (though you do have to make sure not to overfill, and then really tighten the lid down). But ultimately I cannot recommend it because the lid has a complicated fluid channel that is pretty much impossible to clean, and it cannot be disassembled. Looking at the gunk that had built up inside the lid, I realized that after a year or so of using it, I was going to be throwing it away. While some users might consider that an acceptable trade-off for a leak-proof mug (or maybe would not be so squeamish), I will go looking for a durable mug that can be more easily cleaned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Travel Mug that Lives Up to My Expectations","review":"This is one of the best travel mugs that I have ever purchased.1. When the mug is sealed it is totally leak proof. Any position that it is stored in will not leak. I have found that the rubber seal in some of the Thermos-Nissan mugs that I own have worn out over time and will allow a slight leak if not sitting upright.2. Good double wall insulation. Beverage stays hot or cold for a considerable sign. Comparable to the Thermos-Nissan mugs.3. Very good ergonomic shape for handling and drinking.This mug lives up to it's advertising!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Pros, few Cons","review":"[...]How well does it keep the drink warm:The label claims it holds \`temperature' for up to 7 hours. Hmm...I drank a 12 oz cup of hot tea out of the thing. (so the cup should have been pre-heated already) Then I rinsed it with cold water. I boiled 8 oz of water to 208F and put that in the cup and closed it up for 1 hour. After 1 hour the water temp was 150F. After 2 hours the water temp was 126F. I stopped measuring after that.So, it was still a good warm drinking temp after 2 hours. However I'm not sure what impact opening and closing it to drink from it would have in terms of loss of temperature. Draw your own conclusions about what the temp would be after 7 hours. For me, that's good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"After about a year, it doesn't work as well.","review":"I've had this mug for about a year and it doesn't keep things hot or cold for more than a couple of hours anymore.

With a good design, the sealing system is good preventing leaks when tipped and keeps coffee hot for a long time. However, I recently noticed small particles when cleaning the inside of the lid (only way to do this is to fill with hot water/vinegar mixture and shake it). After doing this several times and particles still coming out, I believe it is part of the plastic inside disintegrating. It's in the garbage now and I'm on the hunt for a different brand, perhaps a contigo.

I ended up throwing this one away. It was impossible to clean properly and no matter what I did, there was always a horrid, gooey substance leaking out of the lid after it had dried on the counter. I always unscrewed the gasket part, but apparently it was just impossible for hot soapy water to clean out all of the inside parts that weren't removable, even after prolonged soaking. Spare yourself the waste of money and get a good one...like the Thermos Nissan travel tumbler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bye Bye white shirt....","review":"This thing does not work at all. Coffee dripped onto my white shirts both times I have used this. It leaked from several places around the bottom edge of the lid everytime I tipped it over for a drink.

I see that others have had the same problem with it leaking at the threads. What's the use of a travel mug that leaks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite travel mug","review":"I've been using this mug for about a year now and I would highly recommend it. To address the issue people have been having with cleaning the lid - just use a couple q-tips. Remove the disk which seals the spout and clean from the bottom and top. This is especially important if you leave liquid in the mug for an extended amount of time, which I do from time to time. But even after not giving it this thorough cleaning for a couple months and just washing with soap and hot water I've never had an issue with odor or mold (which some have complain of). I've recommended it to several friends and given it as a gift. Compared to my other travel mugs, there is nothing better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the busy coffee drinker.","review":"I can't go about without a nice cup of coffee a day at work. So far, its the best coffee mug I've owned. It fits in my car's cup holder, my hand fits inside to wash it, does not have a rubber top so coffee or any kind of liquid won't get stuck there and make it hard to wash. It has a click-release mechanism to drink the coffee, and it can be removed for washing purposes. This makes my mug of choice. I have owned it for 2 months now, so even if it would break now, it has served its purpose and my enjoyment.

As many people online have described, there is no way to properly clean the lid of this coffee mug, and it has become a haven for congealed coffee (read: old milk) and, what is worse, bacteria. Though it obviously does a fantastic job of being a spill-proof mug, it should not do this at the possible expense of the drinker's health.

Through a bribe, Esther obtains a place on the Santa Maria, under the alliance of Pedro, a Christian boy. Esther doesn't know where the ship is going and she doesn't care. All she wants is to get as far away from Spain as possible. At every moment, she fears that someone will discover that she is a Jew, a girl, or both. I had high expectations for this book, and was rather disappointed. The plot was paper thin at times, the characters cardboard cutouts, and the romance just made me queasy. It's not the very worst book I've ever read, but it isn't really any good, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent debut!","review":"I finished this book last night, staying up much later than I meant in order to see the resolution of this multilayered story. It's a gritty tale in some respects, but Ms. Vaught handles tough issues with a deft hand, making the reader care about her characters. It goes beyond the standard teen angst book in many ways. I should mention there is humor as well, mostly in the form of Stonn, a blunt Finnish exchange student who had me laughing out loud. But mostly it's the story of Rusty, who must deal with her mother's mental illness, a suicidal friend, and her own budding sexuality. The action climaxes in the rich atmosphere of Mardi Gras, which Ms. Vaught captures quite well. Highly recommmended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"curl energy - curl enhancing styler","review":"I don't know why you would discontinue this item - I am in love with it and of corse can not find it anywhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered?","review":"I bought the remastered version just to find a major error in the remastering of the title song \\"Penthouse and Pavement\\". It made me wonder if any one was paying attention to what they were doing in remastering this great album. About one minute into the song \\"Penthouse and pavement\\" all the highs drop out of one speaker for about five seconds and then return. I own this on vinal and an original pressing of the cd and this error is not in the master tapes. I thought maybe it was just on the downloadable mp3, but found this error on other websites where this album is sold.

I wish I had looked over the reviews before purchasing, this is THE worst SELLER despite pricing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy reading","review":"This lyrical collection of essays by an accomplished airman illuminates the pilot's soul as much as his environment. The essays on \\"The Turn\\" and the Air-India disaster are masterworks, not because they apply to the JFK Jr. tragedy but rather because they speak to the ever-changing relationship between pilots and their sky.The reader should not be discouraged by the first essay in the volume, a meditation on perspective which probably is better read last. Rather, skip to others and absorb how the author's adopted home--the sky--has enveloped his predecessors, his contemporaries and himself.Other reviewers have compared William to his father, Wolfgang Langewiesche. The comparison is unfair to both men. \\"Inside the Sky\\" is no more a manual of flight than \\"Stick and Rudder\\" is a meditation on the topic. Readers, airmen or not, are the richer for the writings of father and son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful, enjoyable reading about flight and technology","review":"An insightful dissertation on both the technology of aviation and the meaning of flight. The chapters on \\"The Turn\\" and \\"On a Bombay Night\\" tell of one of the basic challenges facing man in his journey into the sky. A challenge comparable to that of determining longitude at sea as told by Dava Sorbel in \\"Longitude\\". Organizational management and systems thinking is touched on in chapters about Air Traffic Control, the FAA, and the Valujet crash. Chapter 2, the \\"Stranger's Path\\" may tend to divert one from continuing, but read on, or skip it because the other remaining chapters are worth the effort. William Langewiesche has given us a book that alternates between a personal, intimate view of flying and a broader view of aviation as perhaps the archetype of 20th century discoveries, technologies, and systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"commendable","review":"I bought this book to read while on an airplane. I wanted to know more about the mechanics of flight to make myself more comfortable with the mystery of flight. The book didn't really satisfy all of my questions, but it left me with something more. Yes it was hard to get into. The first essay was just ok and really brings out Langewiesche's thinly veiled condescension (or maybe misunderstanding) of non-pilots. And the second essay where he introduces where he introduces his admiration for J.B. Jackson was where he almost lost me. But the third essay, The Turn, hooked me. An intricate study of the physics of flight, Langewiesche deftly interlaces history, science and his own experiences to give the reader valuable insight of the experiences in the cockpit, intellectual and emotional. I will recommend this book by the virtue of this one essay, though of the ones that follow there are some that are equally readable and there are some that are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Can He Fly with His Ego Weighing Him Down","review":"As I pilot myself I appreciate the beauty of flying. However the author takes an unnecessarily superior, almost professorial, tone with his writing. Flying is a freeing experience that is best described in simple, soaring terms. There is too much \\"me\\" in this book. Not enough of the true essence of flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Level thoughts in places, but tailspin thoughts in others","review":"I thought this book was very interesting in spots, but the writer seemed to want to explain more than he had too. He would go off on tangents that seemed to me to not be releavant to what he was originally talking about. The last half of ch. 6 should have been thrown out, since the author kept repeating the same stuff over and over, as if we the reader can't understand what he is saying. That got really annoying. I would recommend borrowing this and not buying it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This author has missed the runway.","review":"In my opinion (commercial jet pilot), if your dedicated to true aviation don't waste your time and money on this one. The one star mark is a gift. This book seems to be written for your garden variety blind romantic. In the final chapter I was completely blown away by his disgusting remark fired towards the deceased crew of Valuejet 592. To me this comment is flat out wrong, reckless, distasteful, and the signature of a fraud who has never really been there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting perspective, but disjointed","review":"I began my reading of this book with much anticipation, but quickly got lost in the second chapter, which seems totally removed from the rest of the book. While chapters on \\"storm flying\\" and description of fatal crashes such as ValueJet are fascinating, Langewiesche often launches into opinionated, rambling passages of little relevance to the rest of the story. Just as the pioneering pilots who had few tools to help them navigate, I could not get a sense for where he was trying to go, and felt disappointed at the end of the journey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused, thin, and only slightly interesting","review":"Although this book has received glowing reviews from the popular press, I found it did not live up to its billing. I enjoy Mr. Langewiesche's occasional articles in The Atlantic, but this book reads too much like a compilation of those articles. In fact, at least two of the chapters have already been in print. The reviews compare Langewiesche with Saint-Exupery, but Langewiesche is a pale imitator. I just found the chapters too disjointed to get me interested. And his obvious bias against air traffic controllers bothered me. He doesn't seem to like people criticizing pilots if they haven't been one, but he feels free to lace into controllers without having walked a day in their shoes. Overall, a minor book, not one I can recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"An idiosyncratic and unfocused reflection on flight","review":"Much like his Sahara Unveiled, the author here uses language beautifully but the book is written in a muted tone, also like Sahara Unveiled. It left me with the vague sense that he is angry. Nonetheless, it will give the non-pilot some sense of the real experience of flight without a lot of new-age adjectives. It contains a long digression on the life of John Jackson by way of expanding on the theme that the orientation to the physical world is changed by its perception from the cockpit. But the digression is a real digression and drags on irrelevantly. His description of why no pilot can fly by the seat of his pants will surprise every non-pilot and is probably worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven collection of one man's flying stories and musings","review":"Some of the chapters kept me interested, others were a chore to finish.

The funk on this first solo release was less than the funk and smooth soulful sounds found on Steve's last album with the group called Slave. Steve's presence is felt strongly on most cuts, although selections found on this album are almost juvenille in comparison to his albums with Slave, notably the last album \\"SHOWTIME\\". The first song \\"Nobody Can Be You\\" and two others \\"Strange\\" and \\"Weak At The Knees\\" are the most memorable selection on this CD. However, the powers to control the releases of these \\"OLD SCHOOL JAMS\\" performed by Steve Arrington of his subsequent albums(releases) should not be deterred from release. I believe his latter albums supplied more of a truer sense of his talents fully explored than his first solo album. Although Christian in nature, many listeners do not realize the gospel aspects of his latter albums. Which were enjoyed by the funky and the sanctified listeners equally. SAMUEL S.

I just don't get it! The story is so beyond belief and more than a little dramatic regarding the upbringing of the heroine by a father who is useless and over the top when it comes to his daughter's well being.

It is beautifully photographed and the text is witty. The problem is, like some other reviewers have mentioned, the recipes don't work.

I've never attended culinary school, but I'm a pretty experienced home baker.

Although scattered with cute commentary (often very funny!) and interesting bits of information about times gone by, I find the recipes not to be very workable. My biggest pet peave is the 'Black and Whites', our beloved huge New York cookies,soft,lemony and satisfying. The recipe sounds great...but it doesn't work out! The batter spreads too much, so the cookies are very thin and fragile, with no body and the fondant frosting turns out a mess.

This book is horrible!The recipes are just wrong and sometimes poorly written instructions.If I could meet the author, I would demand my money back and then punch him in the face for wasting hours of my time and nearly embarrassing me at my own dinner parties.I was going to donate this book to a charity, but why proliferate the bad recipes and frustrate someone else.

For example \\"National Brotherhood Week\\" from \\"That Was the Year That Was\\" speaks of the same hate and hypocrisy that we are too scared to admit exist today. Ditto too, \\"Who's Next\\" the song detailing the insanity of the nuke race. (Tom must be in seventh heaven, after learning about the Pakistani and Indian bombs, which are almost more ludicrous than even he could imagine.) I grew up with Tom, Jonathan Winters, and Charles Addams (even before the TV shows that couldn't approach the oddity of the Addams experience.)

Many fun things to do are not mentioned (try seeing the Shanghai Sharks if you enjoy basketball or visit Circus World) and it never mentions many of the fabulous local restaurants but instead focuses on tourist and western style restaurants.

This went on through every song I managed to find. I've listened to Fisher everyday since that first day. It has become an obsession, but one that I love. I've read and watched everything I could find on Kathy Fisher and Ron Wasserman and determined that not only are they extremely talented, but are equally nice.

I did, and I was not disappointed by the rest of the music. There is variety in the music but there is not one track on this CD I don't like. Every song has a wonderful \\"hook\\" that you anticipate every time you listen. Kathy's voice can be edgy or soft, and she has complete control over it.

Fisher's wonderful vocalist, heart wrenching lyrics, and stunning music come together like pieces of an elegant puzzle. No where else will you find such a passionate album. 'True North'is truly worth investing your time and money. All 13 tracks are superb; something you wont find on most cds. I guarantee you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soon To Win the Best New Artsist Grammy","review":"I first ran across Fisher quite by accident near a year ago, and in the first half of the song \\"The Life\\" had fallen in love with her voice and the music. The content and musical capabilities of the duo are phenomenal. From more techno driven pieces like \\"the Life\\" to more traditional piano ballads like \\"I will Live You\\" she evinces in her direct, and poingnat lyrics a range of emotions and personal subjects that any of us can relate to. This album is a fine showcase of a new artists work, expressing itself in beautifully perfect tones. I do belive this duo will make an impact upon the music scene, and though comparisons to Sarah McLachlan and Tori Amos are inevitable Kathy Fisher is most defintly her own voice (literaly and figureativly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Another Pretty Face","review":"These days there is no shortage of pretty girls with equally pretty voices cutting pretty superficial music. Kathy Fisher, however, is not just some fluffy femme, she's an artist's artist and someone to watch. Her music will grab your heart by its lapels and won't let go until the last track fades. The emotional impact of her work is nothing short of intense. If she hadn't landed her own deal, she'd undoubtedly be penning songs for others who had. Lucky for us, we get to hear this music first hand, directly from her.If you've never heard of Fisher before, don't worry.You're going to."},{"rating":"2","title":"a DIVA who shares her soul!","review":"If you are someone who has been trying to find that one perfect singer who you can actually relate to and believe in, this is the girl! Fisher's album is above and beyond amazing! With this album she gives us her heart and soul. I was introduced last year by just downloading her songs and at once loved her voice and music! I finally was able to purchase the c.d \\"True North\\" and haven't took it out of my player yet! Believe me, just listen to the song \\"I Will Love You,\\" and you will know what I am talking about. So if you want a great album and love listening to music like chantal kreviazuk, kendall payne and tara maclean, GO BUY HER \\"TRUE NORTH\\" ALBUM TODAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher Review","review":"Excellent CD. Bought Fisher \\"ONE\\" last year and was dissapointed that they weren't being played, glad to see them climbing the charts, \\"True North\\" will get them there. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"This woman really belts out the tunes! She can \\"rock\\", and also give you romantic chills with \\"I will love you\\". Get Dido, get Beth Hart, get Joan Osborne, and get Fisher's \\"True North\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to Buy it","review":"When I first listened to the cd, I thought that Fisher sounded like Fiona Apple. She still does as I listen to this cd again but not so much as the first time. Fisher is her own singer/songwriter. Each song is a real winner, \\"Miseryland\\" is a particular favorite of mine as is \\"I Will Love You\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"fisher is the best artist i have ever heard. she is soulful and jazzy. her voice sounds like silk feels. this has become my favorite cd. listen to it and you will be hooked. it's great medicine after a bad day at the office and that long ride home is where you unwind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome******* Go Harry Williams!","review":"Harry Williams is the main reason why I would buy this cdover and over again. He is an awesom person and a fantastic performer. Outside Woman,Natural High and of course Long Way Back are the ultimate jamz.(HI Harry!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Underrated Soul Classic!","review":"Anyone who grew up listening to R&B station know more than the one pop crossover hit, Natural High. I recently saw Bloodstone perform in July '08 and even though they were opening for '70 Soul Greats, the Main Ingredient, Chi Lites and Stylistics these guys stole the show for me. Highlights on this CD include the classic, Natural High, Outside Women, Give Me Your Heart, We Go A Long Way Back, My Little Lady, That's Not How It Goes and Traffic Cop. This was a group with some of the most outstanding vocalist of the day and today who could sing just about anything and make it sound good. Don't pass up on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The iPhoto alone is worth the price","review":"All of the improvements are great. I was editing a video for a presentation when my order arrived. There was a transition that I simply could not get the old iMovie to do. I installed the new iLife and told it to make the same transition in the film and it worked perfectly. I don't know why or how but I was sold five minutes after the box arrived.I still think iPhoto is the best improvement however. I really like the scrollable photo index when looking at a picture in edit mode. I also like the ability to eject the camera from within iPhoto(I sometimes forgot to do this before.) And the one-touch red-eye correction is nice too.Also I like the new themes for iDVD. The movie I was editing ended up getting one of the new themes instead of the old theme I had originally picked and I was very pleased with the end result. The presentation was a big success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple comes through again","review":"iLife is superb; my only complaint is that it doesn't include a Version 5 of iTunes, but after installation one can upgrade to 4.9 in the usual Apple way. So far everything works great with Tiger (OS 10.4.2) in my 1 GHz G4 Powerbook with 256 MB DDR SDRAM without snap, crackle, or pop. That amount of RAM is the least I would recommend for Tiger and iLife use, however; otherwise the constant swapping in and out of virtual memory will drive you nuts if it works at all. As it is this amount feels marginal to me and an upgrade is on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has what I wanted","review":"I got this because of my older mac. I still haven't used all that was in it. I've used the IMovie and it does what I need for it to do. I still haven't used it to the full extent due to lack of knowledge that I have for Macs. This is a learning experience for me. I do like what I've used though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered wrong item","review":"I wanted to order the latest Mac version of iLife. Upon receiving your Email solicitation, I automaticaqlly selected the first iLife item that appeared on Amazon's page. Unfortunately, it was for iLife '05, rather than iLife '06. Since I already had iLife'05, I had to send it back and reorder iLife '06. To Amazon, I recommend you feature the latest version of the product and list the discounted older version thereafter. To us Buyers, i've learned to be more aware and detailed in my ordering. It saves everyone a lot of pain and suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was highly recommended to me but I did not like it","review":"I did not like the movie. The best part were the interviews that came with it as a \\"plus\\".What was discussed in the movie is something that is around for more than 20 years and it just happened that \\"just now\\" the New Age decided to pick it up as \\"new\\"...New Age is becoming more and more a commercial thing, big money, like anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...","review":"whatever you do, see this movie. any way you can. SEE THIS MOVIE! if it doesnt totally blow your mind, it will at least provide some very interesting things to ponder or research. this movie gave me the feeling, \\"god, a lot of this is new to me, but i feel like ive known this all along.\\". this movie explores the fundimental questions of human nature, and weaves science and spirituality together perfectly. quantum mechanics can explain human consiousness? this film sure makes you think so! go ahead, treat yourself! let this movie serve as a reminder of your great capability with this life you have chosen. you create your own reality. think for yourself, quesiton authority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me want to claw my eyeballs out","review":"I'm a man of science. I totally buy in to the idea that quantum mechanics tries to explain that which today is inexplicable. This movie, though, literally made me want to never interact with anyone in the human race again. The band of scientists and theorists they pulled together would make for an interesting panel discussion, but the story that was woven from their thoughts was uninteresting, and irrelevant. I feel cheated out of 109 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made me sick","review":"This movie was scary and made me dizzy. I watch it when I do my pull-ups cause it's like Rocky V and makes you better than other bad men who come to do the bad things. The cartoons make me dizzy, and this movie is great and says I'm special cause I was bad a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, time ago and now Im bein' pun-ish'd! I watch this over and over and every time I watch it, it makes me better cos it's got the magic in there, you see. It was really sad when Rocky didn't get to go on the motorcycle trip through europe because he looked like a lion and his mom was busy with strange men.

Barnum was right!","review":"Maybe it's not fair to review a film that you did not watch in its entirety, but 40 minutes was about as much as I could stand of this malarkey. Between the atrocious acting, the annoying \\"outer space\\" animations, and the breathlessly, self-important \\"deep thoughts\\"-- well, that's 40 minutes of my life I'll never get back. The good news is that I borrowed it from the library rather than spent money to rent it or (god forbid) buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made!","review":"This should be entitled \\"Why the Bleep Should We Watch?\\" I had read about it online and saw it in the theater. It has choppy editing, a poorly written story interspersed with interviews with various \\"experts\\" who are inadequately identified, cartoon animations, and a scattershot approach to some very interesting concepts mixed in with new age blather. If you are at all interested in quantum physics, self-help, body-mind connections or any new age religious practices you probably already know more than this movie tells you. My advice?

If only they had filmed it as a straight-on documentary and left out the \\"dramatic\\" bits starring Matlin.Marlee always ruins everything she is in cause she always has somekind of chip on her shoulder. Yeah honey, we know you are deaf...get over it.The scene where she was judging her body in the mirror and yelling \\"I hate you!\\" and \\"You suck!\\" were just obnoxious. I found myself wishing for her death at teh end.The \\"new agey\\" stuff actually appealed to me. To bad they didn't focus more on that as opposed to the no-talent actress. And just what was up with her deficient roomie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful","review":"I have discovered that this flick is a recruiting instrument for a \\"spiritual\\" religious cult. Creative, but specifically looking for lost souls who need somewhere to turn. Legitimate reviews of this movie have ridiculed the misrepresentation of the science and thrown light on the hidden agenda. And, by the way, I do not believe the world is only 6000 years old. One doesn't have to be a brainwashed bible thumper to see through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quatum physics? No Way","review":"Peptides are NOT quantum particles!

A chance wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you belive in science?","review":"This is a classic example of the kind of pseudo-science that has convinced so many to waste their time and energy in persuit of vague metaphysical concepts that conveniently enough are of the nature that they cannot be tested or proven. The movie is teeming with scientific half truths that a well-read armchair scientist could see through. Read some of the books mentioned in the movie and you will quickly see that the information is being taken out of context. Also, there are countless blatant contradictions and bold ascertations given without a source, reference, or even a shred of logical proof applied. If you belive in science then you have got to realize that this movie is total crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult Schmult","review":"Using the word \\"cult\\" to describe the makers and participants of this film is just plain crap. These people have an alternative viewpoint of life and personal experience. It may not be your cup of tea, but I think it's refreshing to hear different points of view. They're not asking you for a donation at the end of it, and they're not asking you to sign anything. They simply just wanted to put this out there and see what the response would be. It's science, is self-consciousness and it is spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening, life changing","review":"I've watched \\"What the Bleep\\" numerous times and learn something new each time. The film tied many strands together for me: quantum physics, Jungian psychology, ecology and evolution, patterns of poetry, and meditation. Watch it with an open mind and your mind will expand."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the \\"bleep\\" do they know, apparently not much","review":"The great thing about telling people to keep an open mind is that now you can fill their mind with twisted logic and half-truths.

You'll find you'll know more than they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"geesh!","review":"I went to see this one night when I was bored, and it looked offbeat and interesting. Plus I'm interested in quantum theory and know something about it. Well, this movie failed to entertain, failed to give even a decent idea about what quantum physics is about, featured boring inconclusive generalized talk about life etc. I couldn't stand to get to the end. There was 5 minutes of animation that was ok, and the wedding scene promised to be better, but fizzled. I can't think of anything else that even is worth mentioning about it. It might be better if you were were high on some drug, or otherwise \\"non compus mentis\\". Bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinated","review":"Fascinating movie for anyone interested/open to the theory of quantum physics.

I was at the event when Ramtha told Will to make the movie and Ramtha even gave the name and the trio changed one word to Bleep. We students know this film is based on the teachings of Ramtha and we created a grassroots movement to promote this film. We are delighted and excited over its receptivity by the public because it is all about us - and not just the students. Dr. Joe has done a brilliant presentation of Create Your Day which is one of Ramtha's disciplines. Please!See this movie! It really is all about the human - including all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spit it out and read a book.","review":"This film is a distasteful blend of real neuroscience, confused and misleading quantum physics, and outright falsehoods.If you are a new-agey, \\"crystals and Atlantis\\" type who looks scornfully on science as something cold and cruel, you may get the impression from this film that there is room for your belief system in the scientific worldview after all. And if you did get that impression, you would almost certainly be wrong.If you are a skeptical person with above-average knowledge of quantum physics and neuroscience, this movie will make you cringe with its clumsy language and refusal to back up any of its claims, whether factual or insane, with references to valid experimental data.Let me put it this way: If you want to learn about the implications of quantum physics as it relates to cognition, there are good books on the topic, without a bunch of unscientific nonsense about the emotions of a glass of water, and how nothing really exists outside your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever at times, well produced, but ultimately silly and baseless. It sounds like a cult infomercial.","review":"This sounds like some strange late night infomerical for a weird cult or something. The whole thing about drawing positive forces towards you, or whatever \\"secret\\" sort of rubbish they go on about is just that - rubbish. There is nothing real here, nothing truly spiritual, nor is there anything that stands up to real science. All this makes it a big waste of time. Its pseudoscience for people who are looking in the wrong direction for meaning and purpose and the answers to life's basic questions. They will not find those answers here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evidently not that much - New Age masquerading as physics","review":"Bunch of pseudo-scientific mysticism that really doesn't amount to anything.

These people are no better than your average fundmentalist Christian rip off artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelmingly Profound","review":"I am going to have to watch this movie several more times to even begin to digest its profundity. I am intrigued. It never occurred to me how quantum mechanics is such an entegral part of our lives. I was spellbound by the film. It's most assuredly for \\"high thinkers\\", individuals who are more highly evolved than most. Less evolved people may not have the spiritual constitution to absorb its meaning. I recommend it to viewers who enjoy a mental and spiritual challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Load of baloney, also boring","review":"I was very interested to see this, mainly because of the participation of Amit Goswami, a genuine physicist and author of a well regarded text on quantum mechanics which was used in a course I had just finished. Total disappointment -- there was no real physics in this movie, merely a load of pseudoscientific new age babble, with a few scientific terms thrown around so as to gull the credulous. On top of that, it was not even particularly entertaining. And 'JZ Knight' channeling 'Ramtha' -- ? Give me a break. Even one star is one too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"new age non-sense charaded as hip and scientific","review":"Pseudo-scientific, New Age non-sense.

It tries to pass of drivel as science and throws expert witnesses (highly edited towards their slanted view) at ya, to see if you take the bait. It actually made me angry that they would offer up a typical american quick fix solution to all problems for an audience that if they didn't understand how badly they were being misled, probably had the most problems!! Even George Nori and Art Bell have more substance than this. Bob Dobbs save us if a lot of people take this as fact, our gullible race is doomed.

There is not a shred of evidence-based knowledge to be found, just a lot of mumbo-jumbo-nonsense thrown at your face by so called \\"scientists\\" and self-proclaimed \\"experts\\".

One of the most annoying things for me was the some arrogant woman who believes she channels some long dead Atlantian. (I'm rolling my eyes!) The Law of Attraction is THOUGHT combined with ACTION.

If you've watched/read the latest rash of information on thinking, believing, manifesting, and so forth, you're just not going to find anything new here.There were three of us in the room, watching this DVD. One bit of information interested all of us (the only information we didn't all mutter \\"Oh, this again\\" about). It was the idea that not only can our brains hardwire beliefs/information, but that our bodies do the same.I sought out the author of that tidbit, and bought his book. It was almost five hundred pages of pretentiousness. He did mention the hardwiring concept, and did say it could be changed, but never told how to re-wire one's body (or offer any information on where to learn more about it).The three of us here were extremely disappointed. If you've kept up with the latest findings, you really won't find anything new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - a movie that makes you think (for once)","review":"This is not your typical movie - if you like mind numbing, I don't have to think movies, then it's not for you.This movie is an introspective look at life and looking at it from a whole new way of thinking - so yes, oh my gosh, you have to think; otherwise, you will miss the whole point of the show.Really it boils down to looking at the issue of: do we make our own reality or is reality thrust at us? Many people live in the world of being victim to whatever life brings us- we had no control over the issue.This movie shows us that we do have a LOT of control over the issues and over our life, but we have to choose to take that control on and be responsbile for the power we have.Novelty at it's best - and yet, scary to most. People don't like to know that they have a say in it cause then when it doesn't go \\"their way\\" they can't blame others; only themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do research, find the truth","review":"I was very disappointed to discover that most of this movie is unscientific fluff. I can't remember his name, but the professor from Columbia was shocked after seeing the finished film. He said he would have never agreed to it if he knew what the producers had in mind.The woman channeling the ghost from Atlantis (I wish I was kidding) is using it to drive a marketing campaign for her products.Do some research on the water labeling experiment. It turns out he only selected the ones that reflected what he was looking for. Meaning, he labeled 50 bottles of water with \\"love\\" and only used the ones that worked.I can go on, but you just need to research for yourself or talk to a real quantum scientist.

They managed to pay some educated people to pervert quantum mechanics into an absurd fantasy.I was surprised to see the credentials of some of the interviewees, until I figured out the filmmakers' strategy. They would use the professors to state the \\"borderline\\" BS, like stretching and distorting the statements of quantum mechanics, and use the crazy woman and the chiropractor to say the REALLY crazy stuff (\\"we are all gods\\").This whole film is a big rip off of the \\"Nova\\" episodes on string theory, and \\"The Matrix\\". (They aimed to emulate the profoundess of Matrix 1, but only managed to create the WTF-ness of 2 and 3).Its alright if spiritualism makes you feel good about yourself, but don't try to justify it with science because its NOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go for your Dreams","review":"Why not?

It then contrives a pseudoscientific approach to explain this dubious claim misapplying and distorting concepts of quantum physics and biology. It is hard to convey how painful sitting through this is. I highly recommend you do not attempt this at home!If you want to get a basic understanding of quantum physics, I recommend \\"The Elegant Universe\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see.","review":"This is a film that all must see. Really don't know why they have Marly Mattlin in it. The drama part just confuses the quantum physics part.

Much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"what the bleep?","review":"I viewed this film in theatre at the time of its release and thoroughly enjoyed it. Life is so full of wonders and this was still another way of exploring another level of it. Another level yet the basis of our daily living we are unconscience of. Great film to view either alone or in group setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, not that","review":"This movie presents an odd mix - a positive personal outlook with scientific substrate. The writers draw on brain imagining, neurochemistry, and quantum physics. Using those bases, they describe how the intention to feel a certain way or to have specific events occur comes from a personal choice. That in turn changes the body, the physical substance of the mind, to reinforce those feelings. It's a positive and empowering message.The problem is, they distort or simply invent the science to support their message. Yes, in a common interpretation, the quantum wave function collapses when the observer measures the phenomenon (creating profound philosophical quandaries). That does not imply that happy thoughts affect the outcome of that collapse. There's some unsound biology, as well, too much to go into.On the whole, this comes across as a gram of genuine fact diluted in liters of wishful thinking.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word--- TRASH","review":"It's New Age hype.

This movie rides a quantum wave of cascading assumptions down the gurgling drain of pretension. I can admit a certain level of egoism, ( am I not beautiful? ) but the concluding notion in this film that we are all gods with the ability to manipulate physical reality by intention alone is the height of absurdity.If you like to keep an open mind, so others may curb their meta-physical dog in your skull, then by all means, grab a roll of paper-towels and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Move is Not Science !

There is enough psuedo-science in here to choke most laymen, though unfortunately our education system is so bad that many will be unaware-----While there are no shortage of opportunists who will profit from deliberate deception.

This movie tries to use the spirituality of religion without its key concepts such as a belief in God (as in the Personal written in the old and new testament). Not so much as contradicts any doctrine or system of Jewish-Christian thought as it suggests that such doctrines and systems are irrelevant now that we have all these movie special effects juxtaposing early 20th century quantum physics and late 20th century neurobiology. Somehow a new spiritual thesis founded on a quantum-neurobiological \\"science\\" is supposed to emerge. It doesn't. Also it's a cheap knock-off of the PBS video series THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE (which was just a good film about theoretical physics that wasn't trying to start yet another new age movement)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see","review":"I ordered this movie for someone I knew would benefit from it.

I have no idea what's true and what isn't but it definitely sparked an interest in the subject. The story is about this woman who's depressed but turned her external life around by turning her internal emotion away from adiction and attatchment, the source of her sadness, and became happy in the end. The physics deals with how the mind controls everything, not just our emotion but the way physical, external things are functioning. For me, the best thing was the subject of God and how we are all a part of God, and how we are connected by our minds, and how they affect each other.Overall the movie contains a very hopeful message for everyone who wonders why we're alive or the meaning of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rating lower than 1?","review":"On a good note, many people who believe this [...] will be too busy staring at glasses of water to do much damage. On a bad one, the people who accuse others of being too closed minded to enjoy it are frighteningly similar to fundamentalist Christians who accuse everyone else of lacking morality. Believing something for which you have no proof is exactly the same as believing in god. It does not require you to have an open mind, it simply requires you to have faith. There is no proof for the claims that are made in this film. There is plenty of evidence to refute the claims made in the film and with a very small amount of investigating, one can find this evidence. Now, a person who refuses to investigate such claims, to me, is the one with the closed mind. However, many people have the mistaken impression that deviating from \\"traditional\\" religion somehow makes them less ignorant. It doesn't. It just makes them ignorant in a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic. Boring. Human Potential Hogwash Masquerading As Deep Thought.","review":"Wow. This movie came out and I read reviews that praised it highly. I cannot see why. This movie is like watching a scientology video. The movie was presented to be scientific. It is instead a mish-mash of new age practitioners and academics that are presenting sophistry as science. All within a cheesy story line and laughable special effects. The story was a joke and the science was unscientific. Therefore it will find its way into high school science classes. Save yourself the trouble. If you want to know more about the scientific theories, go read a book, and rent a comedy.

Capitol C.The film never once identifies the large blond woman dressed in Captain Kirk's caste offs.

But basically the movie has no point. Oh, there's sort of a point. Kind of a point. It sorta kinda wanders from one half-digested new age concept to the next pseudo-scientific meme without amassing any momentum or coherency. I guess perception shapes reality. I guess positive thinking can change the world, so this movie is a thematic sibling to The Secret. That's so great! Even though happiness doesn't automatically give your life meaning or value.

The little excerpts of non-documentary 'film' with Marlee Matlin were odd, disjointed, out of place, and seemed more like an acid trip than an explanation of the points being made, very distracting. They have some great minds explaining some great concepts, but then they get 'spiritual', and the movie starts to drift. The woman speaker who is supposedly channeling the spirit of Ramanatha is particularly wierd. Wait for this to come on the Science Channel, or you'll be out $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"too sci-fi for me..","review":"i got this dvd thinking it would have interesting and factual information quantum dynamics and it was really interesting in the first 15 minutes or so. Then all of a sudden the focus shifted to what could all of this science mean. people were then being interviewed who had no titles or references to support this new focus of extraordinary and paranormal abilities such as looking into the future and how the brain can subconsciously predict what is going to happen and how snow cystals can take the shape based on karma or good/bad feelings. i could not finish this dvd. i felt cheated and duped into watching someone's speculative and subjective thoughts on a subject i thought was going to be educating and factual. the dvd is based on the 'what if' part or 'wouldn't it be cool if..' premise about the 'wonders' of science. you'd have to be extremely open minded to think any of this were true. get this movie if you're into sci-fi books/flicks and want to learn about a fictional world."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening","review":"I found this to be a beautiful and thoughtful movie, and an introduction to Q Physics.For the lay person, this is the best introduction...If you have never been interested in the subject before, it will make you want to learn more.Please watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two parts mumbo jumbo one part science","review":"As fascinating as this film may seem to those interested it does all involved a major disservice by presenting sham science alongside the real thing. The sham referenced is the faulty \\"science\\" on water molecules and their \\"reaction\\" to emotional/environmental stimulus. This is not science any more than bigfoot research is science.Inclusion of this pseudo-science is the ultimately disappointing aspect of this film.

The group of people speaking here seems to be gathered randomly, rather than by their background and reputation in scientific and alt.scientific circles. Although they express some interesting thoughts, too much of the DVD contents is really nothing more than pseudo-science. Scientific concepts seem to be twisted and abused in some way to make it look and sound like science. If the idea was to question some age old scientific concepts and open doors to the new age of science, I would call it a nice try, but not more than that.

It gets one star only because no stars is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie with lots of misinformation and distorted facts","review":"When I first watched this movie I enjoyed the beginning and was very interested by the initial discussion on quantum physics. However, I find that many of the so called \\"facts\\" presented about quantum physics are not true at all. Also, I was sorely dissappointed at the end as the movie inserts New Age ideology. The movie is infected with premature closure and selective observation. It only tries to seek out evidence that will confirm its own beliefs. Almost all, except one professor who was misrepresented, are non-professional scholars and mystics. This movie is really a pathetic attempt to cover up the teachings of JZ Knight, who claimed that a spirit named Ramtha revealed itself to Knight.Basically, this is just New Age propaganda.Although not about physics, for a better film about philosophical discussion, check out the film Waking Life by Richard Linklater."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the Bleep Do We Know","review":"This is a very thought provoking movie about the effect our habitual thoughts have on the experience and outcome of our reality. Marlee Matlin plays an out-of-sorts professional photographer with a bleak outlook on life, partly due to her marriage having recently come apart. She is a pill-popping curmudgeon at the start; however a series of events bring an awareness that she has been greatly contributing to her negative life experience by habitually looking for the dark side of things. She finally awakens to this and sees the many possible positive outcomes. Intermittently, various individuals such as astro physicysts, or quantum physicysts comment on \\"what is real\\", bringing another level of thinking to the equation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sham of false claims and out-of-context speech bits to trick people into thinking this collection of wishful thinking is real.","review":"It's no better than when Limbaugh does the same thing, and the producers of this film should be as ashamed of themselves as Rush should be of himself.

I realise it wasn't made as a real movie and more of a quasi-docudrama type thing, but the \\"docu\\" and \\"drama\\" are both awful. There's some good scientists who have some great thoughts about quantum reality, but while watching this I felt like without having read numerous books on the subject, I would hardly have known what they were talking about. And, since I _am_ well educated on this topic, I felt like this movie added nothing.It's geared towards newcomers to the topic, but it fails. Look around on Amazon for highly rated intro-to-quantum-theory books if you're interested in the subject, don't buy this.This had potential, but it's just horribly flawed by bad acting, not deciding if it wants to be a collection of interviews or a noncoherent storyline, virtually no art direction, and inadequately presented information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have been more credible if...","review":"My favorite parts of this DVD are the scenes where the scientists are explaining lots of things. I hated the movie part. Personally, it would have been better if it is pure documentary or maybe 70% documentary, 20% interview and 10% silent movie.I believe in quantum physics and mind over matter for years but I think this movie would have been more credible if Ramtha is not involved. I am not saying Ramtha is a fake or anything like that.

There are lots of generalizations, without any type of critical eye. Nothing new or profound about the ideas. That's not to say that that the ideas are bad. There are some significant ways of thought presented, but it's been rehashed, dumbed down and dressed in a fluffy New Age feather boa. Just who the @#*! was the target audience for this?

Apparrantly there are quite a few people who need to be re-assured that they are in America and free to believe whatever they wish regardless of how silly.This movie is a pat on the head kind of encouragement for people that need positive reinforcement for spiritual views and would like them to be validated by the very science they reject. Luckily the science is so dubious as to not bring the charge of sell-out to New Agers, who may now wade in the shallow end of quantum respectability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"The topic is an important one, but the execution in this film is simply horrendous. The entire topic is apparently supposed to be absorbed through 10 second sound bites interweaved with a storyline badly acted by Marlee Matlin along with MTV style liquid video. Sadly disappointed. If you've never heard of quantum theory or the power of intent then you might consider renting it, but don't even think of purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Agers Obsessed With Themselves","review":"This movie is filled with self-obsessed, pretentious New Agers spend the whole time talking into the camera as if they are explaining the secrets of the universe to 2-year olds.

I also agree that spiritual exploration and practice is beneficial both to the individual and the community of all living beings.But.This film is full of so much fuzzy-headed quackery and self-delusion (if not outright con-artistry), it makes the mind reel. In addition to compassion and wisdom, clarity and intelligence are key to our spiritual development. With the exception of a few interviewees, these qualities are in very short supply here. I plead with anyone who's contemplating the path of spiritual enrichment to remember to keep your wits about you, the traps of ignorance and charlatanism are most certainly out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"could be complete bs, but fun nonetheless!!","review":"i've seen this movie a number of times. my friend and i watched it everyday for a week. then we'd ride our bikes all over town and discuss the ideas. it got us thinking in new ways, exploring new points of view, and opening up to big ideas. i understand that it could all be complete bs, but that's okay; i don't have to believe it, i just have to use it, learn from it, and move on. i recommend it for anyone. think differently for a while. it's fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserving of all the hype","review":"this movie was such a disappointment. poorly acted, photographed, and edited it proved to be nothing more than a new age/self-help video. this film's success is a direct result of good PR. nothing more. if you are interested in seeing a beautifully crafted, intellectual documentary that really gets you thinking and that will blow your mind, go see or buy \\"Flight from Death: The Quest for Immortality\\". this movie is what \\"what the bleep\\" tried to be but failed miserably at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and shallow","review":"The movie is about interesting topics - quantum physics, psychology, consciousness, spirituality etc. However it completely fails to explain the science, the spirituality part is shallow and worst of all they make lot of statements that are speculative at best but they are stated as fact (often connecting science and spirituality, jumping from scientific statement to a spiritual one as if it was a logical conclusion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only enjoyable if you know nothing about science","review":"People who like this movie generally flatter themselves into thinking their enjoyment is a result of their superior open mind. In reality, it's a result of their complete lack of scientific education. There is a great deal of rich material out there on the interface of science and religion, done by respectable scientists and theologians. This, however, is done by a bunch of cultists and crackpots who have little more than a cursory understanding of popularized quantum mechanics. Anybody who found this \\"deep\\" and eyeopening usually ends up feeling pretty stupid when they find out that the scientific expert panel included a chiropractor, but no real physicists. There's having an open mind, and then there's being gullible. Those who thought this movie was intellectually valid fall in the latter category."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"it is a very interesting documental about quantic physics and human nature with very clear examples dramatized by actors.

The two prove the adage that the whole is sometimes greater than the sum of its parts. After all, 1/3rd of the world perceives information best by seeing, 1/3rd by hearing and the last third by a combination of the two senses. I gave sets of the two to at least 25 friends and have been receiving rave reviews and \\"thank-you's\\" for the combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinary popular delusion and madness","review":"There are good arguments in this movie. The trouble is, they're only the minority.From the very beginning, with the absurd \\"legend\\" of the Central American Indians not seeing the first european boats (that transported the End of their ancient civilization), the movie tries and fails to give a sober and stimulating existentialist/holistic discourse on reality.Overweight palm readers are stirred into a vat of interviews with scientists, theologians, and Tolle-esque charlantans (introduced along with their books available wherever books are sold). Throw in a mini-movie about a woman's hormonal production. Drink up. Repeat as needed. Placibo as ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profound misunderstanding","review":"The idea here seems to be that, since quantum mechanics shows that the universe has no underlying reality (true), and the act of observing collapses a particle's many possibilities to a single state (true), that the observer can CHOOSE the state the particle ends up in. This last is complete and utter nonsense of the most pernicious sort.A flipped coin, while spining, is both heads and tails. Even after it lands it is still both, mathematically and actually. Only when it is observed does it take its final state. But wishing it is heads, no matter how hard you wish, won't change the odds. Half the time you WILL observe tails. If you don't believe me, let's bet houses.To say this film is anti-scientific doesn't do it justice. It isn't simply inaccurate, or misinformation -- it is a deep philosophical misunderstanding of the way we know the universe works, like believing gravity is optional.Delusional claptrap of the worst sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop-up book for the spiritually lazy","review":"This movie will fill you up and leave you hyper and elated, yet so will pouring a ten-pound bag of refined sugar into your belly.

If you become one of the \\" just add water \\" instantly enlightened adherents to this film, you will eventually spend alot of time and money re-educating yourself on the validity of What the Bleep's absurdist claims. Please educate yourself on the metaphysical concepts vs QM probability theories before you embarass your-self by aping and echoing the film's baseless claims. Shouting down anyone with a contrary opinion, or an attempt at constructive dialogue with ad hominem passive aggresive attacks such as, \\" you don't have an open mind \\" or \\" You're afraid of the new paradigm \\" merely retards the conversation to the level of Christian Scientists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science turned into Fiction","review":"The first 10 minutes explain modern theories in Quantum Physics but then it turns to disaster. Rather than correctly stating that the sensitivity of measuring an electron is currently not possible (because any device attempting this bombards the target with electrons of it's own and skews the results) the movie jumps to a hair-brained conclusion that the skewed results are because their mind changed thought into matter. Worse off, they took several notable Scientists and skewed what they were relaying by trying to intertwine some terra-card reading freak (probably from Vegas) to suggest they were all coming to the same conclusion. They're trying to make Quantum Physics into the new religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do we really know anyway?","review":"I watched this dvd again last night!

Hmmm, the only thing I really, really believe at present is that I've been bilked out of a few bucks...and, hey, if JZ Knight is so smart, maybe she'll invest that money and come back in another 35,000 years to collect the massive profits..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This movie presents a series of very interesting interviews with preeminent and eloquent scientists from various fields of knowledge who explain, in everyday language, where they're at with current scientific thinking at the sub atomic level in attempting to explain the ultimate nature of reality and how our mind creates our world for us.The subject matter is deep and profound, yet it is presented in an entertaining and very skillful way, interwoven with the story of a depressed deaf photographer who's spiritual awakening comes when she realizes what's happening in her world is created by what's going on in her mind. She shifts from being the mere observer all the time, for which her job as a photographer is a metaphor, to being an active participator in her life. How her thoughts come to determine her day are gradually revealed to her, hilariously so when she gets the job of wedding photographer for the day and she gets swept up by the raucous wedding reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've EVER seen","review":"I saw the previews.

On some televisions you can \\"zoom in\\" on the image, but this results in a blurred picture. Owners of widescreen televisions should be aware of this before making the purchase.As to the documentary/movie itself, it is an excellent exploration of some of the more interesting and extreme implications and interpretations of quantum mechanics and M-theory.

I am always curious about how life came to be and what purpose a human life is supposed to be in this world. An interesting point made in the movie is that we are here to create (not be created). However, I wasn't impressed with any other discussions even though there are a lot of positive thinking that encourages self-esteems and confidence etc, because I have heard all these angles of thoughts about life a few decades ago. The quantum physics part was over-played and over-used to show how choices would affect your life's path. Note \\"Quantum\\" theories are not for big \\"things\\" like humans. The discussions about psychology and emotion are also just common senses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice anything-but-scientific movie","review":"A nice and touching movie.

If you believe in everything you see, you won't. It's really that simple.The ideas presented are just that, ideas. They are theories and beliefs all mixed into one grand idea of controlled perception.Honestly though, I won't convince anyone not open to the absurd or far out that this movie holds merit. So, to those of you who are, buy it and use it to your advantage. I did, and my life is better for it.-note-And to anyone who says I don't understand Quantum Physics, that's BS.

Bad computer animations, cheesy music, and fluffy New Age nonsense abound. No, I've got nothing against Eastern philosophy, in fact I lean that way myself. But I do know the difference between science, which demands rigorous observational evidence before making proclamations about truth, and pseudoscience, in which anyone with an interesting idea is allowed equal time and equal weight.The problem is, the movie presents itself as grounded in science. But in truth many of the talking heads interviewed are not even scientists at all, they're the same fringe practitioners of pseudoscience that prop that whole cottage industry up.

Researching the backgrounds of the members in the movie will reveal that this film is more of a New Age group's propaganda scheme.

It's lies and half truths wrapped up in a pretty documentary.I can't say it's 100% bad. I completely agree that how you do in life is intrinsically linked to your outlook. I.e. positive thoughts drive positive behavior which drive positive outcomes. However, I in no way agree that my positive thoughts have a direct physical affect on the outside world.

Quite frankly I can't see what one has to do with the other and I was rather ticked off I paid for this thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is sad when people make a movie like this, it is heart breaking when so many people believe it.","review":"This movie is great if you think that you are a victim of fate. That your DNA controls why you are in a dead end job or cannot quit smoking. Insipiration is its only redeeming quality. The basis of this movie in science is misguided and trivial at best.If you need a \\"Nobel Lie\\" to make you feel better, well this is your movie. If you actually want to understand physics,biology, philosophy or even reality there are thousands upon thousands of commonly ignored books on just such topics.It is truly sad when people make a movie like this, it is heartbreaking when so many people believe it. It shows that humanity as a whole is no longer capable of exercising either logic or reason. Ironically, if this movie makes sense to you, then \\"nothing\\" is your answer to its title and premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random, Incoherent, Psychobabble Disguised as Science","review":"This film is about as believable as the horoscopes in the back of tabloid magazines. Full of ridiculous twists of science and psychobabble. To say that people completely control their reality based on mental power choices among an infinite number of choices is ludicrous. Garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been","review":"Could have been a fascinating and informative DVD...if it had not included the intertwined cultist views.

This movie is for those that want to better themselves, those that believe they can change the world and create whatever they want in their lives. The people that gave this movie a one star are the type of people that are close minded, they probably are very negative, and they blend in with the rest of society, they are the type of people that will live and die and not make any difference in the world. Sure they might have made a few mistake. So what, that we are not 90 percent water. That made no difference in the point they were making in the film. I don't think someone has to be an expert in quantum physics to know what it means. I can talk a lot about baseball but I am not a professional baseball player. The point is valid throughout the movie. This movie is more then positive thinking as the amazon.com writer stated. It is about how your reality becomes by how you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD SEE","review":"THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN \\"WHAT THE BLEEP\\".

Every viewing shows a slightly different point of view. It has some really good insight and presents ideas and philosophies about quantum physics and life in an interesting and fun way. Some of the ideas might be a bit on the edge, but certainly gives some interesting perspectives to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ideas undone by special effects","review":"There are a lot of interesting and thought provoking ideas here, but the special effects were so distracting as to make the video hard to watch. My wife had to leave after just a couple of minutes for fear that the special effects were going to give her a migraine headache.Skip the video and buy the book with the same title. The book also goes into more depth than the video can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Contribution To American Cinema","review":"If you have no clue about how science and spirituality/religion could possibly be interconnected, or if you have no clue about the true nature of reality or quantum physics this movie is an absolute must see. There is a lot of negative reviews about this movie, but it's either from those who know WAY more about quantum mechanics than the average person or are from closed-minded fundamentalists. For these people the movie may seem a bit corny or contrary to their beliefs. If you are, however, an average (or even not so average) American, and are looking to be adequately entertained while learning something absolutely facinating and life changing, then definitely pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"This was a hack job in the editing room, resulting in a mess of confusion. I'm amazed that it took three directors. The old adage too many chefs are gonna spoil the soup. . .Arntz may have provided the funding, but this is definitely a Ramtha production as virtually everyone involved ( including Arntz ) are members. Create your own reality by rejecting theirs, when Dylan asked what everyone could take out of the 60's he replied, \\" Don't follow leaders. \\"I'm waiting for the cross merchandising with fast food chains to materialize. Could a Ramtha action figure, or create your own bubble set be on it's way?Life is a wonderful beautiful gift and I can't wait to see what happens next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"I attended a showing of this movie and was a little put off by the rabid intensity with which it was received. During an after show Q and A, any criticisms were booed, and people not completely embracing the film-makers' belief-system were branded close-minded and victims of a biased western educational world-view.I won't blindly follow anyone and did not appreciate this kind of mob rules mentality. Before closing people were encouraged to post on message, news-groups, and review-boards as often as possible.This movie was a jumbled mess. I think it's true purpose can be exposed by the many other products and services being offered under the What The Bleep Umbrella. . .Interestingly enough if one follows the money it leads to the door of a 35,000 year old spirit from Atlantis named Ramtha. This franchise has just taken it to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"It's a great movie for the open minded, and has a very interesting theme about quantam physics, it blew many of my friend's minds, it really opens up views on the world. It's a bit long and, dare i say it, almost boring in some points, but it's great to talk about with friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-physics nonsense!","review":"This movie has the look and feel of a documentary of sorts, with \\"interviews\\" with people who-- until you read their credits-- are made to appear to be credible scientists. In fact, they're not credible anything! One woman is actually someone who claims to be \\"channeling\\" some spirit. Another \\"scientist\\" has his degrees from...the Maharishi University, or something like that.The fictional drama woven between the interviews is confusing and, in my opinion, totally nonsensical.The only thing mildly entertaining or interesting is the special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt Quantum Popcorn for Oblong Brains","review":"I could only rehash what others have written far more eloquently, but the one, over-riding question at the forefront of my brain as the movie ended: \\"I actually watched this entire $#@*ing movie?!?\\"A sad waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate fraud!","review":"After a basically step-by-step path through some of the possible implications of Quantum Physics, the film suddenly leaps to conclusions for which it has not established a basis. I thought I had missed something, so I backed up and watched again. I realized that the whole thing was a ruse. They set you up with some valid science to make you receptive, and then attempt to slip unfounded and definitely unproven claims past you. I was disgusted. There is so much for us to learn about the questions posed by quantum theory and pretenders such as these pollute the waters. Some of the scientists shown are legitimate, but their presence is apparently used to attempt to make the fakes appear authentic. My recommendation for those interested in the topic of \\"what do we really know?\\" is the book \\"The Mind of God\\" by Paul Davies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open it up","review":"If you're thinking of buying or renting this as a Saturday night popcorn flick, then yeah, you're likely going to be disappointed.If you go to the What the Bleep website first and read up on what it's all about, then at least you'll know what you're getting into.The only way you're going to enjoy this...movie? documentary?... is if you are the kind of person who has an open mind to different views of our world, how it works and your place in it.If it doesn't change your life or even make you think about it, at the very least it's a wicked discussion topic afterwards, that is, if you can wrap your head around it.I bought it, I liked it, I've watched it twice and will watch it again - for no other reason than its given me something new to open my mind to that I've never even considered before."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Bleep You SHOULD Know Before You Go...","review":"This movie is the product of three students of JZ Knight, who channels \\"Ramtha.\\" Who's \\"Ramtha,\\" you ask? According to JZ Knight, he's a warrior who lived 35000 years ago on the lost continent of Lemuria, which then conveniently sank into the ocean, leaving no pesky evidence to counter JZ's claims. (JZ, by the way, is the bottle blonde talking head in the film with the sometime Elizabethan accent.) A lot of people are seeing this film in hopes of learning more about quantum physics and how it can enlarge our understanding of God. That's a worthy field of study, but alas, the answers are not to be found in this particular film. Some of the science may be legit, but the theological speculation is just New Age claptrap. \\"Ramtha,\\" by the way, has been copyrighted by JZ Knight.

This film isn't about anything save ego-stroking and New-Age Hackery trying desperately to use science as justification for it's inane blatherings. Some of the scientists were at one time reputable, but all save one have fallen well below the line of fakery.

Type ramtha and then a period and COM in your address bar to learn more. I think that you will recognise the woman on that page as the one interviewed in the video. One of the professors (I can't remember which) was really angered that they asked him questions to deliberatly mislead him into saying things that if taken out of context could support the premise of this film.

The randomness is a novel idea but it created a disjointed collage that interrupts my thoughts, concentration and enjoyment. The whole movie isn't even on one disc. They split it onto two discs. The interviews are a good addition but if you want to watch the movie buy the What the Bleep DVD separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Sagan type baloney","review":"I had to watch this movie for a philosophy class in college, when we were studying Carl Sagan, if you are dead set on watching this film I suggest you keep his baloney detection kit close at hand because youre going to need it. I really dont know what the flim makers were thinking when they made this film, I didn't find it interesting or \\"mind-blowing\\". I thought the whole idea of the film was overblown, and honestly as much as I hate saying it I had to watch it more than once just because I kept falling asleep. The only thing that kept me awake was looking for its fallicies, which were plenty. I would definately not recommend this film, but for the purpose for which I used it, then sure, why not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wellll","review":"Far be it from me to stop anyone from buying this movie.

Not much.","review":"Even if you knew what all the talking heads were really talking about, all about quantum mechanics and the collapse of the wave function, even if you knew all about that, this mess of a movie has got its physics, the little there is of it, all wrong. And because of its mix up between the micro world and the macro, the movie makes assertions about our sense of reality that are leaps of mysticism or faith.

At first the movie seemed to be about quantom physics. Then a while into the movie it became about some kind of pop phychology with tons of irritating computer animations and while that was going on I was thinking when are they going to get back to the quantom physics, then it got really preachy and new agey religious. At the end of the movie it became clear that this movie was religous propiganda disguised as science, sort of like battlefield earth. I am interested in science and metaphysics/philosiphy but this movie did a really bad job of trying to combine the two, and it came across as seeming very diseptive and dishonest.

I enjoy authors like Asimov, Sagan and Hawkings. I rented this movie because it said it was going to explain Quantum Physics. After watching it for twenty minutes, it became too painful to go on, so I stopped it and came to the Internet. After reading Amazon's description, I knew I needed to go no further.In this movie, science and unsupported claims are mixed in an effort to validate all kind of stuff. I highly recommend \\"The Demon Haunted World\\". In it, Carl Sagan speaks about J.Z. Knight (more accurately, JZ Knight, the \\"narrator\\" in this movie) as follows:\\"Suppose Ramtha were available for questioning... How does he know that he lived 35,000 years ago, even approximately? ... What were things like 35,000 thousand years ago? Either Ramtha is 35,000 years old, in which case we discover something about that period, or he's a phoney and he'll (or rather she'll) slip up.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not casual party viewing","review":"If you are versed in string theory, parallel universe thinking or quantum physics, you are ready for this DVD. It's not casual party viewing. It would be an excellent tool for a Salon, a discussion group, or a solitary seeker. It will expand your vision and raise questions that will require revisiting this DVD over and over again for deeper meanings.

I have studied the history of science (in graduate school!), so I know what a paradigm shift is. I have also had mystical experiences and believe that thought can affect matter (I've even bent a fork). But this movie feels like a con. Either quantum physics actually does \\"support\\" mystical experience, or it doesn't. I honestly don't care. But I don't like searching around on line and finding comments from scientists who were interviewed for this film and feel they were misrepresented. I don't like people presenting work like Emoto's, which is aesthetic, but not even remotely the product of sound experiemental methods, as if it is science. And the film itself reminded me of a bad acid trip. All the directors are members of the Ramtha cult. Unless you are, too, I would pass. Either you will dislike it, or you will fall for it.

I was disappointed to find the film did not site the people being interview (Mr. Joe Doe from Harvard, etc), nor did those people bring any specific evidence or background to what was said. They repeated the same opinion over and over. I expected this to have some explaination of quantum physics (like Elegant Universe), followed by at least a connecting and cohesive point of view derived from quantum physics. Instead, the producers made the science seem too incomprehensible for ordinary people to understand it, so they didn't explain it. In addition, the background music was so loud that it was impossible to concetrate on what was being said. I had to turn on the subtitles. Finally, the constant use of CG made it look like a ride at Disney, rather than an insightful documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film belongs down the rabbit hole as far as it can go!","review":"I have always loved to watch anything I could find on Quantum theories or space.

Instead it badly misrepresented quantum theory, continually extended various theories beyond the theory in an effort to link it with spirituality. The \\"experts\\" make the science sound so plausible, until you realize it's WRONG! For example, were the Native Americans in 1492 really unable to see Columbus' ships because their appearance was so far out of their reality that their brains were unable to process the images?

This film promotes pseudo-science and relies on no one really understanding quantum physics to make its dubious points. If you review the \\"scientist\\"'s credentials at the end of the film, none are physicists-- they are all discussing essentially spiritual and religious beliefs as if they were empirically verifiable. I loathe this type of pandering to ignorance, but admit that it's certainly easier than thinking and studying hard subjects.

It was close for awhile and the mighty lizard fought marvelously, even setting her wig alight. Ramtha's mouth then yawned wide and let loose a blast of pestilence so foul it took Godzilla's head clean off!Then, the terrible sound of flexing muscle, tearing sinew, and popping cartelidge echoed over downtown tokyo, as Ramtha dislocated her jaw, and proceeded to swallow Godzilla's smoking torso in three spastic grunts!I can't tell you what happens next, but be sure you will see the return of the sinister Dr. Emoto and his minions of ice.Ramtha kicked so much butt I was a little disappointed that she retired to the volcanorama... The rest of the movie was mostly scientists speculating on what if Ramtha and Godzilla were to breed, and if a tree crapped in the woods would it make a sound?More Ramtha next time, less blah blah blah.

The movie's production values are terrible, special effects that aren't so special, terrible acting, and terrible editing.2. Now to the cult stuff... The film is produced by members of the Ramtha religion/cult and basically offers second tier philosophers and scientist to back up auspicious claims about science, and metaphysics.3. The Ramtha cult is led by a woman, shown predominately in the film, who claims to channel a warrior spirit from Atlantis. The behavior of the religion she leads is quite suspect, attendance is mandatory; followers are asked to covert their possessions into gold and to store their gold at the Ramtha compound, etc etc. But don't take my word for it... please read about the Ramtha religion here and make your own mind up: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramtha[...]I would not suggest this movie at all... unless of course, you're looking to be indoctrinated by a cult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but scientifically bogus","review":"This is a flashy movie with lots of graphics, but it provides a very inaccurate view of Quantum Mechanics and how it should be interpreted. I am not convinced of either the \\"Many Worlds\\" interpretation or the traditional \\"Copenhagen\\" interpretation, but this movie goes into la-la land.The interviews with scientists have been edited very selectively to make it seem that the scientists are lending their credentials to the project. If one goes to the complete interviews on the supplemental disks, one finds that they actually don't agree with the point of view expressed in the movie.The only good thing here is the interviews with the scientists who actually study quantum mechanics.

Everytime I watch even just ten minutes of it, I wake up the next day with a spring in my step. Whether or not you agree with the science, the message is all positive.

Unfortunately, the writers use that as little more than a launch pad to promote a lot of unfounded metaphysical gobbledy-gook. It is, ultimately, just another version of \\"The Secret\\" only with the audacity to tie it to Quantum Theory.The opening sequences give an elementary intro to Quantum Theory which leads the viewer to assume that it will be an easily digestible exploration of complex theories and how they may engender a greater understanding of our place in the Universe. This hope is unfortunately unrealized as the movie then takes you through a repetitive series of 'interviews' with people who are already invested in metaphysical beliefs that have no basis in science.It's enticing at first, but ultimately audacious and disappointing. Go with the movie \\"Mindwalk\\" if you want something philosophically based in Quantum Theory that doesn't digress into make-believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the Bleep should I care?","review":"New-Agers. . .

Please differentiate between the many theoretic justifications for the behavior of particles, not merely the many worlds theory cherry picked to your \\" Intended Creationist View \\" To subscribe to such a two-dimensional revisionist view is to tread the shallow water of the creationists. Don't be one of those people who thinks a higher power put fossils of evolving relation dependent upon depth in the ground merely to test our faith. Don't be so ego-centric to believe that reality depends upon your conscious desire to impart your perception and truth upon it. Then again, do or say whatever you like, just don't be surprised when America sinks even lower internationally in education, and the best we can do is raise an army of droolers in tin-foil hats to help each other cross the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open minds and Watermelon Rinds","review":"This movie poses as some kind of revelation, but is nothing more than a confused mashing of meta-physics and quantum mechanics with no distinction between what we know and the world-view promoted by the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. This movie boasts a barrage of unbearable sound-bytes, cheesy computer anime, and talking heads promoting the nature of the universe through misappropriated quantum mechanics, and New Age scatalogical ejaculate.If you want to be misled by talking heads including a chiropractor, Atlantean God, and a defrocked priest/child molester then you have come to the right place.

Mostly, we have Jason singing rhythmic & melodic compositions with his gentle voice backdropped against acoustic strumming & guitar riffs.

The title track has some nice guitar playing, \\"Why don't I leave this woman? I've asked myself that question time and time again.\\" \\"The Campfire Song\\" has a nice carefree feel, \\"You've gotta let go & do some dancing.\\" Perhaps homage to Nebraska, \\"Stuck in North Platte\\" coaxes the toe to tap. \\"Cherry on Top\\" has a catchy tune with Amanda Vilzakovitch's guest vocals adding vocal variety. \\"Stay\\" & \\"Do-C-Do\\" are both nice tracks.

I went to multiple sites and nowhere did it specify whether \\"the pair\\" was 5 pounds or whether it was \\"a pair\\" of 5 pound weights.Well, it's a combined weight of 5 pounds, and if you have the foresight to check the shipping weight that will make it clear.The other thing is these don't fit well on wrists, which is what I specifically purchased them for. I wanted weights that would allow hand mobility when running on the treadmill, this doesn't really cut it. By the nature of the design you can't get them that snug so they jostle around on your arm when running, they are also bulky as hell.There might be an alternative out there, but if you are looking for some wrist weights I'd look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Amazing Southern Gospel!","review":"I've been a fan of The Happy Goodmans for more years than I can count.

For those, it is a fine work, clear, not deadening, comprehensive, well-organized, and with at least a trace of humor. If you master this book and acquire some vocabulary you will know Italian. For those who can carry on a conversation in Italian and think they know the language pretty well it can be an eye-opener--but in the end a most rewarding one.Might be a little daunting for those with no knowledge of the language at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended, even if you're not a MSTie","review":"I loved the MST3K series, and greatly mourn its passing. However, this book shows that Mike Nelson is more than just a prisoner on the Satellite of Love. His observations on everyday life are spot on and laugh out loud funny.As in any book of this type, there are a few essays that are less than funny, but they're greatly outnumbered by the ones that have you snorting milk out your nose while reading. (Assuming you're drinking milk, of course)The essay format makes this a perfect book to read during off moments, as long as you don't mind odd looks from passersby as you snicker and chortle. Well worth reading and adding to your comedy library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny,sharp,witty","review":"As a MST3K fan, I have been enjoying Mike Nelson's sharp,acerbic wit for years. But even non-Msties will love MInd Over Matters. It pokes fun at the mundane,ridiculous, and sometimes absurd aspects of modern American life. I especially enjoyed the chapters in wich he describes following his wife around to discover her secrets to making so many friends, and reading to his young sons at bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Score's Again: Even Better than His Last Effort.","review":"The author's last book \\"Movie Megacheese\\" was a wonderful assault on the imperfections of those movies and stars MST3K would never get a crack at.In this book Mike Nelson, aims higher to provide his humorous observations of the everyday annoyances and small events of life. All with his practical and midwestern-honed sense of humor.Particularly memorable to me are sections on \\"The Radio Shack Experience\\" and Mike's self-mocking account of his days acting in the theatre. Also memorable descriptions of living in Minnesota and investigating why his wife has so many friends.Mike Nelson as an essayist is right up there with David Sedaris in my opinion. Buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think that they call this over-sharing","review":"Hmmm. You know, Mike, after reading this book I am struck wondering if perhaps the best course of action in the future is to not write in detail every single thought you have. Maybe cull it down a bit. Maybe make a list of ten things that annoy you, and write about one of them.From Red Zone Cuba to \\"I don't like toast\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Regular guy with an Outstanding book","review":"Mike Nelson's \\"Mind Over Matters\\" is, quite frankly, outstanding.From cover to cover i was not disappointed.Mike's wit and storytelling are fresh and fun. His experiences are common to us all, but his take on them is funny, smart, and drier than the mojave.I had wanted to pick this one up for a long time and, when I did, I kicked myself for not doing so sooner.Whether or not you're a fan of MST3K or RiffTrax, it doesn't matter. Mike's take on the world is unique and hilarious. I couldn't stop reading the book and found myself actually laughing out loud at points - something I've never done while reading.Mike Nelson is just a \\"Regular Guy\\" going through life with a decidedly humorous outlook - one that, thankfully, he has decided to share with the rest of us.So, thank you, Mike. As long as you've got something to say then I'm all ears... or should I say eyes? (Eyes, right? 'Cuz I'm reading?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally Laugh-Out Loud Hilarious","review":"I have to admit I was a huge Mike Nelson fan before I picked this book up. I read both at work and on a flight, and I had a hard time not laughing audibly. He's great at pointing out the humor in the ordinary, such as leaf blowers and Radio Shack (which he calls a \\"portal to hell\\"). You don't have to be a fan of Mystery Science Theater to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Younger Andy Rooney...","review":"...that's what Michael J. Nelson has become. This book is a collection of essays remarking on everyday annoyances, the wife and kids, frustrations in stores and at parties, etc. The kind of thing old Andy Rooney has been droning on about for years. The book seems to be aimed at a young audience who a)loves Mystery Science Theater (as who doesn't?), b) has no idea who Andy Rooney is, c) laughs at the obvious. The humor is sometimes strained, pointless, and obvious. As with Mr. Rooney, there ARE some funny things sparsely sprinkled about. Hey, I'm a rabid Mystie, I like Mike and am glad he's found a new career. I just don't think Mind Over Matters is very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illusions of Power: The Fate of a Reform Government","review":"This is an excellent and first hand account of the misfortune, scandal and calamity that befel the Whitlam Government in Australia from 1972-1975. As the first Labor government in 29 years, the members of the new regime were presented with an opportunity for reform unequaled in Australian history. However, as the book details, the dream sooned turned to nightmare, as the party was rocked by scandal in the form of the loans affair and many other misfortunes. Finally, with the Senate blocking the flow of money needed to run the country, the Government was dismissed by the Govoner General John Kerr. So was the fate of a reform government.This is a lively and well written account of the events seen at first hand by Michael Sexton, who was personally involved in all the events and knew everyone involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read if you are serious about software architecture.","review":"Likes,The articulation of the Architecture Business Cycle (ABC), a theme that runs through-out the book.

Some of the best instructions and workmanship I have seen. They even included actual wrenches to do the job. The exercises are great and the machine delivers.The only reason I held back from 5 stars is the following.1. The machine shows to be white in color but I was shipped a dark Grey color.2. The instruction sheet on how to do the exercises is scant, and the very short videos on the website are to much of a pitch for the machine. Now it does not take a rocket scientist to do a stretch, but I think for the price they are charging they should include a video and have more in deph stretching on the website and include guidelines on how often to perform the exercises and what kind of degree gain you should be shooting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Set","review":"This takes probably a couple hours to put together with 2 people.

It's perfect for me because I needed something with shelves so I could put all my shirts shorts and jeans into one thing. I got tired of using a regular dresser and went for something with shelves.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good looking armoire","review":"The assembly was not hard, just time consuming. I completed 90% of it on my own, with just a little help near the end.We are actually using this for a pantry cabinet, because we wanted something that wouldn't be an eye-sore in the dining room. This works perfectly for that purpose. The door operates smoothly and the doored area has the dividers that make organizing the pantry a much easier job. I just put in some shelves in the back of the areas I am using for cans and I can see the contents much better, since it is so deep.We did buy extra felt pieces for the bottom to ensure it doesn't scratch our wood floor as we weren't sure the ones it came with would be adequate. I do like that it came with the marker to fix any blemishes.

She was a fasinating woman and \\"ahead of her time\\". This book helped me learn even more about her. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased biography","review":"The biographer's research is incomplete. Example: although it is claimed that Chanel was devoted to her business designing women's clothes, no one is interviewed who actually worked with Chanel. The business was abruptly shut down by Chanel after her employees went on strike in the late 30's. The single tidbit the author provides is that one of Chanel's employees, who had been with her since the infancy of her store, quit when Chanel refused to give her a raise. Many of the employees openly wept when they learned that this devoted employee was gone. Chanel took up with an officer in the german army during WWII. Was she a collaborator with the Petain government ??? Did she benefit from her cooperation with the germans during the war? The author is interested in presenting Chanel as a likeable person. I wonder how accurate this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"This book is Amazing!! The pictures inside the book are worth the price alone. It is quite thick, but reads quickly.

Ellis points out that our response to a given event is conditioned by our irrational beliefs (e.g., \\"She should not...!\\" \\"I can't stand it that....!\\" \\"How awful that...!\\"). You can monitor your level of anger (mildly disappointed? enraged? something in between?), seek out your irrational belief, and counter it with a rational statement. This brings your implicit beliefs to the surface and makes them available for examination. It also levels out your emotional response to one that's more appropriate to the actual situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"The book was in great condition.

I'm sure that the illustrator didn't even think about the implication. But because of the over incarceration of African Americans I am concerned about the subliminal message it sends. Because there are so few regular children's/youth books that depict pictures/images of African American children, it's a shame that this one is marred by that illustration. I know it seems touchy or paranoid to some and it may be, but being a prosecutor who sees almost exclusively African American boys and men incarcerated I may be a bit touchy or paranoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appropriate for Traumatized Children","review":"I wish that one of the earlier reviews of this book had mentioned the fact that many of the illustrations are almost surrealistic, distorting the image of the little girl in semi-grotesque ways. While these pictures might be viewed as humorous or silly by typically developing kids(?), I had purchased the book to use with young traumatized children who generally find these kinds of distortions to be disturbing and frightening. I had been looking for good picture books with positive images of children of color, but due to these illustrations, will not be able to use this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"self esteem","review":"This is a cute book to give children a sense of self and how great and special each child is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proud to be me!","review":"David Catrow brings Karen Beaumont's story about a young African-American girl to life with his vibrant and hysterical illustrations.

(2004). I Like Myself! Illus. by David Catrow. San Diego, CA: Harcourt, Inc.I Like Myself! is one big poem about self-esteem. A little girl uses rhyme to show us that she loves herself for who she is, and nothing anyone would say about her could ever change that.The illustrations in this delightful little story are very simple, but extremely colorful and cheery. They draw in the reader without being too busy to distract us from the text. The layout of each page is different from the previous, with some text wrapping around pictures, some apart from them, and other text set within pictures. There is a perfect marriage between the poem and pictures that really allows the reader to feel the rhythm of the story in a way that would be difficult to imagine without the aid of these fabulous pictures.I would definitely recommend this book for young children who are learning that everyone in the world is different, but that is what makes the world great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like This!!!","review":"I love, love, love this book!

I liked that version so I kept exploring. I have everything they put out now, and am eagerly waiting the next release and tour. The band is from Newfoundland (Canada). Their style (for about half the songs they do) can be very roughly described as taking old sea songs and whaling shanties (chanties?), putting them to tasty modern melodies, and then singing them with 3-4-5 part harmonies. Beautiful, joyous, energetic, compelling, funny. They also do love ballads, a few covers, some harder songs, etc. I've seen them live and they're every bit as good (sometimes better) live as they are in the studio.

The best part about GBS, their energy, comes through loud and clear on Road Rage. The versions of General Taylor, Mari-Mac, and especially Lukey blow away the studio album.

It made him seem more human to me, even though I have read most of his travel books and several of his novels. Personally, it was hard for me to imagine why V.S. Naipaul was worth keeping as a friend. For example, his treatment of his wife, Pat, as described by Theroux, left me angry and disgusted. Yet, Theroux makes it clear that it was Naipaul who first encouraged him as a young writer. How splendid it must have been to be validated by such a distinguished and accomplished author. And, thus, how devasting to be cut off suddenly and without any recognizable reason after 30 years of friendship, tolerance, and yes, love. To me, this book comes out of Theroux's pain and confusion, and the resulting look at his very real humanity will stay with me for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys Boys boys...","review":"Certainly a very good book, and well worth a read. I must say it is one of the best Theroux books I have read in quite a while, something seems to have driven him with this book, and the result is a very intriguing story. Naipaul does not come off whiter than white in this book, but then neither does Theroux. Naipul comes off worse than Theroux in this book, but with only one side of the story told, I can only conclude that they are as bad as each other. Definatly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This alleged memoir is novelist's invention.","review":"V.S.Naipaul, the subject of \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow,\\" told Paul Theroux to \\"Tell The Truth\\"; the author's father told him to \\"Be Kind.\\" At book's end, Theroux clains that when he was being kind he was not telling the truth. What then in the narrative is true? The book wavers among respect for Naipaul, gratitude to Naipaul, resentment of Naipaul, disgust at Naipaul, hatred of Naipaul. The book is not the memoir it purports to be. It's a novel. The alleged total recall of decades-old conversations--with everyone , not only with Naipaul--words, syntax, intonations, all delivered within quotation marks--is a novelist's invention. The last chapter, which denies every respectful statement previously made about Naipaul or his books, is so bitter in spirit it reveals \\"Sir Vidia's Shadow\\" to be a work of vengeance. As a novel prefaced with \\"Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely...\\" I would have enjoyed it, knowing much of it to be a novelist's license."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unofficial Biography","review":"This may be the most interesting book that Theroux has ever written because he delves deeply into what makes Naipaul tick. He also reveals much of himself and what he drew from the relationship. This is a story of the mentor turning against his protege.Theroux seems to be saying to Naipaul: you don't want me anymore. Okay, but I'll write a book. He also mentions the official biography of Naipaul. Now the official biography of Naipaul will be much more difficult as the biographer will have to spend time on what Theroux said.It seems to me that by writing Sir Vidia's Shadow, Theroux will always be Naipaul's shadow. The two will be linked forever. This will bother Naipaul very much, and it will be very amusing to Theroux."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing Lives","review":"I haven't read anything by V.S. Naipaul but I've read nearly every book by Paul Theroux (all but three).I found SIR VIDIA'S SHADOW completely fascinating because it illuminates the private lives of two internationally-known authors in ways I never imagined: their boldest moves were frequently made out of poverty and desperation, their struggles for money long after their books appeared in print, their day-to-day lives while the world reads their words.Most of the reviews praise Theroux's handling of his relationship with Naipaul and I agree with them. It's endlessly absorbing and interesting (and funny!). But I also enjoyed how he tracks his own career as well as Naipaul's.This book is a must-read for anyone interested in living a writer's life--or how others have done it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine book","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and agree with other reviewers that it sheds a lot of light on the creative process and, I would add, the natural process of aquiring and eventually losing a mentor. Read this after \\"My Other Life\\" for complementary narratives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship or Worship?","review":"Paul Theroux has been criticized for betraying his mentor and friend V.S. Naipaul. Except for some mean-spirited jabs near the end, most of Theroux's account of their friendhip suggests that he is still in awe of Naipaul. One feels a little sorry for him that his hurt is so deep that it has driven him to the extraordinary act of writing this book.A good read, this book only reinforces Naipaul's reputation as a literary genius and an original. Theroux admits that Naipaul made him as a writer. He generously mentored him, encouraged him and spent time reading and criticizing his work. By contrast, Theroux complains in the book of being asked to write the jacket cover of one of Naipaul's works.I enjoyed the book because it gave me an intimate look at one of my favorite authors (Naipaul). I don't think less of him after reading it. My advice to Theroux would be the same as Naipauls, \\"Take it in the chin and move on\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bitter","review":"After reading this book, I couldn't help but wish Theroux had let some years (or even decades) pass before he wrote about Naipaul. Perhaps, with the passage of time, the bitterness that so evidently taints the latter parts of the book would have been damped, and Theroux would have been able to treat his subject with more clear-sightedness and fairness. Perhaps he would have been able to write the book he claims to have written -- an examination of friendship and of the relationship between two writers. But as it is, Theroux's sight seems clouded by an inchoate passion, and much of his book reads like the self-justifying ramblings of a jilted lover: no careful examination, no insight, no growing awareness -- only a laundry list of Naipaul's idiosyncrasies and character flaws. I think only people who are really interested in Naipaul and/or Theroux will want to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't add up","review":"A very unsatisfying book from a master of the travel genre. Theroux is out of his depth with the demands of writing a memoir. (What is strength in geography is a weakness in biography.) Has strange errors of fact. Theroux says that Patrick White's book was one of the finalists for 1979 Booker Prize when it wasn't. Makes us question his powers of recall."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shadow best left on the shelf","review":"Memoirs are ultimately about balance and Theroux fails to find this in the book. Recounts some interesting incidents from the years of their friendship together but it is hard to tell how much of it is fictional. Theroux comes across as a very petty minded individual who projects his own traits on his subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Quite Good","review":"First off, I think that when it comes to travel narratives, Paul Theroux is unsurpassed. His ability to describe the misery of a trip is classic. When it comes to fiction I am convinced Paul Theroux should stick to travel narratives. As good as he is on a train, he stinks in a fictional setting. I expected the novelist Theroux in Sir Vidius's Shadow. I got the travel essayist. Who cares about sour grapes. That's life. Sour grapes put into words is something to be savored. Whereas I have read The Great Railway Bazaar et.al many times. Sir V's Shadow is a \\"one and done.\\" Still, it was unexpectedly quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compare this with Naipaul's own tale of apprenticeship","review":"In Naipaul's 'A Way In The World', there is an account of his own relationship with an elder writer, Foster Morris. In spare, unsentimental and clinical prose, Naipaul dissects this relationship, dealing with the help and the let-downs that he received. Anyone who's read Theroux's self-serving rant would be well-advised to read 'A Way In The World' to see how Naipaul himself writes about his relationship with a writer during his younger days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Love the squares!

Love it!Thanks, Brenda200 Crochet Blocks for Blankets, Throws, and Afghans: Crochet Squares to Mix and Match"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Companion","review":"A superb companion for any crochet lover! It has detailed descriptions for crocheting in text & visuals. A big plus is the mix & match of colours & suggestions. I'm really pleased I obtained this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful crochet squares","review":"This book is the best one that I have read and plus it's very easy to follow. I haven't been crocheting very long and this book is easy to follow and I will have it for a long time to come. My friends n family are shocked at what I can do. Plus crocheting relaxes me so I give this book 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as it looks","review":"This book is beautiful to look at, but the instructions are very poor and confusing. My first square worked out just fine, but it was a simple one. (# 52?) The more difficult squares which are harder to intuit have confusing directions and I tried three blocks three times each and could not make them come out like the picutures and was confused by the directions when actually putting hook to yarn. Dangit! Also, the two blocks I tried successfully are not the same size.The pros are that the pictures are good and she shows several blocks in different colors. She also shows several projects and different ways to put together various shapes of blocks. Her use of color is lovely IMO.Just such a disappointment not to be able to create some of my favorite blocks because the directions are so poor. I will stick to books with charts from now on. This is such a let-down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"200 Crochet Blocks for Blankets, Throws and Afghans by Jan Eaton","review":"This book is excellent for anyone who wishes to have a variety of crochet squares (blocks) to make blankets, throws and afghans. I also used the blocks to make some pillow covers to match the blanket that I am now making. Well written and excellent instructions. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crochet is Back!","review":"This book uses some old, some classic, and many modern patterns and styles to make squares that can be joined into an afghan. Another way the patterns could be used is to multiply them and make an afghan from one single square. Or, you could join squares into a scarf, hat, or whatever else you can think of. However, there are NOT 200 DIFFERENT patterns. Many of the squares are the same pattern done in different colors. That is really the only problem I had with the book. It is well worth the investment as there are a lot of patterns and the showing of different color groups does provide some inspiration and lets readers know that they can use their own creativity to extend the beauty of the art of crochet."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent selection of blocks","review":"I love the color choice section at the beggining, incredible graphics and book desing. well explaind patterns. must say many \\"new patterns\\" are just color changes. anyway love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable crochet reference","review":"I would recommend this book to crocheters of all skill levels. The skill levels are shown by the number of crochet hooks by the pattern. One hook is the easiest and three the hardest. They also list any difficult stitch at the start of the pattern so you know what to expect. I am a beginner and there were plenty of pretty patterns to start on and I can now do two hook patterns. I liked how they showed which combinations work together and made suggestions for different color themes. As another reviewer said, some of the colors they use are rather Blech! but you can always do your own thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"200 blocks - nearly infinite possibilities","review":"If you are looking for inspiration for stitch patterns, color combination, block mix & matching - then this book will deliver. Being a novice to crochet, this book has opened my eyes to the many possibilities a crocheted block can offer. I view each block as a mini project, which is less intimidating to me, allowing the opportunity for me to improve my skills while learning new stitches & techniques. I feel anyone, beginner to experienced, will find inspiration within the pages of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like blocks, you'll like this book!","review":"Sure, some of the blocks are repeats of each other, using opposite colors etc., but this book is fantastic if you like to make blocks for your crocheted projects. Each block has written instructions (no diagrams) with symbols indicating the difficulty and whether it's worked in rounds or rows. Very handy. Also the author gives a suggestion for other blocks in the book that you can mix and match with each other to make a bigger project. Eaton also has some educational stuff in there about color, mixing block styles and blanket layout. I'm also a huge fan of the table of contents because it has thumbnails of each block so you can see them without having to flip to the actual pattern. It's a nice touch. A techniques section is included for how to do the stitches, change color, increase/decrease, and join. She also includes what brands/colors of yarns she used for the samples.I have already used this book a lot. I'm a big fan and am so glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 30 or 50 crochet blocks","review":"This book has a couple cute squares in it, but a lot of them are just plain crochet with stripes added. The author changes the colors of the stripes and then calls it a whole different block, really inflating the actual number of blocks you get for your money in this book. There are some decent-looking squares, so it's worth checking out from the library but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Also, the color choices strike me as kind of garish, making it difficult to get too inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good resource.","review":"My friend referred me to this book. We both use it all the time. I even used one of the patterns to make a flower pot cover.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading book","review":"While some of the patterns are quite nice, as other reviews say, there are not actually 200 different crochet blocks. The number is closer to 100 when discounting repeats of the same pattern with different colors. A dishonest title also disappoints in other ways. Also, while the blocks are supposedly all the same size, they are not, so you have to add or pull out rows in order to join blocks together. Since stitch counts are not given at the end of row directions, this makes it even harder to decide which blocks will easily fit together. Additionally, some blocks will not lie flat when created as written. Thus, while some of the patterns are quite pretty, I would not recommend purchasing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elaine, Sunnyvale, CA","review":"I have been crocheting for 30+ years but wanted to learn some new stitches so bought this book. While the colors and the squares are just beautiful, I found the instructions on several of the blocks very confusing. In more than one case, I had to look at the picture to figure out what to do next. Lucky my crochet experience allowed me to do that. I wouldn't recommend this book for a beginner and maybe even intermediate as it just isn't written clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of color","review":"I love color and this book will certainly help you add it to your blanket or whatever you want. The squares can easily be modified to make a skirt or even a sweater, think of all the compliments you would get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception","review":"When I ordered this book there was another book with a title that was almost identical, but it had a different cover so I ordered it. Knowing there are an infinite number of crocheted squares, I thought I would be getting the ultimate in diversity.As it turns out, I had ordered two books that were identical beyond the cover. To add insult to injury, I had to wait 4 months for the second book.I know publishers will often change covers and I have always thought of it as being deceptive and this was no different. Somehow Amazon found out about this and the second book is not being offered any longer, but now I have to go through the extra time to return one of the books.I am very disappointed in this practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"crochet book","review":"My daughter loves to crochet and has found this book to be very helpful. She has made several afghans and also has used the patterns to make some baby crochet throws for friends. She felt the directions were easy to understand. Would recommend for any person who loves to crochet."},{"rating":"1","title":"many errors","review":"Beautiful book.But every block I have tried has a mistake and I have not been able to complete one.Very disappointing.I would not purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book but....","review":"I just love this book, it is really well done and the patterns are amazing... that said, I wish the authors/publisher had included graphic patterns to accompany the written patters. I am new to crochet and find many of the patterns a little confusing.All in all, it is a beautiful book and a worth while purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For Beginners","review":"This was my crash course to granny squares. There are lots of square options plus some sample finished patterns. Directions are more or less self explanatory except for occasions like when you are making the shell trimming. I went through a few unravellings with that one. All in all it wasn't a bad purchase. Made my first afghan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a 5 star book....","review":"The book really is a must for those who are seriously interested in making items using granny squares. The book has easy to follow directions, clear pictures, and many different types of granny squares. Also, it provides many different color combinations one can use when making a granny square(s). If you love granny squares as I do, this is a must add to your collection of crochet books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Experienced Crocheter!","review":"I purchased this week at my local craft store. This is a great book for the beginner. The patterns are very simple to work - I found them to be boring - most are in single crochet. There were only 2-3 difficult patterns - not enough to keep my attention. THat's why the 2 star rating..... THe book is bright and colorful and would make a nice gift for someone learning to crochet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice picture/hidden costs","review":"I've owned this TV almost 2+1/2 years now. The picture is nice, it has nice sound, the on screen menu is intuitive and easy to use. I would give it a much higher rating if it were more reliable. The picture went black after having it less than a year and getting warranty repair was not simple or easy to arrange, however it was provided at no cost to me and included pickup and return. The TV worked fine for another year plus, but a couple weeks ago I started having power supply problems again - turn it on and the opening screen flashes on and off for a while before it comes on, a few seconds at first, now a few minutes.If your shopping for a new flat panel TV, be sure to include the cost of an extended warranty for this one when comparing prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for the money","review":"I purchased this from a store that was going out of business, again leary of the Audiovox line but it was cheap so I figured what the heck. Turned out to be some of the best money I could have spent, this TV has been a gem. I use it in my bedroom with my PS3 and my Apple TV and it doesn't miss a beat. Well worth the cost, and it is 1080i."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not purchase again","review":"My wife bought this for me for Christmas a year and a half ago. I used it to inflate car tires a few times a year. A few months ago the pressure would not build past 42lbs. After some troubleshooting I replaced the safety valve for about 24.00 (Sears Parts Store). Still would not build. I ended up taking apart the piston assembly, it looked fine no burnt or scratched valve no bad piston ring. Re-assembled and it was fixed! 100lbs psi again. Two days later down to 25lbs. This thing is loud and after taking this apart I can see why its cheap. The only replacement for the piston I can find is the whole motor/piston assembly which is probably more than a new compressor. Look elsewhere for a better quality unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy man advantage","review":"This small compressor is all that i need for maintaining my auto tires, lawn mowers and other equipment. It's light, very portable,andeasy to handle. I can take it inside or outside without any problem. I like it very much. I am a senior citizen and handy man. It fills the bill.Thanks, George Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pancake air compressor","review":"Works great! Good value for price and what we wanted. Only complaint is that it is noisy, especially when used in a confined area. Would recommend to anyone who needs a small, very portable compressor."},{"rating":"1","title":"L-O-U-D","review":"This little thing is unbelievably LOUD. I took it back the first day I had it. So, I can't say it's not reliable. but that was my impression that I got from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"compressor","review":"I received the product the next day! Although I haven't yet used it, it looks brand new. The package included a coiled air hose and a couple of attachments. Looking foward to using it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting people at customer service tried to rip me off.","review":"I needed to purchase a filter for this product which I did on line, but in three weeks when I had not received the filter I place a call to the mfg. I was told that the piece I ordered was not made any more that there is another product the will do the job. I ordered two filters and a few days later received the filters. Two weeks later i received a so called filter in the mail with they charge to my credit card. I called the company and told them the story but they said you did order this and if you return it there will be a restocking fee. But I told them that I already ordered the right filter and was told that the internet order would be deleted. They said they had no such written info that I did that. They were rude and insulting to me. Please do not purchase and Campbell Hausfeld products. By the way I returned it and they failed to credit my credit card. Very bad company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Nice","review":"This little air compressor is ideal for pumping all of the kids balls and pool toys up. It is also good to add that extra few pounds of air to your tires every now and then.....Nice gadget to have...."},{"rating":"2","title":"meets my expectations","review":"I purchased this product because I was tired of having to drive somewhere to pay 75 cents for air for my 3 vehicles. For my needs it is perfect, it's loud, but I expected that so I just wear ear protection. For the price I paid of $42.74 you can't beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"JUNK junk junk junk junk junk JUNK junk junk junk junk junk JUNK junk junk junk junk jun JUNK junk junk junk junk junk did I say Junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow --Opened It and Turned It On and It Was So Loud - Could not use it","review":"It is small and lightweight- easy to set up. Then the bad news..... I turned it on and it was so loud that I could not use it.I had to return it. I would not recommend this product. My ears are still ringing and all I did was put air in a bike tire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air Compressor","review":"Though a good price, this unit is not powerful enough to use tools such as an impact wrench. You should consider it ok for inflating tires but it takes quite a while to build up enough air pressure to even do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and weak","review":"Makes as much noise (or more) than some full sized compressors. As another review said, you'll probably want ear plugs if you need to let it run for longer than a couple minutes. The noise is really obnoxious. A compressor this small and weak should not make this much noise! It doesn't really put out much air either. Unless you're looking for something to put out a steady stream of low volume air, you'd be much better off buying a nice bicycle pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...very weak","review":"I was really excited about this purchase since it meant I wouldn't have to drag out my big compressor every time I needed to add air to a tire. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by this \\"tool\\". All I wanted was a simple & portable compressor to inflate tires and the kids balls, etc. First time I tried to inflate a car tire, it failed to deliver, meaining now I have a $40 soccer ball & bicycle pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I expected...sort of","review":"Portable air compressors make noise and this one makes alot of noise. But it's what I expected from an oil free unit that is portable. It seems well constructed and I put it through it's break in period as per instructed, we'll see if it can last. The accessories are lame: tire air chuck, ball needle and 2 tiny filler nozzles, have to get an air gun and the tire chuck looks weak. The hose provided is horrible it doesn't extend at all, I can pick up the unit with it and it barely uncoils.Once I get the accessory issues tamed i'll use it to blow off hard to reach equipment. Really don't have room for a larger compressor will make due with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Compressor","review":"I purchased one of these, and returned it after it's first use. Box says 100 PSI max, it could not maintain 10 PSI constant, and just like other people have said, it's loud, loud, loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap (Is there anything less than one star?)","review":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I owned one of these units for about 9 months and used it sparingly. It is now dead. Dead! After using it maybe a dozen time, the compressor died.I used it for bike tires only because it did not have the power to fill up a car tire. It takes about 5 minutes to fill up the tank and generates enough air to only fill up one bike tire and maybe a little bit of a second one. You'd be better off to save your money and use your mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, but loud","review":"If you intend to use this machine indoors, I suggest buying a pair of earplugs with it. It is deafeningly loud. On our farm, we have a much bigger compressor from Campbell Hausfeld that produces a quarter of the racket. Still, the FP2028 is sufficient for light chores around the home, so I'll give it a mostly positive review. The compressor comes with a tire chuck, needle, and pig tail hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air Hose is flimsy and useless","review":"I received the compressor today and when I was taking the it out of the box the air hose snapped in two. I don't know how well the compressor works since I have to find another air hose! Let's see if Amazon fixes this situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"very light duty","review":"This unit is essentially a toy. Ii is very noisy and it takes a long time to fill the air tank. Once the tank is full it is consumed quickly. It took me nearly 20 minutes to fill a tire. I had to jack up vehicle for the tire to inflate!Usefull only to fill toys.Amazon service is Outstanding! They ship promptly, you get what you order, and it's super easy to track your items. Very satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for Money","review":"I couldn't find a compressor at this low price for household use. I used the brad nailer (got to buy it extra) to quickly put up trim molding. My lawn tractor tire was flat, and off the rim, so I was able to pop it back on with the compressor. I aired up the car tires. If you want to run a nail gun, forget it, you got to go for something more heavy duty. This is not a whisper quiet compressor; but for the price I don't care. It runs off household electricity. The compressor runs till the tank is at 100 psi, then cut off. If you have it turned on, and pressure drops, the compressor cycles on. It is small and light weight, a plus. I only gave it a 4 star rating because my last Campbell Hausfeld compressor lasted only three years. It had a rechargeable battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD, and I mean LOUD, and POOR quality","review":"we've had this unit for a little over 6 months - every use is very LOUD, and now it's seized up, and not working at all, so it's back to Amazon for a better quality replacement. I checked warranty issues, and it's only for a month!! what a shame. No more CH items for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Junk!!","review":"Based on mixed reviews, I bought this compressor locally in case I needed to return it, and I was right. I wanted to upgrade from a little 12V compressors, so I could inflate my cars' tires quickly. This thing was very noisy and I couldn't even inflate the tires in one car. It took the longest time, and I couldn't even tell what was the final pressure on the tires. I couldn't stand it and returned it the next day.Unit is cheaply made even for $55, and the external gauge didn't even work. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underpowered & Noisy","review":"I bought this unit in hopes of using it as an inflator and to blow dust and grass off my lawn tractor. The instructions are pretty useless. You need to use pipe tape to seal every fitting. Even when properly set up, the unit never reaches anything close to 100psi. The best I was able to get was 50. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is it's a better inflator then what I had. There has to be a good light duty air compressor out there but this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Soooooooooo noisy I almost didn't notice it never made it to 85 psi. Luckily Amazon is Amazon. Very easy to return. Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor performance of Cambell compressor","review":"1st compressor arrived broken. After normal return hassle and time the second Cambell Hausefield 1 gallon compressor (supposed 110 psi available) arrived and DEFLATED my 68 psi tire from about 50 psi to flat as a pancake and thus unable to move aircraft at all until I arranged with the airport manager to bring his compressor to inflate my tire. I cannot use this compressor for anything and will again return it. What a pain and over a six week period also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and cheap quality","review":"Pros: It works for the most part.Cons: Like the other reviewers said, it's REALLY loud. The other main drawback is that the included nozzle heads are exceptionally low quality and just about useless. Please do not be tricked into thinking this is a good deal because of the \\"Accessory kit.\\" Using the included accessories is an exercise in frustration.In summary, if you are willing to shell out more money for good quality accessories, this thing is mostly usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for most projects","review":"Too small in size to inflate car tires only good for bikes and such. Returned and bought 3 gallon from harbor freight for same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I ordered this product and was worried there might be a problem. It turned out that there wasn't. They sent this product really fast and I would recommend buying from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"Bought this to provide me with a quick way to pump my bike tires, and quickly came to the realization, that this was a bad pump for the job. The quality of the pump is lacking at best (all plastic casing, and a lot of loose joints and junctions). It took forever to get the pan filled to the shut off point, and once full, had a really low rate of compression, so the PSI depleted in a few seconds. The hose is awful. Yet again more cheap plastic, not flexible, and the threads where the attachments screw on cracked, when tightening the tire inflation nozzle. I didn't even bother with getting my money back, and ended up removing the pump and tossing the rest of the unit in the garbage. Do yourself a favor save up your money and get a better quality one then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD!!!","review":"I bought this compressor after reading other reviews on it that said that it was quiet & another site said that this was supposed to be quiet. I was excited when I got it home and hooked it up, but then I turned it on and it was so loud that I had to leave the room, after 30 seconds I started getting a bad headache!!! I bought this for my computer repair company to blow out used computers so that I would not have to buy air in a can, but I can't use it for that without driving out my customers. This thing was so loud that it sounded like there was a broken piston rod, I was sure that was what the problem was, but it filled with air so that can't be it. I went to Menards and found them selling the same set and asked them to plug in their floor model and it was really loud also, though not as loud as mine. I wish that I had never bought this wimpy, piece of junk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy air","review":"Pro's: CheapCon's: Very noisy, need earplugs. Hard to inflate tires, as attachment won't depress when pressed unto tire valve, especially if tire very flat. Have to use before tank builds pressure, and hold valve stem so it doesn't sink into tire rim."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother - much better choices","review":"I bought this to add air to car tires, bike tires, balls, etc. Here is my experience.... Plug in, let run for a few minutes. Both of my kids ran inside because this thing is so loud - I put in ear plugs. It reached pressure after running a minute or two then shut off. I started adding air to the car tire and after adding about 2 psi, the loud comressor kicks in again. The 1 gallon tank does not hold enough air for a car tire. After topping off four car tires, which was a 10 minute process, the compressor stared groaning like it was ready to overheat. I let it cool off and then repeated with some bike tires - same disappointment. I put it back in the box and brought it back. I just got a Black & Decker Air Station, which I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little compressor","review":"This is my second campbell hausfeld compressor. My old one was a battery operated unit that lasted for 8ish years until the battery inside wouldn't hold a charge. The compressor seemed rock solid though. This unit seems very well built. Pumps to the advertised PSI and holds at the PSI. Regulators work well also. Accessories are good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great toy","review":"For the price that I paid, the toy is not worth it. It's very lite and just feels cheap. My daughter got the toy for xmas 05 and if she broke it my January 06, I would not be angry with her at all being that whatever the toy is made out of seems very cheap.

This Cd is an exquisite experience. Here, his voice is as glorious as it is live. This cd will make you want to see and hear him live. The repertoire is a vast spectrum, ranging from the tormented music of Don Jose in Bizet's Carmen to the triumphant music of Siegmund in Wagner's Die Walkure. There is music from Montemezzi, Verdi, Strauss, Weber, Barber, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Lee Hoiby \\"Tempest\\" (a role that was written for Mr. Trussel and premiered by him). This Cd is an exciting combination of music that isn't recorded very often. And it is all sung with great passion and a full, beautiful tenor voice. The Janacek Philharmonic Orchestra is both robust and delicate, when need be.Thank god, A REAL TENOR!!!This is a rare find and something worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to listen to...","review":"Someone gave me this CD as a gift, and it's amazing I still talk to the person. This CD is full of bland, flat performances from a strained, undertalented, overblown tenor who should have retired, or better yet, never have started his career.The only reason this CD is worth owning is to have a recording of Hoiby's \\"Be Not Afeard\\" which is a beautiful piece totally murdered by the performer.On the bright side, this is a perfect gift for someone you hate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Back when they sounded like everyone else...","review":"Well, I became a fan of The Number Twelve Looks Like You about 2 years ago with the release of \\"An Inch of Gold..\\" and especially with their MUCH BETTER full length, \\"Nuclear Sad Nuclear.\\" What makes \\"Nuclear\\" such a great record is that it stands out as being so different from the hundreds of other releases every year coming from bands who perform this style of music.What makes this album so terrible is it sounds just like everyone else. Not much originality and definitely missing a lot of the quirks and nuances that make this band so entertaining today. This is before The Number Tweleve really came into their own and became innovative. If you gladly listen to whatever is put out in this form of music, and don't actually have a concern for lyrical improvement, and intellgent/original musical arrangements, then this album will make you happy, otherwise just get \\"Nuclear\\" and enjoy this excellent band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"Ok, I love anthologies. I have been reading them for the past 14 years. I like getting to know new authors alongside old ones. This anthology was a waste of my time. The stories were trite and cliche. One or two stories rises above the mediocre and is a pleasent enough read. I liked Von jocks \\" The Fairest\\". The story centers around a woman who becomes obsessed with her looks and lose herself in the process, but finds her again self after looking in to a magic mirror. The story was funny, intresting and well written. Sad to say this one was the only story to stand out in my mind. As an editor Denise Little can an usally do better, I guess thats what makes this collection so disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Product Description","review":"Purchased this hitch based on the Product Description on the Amazon web page which stated it would fit on a 2002 Honda Civic, would install in 20 minutes and, most important to me, it required NO drilling into the car's body. First, the photo on the web page showed a receiver hitch which was completely different from the hitches I received. (I returned the original hitch and reordered after talking with Amazon's rep on the phone.) Second, both hitches, Models 11206 and 112062, are the same hitch and both require drilling 4 holes in the floor pan of the trunk. I'm still searching for a Class 1 receiver hitch which requires no drilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"40 mb click disk","review":"during the search the sale was listed as a 10 pack of disksonly one camei donot think i will buy from this site again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"I found this book to be sensationalized, good, fun ,fiction, but not to much truth to it.

If you knew Darryl you would see his personality in the writing. Darryl entertains, sensationlizes, he is a great tall tale teller and this book is a perfect example of that.

The first dimwitted reviews for this particular album don't even address the album at all! First of all, the other \\"inspired by\\" soundtrack, which does contain the songs by Leigh Nash and Beth Orton and the like, is a rather good listen. But this album is also worth buying because of the great score effort put forth by Mychael Danna. The strings, and use of bansuri, help to provide a sweet, simply, yet soulful musical rendering of the movie. It's great background music for when you need to relax, do some catch-up work, or even an intimate dinner. Whatever your purpose, do listen (and hopefully buy) this CD for its relaxing---and, perhaps, inspirational---nature.Oh, and the Gwyneth Paltrow rendition of \\"Cruisin'\\" is on the DUETS soundtrack, BUDDY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd from fairly unknow band","review":"this cd is fantastic, I hadnt heard the morning after girls before I saw them open for BRMC. they put on a pretty amazing show, very much a wall of sound. the cd does the live experience pretty good justice, the songs are well written and have an exciting sound"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the Layout","review":"First of all I and my children enjoy all the Mr. Putter and Tabby stories, they are great. Unfortunately who ever converted this series to Kindle format didn't do this series any justice. There will be a page that looks copied directly from a paper book, the image small and faint and tiny text. then there will be full sized picture, and then the next page will be regular kindle text. So you will read one page and then skip over then next couple or you will be reading the same text twice and straining your eyes. Too frustrating for me as an adult and I know I young reader wouldn't even bother. I strongly suggest checking out these ebooks from your local library before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste like soap","review":"This tastes like soap. And it sticks with you forever; drinking water doesn't help remove it. I recommend this for anyone who needs to wash someone's mouth out with soap - much less messy.I bought a pack at World Market because it was unique and out of the 10 people or so I've given a piece - only one likes it. So there is a market for this.Also the smell comes thru the package and if you hold the package too long,your hand starts smelling like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cup of tea","review":"I am sure this is a good quality product and it has surely endured for many years.

I used to get them at Vermont Country Store, but they no longer carry them. I love the way they smell and taste. It's exactly as I remember them. It is a bummer when they get broken, but that used to happen to me with the other places I bought them, too. I think they are just fragile by nature. Not everyone is into them by any means, but the people who love them REALLY love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Litt Riffs","review":"I had to have this book for a literature class.

A fun setting, with fun and interesting characters. Increasingly difficult puzzles as the game progresses, with minigames ranging from poker to checkers, all well done. Even the gunfights are well done, and humor is present all the time, and in every character. A little mystery and horror is present in the game as well. A great story, a great adventure game, a great buy. This game will make you want to REALLY be in the old west."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a great game. I have owned this game for years and it never gets old. Your in a western town where you are new and alone, you end up making friends and becoming the sheriff.

A great game for anyone, it's very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Windows XP","review":"I had this game on my wish list, thinking it would be fun, but the description states that it's for Windows XP and it isn't.

Very misleading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING but I need help installing!","review":"I love this game to death BUT I tried to install it on my mac but it won't because it's too old. If anyone can help me that would be great! Other then that this game is AMAZING!!!

It's actually an audio drama recreation of the movie, intended for children.On that level, it certainly gets the job done. However, most kids will probably not be thrilled with the storyline of \\"Steel\\" anyway, which is not nearly as outrageous as, say, that same summer's other DC Comics film, \\"Batman & Robin.\\" \\"Steel\\" is decidedly grounded in comparison, and even less original than the inept \\"Batman & Robin\\" was.Ultimately, why would you want an audio version of the movie when you could just watch the movie? And why would you want to do that anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a book that covers the big picture for foster parent","review":"As I began reading this book, I regretted not having it as a resource before and after my first placement of a troubled child. One has so many unanswered questions during this time that DHS, private agencies, or counselors do not address. As I read on, I found answers and support to some issues I was currently faced with, as well.The book's foreword, which is noteworthy, was written by Daniel Hughes, Ph.D., a reactive attachment disorder specialist. He praises Glatz for the numerous factors that must be considered before parents bring a troubled child into their families, and for the critical issues that will arise after a child settles in.I highly recommend this book to all parents considering fostering or adopting, or those already involved with troubled kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of Incognito!","review":"Incognito is one of the groups that got me hooked into Acid Jazz and this album quite nicely summarizes the hits that make Incognito addictive and popular. However, \\"The Best of Incognito\\" is also a good start for those who don't know this delightful group. Besides from the upbeat songs, the album also has some mellow songs like \\"Deep Waters\\" or \\"A Shade of Blue\\". As a bonus, there are also 3 new tracks that are groovy inded!Play this CD and head down to the street and I'm sure after listening to \\"Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing\\" and \\"Everyday\\", you'd be dancing and walking at the same time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD!","review":"All I can say is I love this group and Maysa can sing she is awesome!I finally got to see her live on a jazz cruise and all I can say is awesome this is a great CD the whole darn thing is good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sound of heaven","review":"This is what you called quality music. Incognito has produced several worthy pieces of music. And in this CD, it gathered together all the best songs Incognito ever produced. So there is no doubt in this CD.

I found it extreemly useful in setting up my own database consulting business. it contains things such as:How to price your time, how to choose your client, how to ensure that your client has confidence in you, pitfalls to avoid when building your business etc.Excelent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good broad introduction","review":"This book covers all the basics. It is a good \\"how to\\" on various levels, but also gives you the advantages and disadvantages of consulting - if you haven't made your mind up yet. But you may want to read other books for more in-depth coverage.I haven't been contracting for 10 years, but have a stong desire to again do the work I like, for people I like, when I like - and get paid for it. Consulting is different to contracting of course, and Meyer discusses many of the new skills needed, for example setting up, marketing and pricing (he strongly recommends flat rate pricing for example) - and the very important listening skills. After reading the book, I have made my mind up. I am ready to chuck my permanent job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good, but I bought it too soon.","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer here. The book had more information than I new what to do with at this time, since I am just considering a career change into the computer field. I know I want to be a computer consultant, but I got a bit intimidated by all the info this book has. Which is good, in general, but I guess I should have purchased it a bit down the line when I am close to completing my training.I took the advice of another reviewer here and bought \\"The Secret Path to Contract Programming Riches,\\" because it is the only programming/consulting book I've found that was written for those in the absolute beginner, from a technical perspective.I will keep this book and refer to it as I near completion of my training, so I can move into consulting as quickly as I can.I would have given it 5 stars, but as I said, I am too new to this field and could not digest it all yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Computer Consulting by Peter meyer","review":"This book will motivate and inspire -bring clarity and amazing insight to an arena that I didn't have the foggiest notion of!

I wanted a new one strictly for myself, and found this one at a quite fantastic price (new), and am using and enjoying it twice a day every day. I actually build my life, thinking, and spirituality around volumes such as this, thanks to Amazon for providing them for retired folks on fixed incomes such as myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I have owned this for about a month and have to say, so far, it is worth the price. It handles every size recipe I have, from a sheet of paper to a large / bulky recipe book, even displaying multiple recipes with ease. I cook a lot but obviously was reticent to spend so much on the product. I had been using a much cheaper version, a clear acrylic, one-piece type that I'd had for years that finally broke apart. This is such a treat since it is so versatile, sturdy, and handsome. I haven't tried to clean it yet but it does come with specific instructions. I am ordering another one for a friend who also cooks for her birthday."},{"rating":"1","title":"kitchen holder","review":"The wooden anchor holding the plastic sheets has such a horrible chemical smell we had to send it back. Clearly, the finish applieddoes not comply with safety, odor issues for kitchen use. Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"Package arrived a little later than expected but Im very pleased with this purchase. Im a young women and I bought this to put in my hope chest so it wasn't going to be put in use until after marriage. However, I was so excited about it that I had to try it out! it works great! My mom fell in love with it too so I ended up giving it to her and she's going to buy me one now! lol. So my mother has one and I have one now! We are thrilled! This would make a great gift for a newlywed if your ever looking an idea or a young women you is looking for items to store in her hope chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Jumbo Cookbook Holder!","review":"Having a user-friendly cookbook holder like this one makes me feel dynamite when I'm preparing recipes for my family! Best of all, it helps to preserve my grandma's recipe book, which is a treasure. Thank you for coming up with such an ingenious solution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"This cookbook holder is the best yet. The easy fold down acrylic front makes turning the pages a snap plus it protects the pages from splatter and stains. The groves make it easy to accommodate books of all sizes. A wonderful product to own and to gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This cookbook holder is what I've been waiting for. It is simple to use, attractive, and well-balanced, so it stays upright no matter how big the cookbook in it may be. Why not perfect, then? The smaller acrylic piece against which you prop the book is narrower than the wooden base by several inches, so when the holder is folded and stored, the back prop piece falls out. Kind of a nuisance."},{"rating":"2","title":"crucial for any kitchen","review":"Sure, there's something nice about an old, warn cookbook with sauce splattered pages - but there's something nicer about recipes you can read! I have enough pages with red wine and tomato sauce memories on them, thank you very much!This holder is easy on books- it doesn't hurt the spine of the book you place in it. The plexi-glass face is easy to clean with a simple wipe down. The frame is attractive enough that it lives on our kitchen island."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and sturdy cookbook stand!","review":"After researching all other cookbook stands and reading the reviews, this seemed to be the best one. I wanted a sturdy cookbook stand for my nicer hardbound cookbooks and this seems to do the trick. Love how you can adjust the distance between the book and the acrylic panel and the fact that it folds flat for easy storage. My only complaint that it's a little pricier than I would have liked to spend; otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Wonderful Gift","review":"I received this cookbook holder as a gift and LOVE IT!!!! It holds my thickest cookbooks as well as my thin magazines. It is very sturdy and I am quite pleased with the product. Good-bye food stained recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey for poor craftmanship...","review":"I remember seeing one of these with a hardwood base and thought that was what I was purchasing. Alas, no. While the plastic cover and backrest for the cookbooks are the same, the base on this one is a light-weight raw wood with an ugly orangish stain. There is no finish so if you spill something on it, it will likely stain the wood and be difficult to clean. It does hold my largest cookbooks with no problem, but it is too expensive for not being finished very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Just like \\"The Battle for Midway\\" and \\"The Search for the Battleship Bismarck\\" by NG, this film stays the same tone as the two. They gather survivors from the Guadalcanal talking about the war while searching for warships in this campaign. Of course, the combat footages interweave during the running time.This campaign was fought so intensively for six months on the ground, at sea and in the air. It turns the tide of the Pacific theater. Before it, the Japanese always advance. After it, the Japanese always retreat. This film doesn't give me the feelings of the significance. In addition, it narrows the scope of this campaign and many important battles are not included. The well-known \\"Tokyo Express\\" is never mentioned in this film, which is another disappointment.To conclude, this film doesn't give you the whole picture of the lengthy Guadalcanal campaign. Another DVD \\"Guadalcanal: The Island of Death\\" is the very choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever Written?","review":"This is an incredible book, well written, important and utterly true in every way. The discovery of Primal Pain and the resolution of neurosis and psychosis by re-experience of that pain, may be one of the most important scientific discoveries this century. Unfortunately, Janov's discoveries have been ignored by some, but widespread acceptance may come in many years from now. One of the causes of the resistance in the world of psychology is that it invalidates many theories that psychologists livelihoods depend on. I hope the truth discovered by Janov is not suppressed forever. It's possible. Janov's newer books are also recommended for the incredible medical evidence, but 99% of the Primal Scream is as true today as it was in 1970. It's important, its not about screaming, it's about the proper and full resolution of pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Making of Everest: On Location in the Death Zone","review":"I was happy to have found a copy of this even if it is a VHS it is a very interesting account of the filming of the Everest IMAX. After seeing \\"Storm over Everest\\" I remembered seeing this account on a PBS channel but have never been able to find it before. It covers the 1996 Everest tragedy from another viewpoint. It was in very good condition and came promptly. It's short, but if you are interested in Everest you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seiko SNA 413 Watch Review","review":"This timepiece is excellent for its intended purpose as an aeronautical flight chronograph. Accuracy is outstanding and 'hacking' is accomplished without difficulty.

One of the screw lock start-stop buttons locked permanently within a few months after the purchase and no longer unscrews (I tried pliers). Consequently, the stop function is no longer available.I find it increasingly difficult to tell time with my fading eye sight, especially in dim light conditions; it does not help that this watch has white hands on a white dial!Overall, I find that this watch is cheaply made and not recommended for people with less than perfect vision. I prefer the gold model SNA414 which I also own (white hands on black dial and much easier to read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for a quartz watch","review":"I'm a fob watch collector and for me, if it's not self winding, it is not a watch. But after I read the review by JP below and I realized that he made a very good point about the differences between quartz and automatic. It is a nice watch, but I hate the dome crystal which is annoying sometime. Seiko makes good watch, but their chrono is suckiest.

This is my second watch like this, I now have both the black and white faced watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good timepiece","review":"I'd given this watch a five star rating, but the wrong manual was sent to me, and I had to get Amazon, and ultimately Seiko, to e-mail me the right one. After getting the right manual, I love it. Keeps good time, it has an hour measurement on the chronometer and an alarm. Also, the flight/navigation computer bezel turns both ways and seems to have a good seal.The only drawback with this type of watch is that it doesn't have a backlit \\"glow\\" funtion like some cheaper chronograph watches. Makes it hard to use at night. The watch hands are luminous, but that doesn't last more than five or ten minutes at night.It's a good, basic, sturdy watch that shouldn't let the wearer down."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books Out There!!!","review":"I have read this book and have also taken Darel's course twice.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am eating my yard!","review":"My husband was dragged into farm life by living with me and I slowly introduced him to the joys of morels and wild asparagus that I found in the roadside ditches while riding colts. It made having a slightly smelly wife dragging into the house in the evening worth while. The exotic meals more than made up for the shock? Those days are long gone thanks to the insistence of the chemically armed to spray the roadsides. I still have the yard which produces delicious puffballs when conditions are right and the pasture has the wild plums. This book introduced me to plants that I had never considered eating and have since enjoyed. My front yard is filled with pumpkins and the blossoms are delicious. If you want identification information, go to your county agent. This book introduces you to the joys of exploration and discovery and taste!!Makes me hungry just thinking about it it!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. I finally got through this book and that's a lot hours of my life I'll never get back. Roger Welsch's hick style of writing is horrible.

Roger should give up writing, but I suspect he can't do anything else either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed to take control","review":"My cravings and bingeing of sweet carbs was so bad that I needed to take control. My husband who has been a follower of Dr.Mirkin for years decided it would make a great holiday present. Because of all the diet advice out there, often contradictory, I decided to read the book backwards. I was impressed with the resources and references. Most impressive is the way the book is laid out and how clear each section is to follow.I especially like the fact that medical jargon is made simple. Because I was just diagnosed with insulin resistance I think Dr. Mirkin has given me the key to taking back my life. I am anxiously waiting for him to schedule book signings so I may meet him in person after all these years of listening to him on the radio and reading his marvelous website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - Changed my Life","review":"This book had that big of an impact on me. I'm only 34 and exercise fairly regularly but my diet was lacking. I've been doing Dr. Mirkin's suggestions for 5 months and I've lost 20 pounds and I'm eating like a pig and enjoying every bite. I'm never hungry and have 9% body fat now and it's not hard to maintain. I also love the blood test coupon in the book. I took it to my doctor and ran them all so I have a bench mark.

Difficult to get through the first play and definitly not worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but...","review":"Some nice songs (the title song, \\"Snoopy\\" and \\"Happiness\\") make this a charming piece. However, it is a minor musical and somewhat uninteresting for adult listeners unless you've seen and loved the show. It might attract kids since it's inspired in the popular comic strip character. It's a \\"chamber\\" musical, without spectacular orchestrations and similar to THE FANTASTICKS in that respect, although the Ton Jones/Harvey Schmidt piece is far more superior. The recording is excellent, considering it's a 1967 show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a cast!","review":"This cd will have you humming.

I chose the orginal cast recording because it had additional features and the reviews led me to believe it was the better one. Without his knowledge,I put the CD in on our way to vacation. He was very surprised, but very disappointed. You could barely hear any speaking parts or songs. It was recorded in a very low sound level and turning up the volume does no good.

The music is awesome! So after the show closed I went out and bought the soundtrack and I was not impressed at all. I realize that all of these adults are acting as kids, but I dont think that they even tried to make it sound good. And just like it says in the CD cover, Lucy's voice sounds like fingernails against a chalk-board: she fits right in. Overall I give this one star because the writing itself is good...but I would be downright embarassed if I was a part of this particular cast! I have never heard the original broadway cast recording, but just by listening to this, I can tell you one thing: buy the other recording!! Anything is better than this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warming Classic","review":"I came to amazon to buy my copy of \\"You're a Good Man Charlie Brown\\" and was torn between the revival version and the original off-broadway version. I ended up choosing the original. I would recommend making the same decision. The off-broadway cast is the real thing. The innocence, simplicity, and of course happiness is all there. I can't imagine anyone but these voices portraying the amazing peanuts gang. Gary Burghoff IS Charlie Brown, Reva Rose IS Lucy, and Bill Hinnant is most definitely Snoopy. The heartfelt songs and charming characters on this recording are exactly what Charles Shultz intended them to be. The only loss is not getting to have \\"The Glee Club Rehearsal\\" on the CD. Do the right thing, choose the original version of \\"Your a Good Man, Charlie Brown\\". It's absolutely PRICELESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"wrist wrap","review":"I was not able to find this wrap in any local stores where I had purchased it earlier.

He slowly becomes involved in Dublin's gay community, and meets another guy who's a few years older, but before anything can happen, Neil is attacked by gay-bashers. After recovering, Neil finds that dating is difficult, especially when he's hiding so much, and the relationship sours. Neil comes out to his parents and friends, and finds some support, but everything changes, some for the worse and some for the better. This amazing coming out story does end with hope and a possibility for a connection to combat the loneliness of living as a gay man in a small town. Like Stuart Thorogood's \\"Outcast\\" and K. M. Soehnlein's \\"The World of Normal Boys\\", Lennon's book is a potent, poignant tale of what it's like being young and gay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me on the edge of my seat.","review":"This was a really excellent book.

I can't just have my nuts falling apart on me in the middle of a job!In my approximation, with 2-3 bad nuts in each size, that's about a 10% failure rate.

It gave it beautiful character and feeling for the show. It was ashame that for the second year that they had changed so much (even the music) and lost that character and feeling (but that is a whole other debate).In 1976, RCA records released the year 1 soundtrack with a beautiful gate fold cover and for about 20+ years, that is all we had, until Fanderson. The year 1 soundtrack is no longer available through them, but it is the most complete.

The music on this CD can best be described as rhythmic, atonal, reminiscent of that early 20th century style called \\"Twelve Tone;\\" that is there are no recognizable melodies or themes --- romantic, soaring, inspiring, invigorating, schmaltzy, or otherwise. I am tempted to call the 20+ tracks, each lasting from 1 to 2 minutes, musical doodles; but I am sure Mr. Newman put a lot more thought and work into this project than what this term might suggest. I have over 150 soundtrack CD's. My own preference lies in the direction of those with indenitfiable themes or melodies. This CD goes in the opposite direction.

Francis' fans will enjoy such rarities as \\"Waiting for Billy\\" and \\"When the Boys Meet the Girls\\", but there isn't much to listen to for others. Rhino/TCM's attempt to milk the MGM vaults provides little refreshment. Francis gets lost in the mess of outtakes, instrumentals, and poorly transferred film masters. For demanding fans only.

Poor longevity.","review":"Bought this item in 2008 to connect an iPod touch to a port on my car audio system. Worked pretty much as advertised. But after very infrequent use (once a month maybe), I started noticing recently that only one channel was working (right speaker only). The issue is that a wire had become frayed at one jack-end. So it is now useless. These did not receive rough treatment. The issue seems to be the very thin gauge wire (20 I would guess), which may be good for retractability, but turned out to be bad for durability. So I am back on Amazon now shopping for a replacement. (As a side note, the mechanism to retract the wire isn't exactly easy to use -- it usually takes a full tugs to get it to work right, like a pull-cord on a set of cheap window blinds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the convenience","review":"This cable was absolutely fantastic when I got it. The retraction mechanism worked great, and it was incredibly convenient...until about 6 weeks after I bought it. I wasn't even using it heavily -- a few hours a day 2-3 days a week -- but it's dead.

Unfortunately, it just doesn't work - at least for me. I'm not having trouble with the spring-loaded cable rewinder. However, the earbuds don't stay in, the sound is a bit muddy, and the rewinder is in the center of the cables (which, when you think about it, makes perfect sense) - but it's so heavy that you MUST clip it on (to keep the buds from flying out of your ears), and it's not easy to find a place that's exactly in between your pocket and your ears. The clip's also small and awkwardly placed; the cables and rewinder keep getting in the way when trying to clip it. One potentially good thing about it is that the volume comes through way high, at least for me (sansa e280). But this also makes it harder to keep the volume low...I have better luck with my old Kanguru mp3 player that has a lanyard, and built-in earbuds, when doing something active."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this as a replacement cable for a pair of noise-reducing headphones. 2 months later, it's trash after daily use 5 days a week at work. I really think it's the retraction mechanism that puts undue wear and tear on the cable itself, which eventually breaks inside and shorts out. The retraction mechanism malfunctioned after the first month, not rolling up evenly on both sides no matter how many times I tried it. I also think the weight of the retraction piece was a bit annoying as well as causing stress on the cable itself. It wasn't too expensive, so while I don't regret experimenting, I would suggest others not bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in First Month","review":"I used this cable to connect my ipod touch to my car stereo and it failed in less than a month of use.

The cable itself is pretty long, so it can stretch to the back seat for passengers to browse through songs.

I've had mine for 7 months using them once a day at the gym - then all of a sudden the sound crackled and dropped out on one of the speakers - then the other - so you're left fidgeting with the cord to hear some sound again. Within the course of an hour, they'd become useless.

Other reviews have commented on these headphones' lack of comfort; initially I was fine with their tightness, assuming they would stretch out a little over time (like other behind-the-neck models I've used). Instead the problem seems to be in the plastic used for the neckband, which is completely inflexible. You would have needed a pair of sharp scissors to get through the neckbands of every other pair of behind-the-neck headphones I've ever had (primarily Sony), so in my opinion this is a mystifying, infuriating choice from a usually stellar company.

The head band puts an incredible amount of pressure directly onto your head at the points directly behind the ears. There are no adjustments, so you can't do any thing about it. The engineer that designed the head band must be a complete imbecile. Or he has ears that stick out a mile, which would be the only way these headphones would not crush your head.

I give them a 5 star now."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets for a portable player w/out earbuds","review":"If you are not a fan of earbuds, yet would like comfortable great sounding headphones, then you should consider the iGrado headphones.The sit behind your head and take a little getting used to, but are comfortable for extended use while training.There is a smoothness and depth of sound that is surprising given the low price. Yes, there is good bass response too.My preferences in music are classical, jazz & blues, so I don't know how they sound with modern music, but for classical, jazz 'n blues they are much more than satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too tight.","review":"I love the sound of Grados but it doesn't matter how good they sound if they aren't comfortable and these are way too tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"igrado","review":"Relatively good sound quality and excellent styling. However, some noise leaks out and the build quality is a bit suspect as I've had two of these now fail in the area of the pin.

But when I wear them the way that is dipicted on the photo in the carton they fit so snugly on my ears that they muffle the sound. When I turn them upside down they fit loosely enough for a beautiful pristene sound but they feel uncomfotable to the point where I'm constantly thinking about them or trying to adjust them. Maybe the reason they fit so tightly on my ears muffling the sound is because I have a big head, I don't know. From the reviews I thought this was a sure purchase, but it wasn't. Oh well, another $50 down the drain. I'll have to go back to the buds. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are made in China...","review":"I bought these after finding out Grado headphones are made in the USA, found out why these are cheaper than the sr60i & sr80i, these are made in China. They're not uncomfortable after a few hours of wear and sound spectacular (warm and neutral). My only complaints so far are that they look and feel cheap in your hands, and because they're very open backed, they project sound outward. I've had Bose Tri-Port and AE2 headphones and these are far cheaper and sound better than the AE2. We'll see how the build quality compares over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a fat head.","review":"These headphones don't work for me. Technically speaking they work just fine, they even don't sound too bad. My problem is I have a large, round cranium. I tried stretching them out to see if that would help some but it didn't. Don't waste the money if you have a larger than normal head."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best just got better!","review":"I have had a couple of pairs of iGrado's for the past 3 years or so. The cable they came with are very thin and do not handle wear. I've been looking for cable replacements (yes, the iGrado's are worth salvaging) but decided it was cheaper and easier to just buy new ones. Well to my surprise, the new ones are better. The cable is much thicker with a thick jacket. The Y split in the cable is much more rugged and the plug is a nice L shape now. I also noticed the headband is wider and a little more comfy. Best of all, they sound the same--GREAT.Do not be fooled by other reviews of behind-the-head headphones that get 4 and 5 stars--they sound nowhere near as good as the iGrado's. If you want good bass and a great sound from top to bottom in the behind-the-ear form factor, the iGRADO's are THE BEST. Don't spend half to ultimately be unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"igrado","review":"i just got the igrado did the quarter mod and have to say these are the best portable headphones i have tried. i have the koss porta pro which are great but don't have the same detail as the i grado, also have the AKG k451 which are great and easier to drive but not as spacious and sound more cramped than the igrado."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource, as always from Dr. Willmington","review":"We have been avid collectors of Dr. Willmington's guides.

Carroll's svelte prose flows past death and destruction as his detective progagonist comes to grips with unknowable alien conquistadors and works his way around their superior intellect and seemingly impenetrable defenses. Friends become foes in the wink of an eye. The ending is too tidy, but the devastastation that precedes it is awesome. Is it too much for film? I like Carroll's crisp, spot-on portrayals of politicians, media, and the security community. \\"Inhuman Beings\\" is particularly pleasant for a Northern Californian. It reels you through a gallaxy of familiar and off-beat venues."},{"rating":"1","title":"aliens take over yet again","review":"I bought this book, despite the cliche storyline, because the cover made it sound like it was going to be humorous, tackling an overused plot with comdedy.It lied to me.

When I find someone interesting, I like to know as much as I can about them. This interview is definitely a good addition to my studies.

It did not include any validation (except one instance on page 109)except you taking her word as fact. It was written more in a conversational way expecting the reader to accept the plain as the nose on your face that she has abilities that include appearances from Jesus and Mary. Lacking any validation or evidential information throughout the book casts doubt on her ability whether she actually has the ability or not.

I must admit, I could'nt put it down. I've read books by other cruisers before, but this was the most enjoyable by far. Suzanne is a talented writer...she has a way of helping the reader to feel as though he/she is experiencing the adventures first hand. I was pleased to see that she included a glossary for those of us who may not be completely familiar with nautical terms.

The story of 2 naval officers taking off on a boat together really puts them heads and tails over the rest of us who are thinking about the cruising life - they were trained for this very thing! As a result, they seemed to breeze through difficult aspects of cruising and the book was more about her struggle to let go of her former life in the spotlight.

Work through the book and try to apply one lesson a week, each week add one more lesson. Re-work the book every 6 months to gauge the small changes that come first, and to help keep u pushing along! One child with ADHD, and another that borders on Autistic - demanding 90% of a 24 hour day simultaneously - regardless if the attention was pos or neg. It didn't leave me with much for my \\"normal\\" non-demanding child or myself.

The shopping in Fredericksburg is superb but changes so quickly that a book would need to be updated every year to keep up with the changes! BUT, as a book of this type is bought more often for the historical, cultural and natural beauties of the region, shopping is generally not the most important aspect of the trip. I have been to and through many of the places listed in Llano, Gillespie, Kendall, and Blanco Counties but this is a much more interesting way of doing the trip. I recommend this to anyone who wishes to see the small towns and historical sites of the region."},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially for early Enigma fans and possibly Oldfield too","review":"This ia an album that I stumbled across whilst looking for the latest Enigma remix, if you like Enigmas \\"Love Sensuality Devotion (The Remix Collection)\\" you will love this also.It is not the best album I have ever heard, more of one that you can just play in the background but it does creep up on you and after a while you start to really get into it, it's interesting musically, I tend to put it on whilst working and then later on I hear myself humming away to some of the tracks. The Robbie Williams \\"Angels\\" track is especially good and the cover of Jon and Vangelis \\"I'll Find My Way Home\\" and The Verbes \\"Clocks\\" cute.I'ts a funny old album, the juxtaposition between modern tunes we all are familar with and Gregorian tones makes it one that I will keep playing for a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh boy, this is bad music","review":"If we're lucky this bands major label debut will never see the light of day.

One of the two vocal tracks is Aren't you Glad from the 2nd album-the notes says this version is unreleased but it sure sounds like the cut on the 2nd album.The rest of the album means nothing and goes nowhere--this will sit on my shelve only because I am a collector and I like the album design and notes, pictures.

Is this the only book you need to succeed as a trader? No, but it's got a lot more practical information, in my opinion, than Farly and Sarkovich (in contrast to the person who posted below). Good luck trying to make it through Farley's material in the \\"Master Swing Trader.\\" I have a library of good trading books and because I couldn't even understand what Farley was saying half the time or I was bored out of my mind, that one did not make it. I suggest that new traders add some reading by Martin Pring, John Murphy, Alexander Elder, Colin Alexander, and Stan Weinstein to supplement the material in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity","review":"I believe anyone who is even considering this book has heard of the horror stories of day trading and wants to learn and TRY to avoid all the pitfalls so many have before. Some people review this book as incomplete or too vague. However, I believe this books takes the beginner and walks them through the critical areas they need to understand before placing one trade.

Then you can develop further with experience and learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel somewhat taken...","review":"This book is decent for a beginning active trader. It is easy to read and it is not a costly investment. However, her broad topics culminate in one ending example of trades of Juniper (JNPR). JNPR's behavior at the time was a total aberration and a result of the irrational hype of the internet boom. It was not a \\"real\\" example that a beginning trader would encounter. Then I signed up for her newsletter at her website which she touts in her book. All I received in two months were solicitations to buy books through her website. Although I respect her knowledge, you get the feeling that a majority of her income is from speaking engagements and bilking people like me out of $15 to buy her book. There are other authors who make a majority of their income through trading, I hope you can find one of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent trading book to learn how it works - get it!","review":"Toni's writing style is clear and concise as she covers dozens of useful tips and strategies in this well-written book. Most trading books are not worth reading; however this gem is one of the few (along w/Steve Nison and Tony Oz and Barry Rudd's) that I put in the \\"must-read if you're learning how to trade\\" category. I recommend it to my traders at Daytrading University and it's on the 'short list' of highly recommended reads.She covers many strategies from start to finish and this is a well written strategy guide, with very well-planned coverage of trading essentials, plus a few advanced tips that are useful as well.Nice work - buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be half the size","review":"I caution against this book. I found it quite patronizing and takes forever to get to the point. Some of the economics are quite dubious and I don't like it's continual use of analogies; this is an excerpt explaining how stock market cycles are made up of smaller cycles.\\"Here's an analogy. This book is made of many chapters. Within each chapter are separate sections that, when strung together, create that chapter. The sections are made of a series of paragraphs: the paragraphs are built of sentences , which are formed by words. Each word, sentence, paragraph, and section is a complete unit in and of itself. And, when looked at as a whole, they form the complete book. Get the picture?\\"If you don't mind paragraphs like the above (and there are a lot of them) then there are some pearls of wisdom in this book but I find the style quite distracting. If you are serious about trading this might be a good first book but I strongly suggest going on to read some more serious books."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"This was one of the first stock trading books I read.

The content is about 80-90% the same, although the descriptions and charts are new. There are a few new pointers in the book. The discussions on intraday and level II displays have been mostly eliminated.If you are a beginner trader who wants a good foundation, this is the book to get. Ms. Turner's discussions are methodical and inclusive. Plus it is easy to read and has humor. Obviously she is an good teacher. The amount of topics covered for the price is a bargain.If you already read her first book, it's up to you. Most of the concepts are the same. But there are few extra pointers, and it doesn't hurt to go over all concepts (for a beginner like myself) since there is a lot covered in the book.My only gripe is that the new money management chapter was a bit under emphasized. I feel this topic is very important to the longevity of traders. But at least she covers the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading for beginning/intermediate traders","review":"Easy to read, gets technical without going overboard. Nice touch to keep going back to the psychology of trading as well. However, in her stock selection criteria she recommends using industry/group leaders from IBD (Investor's Business Daily).

It is a little quirky at the start of your trip and the details at the end of the trip (like all the little turns) can be questionable, but the main eneral part is good. Has options to look for restaurants and gas and stuff like that, but the maps may be outdated. Sometimes it leads you to a nonexistent gas station or you type in a place you know exists and it cannot find it.I like it, but I only paid $99. That was only two weeks ago and for some reason it has jumped up to $199 and slightly better models cost less. In that light I would look into those models like the 255 or higher and wonder if it is a sign that this particular one is being taken off the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin GPS 250","review":"Works great purchased for my daughter, I have a 260 model it works great.

It makes driving in unfamiliar places much easier. It doesn't speak street names, but so far it hasn't been a problem as there has always been another person in the car to read the street name for the driver.

The estimated arrival time to my destinations has been very accurate so far and it had been able to find most of my destinations. I work on the road all the time and it helps me to find really good shortcuts that before having Garmin I was not aware of. The only ting that I am not so thrilled about is that it needs to be plugged all the time to the AC connector/charger because its battery does not last long if it is not connected.Also, if you are thinking on buying this product go ahead and by the upgrade. If you live in a big city, the maps in Garmin 250 might not have the newest streets or new highways uploaded. I might go for it as well pretty soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price","review":"Purchased the Nuvi 250 at a reduced price at Amazon. Can't beat the price for the functions. Make sure to purchase the Nuvi model with the USB computer connection so you can later install updated maps. They go for around $65. Since I live in the North East US, maps of Canada come in handy. Used it in Toronto, works like a charm. The menu is simple and straight forward.

Best windshield mount out there. 8 hours of battery time make it great for city touring on foot or hiking in the woods. Will give altitude as you hike in the mountains. SD chip reader is nice for viewing digital pictures while on the road. Standard size easier in the pocket, consider the Wide version if your vision is not what it used to be. Dims automatically at night. Pleasant voice and easy all-touchscreen controls. No Bluetooth, but I seldom would need it. Kids names it \\"Sacajawea\\" ie.

I don't know if there is a way to make it choose between fastest, shortest or main roads - if so we haven't found that yet.

So, we can use it only when fully charged, and then have to stop using it when it needs to be recharged. Visits to the Garmin website have not resolved the problem. Also, the TomTom allows more customization, such as a choice between an alphabetical or qwerty keyboard. Who uses an alphabetical keyboard? The ability to change a route when there is a need for a detour is another shortcoming of the Garmin.

The black face with highly polished silver numbers and markings are beautiful, and I'm sure it's a quality watch but if I can't easily tell the time (anytime) I can't rate it above 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"good,little dress wattch","review":"Very attractive if small watch.

Definitely best for guys with smaller wrists, though. I am very impressed with how well it keeps time; I've had this watch for a month and using the navy master clock as a reference ( http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl ) I think in all that time it was was fast by about 3 or 4 seconds. There are two minor complaints though. First of all, the date is a bit small and a little hard to see, and secondly, it is virtually impossible to see the hands in a dark theatre. If you can live with those two things, I definitely recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch, strap and dial could be better .....","review":"I like the Eco technology - beats having to change batteries every couple years. This is a wonderful watch, lightweight and accurate.I wish the dial was less shiny and easier to read .... watches should focus on ease of readability, and provide better contrast between digits and dial, including the hour and minute arm. Silver hour and minute arm tends to not be as easily visible. It would also be nice to have a softer leather strap, maybe with wear the strap will do better but seems kind of rigid.All in all, the watch is excellent and a steal for the current price.

This straightener also pulls out hair. Trust me, it was awful looking down at the hair coming out. I also started to have problems with turning it on right after my first use because even though I had plugged the iron in and pressed the on button several times it took a while for it to actually turn on. Sure.....60 second heat up....but like a long time for it to turn on. My suggestion is that try this product and see what you think, but make sure you can return it just in case. However, DO NOT be fooled with gold plates and so called ceramic technology. I suspect the plates to be only gold-covered metal to seem like a high end straightener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightener Review","review":"This straightener is just right for my hair type.

My hair after 1- 1 and 1/2 hours still remains with great frizz, poof, and it looks really bad if you have semi-straight hair with noticeable curls in random places..The good thing about is that it is a 2 in. You don't have to section your hair out into 20 + pieces or w/e..But its really only good if you have wavy hair..By the way..there are HORRIBLE fumes from this straightener after over 2 years of use..It smells like pancakes and then it smells like smoke...ehh not a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"I bought this 8-9 months back, and its amazing. And more importantly, I am a guy with not-so-long hair.Pros:1. It comes along with a comb which is very comfortable.2. Auto power off. I always tend to forget switching it off, and it shuts off automatically. No worries.3. Comfortable grip4. Gets hot quickly.5. The comb is detachable. I just take it out and wash it regularly.Cons:1. The plastic handle is flimsy. Each handle is made of 2 pieces held together by a screw. The screw is already screwed up in my piece (after nearly 3 months of use). Right now, I have held them together by a rubber band (and it works just fine). I used to travel with this a lot though.2. It actually takes more time to cool down (approx 15-20 minutes). So if you are traveling, and use the straightner just before heading out, then you need to wait for atleast 10-15 minutes before packing this.Having said both pros and cons, I really love it. And believe me, it works well for guys too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really not a great investment","review":"conair just really does not make great hair straighteners. i bought the full size one before, and without warning it just quit working after a 2 months. i have a revlon full-size one now (which works GREAT). i recently got my hair cut short, so i decided to go buy a cheap small one to reach the short hair in the back. turn the turbo on, blast it up to the highest temperature, and it still is not even half as hot as my revlon one thats turned on minimum. i have really thin hair, and its not even curly it just gets wavy sometimes. this thing cant even straighten that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"..Heats up quickly..No abnormally long cord..Big paddlesIt works well.

If this review serves to prevent some other poor consumer from wasting their money then I have spent my time well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My hair has never looked better","review":"I'm actually surprised by the reviewers that said that their product broke down in one or two months. I've had mine for almost a year and it's operation is still outstanding. Here are the highlights:1) Temperature control is perfect. I have fine but unruly hair so the metal iron I used before singed my hair constantly. The adjuster really works for this product (not just decoration) and I haven't had the problem of burnt hair since.2) This heats up fast. Again with a metal iron it would take 15 minutes to heat up and would consistently cool down making the whole straightening process take an hour. This takes about 3 minutes to heat up and a minute to reheat. I straighten my hair in 15 minutes now.3) Ceramice plates in general are better for your hair. They won't damage it as much and I've found they are more effective also. My hairstyle will stay all day even in high humidity (provided I have an umbrella).Definately worth your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Straighter","review":"Bought this for my little sister when she went off to college and she has loved it.

First of all, all of the people that think this is so great. It damages your hair very bad. I do use hair protectant spray, but still this CONAIR fryed my ends and my hair. The other thing is that after about an hour after I straighten my hair... it starts to get wavy.

This ConAir just does not compare. It is NOT ceramic like it says, it is ceramic-COATED and there is a BIG difference. If you want to stop battling your hair every morning, splurge on a CHI flat iron and you will immediately see that it is worth every penny.

I have considered getting a CHI but I am wondering if I even need it, because this one does such a good job on my long, thick, wavy hair.

I have been using the same one since 2003!!! Daily!! I personally think this does a better job than a CHI. I like that it has wide plates and it glides right through my hair, makes it super shiny. Love the handles, easy to grasp and manuver through my hair quickly. People will say it's not as good because the plates are only ceramic plated.

I'm South Asian with very thick, coarse, curly hair and this iron just didn't get hot enough to fully straighten it out. It took over an hour to get through a first pass of my (completely dry) hair and the results were not satisfactory given the time invested. It got my hair straight-ish but there were still crimps and it just generally wasn't as sleek as I normally get it with the Remington. If I tucked my hair behind my ear there would almost immediately be a sharp bend that I'd have to iron out again. All in all, this is probably fine for the average person but it just isn't up to the job for extra stubborn curls. If you have coarse or thick hair I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!! one that works!","review":"I have bought multiple straighteners and none of them worked as nicely as this one.

It does not get super hot as I am used to(my others go up to 410 and I use the 390 setting) and I found it hard to get my hair as straight as I like.

I usually have to blow dry forever, use some sort of product to smooth it out and then go over and over and over with a straightening iron or big barrel curling iron. This iron gets my hair silky smooth usually in one swipe, but at most two. I can have my hair looking awesomely straight within ten minutes, whereas it use to take me twenty to thirty. It also doesn't leave my hair feeling like straw or looking fuzzy afterwards, which is a huge bonus.

Don't waste your time or money with this -- I have already returned it to Amazon and received a refund, which I used on the Revlon Satin Finish Ceramic Straightener.

It takes me on average 5 minutes, as few as 3 minutes. It's much faster if you wait until your hair is fully dry. You can adjust the heat from 0-30 and it has a turbo option. It truly does heat up in 30 seconds. My old Conair took 7 minutes to heat up.I saw it at CVS for about $20 and decided to check the reviews online. I actually paid less for it online and got free shipping. Perfect solution to straightening hair in no time.

Mind you that many stylists have complemented my hair for being easy to work with. It's never damaged my hair since I use a spray that prevents it from damage. I recommend trying other irons...the wet or dry I am going to try next. Do NOT buy this please...it's a waste of your money. Save your money to buy a better one!!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great - try the Conair CS25 instead","review":"I purchased this to replace my Conair CS25 model that I left in a hotel room by accident, and was very disappointed. Although this model does have a comb on the side of it, it did not glide through my hair well - my hair got caught and seemed to stick to the plates. In fact, I pulled out quite a few hairs trying to use it and I felt like it was really damaging. It is also heavy and awkward compared to the CS25 model, harder to manuever to the root of your hair and easier to burn yourself. I stuck it in a drawer after two uses and ordered the other model.The CS25 is the ultra slim model with 1 5/8 inch plates. I'm not sure how it would work on thick curly hair, but for wavy hair like mine that has a little frizz and mostly needs to be smoothed it was fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"THiS STRAiGHTENER SUCKS!!","review":"dear fellow people..i am telling you that this piece of crud is horrible!(i am sorry if you are offended by my language) i have this and it pulls my hair and it has damaged them. it has given my split ends and my hair is always frizzy because of it.CALLi3__"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Like A Dream","review":"Mine hasn't arrived yet, but its sounds AMAZING!

The light would turn on, but the plates would stay cold, so I think it has something to do with the wiring. It happened when I took it on vacation, so it might have something to do with twisting and wrapping the cord around the handle (but what else are you supposed to do with it?)On the plus side, it's SUPER CHEAP, and it made my hair super straight and smooth. I like it much better than my friends' Sedu or Chi. I also like the scissor handles... I felt like it gave me more leverage to squeeze the plates together. It heated up in less than 30 seconds, and it held up through 3 years of a lot of travel and abuse.

I think whoever came up with the albums track listing was unfamiliar with how many hits the band actually had. Maybe the band were more popular here in the Phoenix area (where they were a rock/alternative radio staple) then in other parts of the country. At minimum the track listing should have been doubled to be a greatest hits album. I was really looking forward to buying this cd and was greatly disappointed when I went to purchase it.

I have every other album and Mike's solo work as well. I never miss a chance to them in concert whenever they are within 100 miles (and sometimes farther).I also have this theory that once a band releases a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection they are essentially done making anymore good music. I'm hoping that Social D is the exception.The classics are here and they sound okay, but once you compare them with the original versions (so easy to do when it's all in your iTunes) you'll find that these re-recorded versions lack the depth and feeling of the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Recently, I bought this for my husband.

That means that to die hard fans, indeed, there could have been so much more.I own all but the oldest and the newest singles already, so the main reason I was looking forward to this release is the remastered sound I read it would have. (Let's face it: the Sony-era releases sound like they made the CDs off cassettes). No credit is given for remastering (in fact, except for the nice biography inside, the liner notes and credits are criminally minimal), but I gotta tell ya, my stereo came alive. This CD sounds fantastic.I can only hope more remasters or an anthology are in the works. This CD will in the meantime serve newcomers to the band and casual fans well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Nickels and Dimes","review":"I bought this on impulse. I love the band, and see them live whenever they're within 300 miles from home.There aren't any original studio recordings on the disc. Nothing you've ever heard on the radio, nothing you've seen live. It's a quickly thrown-together garage-studio set of re-interpreted hits, and a few non-hits mixed in. There are some obvious choices missing, as well, but I knew that when I bought it.Some tracks have cinder-block-room reverb. Others have mic splatter. It's just a hard disc to listen to. It doesn't sound live *or* studio. It sounds like a demo tape, really, but without the energy.If you want live recordings, get the live cd they put out a few years ago. If you want the cleaned-up originals, get the old sony cds (or better yet, just download them for free from the Social D web site). If you've already got both, just save up your nickels and dimes for the next show."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO UNHAPPY!","review":"My daughters, 3 & 4, wanted this for Xmas.

Three of the tracks from the vinyl recording I have are missing - by Otis Spann, Elmore James and Johnny Shines - but there are a number of additional tracks by artists such as Taj Mahal, Dylan and Janis Joplin, which make up for that.I thoroughly recommend this as an comprehensive introduction to the blues - and a delight to existing blues fans.Raj Kothari"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction","review":"I am 40 years old and completely new to orechestral instruments, but this book is very basic, for the complete beginner.

This only improved slightly after I cleaned the disc. If you are purchasing this version with the hopes of having your experience enhanced by the accompanying DVD, just be aware that it may not play for you.As far as the book by itself is concerned, I would recommend it, and I am pleased with its pacing and the ease with which new notes and musical concepts are introduced."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners","review":"this is made for those who are in a school band not for those who wish to learn to play the trumpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"school band manual","review":"I bought this book for my granddaughter who will begin taking trumpet lessons in September and who will be in the school band in elementary school.It is the book mandated by the department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, I think I'll use this todaSPROING!","review":"The thing literally exploded apart while I was extending it one morning.

The plastic end caps have raised ridges so only a tiny bit comes in contact with the door frame resulting in insufficient friction to support your weight, it wouldn't even support 30 pounds that way.So the only way to use this model is by screwing in brackets, couple that was the offset foam padding and I really can't see a reason to recommend this bar over any cheaper alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I got this item from Big5 sporting goods. Had to return first one back to store for replacement - bar would not extend. Salesperson had to open and test several before found one which worked. Now, month later one fitting broke and bar almost injured my son. He is the only user of the bar, 10 and slim.It's a peace of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUSLY CHEAP!! WARNING!!","review":"Who are these people with the 5-star reviews. Are they insane?? I received this cheapo chin-up bar today and it's already wrapped up to go back for a refund.When the bar is mounted you can, with just a bit of effort, move the bar OUT OF ITS END SUPPORT, at which point you'll be crashing to the ground. This is a dangerously designed product that exudes cheapness. Everlast should be ashamed to slap their name on this product.Save yourself from extreme injury or death and avoid this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Recommend","review":"Don't recommend using this product, unless you're interested in damaging your door. First of all this item is made for specific door frames,so you don't have many options as other chin up bars. Secondly removing the nails off the door is a pain, because once you drill it to the door it's very difficult to remove the nails without causing severe damage to your door. Thus this is a poor product. I recommend chin up bars without the use of nails drilled onto the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't mount it in my doorway","review":"Despite the fact that it says that one side telescopes, I tried like hell for 15 minutes to do that, and it wouldn't budge. Without the telescoping option, it won't fit in my doorway."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute dud...I wasted my money, so save yours!","review":"In my opinion, this thing is flimsy and worthless. I set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just doesn't hold. Once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin-up, you realize that you've already thrown away your money and now it's time to throw away this product. I ABSOLUTELY agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy enough / not portable","review":"Caution! This chinning bar requires you to open 6 holes on the door frame for the 6 screws. Hence it is not portable by any means. Also it expands up to a point that is still not fixed hard against the frame; after this point the bar rotates without expanding! Big dissapointment from Everlast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"Okay so you have to put 3 screws on each side of the doorway to install the holders.

I also do not like that you need to put into the frame of the door 2 cups that help hold up the bar. I used to have one that you could just tighten between the door buck by turning it very tight. This one you can twist too, but only so much and you need to use the cups for it to hold me up. (230lbs)"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm....","review":"didn't like it. It requires that you screw in some small cups before you can secure it between the doorway. I was wanting a pull up bar that would be able to secure itself without the need for screws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pull up bar","review":"I purchased this bar because my Iron Gym bar was wide enough for the door frames in my new place. The pull up bar was easy to install. I used the brackets and screws included in the package. I weigh 235 lbs and never felt any slip or give. I've had it for about 4 months now and am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"good bar, bad foam grip setup","review":"Firstly, I must reiterate that you NEED to screw in the mounting-cups for this bar to hold you. Those that complain that this bar is not sturdy have most likely not installed the unit properly.Once properly installed, this is a good, solid chin-up bar.My biggest source of disappointment is the foam grip. It is only on one side of the bar. The manual says that the user should simply push the foam grip over to the center. Well, it is practically impossible. I have tried several times, I don't see how one can do it. I managed to tear the foam grip in my efforts.The bar still does its job perfectly, even without the foam grip.Bottom line - if you want a solid and affordable bar, get this. If you care about the foam grip - shop around for a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable mounting configuration","review":"Took it out of the box, took 5 minutes to set it up, and propmtly ripped one of the flimsy mounting brackets off of the wall during its first use. I definitely would not let children use this item without supervision. The bar itself is of good quality. But the brackets have to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap screws ruin it","review":"You'd think it'd be easy. All you need is a bar. But Everlast screwed it up by including screws that strip way too easily. I was just installing the bar. One bad turn, my screwdriver popped out, I tried to line it up again and twist, but the metal's too stripped to catch. After one bad turn. Ridiculous. I wonder what fraction of a penny they saved on each screw. Now I've got a chin up bar holder that I can't use stuck in my door frame. Do yourself a favor. Pick another bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit in my doorframes","review":"My bedroom has two doors of different sizes, and this bar didn't fit in either one. I'm moving out soon, and I'm hoping my new place has doors which will work. Maybe it will suit me then. But I should have spent a little extra and bought one that doesn't require drilling into the door frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author did not think.","review":"The author states that a resume without an objective is at a \\"great competetive disadvantage\\".

The unit looks great after assembly and I think will serve us well.The only real issue we had (and I think another reviewer has reported the same thing) is that the holes on the bottom piece were not placed correctly; luckily, though, I was able to drill replacement holes in the correct positions and use those. From the directions I surmise they sell several variations using the same pieces, and I imagine we got a bottom piece drilled for another version. A much more trivial issue is that one small plastic cap (a cover for the pieces that support the shelves) was missing, though they did give us two extra nails and an extra plastic hole cover. From what I can tell, the lack of the plastic cover doesn't affect the stability of the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two big cracks but still sturdy enough to be assembled","review":"This bookcase came quickly and had free shipping, which I was very happy with but when I opened it I discovered that there was a crack horizontally across each of the bookcase's sides.

I had the suction cup attachment mounted to the center of the front windshield. Ran my cord to the cigarette lighter then ran the antenna to the rear of the vehicle. Well the suction cup is fried and wont attach anymore. My power plug-in finally had a short and quit working. So I was reading my ops manual for my after-market stereo and noticed this SIRPAN1 receiver is a perfect match. I love it. No more cigarette lighter having to switch it on and off all the time. No more matching FM stations with your Stereo FM Stations to get the best sound. With this unit, you hard wire it into the back of your aftermarket stereo and run your antenna to the rear. The unit turns on when you start your car and shuts off when you shut off the car. Nice. And I get much better reception with this unit.

Sometimes the depths to which the players sank were as deep as the Empire State Building is high. There are many of the names that you would expect to be involved in this tale: Raskob, Smith, Helmsley, Trump, but there are plenty of surprises (which I won't give away).Mr. Pacelle deserves a load of credit, not just for the research (which is impressive enough) but for the glitzy, brash, and engaging style with which he tells this fascinating story.

For the devoutest of the devout only.","review":"I had a hard time figuring out what the director had in mind with this tribute to Frida. Is this a play? A documentary? A poetry reading? Inserted into the very overwrought and sometimes embarrassing histrionics are some very fascinating reminiscences by people who actually knew the artist. The video is worth it just for that. But the acting was so bad and the concept so pretentious that I had my finger on the fast forward much of the time.I'd almost ask for my money back, but the collector in me says no."},{"rating":"2","title":"feedback","review":"Thank you so much for this item.

The interview's with Frida's students and people she knew were interesting - but the \\"skits\\" in between were awful. The woman who played the part of Frida was a good actress, but if I wanted to see Frida's life acted out, I'd just rent FRIDA with Salma Hayek (greatest movie ever!).

It has become part of our lives in a way that subsequent wars cannot. It was a war of emmense porportions, truly a world war fought in every time zone the world has.Yet, in a city of monuments there was no memorial to this war for sixty years. Finally, on May 29, 2004 this memorial was finally dedicated in the middle of the Washington Mall.This small book (exceedingly well bound to give it a long life in a library) is designed to assist children to understand the cultural importance of this war. While not the war to end all wars, this war probably marks the end of huge superpower wars. With atomic weapons, such wars as this could never be fought without ending life as we know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered?

The author speaks candidly and casually of the city as one would of a dear friend, including charming anecdotes of his days there. Mentions are made of the usual tourist spots: the Eiffel Tower, the Moulin Rouge, et cetera, but also little known spots and out of the way places. The myriad of pictures throughout the book only serves to heighten the sense of being there: you can almost feel the well-worn cobblestone beneath your feet as you stroll the streets, hear tourists and natives alike conversing en francais at corner cafes, smell the freshly baked bread from the boulangerie patisseries, and see the sunlight glinting off the Seine. A must-read for anyone who has been or simply dreams of visiting Paris."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wouldn't choose anything else!","review":"I love these storage binders...I only started buying all my favorite DVD's recently but I have A LOT of CD's as well.

Unfortunately, the covers are so curved that they take up twice as much space as necessary, and don't fit on a shelf together.

But the actual storage pockets are only wide enough for the disks - the inserts are wider than that, so you cannot put one in there unless you fold and crease the insert further. (I added a user image to show this.) If you are willing to damage your inserts, then you can practically use any CD sleeve, and you don't need a DVD binder. This binder claims to hold the inserts too, it even has a picture of one on the packaging - that I consider a stretch and deceptive advertising, so I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as other colors by same manufacturer....","review":"I've purchased several burgundy binders and then added the black ones for organization of DVDs, as well as computer software and digital pictures. I will NEVER purchase the black again. The burgundy I purchased were a fine quality. I just figured the black were more inexpensive due to the color. Not so! The outer binder is bent outward in all of them. The paper lining the inside of the binder is not glued down sufficiently in places and wrinkled in others.Overall, they have a cheap look and feel to them, as if they won't last half as long as the burgundy ones. If I decide I want to purchase a different color for organizational purposes, next time I will choose the brown.

One of them had the paper bent and starting to tear away already.They come with 20 pages and you can buy more pages - which i did......i added 8 more.......and then the book doesn't close.........so there is a ton of wasted space with these.I plan on keeping them and using them just for the kids Dvd's ......being that they'll probably fall apart by poor craftmanship anyway.....but i will buy something way better for my Dvd and CD collections.All in all - just plain old not worth it and not anywhere near a good looking in person!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great organizer","review":"I bought three of these albums about a year ago to help control the growing dvd collection that was taking over the living room. I put the kids' dvds in one of them, and used the other two for non-kid movies. The room looks less like blockbuster video and more like a living room again. My one complaint is that the dvd's fall out pretty easily if the album is not held upright, and it's no fun having a pile of dvd's to clean up (I'm sure it's not too good for the dvd's either!) This is probably the result of careless children rather than a design flaw. Overall, a wonderful product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware of reviews","review":"Buyer beware. There are many false reviews floating around the internet on this product. I was searching for the lowest price and came across several 5star reviews that were identical and posted on various sites. This is usually the company doing fake reviews to boost their sales...dishonest and a poor business practice.I purchased one of these for cheaper from a different online retailer and it was ok. The quality is marginal, but they do look ok from the outside (a little cheap looking). One thing is that they only come with 12 sheets and charge you a buck twenty five for each additional sheet. 12 full sheets does not 'fill' out the binder. I got my extra sheets cheaper at office supply store or online. They do get dusty though on the inside as one of the other reviewer's mentioned.

The actual facts and history are pervasive enough that the observant reader will find a ton of accurate information, though, unfortunately, you pretty much already have to be familiar with that information to be able to distinguish the facts from the jokes. Being able to distinguish the jokes from the reality is half the fun. Both the left and the right are heavily targeted, and those who have too much faith in the goodness of big government and those who have too much faith in the goodness of America will find plenty of reasons to get upset.I can only give it four stars because a number of pages fall flat, especially some of the large diagrams and visuals.

If you've seen The Daily Show, you know what type of humor to expect - informed satire and absurdity that is humble and self-effacing enough to throw in a dick joke at just the right moment. True enough, there were more than a few less than laugh out loud moments and a modicum of tedium, but the book's clever and colorful graphic design, a parody of a middle or high school textbook complete with charts, graphs and hilarious subsections by people like Samantha Bee and Stephen Colbert, more than make up for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A riotously enjoyable and subversively wise book.","review":"(four and a half stars)John Stewart keeps us laughing as he prods us to think. Although he may be a liberal he is not of that kind that are so common these days that bores us to tears or rabidly ranting at us. Jon Stewart's approach is far more palatable. Although he is a humorist Stewarts approach goes along way in helping to depolarize a country that has become so dangerously polarized. Instead of this being a liberal diatribe it is a happy hunt of sacred cows. Some may find a few of the gags in poor taste but for the most part I think this book will make the most dogmatic of either side of the political spectrum laugh.A breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Satire","review":"Although a bit vulgar, irresistable - I read nearly the entire thing on the same night that I recieved it (as a gift) - definitely tops my favorite reading list this month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed So Hard It Made Me Pee In My Pants!!!,","review":"This book is a take on our government in all of its forms.Even if you don't get the Comedy Central cable channel and watch the \\"Daily Show\\", you can still enjoy this book for its shamelessly funny but sadly accurate observations of our government at work. I've found myself smiling and laughing out loud through entire chapters.The text is clever, thought provoking and absolutely hilarious! I even stopped drinking coffee after he mentioned a delicious coffee substitute called soyfee on his show. Its made from soybeans and you brew like coffee. I found it at my health food store but its also available at www.soycoffee.com.

Everyone from Colbert to Helms to Sam Bee to Corddry (the best ever 'news team,' I think) really keep the show going. Stewart does a great job narrating, and of course, the writing is as irreverent and as brilliant as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"So hilarious","review":"Jon Stewart in book form. Absolutely hilarious, I gave this to my (liberal) father as a gift, and he loved it too. It definitely has the Jon Stewart slant to it, so if you're not into that whole liberal humor thing you probably won't like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly, the most accurate book about American politics today","review":"This book really is a masterfully crafted political manifesto. Every page has several laughs. The text itself is written in a textbook tone, adding its own level of humor.They aren't afraid to go immature. You can tell the writers put a lot of work into the graphics, making them fit well with the text. The humor remains fresh throughout the book, they don't fall into easy formulas for jokes or anything.The thing about this book, though, is that it really pins down, more than anything else I've ever read, American politics, culture, and media. More than Tocqueville, more than Orwell, more than Aristotle, more than Marx, more than Rousseau. You read this book and laugh, but you realize every word is also true.I love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"History with humor","review":"We've all sat through history class in school discussing our nations constitution and thought it was the most boring subject. Enter Jon Stewart. He's scaled down the information to the basics, and presents it in such a way to make it humorous. You will be able to follow the timeline and smile at some of the Ben Franklin references.This is a no high brow, down to basics history lession. It's a good introduction to US history to school aged kids, or anyone who is interested in a little history with humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and educational, is that possible?!","review":"This book is the most interesting one I have ever read. Anyone who has seen The Daily Show, or knows John Stewart's sense of humor can understand how hilarious this book is considering they wrote it. It is written in the form of a school textbook including end of the chapter thought questions and classroom activities. The author's thesis is that not many people care for politics, or that sometimes they don't really make sense to anyone. One funny definition I found showing how people have little interest in politics was when he defined the word \\"primary\\"(114) when talking about elections, they said \\"[It] is like a general election except it's against people of their own party, and no one votes.\\" Or when politics don't usually make sense, here is a thought question, \\"If con is the opposite of pro, then isn't congress the opposite of progress?\\"(79)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Does anyone notice how the people who gave this book a bad reveiw refer to it as \\"liberal garbage\\" and to Jon Stewart as a \\"radical\\"? I think it is pretty safe to say that these people did not have an open mind when they started the book. Granted I am a liberal, but with a family of all republicans I have read plenty about both sides without calling any of it \\"typical conservative garbage\\". As far as the book goes, I thought it was hysterical. Laugh out loud funny!

I was only disappointed by the fact that it was not as funny as The Daily Show. Maybe this is because I am not an avid reader. Maybe it was because the book was fact filled, which I enjoyed.

I'm a former history teacher and although some of this book is researched and some is accurate, it's obnoxious, idiotic, and in poor taste. I mean really if you have to superimpose naked aged bodies onto the faces of supreme court justices to get a laugh don't you think it's time to retire? Whether you agree with the justices or not, they're accomplished and need to be treated with respect. This book is shameful and in poor taste.

In a nutshell, Jon Stewart rips all that is sacred in America. Perhaps that is funny to him but while Americans fight terror all over the planet (and die in the cause) I find it not funny at all.I'd like to see him write crap like that about Islam. I wonder how funny it would be then after he has to go into hiding for the rest of his life.Jon Stewart should move to China if he thinks its so funny to slander the nation's history and founding fathers.

The book's girth is deceiving. So, my only objection is that for the price and size, I wanted more! You may have this reaction too, so be forewarned. I finished the book so quickly I felt a little cheated, having expected hours of uproarious laughter. More like an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satire at it's finest.","review":"It's refreshing to see something that's shocking, offensive, brutally accurate, and funny as hell all at the same time.

Get it now, while it's still fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as hilarious as the show","review":"I have read about half of this book so far and just keep laughing my ass off. But the funny thing is that it is both reverent and irreverent while teaching people how our government works. I know that its not intended to be a schoolbook nor should it but it's a great supplement that will really get you interested in our government and history. This is an absolute must buy that pokes fun at all parties and people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"If more school textbooks had been written like this I actually would have read a few of them! If you are someone who gets easily offended, this is not for you.

This book is actually like the little voices in our heads- Pretty scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO FUNNY!","review":"This book is great. For those who said it was trash- you are missing the point. The Daily Show is a COMEDY show, it's not suppose to be a news show. They don't promote it as such. Same with the book. It's a comedic book, not a text book. It's not suppose to be used as a text book, it's suppose to make you laugh. He's a comedian. And he's very funny, as is this book. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stewart has never been sharper","review":"For those of you who simply avoid all things political, never watch comedy central or have the phrase \\"under the rock\\" as part of your mailing address, Jon Stewart is one of the funniest and smartest late night hosts on TV today. Stewart's delightful ability to tackle today's political issues while pointing out the hypocrisy embedded deeply within those issues continues in this Audio book version of America: The Book. Fans of the Daily Show will also enjoy the cameos by Stewart's correspondent's Samantha Bee, Stephen Cobert, Rob Corddry and Ed Helms. This Audio book is a must have for any road trip (especially if you like to drive on the left)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"Oh what a cornucopia of fun and biting, sarcastic commentary. This is an excellent compilation of facts, history and comedy blended together in a format that the NEW GENERATION can not only appreciate but will devour with gusto.It feels like a textbook--if school was actually fun--and with textbooks like that school WOULD be fun.John Stewart and his team are really funny and there is good reason why this book is number 1 in Amazon.com sales rank.PARENTS: Buy this and give it to your kids immediately. What are you waiting for? Go now.You'll be doing America a favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious read!","review":"This book is truly hilarious! It is one of those books that you don't even have to read in sequential order; you can pick it up flip to a page and read an excerpt with side-splitting results and you haven't done yourself (or the book) any injustice by doing so. I am not politically minded, but you don't have to be to understand its humor. There are no vague references to people or events that only those who follow politics would understand. And I love its format--poking fun at our nation, its leaders and its policies in textbook form? Brilliant! I can only hope for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What did he read???","review":"I am confused as to the person who wrote the \\"review\\" of this book and claimed it was a horrible history book. What book was he reading? Let's be honest....this book is wonderfully written, amusing, entertaining, and MANY other things. It was NEVER supposed to be read as a HISTORY book. It is a shame that some people cannot read a book for what it was meant to be read as....entertainment. Buy this book. Read it. Then go back and read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you know, the funnier it is...","review":"Hilarious and refreshingly erudite take on American history and government. The more knowledge you have of the events and systems covered, the more you will enjoy this highly tongue-in-cheek parody. How wonderful that a popular humorist like Jon Stewart has embraced the idea that educated and informed people like to laugh as well. Highly recommended to all those who don't believe historical irreverence is a sin, or that humor must come with an explanatory guide book--as some reviewers apparently do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny book.","review":"The book is funny. I own it. Most of the reviews below are right.But it's amazing how polarized we are. It seems like the book either gets five stars or one. Nothing in between. And if you think about the reasons for that, it's not so funny.If you've got a moment, scroll down through these reviews until you get to one by \\"Tom Sileo\\" aka \\"wiseguyrunj\\", then click \\"see all my reviews.\\" It's a revealing insight into some of the \\"reviewers\\" who so earnestly bash this piece of harmless satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah America!","review":"I wish people would review the content of the BOOK and not vent their political beliefs. \\"Jon Stewart Presents America,\\" is talented, smart, and very funny. Even if you don't agree with all of Stewart's opinions you have to admire this clever writer for getting his views across in a very witty and engaging way. It's a great book for anyone interested in exploring all different viewpoints--even if the book's opinions don't match your own. Stewart reaches an audience who normally doesn't pay any attention to contemporary issues and he sparks lively debate from both sides. And that's a good thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected...","review":"I was ready to chuckle once in a while but ended up laughing right out loud page after page!

To those who say it's inaccurate and Jimmy Carter never had a beard, you don't get it. That is the whole point its not supposed to be accurate it's in the humor section not the historical. To those who say this book shows only liberal views you must have missed the Watergate section. But all in all it's just a book that disects all the bs in American politics. I espicially liked the chapter on congress and the C-SPAN drinkiing games. If you can't take a joke don't read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few political books can be as funny as this!","review":"If you come accross this book expecting an honest discussion about politics then you will be surely dissapointed. The nuances of the Federal government are cut open for all to see. Then if that weren't enough the authors go ahead and pour salt in the wounds by humiliating these supposedly pious fools. It only gets four stars because it is entirely to liberal biased (before i get 500 conservatives calling me a great american i must clearly state that I am a liberal myself)it would have been nice to see a conservatives corner or something to that affect so that they could poke fun at their counterparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny","review":"The set up for the jokes are just too long for a not satisfying endOnly worth it if it's on sale for like 5 bucksIt's just not so funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"If you like The Daily Show, you will definitely enjoy this book.

And you might also learn a thing or two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"America (the book)","review":"America (the book) is probably the most valuable textbook you'll ever encounter. Honest, quirky, and oh so sarcastic, this was a guaranteed winner and Jon Stewart knew it. Penned by the perfect person for the job, you'll learn more from this textbook than any other government book you'll have to read in school. While it gets a little dense and, well, textbook-like at some points, and utterly crude (crossing the line more than once to 'disgusting') at others, it's a great book, one that people who love to mock this democratic government of ours will absolutely LOVE.Rating: 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read","review":"I received this book for Christmas and I haven't stopped laughing since. It is one of the most hilarious books I've ever read and apart from being funny, you actually have to be quite intelligent and knowledgeable about history and current events to truely enjoy this book.

It always leaves me rolling on the floor laughing. The program's mix of news and satire is perfectly balanced. I like the show so much that I bought the book.This book has a lot of funny things in it. I think it might be the only publication in the world to have nude photos of the Supreme Court justices (obviously digitally manipulated). The only reason that I give this book four stars instead of five is that without Jon Stewart to deliver the lines, it loses a little bit of its magic. With Jon Stewart delivering the lines, I would give this five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and informative!!!","review":"I was laughing out loud alone in my house while reading this. I also learned stuff. I think the funniest thing about the book is how accurate it was, it really had some very good points."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Stewart Doesn't Get ...","review":"Is that in text book form, even the funniest bits make me sleepy. It's like some Pavlovian reaction that harkens me back to high school when my forest-green levi's cords were just a little snug and my kelly-green izod shirt was a hand-me-down from my brother when everyone else was wearing Polo and the sun was shining directly on me, making me very warm and clammy.I further suggest he put his next book into some kind of cool hip-hop song/jingle featuring a sample from an '80s mega-hit -- perhaps Patty Smythe's \\"The Warrior\\" -- that way I'd pay attention. Because for my money a combination of Patty Smythe, Jon Stewart and hip-hop would crossover a lot of demongraphics -- especially to those who aren't bred to enjoy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"It's my own fault. I read the thoroughly mixed reviews of this book and bought it anyway. I thought \\"Surely the Daily Show writers have done a great book, and these reviewers didn't appreciate it. It's such a great show...\\". Well, the negative Amazon reviewers were right. About 98 percent of this book is simply not funny and not interesting, although it works very hard at it. One percent is vile and uninteresting as well as not being funny. The remaining one percent, scattered as nuggets throughout the book, are funny or informative or both. Probably you will pick different ones than I did, but they are not worth reading the rest. Watch the show. Skip the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"los lobos","review":"Hey los lobos - the top review would not be insulting to a reasonable reader. It's a very funny book.

Yes, I'm a senior citizen, who is bored with such childish drivel, so I asked my four middle-aged offspring to check it out and see if I'm just too particular.

The current administration is given to this trend of deception, as this book by pundit Ed Helms rightly points out. Systematically. And with charts.The oft-cited diagram of nude supreme court justices is generally considered to be the \\"emotional core\\" of this politically-charged text. But I'd be remiss not to point out, however, that it is when we see the entrance of Mr. Darcy into the action that we begin to understand the complexity of America, when we understand that Lizzy, in all of her red-white-and-blue trappings, experiences a desire both wholly human and also doomed, and that no one, whether it be Dick Cheney or Mrs. Bennet, can change that. On second thought, this book should get five stars. Viva la show du jour! Viva Mr. Darcy! Go Panthers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Christian?","review":"Jon Stewart is a brilliant comedian and it shows through in this book. There are a number of valid points and laugh out loud moments but those are tempered by outright offensive annotations. This book will be particularly offensive to Christians as its authors obviously had an agenda to defame Christianity. Overall I found this book to be very pretentious, offensive and an affront to my religion. This blasphemous piece is not a good example of progressive writing and it is a shame because Jon Stewart is otherwise a genius at creating amusing satire. It is not all Jon's fault though, this book was written at the height of the Bush administration's \\"line in the sand\\" domestic policy and many liberals were caught up in taking the opposite view to Bush and his cronies as a self defense mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that funny","review":"I feel like the Simpsons' visit to Mad Magazine.

It reads like a high school text book-gone-wrong. Reading it is like watching a long, brilliant episode of \\"The Daily Show,\\" complete with articles from Stewart's television comrades. It takes the history of America and turns it on its head showing the hilarity of all the serious moments of the past billion years. I can't think of one serious moment in this book, yet, if you were to give it to a middle schooler, it may actually pass of as a text book to them. It's that well written in its satire. Pure, unbrideled comedic genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be used in classes to teach Government","review":"This is a great book that, like \\"School House Rock\\" in the 70's, actually teaches you something while you are entertained.

I even stopped drinking coffee after he mentioned a delicious coffee substitute called soyfee on his show. Its made from soybeans and you brew like coffee.

I noticed some people seemed to think this book was more liberal, but to me it seemed to me to take a more middle ground making fun of Democrats and Republicans equally. In fact to me it seemed to make fun of the idea of politcal parties in general describing them as warm fluffy blankets to protect one from independent thought. This whole book was hilarious. In addtion to the satire on American politics, I thoroughly enjoyed the first chapter about the predecessors to American democracy(since I'm into that ancient stuff). The public opinion poll in cuneiform was solid gold!! Anyway to sum up this book was hilarious, but its sometimes irreverant humor(with cussing and multiple references to sex) may not be appropriate for the more sensitive reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I really like how this book was written in a Social Studies book format.

Not only because John Stewart's handsome face graces the cover, but because it actually will teach you parts of history you may have missed (more or less, considering they actually happened).I could list tons of highlights but instead I'll only post a few of my favorite quotes.\\"Thomas Jefferson was widely credited with inventing the cigarette slogans \\"All the cool kids are doing it!\\" and \\"You need something to do after f***ing a slave.\\"\\"Were you aware?: Though the president is never actually required to salute anybody, President George W. Bush does it regularly because it's one of the things he doesn't know.\\"There ya go.(and oh yeah, check out pages 98-99.

The stuff on the founding fathers and the formation of the constitution had me rolling on my floor. I have never laughed so hard at anything political. I have always thought that a mixture of facts and humor keeps everything interesting, but this is another story completely. Totally worth it. Some may think it's in poor taste, what with naked William Rehnquist, and all the F-bombs dropped. I didn't really look at the naked supreme court justices... Whatever. This book is too funny for words. Buy it. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very funny","review":"I've never watched five seconds of Stewart's show. Not because I was avoiding it, I just plain never watched it. I knew Stewart was a liberal, and although I am not, I'd heard enough buzz surrounding this book to make me think it was worth a purchase.I'm 100% satisfied with this book. It was an absolute riot. I laughed out loud many times reading it. What's funny is that there are tons of things in it that are totally random and shouldn't be funny, but for some reason they are. Like a sidebar at one point shows a picture of the Declaration of Independence as hot pink, and under it it says \\"The Declaration restored to its original color, fireball fushia\\". Shouldn't be funny, but is for some reason.The book seemed to get less funny as it went on, until it got to the very end with the Rest of the World segment, but I got more than enough laughs out of the early parts to satisfy me."},{"rating":"2","title":"laugh out loud funny","review":"Almost every page has something that makes me laugh out loud.

The individual novels were only loosely connected. Most people probably thought that this last book was going to draw the stories together in a grand finale. That it didnt do. The Challenger segment was at least related to what transpired in the novel as was the TNG story which was the best of the short stories here. The New Frontier story had absolutely nothing to do with the novel or the Gateways and could have easily been left out. Keith DeCandido's DS9 short story though well written didnt have the least thing to do with his DS9 novel nor the Gateways. Kira fans would like it. The Voyager story explains rather poorly the orgin of the Gateways. The TOS story is just about as weak as the novel but at least it dealt with the story that was set up in the novel. I did enjoy the Pocket Novel Timeline in the back of the book but then I am a bit prejudiced because I helped to construct it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremley disapointed","review":"I was disapointed with this book.

Buying this book was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Janice's Disappointment","review":"I've read almost every book in the Star Trek series and seen most of the shows throughout the history of Trekkies. This book was a total disappointment. Plot lines were just left without continuity in each of the sections of the novel. I actually put down the book without finishing it!I realize it becomes harder and harder to come up with plot lines, but the authors blew this one. The series leads the reader up to a climax in each of the books, but I feel empty since there is no ending in the final Gateways book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap shot by the publisher","review":"I gave this book a low mark not because of the stories, but because of the format and that this is a cheap trick to sell an extra book.This is the 7th of a set - not a series, but a set - of books about the Ionian-built gateways. I have not problems with the actual stories. They are good, well-written, Star Trek fare, spanning all televised series and the later book series that developed.What really ticks me off is that none of the stories are complete. They are all continued and reach their conclusions in separate sections of this book. So what this book is is the final chapters of 6 other books.This book does not stand alone in any way, nor does it tie the other stories together. Why not just conclude each book in the set as it was written!If you have read any of volumes 1-6 of this set you will need to read this one to find out how it ends.I would buy it used or check it out from the library, though, just to send the publisher a message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex's Book Review","review":"I must say that this was an acceptionally good ending to an awsome series that I have collected the entirety of. I recommend to all Star Trek fans, wether you read New Frontier or The Original Series, to read all these books. I own them all. The only thing that I would recommend to this Gateways finale is: Longer! Otherwise, good job to Peter David, Christie Golden, Diane Carey, and Susan Wright!

But as it turns out, it is just my imagination after all. All the story was independent and the last book is no exception. It is basically just seven stories that has nothing to do with each other. The worse thing is that they shouldn't be even called stories by themselve, but missing ending of the six earlier books. Defintely not a book, and the whole series as well, worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"The whole idea behind the Gateways series was that at the end of each book the commander stepped through the Gateway. Each book was to be concluded and the entire series resolved in this the final title.Well each story was concluded. But those conclusions were for the most part extremely stupid and played no role in the overall resolution of the series. The final story in the book, the TNG offering does conclude and resolve the crisis presented to the galaxy by the activation of the Gateways. But by that point who cares.If you've been reading this series, just read the last story at the bookstore and save your money on this useless hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has made all the difference!","review":"This flash is well worth the money.

The writing is pedestrian, and the kinds of military details and references to Roman history are cliched and repeated in each book of the series for the sake of new readers. The unimaginative use of an older centurion sponsor of a younger, ambitious sidekick can be found in any \\"buddy\\" novel or moview.

You should not buy this as a Kindle book though. At location 4769 and till the end of the book the font changes in size on the pages from very tiny to large and at times this font size change appears all on the same page mixed.So do yourself a favor and buy the book as a paperback and avoid the Kindle edition. This is the second time I have seen this happen for the books in this series for the Kindle stuff. It is a shame that Amazon does not have a better quality control/review of this stuff and leaves it up to a reader to find.

You can feel yourself drawn back in time with Simon Scarrow's characters Cato and Macro, from the battle scenes, which are increasingly described in great detail but without going overboard in the depth, to life within a Roman Legion either on the Campaign trail or on hiatus in any number of locations. A sense of realism woven within the fabric of the intrigue, character development and storylines leaves you with no option but to keep reading until you've finished the book, and then , you're left wanting more.I was hooked from the first book, Under the Eagle, and am currently having a hard time putting down The Eagle in the Sand.Thank you Simon Scarrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"the eagle and the wolves","review":"Tipical of Simon Scarrow, once you start this book like all of the Eagle searies, it is imposible to put it down.Do your self a favour, if you are into Roman history, get into Macro and Cato, very entertaining and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued fun with Macro and Cato","review":"A continuation of this light and easy reading series.

The HDTV channels look like a picture postcard, almost 3-D. The standard definition digital tv channels are very good.

If you are sick of sugar-coated,unrealistic motivational crap then you will love this book. If you LOVE sugar-coated, unrealistic motivational crap then you NEED this book. Winget pulls no punches, makes you mad, and gives the reader an extremely useful kick in the truth.

Interestingly, he admits that he has been a multiple failure in his professional life until becoming a motivational speaker; I can't help but notice how motivational speakers spend a lot of time telling us how to succeed without much evidence that they succeeded at anything but talking.

This book is a must for anyone choosing this line of work. --Jan Lastella"},{"rating":"2","title":"warm fuzzies and unassuming wisdom","review":"In a sea of academic self-help and personal essays, James Lang's account of his first tenure-track experience is -- thankfully -- more of a token from a companion than a mentor.

It doesn't. Like much of Asia's output in the nineties, either with John Wetton or his watered down mini me, John Paine, this is, for the most part, tosh. The mix is appalling, rendering in particular Pat Thrall as potent and relevant as a eunuch in a sperm bank. It's instructiive, I think, that on my version at least (put out by Eagle Records), no-one is credited with producing this mess. Wetton, usually such a competent and rewarding vocalist sounds strained and off key through much of this ordeal, with keyboardist extraordinaire Geoff Downes the only man to escape with any credit. Recorded in 1990, the ecstatic response of the Russian crowd throughout serves only to show how starved of 'first division' western talent they must have been at the time.

You have a bunch of US Navy personnel who don't quite act and react the way professional military people do. And the pace does drag a bit.But hey, it's not all that bad. The pace picks up towards the middle, and after you suspend disbelief, the story if pretty interesting. Some of the characters lean towards cartoonish, but others are pretty well drawn.

This is a must-read for anyone who wants to appreciate the true Statesman of South Carolina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a fun book for anyone familiar with Southern Politics (esp. South Carolina politics). Really looks into Strom's positions with race and his moderations from extreme positions. Unfortunately, Strom has yet to admit to taking unfortunate stances and hasn't admitted that states' rights was no more than a cover term for racist policies. However, he has since moderated his stances and has lived his life in a way that doesn't condone such nasty positions. Also, Strom's abilities with constituent services is praiseworthy.

Thanks for making the commute more tolerable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"I enjoy the world of the Elemental Masters, but this book is the weakest of the series so far. The first part of the book is more like a series of short stories, where the first part of each chapter rehashes information you already have.Also, the students with animal companions overcoming the bad guy who is trying to live forever is a plot sequence that I'm getting a bit tired of in Lackey's work.The editing perhaps needs a little work as well -- there were several bits where character gender changed, and some of the grammar was bad (repeated words in the same sentence, etc). Those are minor points, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the others, but still up to snuff","review":"Fourth (and final, I believe) in Lackey's Elemental series, this story features Sara Jane and Nan, who are students at The Harton School for Boys & Girls. Isabelle & Frederick Harton opened their school for special children, children with special talents, when they returned from India together. These children have a different kind of magic - instead of having it come from the world outside of them like the Elementals, they draw it from within themselves. However, someone has decided that the girls are a threat and is trying to kill them. Once Isabelle recognizes the danger, she approaches the Elemental masters for help, despite her bad history with the unofficial Wizard of London - Lord Alderscroft. When the Masters dismiss the threat, Isabelle faces her past and pulls her resources together to find out what malevolent forces are gathering before they can harm the children she's come to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Book","review":"I was attracted to this book because of the title. London is my favourite city and anything that has a reference to it, has an irresistable pull for me. So even if I chose the book for the wrong reasons, it still turned out to be good. Having only read 'Rediscovery' in the darkover series which Lackey co-authored, it was definitely new for me. And it was definitely a riveting and fascinating read because of the aura it surrounds you with. There is humour, subtle and sharp - and there is detail with crispness and clearness like a cold winter morning. You never feel the absence of a master plot, but the lack of it makes you take notice of the details of each situation that rises to meet you. Definitely a must read for all the people who love Darkover books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Split Book","review":"Personally, I think Lackey would have done better for her characters and plotlines if she had split them in two. One book for the Harton School plot, and another, quite different plot for Lord Alderscroft. The latter is an often mentioned character in the previous Elemental Masters books, and he certainly deserved a better treatment than he received in the novel--even though the book is named after him, he is one of the most shallow characters there. I hope Mercedes Lackey is not being hounded by her publisher or us, her readers, to produce too much, too quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I am used to","review":"Most of the books that I read from Mrs. Lackey are excelent, and I like the elemental masters series, so I thought that this one would be in the same line, and what could be better than a book starring and African Grey parrot, a parrot that I myself own? Well, unfortunatly this book was a large disapointment, and it was entirely too childish for the elemental masters series. I am giving it to stars for the descriptions of the Grey as a \\"grey fluffy pinecone\\" which was quite charming as well as accurate! On the subject of birds, Mrs. Lackey continued her exceptional eloquence, and I will look forward to her other books, for where else can you find a fantasy author who knows so much about parrots and raptors, and has had first hand experience?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fantasy Done Right","review":"I'm wondering when I'll break after reading ANOTHER book about teens or preteens attending a school of *gasp* magic or sorcery or witching or wizarding.

Rose Sabin's 'A Perilous Power' and 'A School for Sorcery'. And Caroline Stevermer's 'A Scholar of Magics' and 'A College of Magics'. I'm sure I could go on.But Misty knows how to do it better for grown-ups. The historical London is more visual. The characters have more depth. The themes are more, umm, grown-up.The end has me guessing this won't be the end of the Elemental Masters series, but who am I? I haven't been to one of those magic/sorcery/wizarding schools .... yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love elemental masters","review":"To me this series combines the best of all Mercedes work-- magic and all its legends; the ethics of thinking people; her predilection for finding a simple sturdy hero in dire circumstances and transporting that young person to a life where love transforms the young person and those around them. Retelling old fairy tales has its own magic. The legend of the Snow Queen now seems to have a basis in more than Hans Christian Anderson's imagination it has been woven into an older tradition.As for this particular tale it is about two remarkable little girls,their remarkable bird companions and a group of warriors who you want to hear more and more about. Hope she revisits these characters more closely in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunker","review":"This is a grainy reproduction of a 1953 Italian movie with awful sound quality and no subtitles.

The book is structured as a dictionary of terms relating to leadership. While some readers may like the A-B-C division of information, others may find the book somewhat disjointed, as the format forces you to skip around from idea to idea. But then, as author James O'Toole points out, readers are invited to seek the nuggets that appeal to them, letter by letter. The connective tissue that O'Toole lays between the entries is ambition, which he says is the single pre-requisite to leadership and the one common characteristic that all great leaders share. We [...] recommend this accessible summary of basic leadership principles, although hardcore readers of leadership literature might be better off elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect, buying jewelry from Amazon.

'Cottonwoodhill' is said to be a true krautrock classic that can make one's third eye cry tears of acid. I won't disagree with that one bit. In my opinion, Brainticket in general appears to be part kraut, part neo-psychedelic. A great genre if you ask me. The tracks that I dug the most were \\"Black Sand\\" and the band's namesake \\"Brainticket, Part 2\\". Joel Vandroogenbroeck's organ playing and Dawn Muir's stellar vocals seem to work well together as Brainticket more than succeeds to take it's listener's to another level of tripsville.

That, or the title is completely misleading: nothing here has the dazzling, enormous-sounding production that has become a trademark eighties sound. Why? Nearly all are from the very early 80s, and nothing is from later 1986. Bombastic overproduction didn't emerge until about '87 or '88. Think Richard Marx, Def Leppard, Whitney Houston, Taylor Dayne, Bon Jovi. This difference is especially apparent because the early 80s offer sharp contrast by sounding very small, robotic, and claustrophobic. This should have been named something else. Big hits? Yes. Big-sounding? Not at all. Plus, the songs are overplayed already (except Cry), so you've probably heard them to death already or even flat-out own then.If you want to up the slickness, up the drums, and up the charisma, check out artists and compilations with music from 1987 to 1989."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eighties Eightites Eighties!!!!","review":"One hit wonders and just good eighties tunes.

Chasing the Sun was a true breath of fresh air. The writer, who was unknown to me, has a smooth, conversational style but also manages to convey true emotion and meaning in his prose. This book emphasizes the importance of living what is in one's heart. It is about ignoring convention and living the unlikely. In the book, the protagonist goes forth in life in pursuit of his dream - becoming a pilot for an airline. The book details the commitment required of an individual to become an airline pilot but more than that - it details what the protagonist learns along the way - that life can and should be a wonderful experience for each individual but that it is up to each individual to make it happen.

One single recipe and the random musings of a bread maker barely filling the pages, unless you count enlarged, bold print. I was very disappointed in this book and give it the lowest recommendation.

It is a single process/recipe book and that is what I expected.However, instead of spending only 30 minutes writing this booklet - perhaps they could have taken a risk and spent an extra 15 minutes organizing the starter recipe into something more coherent. It is basically a short story that you need to pull the recipe out of. I am sure it is a great starter recipe but I could have used the $3 on the postage for sending a book that provides better steps - like Laurels Kitchen Bread book - which I recommend spending the extra money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"One recipe booklet","review":"This is a little tiny booklet with one recipe for sourdough.

Other than a very few isolated second hand stories of POW's 'somewhere over the next ridge line' there is virtually NO information on POW's. Lt Col Simons tells some very interesting war stories but that is about it.If you want to read about various women that the Lt. Col. has slept with over the years then this is the book for you. If on the other hand you want some information on the POW/MIA issue, you will have to search elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A summary for a book, not an actual biogaphy","review":"This miniscule book reads more like a synopsis that the author would have submitted to a publisher as a book proposal, not an actual fleshed-out biography. There is a smattering of biographical information, a few patches of analysis, and not much more. For example, the last two years of Capp's life took two sentences: \\"He was suffocating. Two years later he died.\\" Suffocating from what? Emphysema? Where and when did he die? What happened to his assets?The writing style is uneven, ranging from obtuse comma-heavy sentences filled with sub-sub-sub-clauses, to clear and passionate passages.Either there simply isn't enough source material to flesh out a biography of Al Capp, or this author gave up after finding a few sources.Either way, Al Capp deserves a much more thorough biography, which this author presumably could have written. I give this two stars just because it's the only thing available on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hatchet job","review":"It appears the author was one of those liberals in the 1960's and 1970's that Al Capp attacked and is seeking revenge.One of the best insights into Al Capp was a book called A Hard Hat's bedtime story where Al Capp stated he did not switch political beliefs, but switched to the group he felt down trodden which was the working stiffs who supported the spoiled brat hippies and others blaming the older generationWhen Al Capp was a liberal up until the 1960's, the conservative element who he attacked chose to ignore him, but when he started attacking liberals, they chose to censor him, harass him and other dirty politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"hatchet job","review":"This book is filled with inaccuracies.

Whilst I do applaud Ian for putting The Supremes back together when no-one else was interested, the video here of \\"I Wanna Be Loved\\" is of such bad quality that I wish it hadn't been included and the ladies themselves (Lynda & Scherrie) were not happy when they saw it.

For that reason alone I gave this CD four stars. However, this CD is not comparable to the experience of the Jam On Revenge album. Jam On Revenge, which the first five songs on this CD are from, was a concept album about \\"a band of musicians from a far off galaxy were music and dancing are against all cosmic and computer law\\". The concept, the way in which Newcleus connected the songs, the relationship of the songs to one another, the artwork and the bands futuristic sound all worked together to make, in my opinion, Jam On Revenge one of the best albums ever recorded. The group's later recordings were ok but Jam On Revenge set the bar so high that it was probably impossible for Newcleus to reach it again. Hopefully Jam On Revenge will become more available in the CD format for future generations to enjoy.

The possiblity that their faith alone could shield them from demonic forces is A CROCK. Even the most devout, and knowledgeable, exorcists are at great risk when battling these evil forces.In my opinion these people have no more knowledge of demons than what could be found in the King James VERSION of the Bible, from which they frequently quote.If you are looking for a trustworthy source to aid you in battling demonic forces, LOOK ELSEWHERE.Given the option this would have recieved ZERO STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best werewolf story I've read...............","review":"Could have used better editing, and I didn't care much about that giant kid that much.But the plot and writing was first rate.

If thats the style you like then this book probably isn't that bad. The only thing that really sticks out that bugged me was the cops just letting the reporters walk all over the crimes scenes.

This book is what I think of when I think of a werewolf story that I would love to tell.Too often the werewolf of most modern stories are weak examples of the raw power that can be found in the subject.But,thankfully this splendid tale puts them back where they belong...As a rending,slavering,howling nightmare that has us all with our heads under the sheets and silently begging for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"best werewolf book, worst e-book format","review":"This is the best werewolf book I've read, and I've read them all.

I finished that series and could not wait to start the next. I have enjoyed V. C. Andrews books so much, I believe, because they are a mixture of all kinds of writing. They are real in a fantastic way, they are humorous yet very tragic they are every kind of literature all combined into one!!

I listen to just about everything, but when a band abuses horrible power chords, bad drumming, and the stereotypical 'metal' voice with a bunch of 'dark' cliches, it just makes for bad music.

Now none of this stuff might matter to you and if so cool--but I would have liked to know this before I bought the album. They should not be considered christian. None of their lyrics talk about God and one is very violent. The corus is \\"Hunt them, hurt them, get away\\", that's it, no follow up on comdeming these actions in the slightest.

I have found that romance novels are often terrible, but I really enjoyed \\"Highland Velvet\\": It made work more bearable.I managed to finsh \\"Velvet Promise;\\" it was a decent read, nothing special. I read \\"Highland Velvet\\" out of curiosity, and I have to say I am VERY glad I did. The characters have chemistry, and the setting/historical background held my interest. Also, I think most heros in romance novels are quite silly, but I actually loved Stephen: Deveraux mananges to make him silly, sweet, cute, and sexy.I tried to read both \\"Velvet Song\\" and \\"Velvet Angel,\\" but they were huge disappointments compared to \\"Highland Velvet\\" and I couldn't finish them.

There is a lot of arguing, throwing insults and fighting physically, which I'll add is more of the heroines doing. Concessions/bargaining is mostly given by the hero. This goes on and on and on... and sounded old and irritating in the end. There's very little romance between them, let alone love. Makes one wonder how they came about that feeling in the end.

I agree with one reviewer from Moreno Valley, that Bronwyn have too much hate in her heart. That made her look ugly to me.

Her foul mouth is annoying and very unlady like at all. She has no finesse whatsoever. Made you wonder what Stephen sees in her. OK! she is supposedly beautiful but heck, her mouth and her attitude sucks badly! My ears is actually still ringing from all her whine and insults. I had to force myself to finish this book!

The composers and their works here for the most part sound very much the same throughout, much stress on severe register shift and dynamics.Two selections I enjoyed were Robert Saxton's \\"from a distant shore\\" and Maxwell's \\"Songlines and Cadences.\\"This music certainly must be engaging for these composers and the performers who play such.

From my vantage point, I've seen religious conservatives be used by politicians for their own purposes, with little commitment or resolve to support religious conservative objectives.

On the other hand, it seemed like the author tried for young adult and just failed. The magic was cheesy and lame and the medieval world they traveled to was as fake as a made for TV movie. Jarrod, one of the main characters, was whiny, annoying and constantly questioned what was going on around him. Who gets transported to another world and continues to simper and complain and rail against it? It was frustrating to say the least. It was a struggled to get through this one, but once I start a book I don't stop. Once again, I judged a book by its cover and got schooled.

I was bored with the rest of my books so I picked it up and I couldn't put it down! Although Kate seems like an incredibly wacky weird girl-- the first chapter takes credit for this, plus the fact that Jarrod, a seemingly normal person, thought she was, she really grew on me and she was easy to relate to as a ghost among her peers. Jarrod, despite playing the typical high school preppy jerk at first, becomes a very dynamic character who embraces his so-called gift when necessary and really grows a backbone by the end. I really wish that she would write a sequel because I want to see what happens next to these quirky, magical people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!!!","review":"I believe this book is amazing, if you want a good book to read, and fall in love with, than I recomend Old Magic.

Especially when all of the dolls (sold separately) are posed on it. It's VERY cute! However,the design/quality is very poor. Mattel needs to keep in mind that parents sometimes need to relocate or store a toy, and this playset cannot be moved without falling completely apart. It falls apart when it's played with too. Also, the backdrop is made out of cardboard. CARDBOARD! It doesn't attach firmly and keeps falling off. I don't think Mattel bothers to test market their toys with actual children anymore. If they did, they would know this needed more work before release. I guess it's cheaper to rush a toy to market before Christmas than to perfect and produce a quality product.

Momo tells everyone he knows, \\"No more kissing!\\" But it doesn't do any good.

Then one day he tries to comfort his new baby brother, and a very amazing thing happens! This colorful jungle tale is funny and silly, with just the right amount of tender sweetness.

The installation is as easy as they come (plug it in - sheesh, my mom could do this).The sound was great out of the box, but the real trick for XP users is to maximize their sound output through a combo of the Windows Audio settings in the Control Panel, and through your MP3 software (I find WinAmp3 works best.) Once you've got the finer settings down, the fidelity is UNREAL.I'm hearing things in some songs that I only hear on my expensive home audio system.

Don't get me wrong, I love Metallica, but think of the tediousness of the riff in relation to Christe's (what is someone with a name like that doing writing a book on metal anyway? Points for irony anyway) literary drone. Basically, Christe wanted to write a book where he can suck up to Metallica. Rife with inaccuracies (e.g., details of Black Sabbath and Kiss backstories) and smelling of poseur-ness, the book's only redeeming quality is coverage of Black Metal. Deena Weinstein's silly pseudo-social-scientific book makes better reading and has more authenticity. Allow me to summarize: I like Metallica, so does Christe. I didn't write a book about that. (I also didn't get published, so there's that). Maybe I should force Christe to read my unpublished writings. Of course no one forced me to read Christe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my new Bible","review":"Now, see, this book is not your run-of-the-mill factual information book. It can be clearly seen that pictures and interviews were carefully taken and meticulously collected. Dates and sources were painstakingly gathered and verified. Yet, even then, it still goes beyong a simple book of information. The descriptions used within the text lets the reader know that the author, Ian Christe, is passionate about the allmighty genre of metal and all the subgenres it holds. From its early beginnings with Black Sabbath, till the turn of the 21st century, Christe goes beyond the imagery and music and delves into the very mindset of the artists of each time period. Any one that is an avid metal fan and eager to learn more about the history of the ever-revolutionary genre should definitely pick this up, as well as self-proclaimed aficionados, for they too will be taught many things from this fantastic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it, don't buy it","review":"Other reviewers have listed the flaws (basically an Ode to Metallica, ignores important bands, dismisses punk entirely, etc) but I also have a juvenile negative reaction to anyone listing \\"living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn\\" in their bio. That one sentence speaks volumes about what is inside. No judgement, I live in Williamsburg, too, but...The book is interesting, but not worth the cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes","review":"This book is ok as a general read, and has some interesting information, but it makes too many mistakes and spends too much time on a few US bands. Don't even bother with the grey recommendation boxes; they have no idea about classification of metal and miss out on major releases/bands. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!","review":"MY GOOOOD this is by far the best Heavy Metal history book ever, it's been written with such passion for the music that makes you want to buy every album by bands you've haven't heard yet. The explanation of why neither Zeppelin or Deep Purple are the fathers of heave metal it's great, and gives Black Sabbath full credit for creating this amazing type of music. Any metal fan should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest book- DO NOT BUY IT.","review":"What would you think of a rock \\"scholar\\" who says that Queensryche's Operation:mindcrime is a science-fiction opera? This person is way too lost and greatly uninformed. Cut to the chase. More than a history of heavy metal, what this dishonest book really offers is an open love declaration for Metallica. Each and every idea or happening in the book has to be related to that band. Remove all the Metallica related information and you will get maybe 3 pages about other bands. The book is light and shallow because the information is nothing but common knowledge for any metal fan. Summarizing: this a Metallica worship biography publication disguised as \\"the history of heavy metal.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I was close to Clueless","review":"I was close to clueless on the history of heavy metal before I read this book. Im as big of a metal head as anyone can be who plays guitar in a metal bad. Music is my life.However, I didnt know the history of it well at all. I didnt know where it all started, how it started, who started it, or the problems it caused throughout history. All the chapters were in depth to their subject, and well writen. If you need a history leasson like I did, this book is for you.However, I found that the band Metallica was talked about just a tad too much. They did make a huge difference, but I felt like I was reading the history of Metallica more than the history of heavy metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! Let's hear it for King Diamond.","review":"I thought this book was good because it gave some well deserved attention to alot of the lesser known bands of heavy metal, such as Mercyful Fate, Celtic Frost and Immortal.

I have another one I've had for 3 years now. Like all purifiers the filters are exspensive. It is cheapest to buy 3 filters at a time.

I actually like it on high in the bedroom at night, I can't sleep without it running now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe It's Not Better","review":"This is the type of novel that SOUNDS as if it should be a good read, a thriller, a nonstop pageturner, but alas.....like the margarine that parades as butter, I can't believe it's not better! Heilbrun should have the background to avoid such triteness, such sadly strung-together unbelievable tripe, but 'tis not the case. When I found it listed on amazon.com, the site it took me to had a long list of numbers, letters, etc., in the web address line, prophetically enough ending in \\"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,\\" which is exactly where this novel brought me. This makes even Grisham's mediocre fluff seem positively genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"no proof of talent","review":"this turgid tome relies on every cliche in the courtroom drama book -- a yawn from beginning to (finally) the end. arch gold is as dull a protagonist as i've ever come across, recycled from every one-hour tv show. ending is ludicrous and predictable. damon's depiction is offensive to me, as a black man, just another case of a rich white guy trying to get inside the head of a kid from harlem -- gimme a break. and give yourself a break -- don't waste the bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Arch Gold -- is that supposed to be like Golden Arches, as in a famous franchise, because someone obviously wants this to become a franchise, I look at all the five stars begging for a series, one review's written by someone with the same last name as the author, and I think --to become a franchise, you can't have a hero with the personality of a piece of iceberg lettuce, you can't have a book that never finds its own voice, that never provides you a laugh or a tear or gives you goosebumps (if I want to learn about the legal system I'd rather read a textbook, probably have as much suspense) --but to be a fiction franchise, you've got to meet the Gold Standard, like Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe, you've got to have a main character readers really care about and identify with, which I'm sorry to say I didn't, and as for all these \\"twists and turns and surprises\\", I say, get over yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"burden it ain't","review":"hold it -- did they expect us to think this was scott turow's \\"burden of proof\\"?! no way is it half as good!!!!first chapters not bad, but then it's soooo by the numbers. male characters are better than the women at least, who are totally 1-dimensional, a mistress, a stripper, talk about cliches. character development way too weak, arch hasn't grown enough in interesting ways for me by the end ot the book, and i can't find a theme anywhere. all the dialogque sounds like i've heard it somewhere before.final verdict -- \\"offer of proof\\" is a turow wannabe that lacks imagination emotion & suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Write This One Off\\"","review":"Zero humor, flat dialogue, blah characters, especially Gold. \\"Offer of Proof\\" plot tries, courtroom stuff so-so, but didn't get any sense of the Big Apple, and that's what I was looking for. I mean, why bother to set the book in New York City and not capture the buzz and energy of the big town?I'm giving it one star because it seems like he got the legal-eagle details down, but who gives a damn without an exciting story riff? The only really good thing I've got to say is, I didn't spill anything on it when I was reading so maybe as a Christmas re-gift it'll work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offer Of Proof -- A Lead-off Home Run","review":"New author Heilbrun touches all the bases with his first offering. Riveting portrayal of New York's criminal justice system with enough plot twists to keep you guessing until the very end. Can't wait to follow the courtroom adventures of Arch Gold in the sequel. If Heilbrun can mentate filmically, Offer of Proof will be an exciting movie soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 Stars -- A Real Page-Turner!","review":"With is first novel, Heilbrun catapults himself to the top tier of legal thriller writers. It tells the story of a beautiful executive that is robbed and murdered, and with her dying breath identifies her murderer. Or does she? Heilbrun writes in a style that keeps you riveted to the page to find out what happens next, provides interesting characters -- especially his hero, public defender Arch Gold, and offers a plot that will keep you guessing right till the very end. When Heilbun is ready for Arch Gold to handle his next case , I'll be right there with him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a Son Follows in His Mother's Footsteps","review":"When one learns that the author is the son of Caroline Heilbrun, the author of Kate Fansler mysteries,it is not surprising that the author has written such a well paced thoughtful whodunit that creates realistically much of the aTMOSPHERE OF NEW York city criminal procedures. Unfortunately, justice does not always triumph."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"Major plot twist at the end a poor effort to keep up with the pack. The female lawyer is totally extraneous. The prosecution case not even close to \\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" Overreliance on the F-word in the narration. Lawyer-narrator begs you to love him. Every character a walking cliche.Plus added for interesting legal points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a winner..so many things to like about this","review":"book. The prose is 1- click fast and the neat, economical use of the right word in the right place only adds to its' allure.Heilbrun's words riccochet like bullets from one page to the next and it is almost impossible to put this book down.I loved his characters: understated but so crisp I would recognize them if I met them on the street. Real life people in real life situations of love, hate, revenge, despair and anguish for Matt Gold the public defender who endeavors to save Damon Tucker a young man accused of murder, from death by lethal injection.This read was like eating one potato chip...you just are hungry for more and I hope they are forthcoming from this new author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is up for an Edgar?","review":"I realize that this is a first novel, but I expected far more from a book that is being considered for this caliber of award. Clunky, over-explanatory writing and stilted dialogue are further hampered by one-dimensional, self-consciously \\"colorful\\" characters (everyone wants to be Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen these days). Heilbrun also wastes paragraph after paragraph using the main character as a mouthpiece to demonstate what an incredibly talented and knowledgeable lawyer he is. Add some really nasty stereotyping of Jews, Indians, and Asians (A Chinese doctor who doesn't know how to use pronouns and articles? How did he think he could get away with this? Shame on him and on his editor!) and the general effect is unappealing in the extreme. A real disappointment. As \\"The DaVinci Code\\" proved, knowing a lot of interesting facts about a subject doesn't mean that a person can write about it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it","review":"I picked up this book at the bookstore while still in hardcover and after reading the description thought it sounded good. So, I waited for the softcover. Good thing I did.Although I like the basic premise of the Public Defender trying to figure out a murder in which he is suppose to be representing the killer, I just could not get into it.I think the problem with this one is the writing style. Although the author writes in non-legalese, there is so much said for nothing. It feels as though the author just keeps writing and writing and never actually gets anywhere with his theme.The action is fair, but I was so bored by the time it appeared that I just could not get into it.I really, really wanted to like this book, but it just did not happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poster OK, frame is junk","review":"There are many Klimt \\"The Kiss\\" posters to choose from so when I saw what appeared to be a good deal for a 24x36 print framed, reduced from $180 to $34 I went for it. I paused when I saw the shipping charge was $59 but decided that was OK for what must be a good quality product, usually $180. It arrived today and I really feel duped. There is no way this could have ever listed for $180. The poster print quality is OK but the frame is junk - very thin and flimsy with a piece of corrugated cardboard for a back and thin acrylic on the front. The cardboard is ill fitting and loose so the poster falls to the bottom of the frame. For the $59 shipping you can buy a much more substantial frame at Target, etc. I could have bought the same poster for $7 with free shipping rather than the $93 I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Driveway Lights","review":"These are excellent for marking driveways and sidewalks..these are brighter than most and are of relatively good quality..metal spikes are always a plus, which these have.

I only got a chance to install the set after my 30-day return window was over expecting that the quality would be the same as my last Westinghouse set which I also bought from Amazon. A lot of the parts where bent probably due to shipping. But besides that, it was missing two of the stems. As far as the light output, I will have to give an update later on since I have to give it 8 to 12 hours (or maybe more) of charging time to make a final judgment. For $99 this was a big a disappointment.

The 1/4\\" jacks are wired so badly one jack was completely useless (because internally a wire crossed over in such a way to short anything plugged into it). The other 1/4\\" jack was intermittent, mostly due to its inability to lock a cable into place inside it (because of cheap and flimsy connector parts).Lastly - the cheap material used to cover these speakers is damaged very easily, and after only a few shows has large scratches, holes and tears revealing the wood underneath.

I also found that positioning along the length of the door is also a factor - it seems more stable when positioned toward one end of the door or the other.I did not have the problem of it falling down due to gravity like another poster, but door I had it on only gets opened/closed < 10 times per day."},{"rating":"2","title":"works good","review":"This does what its made for it moves up and down a little bit compared tothe fixed ones but moves out of the way so its kind of a trade off.

The main premise of the book is that there are gifts in all events in our lives, even (or maybe particularly) in the difficult times; we just need to open our eyes to see them.Eble's message is based on her collection of stories from her own life as well as the lives of others. Each day presents a different story and a discussion of the gift the narrator discovered as a result.I picked up this book in a bookstore at a particularly hard time in my life, when I needed spiritual support. In the dark days I experienced, Abundant Gifts was a ray of light shining through, helping me to think, \\"What gift is God giving me today?\\" It helped open my eyes to the reality of a God who cares about me in the little details of my life and who wants me to see and delight in His blessings.Abundant Gifts was a blessing in my life. Thank you, Diane Eble!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I used to be into Todd Rundgren back in the early '70's. But when he started doing Utopia, I quit listening.

Not every song on here is a gem and some leave me scratching my head as to why it is considered one of his \\"best\\" but by the time I get to the song about playing his drum all is forgiven.

Every rapper in the group is FANTASTIC - not only can they spit extremely well but they have great charisma. You will love how they sound. The lyrics are also very well done - they're definitely catchy, somewhat memorable and, most of all, interesting and occasionally deep.

It makes the undo-able seem doable.If you haven't done much math to begin with, the first few chapters breaks down all the basic stuff you need to know.

The pioneer representative said that it was a laser pick up problem. Nothing (DVD, CD, etc.) will play on it. So off to the repair shop it goes. Hardly, what you would expect from a quality Pioneer product. It is fortunate that there is a one year warranty on parts and labor, otherwise it would be a large paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips easily, doesn't play DVD-R","review":"I bought the dvd player two years ago, and it is already skipping with lightly scratched DVDs. Also, the machine does not play DVD-R (home-burned DVDs) well at all, so I suggest you buy an upgrade machine. Even if you do not burn your own DVDs, you may receive some from friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!","review":"I am about to return this item for the second time. The first time, I returned it because the picture was \\"stuck\\" in widescreen mode -- no matter what setting I had it set on.

So frequently, a set might hold one product I enjoy, but the others are sort of \\"throw-ins.\\" Not so with this Ahava Gift Trio.The full size Body Lotion is alwys on my bathroom shelf. It offers the greatest softening I've found with a once daily use. After a shower or bath is the perfect time to rehydrate your body with this mineral rich lotion.Although I don't have a problem with dry, cracking skin on my hands, a friend who does swears by this hand cream. I use it primarily in the winter (as I dislike wearing gloves) or when my hands have been exposed to water over a period of time.The foot cream is another triple treat as it softens, heals and disinfects. It contains camphor if there is a need for soothing dry skin, and a natural disinfectant, Tea Tree Oil to banish any potential odors. It's a true treat for your feet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends what you're looking for, I guess","review":"This is certainly not a two-star offering. Yes, the jacket copy's a little over the top, but this disc is a long way from sleep-inducing, unless you're immune to a killer groove, stellar playing from all involved, and just a doggone infections vibe.In fact, this release, with its ingratiating mix of traditional Celtic instrumentation (concertina, fiddle, small pipes, whistles) and funk/dance elements (organ, synth, electric guitar), practically single-handedly redeems an entire wasteland of prior electro-Celtic efforts.What makes this work where other forays flag, drag, and go limp? First, these people seem to just want to have fun. No big egos, no world-saving pretensions. Just great music brilliantly played. Second, this is a true mix of traditional musics and modern grooves, not a dreaded musical jackalope. Third, a genuinely haunting Celtic sensibility reigns throughout, no matter how playful and even cheesy the proceedings get.Recommended. ****1/2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment in a small package","review":"Do not be fooled the the description on the CD sleeve.

Not just for Holmes fans by any means. Its full of wit, wisdom and great characters. The Great Game has a real feel for time and place with echo of what is to come. Kurland's Prof Moriarty is a first rate creation. From one puzzle after another the excitement keeps building to Kraiser Willhem himself leading a charge much to the dismay of everyone! Most of those rescued are properly thankful except for Barnett ( one of the few Americans) who was focus of the first two Moriarty novels who only grouses - what took you so long!Highly recommended!

I like the step-by-step directions with visual illustrations. It also includes literature connections, poems, songs, and theme related extension activities. Each child assembles their own portion so there is no sharing of germs. No heat source is required. I've tried several recipes with my special education class (k-2) and my students have enjoyed them, and they have been easy for my students to prepare and clean up. Some recipes are fairly nutritious, but others contain ingredients that are sugary or have artificial flavors and color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome teaching tool","review":"This was a great book, I used it everyday teaching and working at a daycare.

The unit comes well packaged. The parts are well labeled and hardware packaged quite well. The unit is pretty easy to put together using the instructions and with my wife it took us just about 1 hour moving at a slow pace and stopping to watch tv for a few minutes from opening the package, taking out all the parts, gathering the necessary tools, and putting it all together. For us this nightstand looks to be a great value.The only thing I will say is I would like to see a few more words with the instructions.. there are good pictures and some words but a few more detailed words would go very far.Over all I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand for the price.","review":"Item came as described, all the necessary parts came in the box. You get what you pay for its not a $250 night stand so don't expect that.

I definitely needed at least one drawer so for around $50 these were by far the most affordable so I took a gamble on them... what a good choice that was.Assembly is not that bad although a bit time intensive. Based on other reviews of this and the matching dresser, the drawers tend to be a bit flimsy, so I used Gorilla Glue to secure the bottoms of the drawers and they are very sturdy. I'm not sure how much of a difference the glue made since I didn't use them without it, but they seem to be well made given the price tag.Overall, these are great night stands and would definitely recommend them over anything else near this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"I used this product once and it worked.

The ability to review the book on Amazon was not available (probably for a good reason). I suggest you check it out elsewhere before buying it. In my opinion, it is only mildly humorous. About $5 worth of humor. The fancy cover is nice for a coffee table. But, you really do not want guests picking this up and reading it as a possible reflection on your personality or lack there of. All I can think of is that the book is written to be funny to a specific group of people.

It tells the whole story, from his youth to his gold medal to his ascension to the championship to his exile from the sport and right through to the end of his fighting days and his later-life bout with Parkinson's. It works for fans of Ali, obviously, but it also works if you want a general primer on boxing history or even an overview of the social, cultural, and political tumult of the 60's. Love him or hate him, the man is an icon, and this has all the footage and all the interviews with all the people who know and were there.

To be fair - some of the fights you only get a couple of important rounds - but as a whole this is the greatest of any Ali VHS/DVD I've ever seen.You get to see some others interviewed about Muhammad Ali - from his brother - To Angelo Dundee - to Malcolm X - it' just incredable the amount of footage that this makes available to you.I know it's said a lot, but if you're an Ali fan you HAVE to own this...you have to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Received inferior product instead of product listed","review":"\\"The volleyball net received was not the product listed.

Her cliched song lyrics offer nothing new to music.

Another Rinadi historical fiction. This is a very tedious and winding novel that just shows that Rinaldi is running out of time periods out of history. I thoroughly enjoyed her WOLF BY THE EARS, and COLONIAL AMERICA stories, but this book was just to rediculous. Maybe Ann Rinaldi should consider trying to act out the lives of people in Europe (Elizabeth I, Lady Jane Grey, Ann Boleyn) and drop the whole American theme.I'd give this book 1 star because of it's weak content and obvious historical remarks, but threw in an extra star because Ann Rinaldi is one of the best historical writers I have ever come across. If you're a new Rinaldi reader, try her other more great works, but if you have read all her other novels, just might as well read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Confusing","review":"I thought this book was very confusing.

This book is not something you easily forget. It is very depressing, definitely not for young children, but quite well-written with likable and complex characters (Salmon and Dauphin come to mind). The plot is not surprising (except for the very end) but it is well done and documents a part of history that few really know about in detail. I recommend this book; it's not just a kids' book, it's actually rather good and quite interesting.

It really is a \\"no-brain-er\\" cookbook! She also has substitution tips that you can do to make the recipe even lower in fat and calories. She includes the nutritional information and portions for those following diet plans. Overall, this is an excellent slow-cooker cookbook with one caveat.

Sadly, this book is not it. The recipes are healthier only because they call for low-fat canned soup and low-fat bottled salad dressing. Many of the recipes are very similar, too similar to be included in the same cookbook. \\"Fix It and Forget It\\" has more variety, and if you use low-fat prepared ingredients, the same health quotient...\\"How To Make Love and Dinner\\" gives more interesting and varied recipes. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I bought this cookbook because it sounded like just what I needed: healthy meals that I could make while I was out all day. However, this book is a huge disappointment. Besides having almost no photographs, most of these also have no taste! Many do not even have vegetables added, which is one of the great pros of using the slow cooker. I was hoping there would be more all-in-one type dinner recipes. Also, many of these recipies are disturbingly similar, just having different names in order to fill out the book. Flipping through this book does not even inspire me to try anything at all. I wish I'd seen it before I ordered it.

When her father remarried, their new mother was a mean, sadistic woman. But she treated her two children as precious diamonds. This book is an autobiography, so it's narrated by Adeline and talks about her feelings. When I read this book, I understand how lucky I am to be loved. Adeline was mistreated by her stepmother, but she was given confidence by her Aunt Baba and her Ye Ye. Although Niang (mother in Chinese) was crushing Adeline, it makes you so mad that her father doesn't do anything about it.

It doesn't take long so be careful. Also, it's not strong enough to hold much of anything.Worse, it does NOT hold up in the heat. I was horrified to see when stirring oil to cover my pan (not above 4 out of 10 for heat) that there were black smears, the turner was leaving nylon on the pan in several places.

It's not the only one I use -- I also have a sturdier turner for heavier foods cooked in nonstick pans, and a couple of metal turners for metal pans. But I reach for this one the most, because it slides readily between the food and the pan. Yes, eventually the heat will make the nylon crack and you'll have to replace it, but this is not an expensive item, and I haven't seen anything better. (Although if you know of a similar model that will last longer, by all means, tell us about it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alert DANGER","review":"Unless you're flipping dollar pancakes or fried feathers this thing is a hazard! Tapers to lunch meat thin and once exposed to heat it has the integerty of taffy. The hazard comes from trying to compensate for what you know is bending the tip down, natural reaction is to lift up flipping the product out of the pan. I did find it useful to frost a cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO FLIMSY FOR A FRIED EGG","review":"I don't know what other reviewers are using this for but the business end on mine is too \\"bendy\\" tohandle anything, it also started to melt when I had to spend so much time trying to get it hold my eggs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not come as advertised","review":"I purchased this item because of the great reviews it received. I did read the most negative review also, however the good way outweighed the bad. Generally as is the case with amazon, reviews are accurate. Not this time. The paddle is very weak and it does have a very difficult time with something as simple as eggs, much less a burger.
