The first twenty pages of 'inferior white boy' I took with a grain of salt, ya know, it's a book about the world of non-white gang bangers, so I endured it thinking the rest would sort of springboard off of that...it didn't. It's an interesting book, just too one sided for my taste. I mean, you could be talking about giving away free gold bars or the second coming...and I'd want both sides represented. Didn't happen here, at least not to my sensibility.Also the writing style, to me anyway, seemed like it wavered between a fictional novel and a nonfictional narrative, kind of all over the place.

The main character is a static girl-child who never learns anything from her many mistakes. She is too dim to the see obvious and too weak to take control of her life. She is as thoroughly unsympathetic as the plot is stumbling, falling from one coincidence to another until it concludes with a deus ex machina. One hopes for at least some definitive opinion on the caste system from the author, but the themes are so shrouded in sketchy and flat villains and the commentary so bland and sparse, I couldn't discern the message at all. One of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Reading","review":"This book is a murder conspiracy set in a fictional world contolled by societies classes.

The basic storyline sounded interesting and somewhat novel, so I bought the book. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its promise. For one thing, it was just to0 depressing. Also, I agree with the other reviewers, I really couldn't get into the character. It was decent writing, but there were no redeeming qualities to overcome these two major flaws. Don't read it. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I just didn't find the book very interesting.

I started this book three different times and was only able to make it half way. The turn of events just isn't that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple of good ideas, but...","review":"I'm a big fantasy reader, and I picked this book up because the book quote on the first page absolutely intrigued me. However, the plot goes somthing like this: An apprentice to an artisan's guild is framed in the prince's murder and subsequently brings down everyone around her, and then has to work her way back up. The basis was great, I really liked some of Klasky's ideas. One of the little details I loved was the set up of the caste system in Rani's (the heroine's) world, and I also enjoyed the set up of the princes murder. But after that, the book really petered out on me. The plot stumbled about aimlessly, and the end left me UTTERLY unfulfilled. I really truly got the feeling that Klasky got bored with the book and wanted to finish it off really quickly (I know I did), so just whisked out a cardboard ending. Still, it was a good learning experience for me on what makes or breaks a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitingly Funny","review":"Having lived in the most liberal city in Iowa for close to ten years, this would seem like satire if the characters weren't just like people I'd met. If you can imagine Grant Wood meets \\"The Osbournes\\" with a healthy dash Joe Friday and Charles Manson, you'll get a good idea of what Carl Houseman's world is like.Some mystery stories are good. Reading a nice Agatha Christie you sort of puzzle your way through and get to the end and feel, \\"well that was very nicely done.\\" Reading a nice Harstad is more like watching the Munsters move to middle America.It's funny and short enough to read in a day or three. It won't make you rethink your life, but it might make you rethink the idea that small towns are boring little places where nothing ever happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tale","review":"The main character, Houseman, has a nice dry sense of humor and a nice way of telling the story. With all the overwrought and uninformed (may I say stupid) \\"thrillers\\" I've had the misfortune to run across lately this is a welcome change of pace. It also helps that the author is clearly familiar with police work and able to convey the day-to-day realities in an interesting way. I've read a few others of his books since and my opinions stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have the worst luck buying books at airports...","review":"I picked up this book a few days ago on a trip up to Seattle. I have to say it took the first 150 pages to really get into the book, which is very technical in nature. Its obvious to me that Donald Harstad was a talented police officer in his previous incarnation. There was quite a bit of, in my opinion, useless dialogue that really seemed to be there to just fill pages. The story itself was at times intriguing but it tended to sputter out more often than not. A lot of the character development seemed wasted in the end which, in my opinion, was extremely anticlimactic. I hate to give this book such a terrible review because after all the lead-up I was really looking forward to a big payoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"This is a long, boring novel. I really tried to finish it because I hate not reading a whole novel. I just couldn't wade through it. The dialogue is clunky and there is too much procedural. An investigation of a crime scene lasts 100 pages! Good luck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arnie","review":"I purchased this video for my Grandson who saw it at Kaleidoscope in Kansas City.

The adapter does not fit the DC-07 because the brush attaches directly to the nozzle. Very disapointed because both pieces are cheaply made plastic and I end up paying for an adapter that does not fit the machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets that dirt, dust and pet hair around the edges","review":"This little brush is great on stairs - carpeted and uncarpeted, and going around the wall to wall carpeting at baseboards and in doorways - places where the vacuum cleaner can't go or won't pick up. The dust and pet hair that build up around the edges of rooms always make the floors & carpeting look dirty, even though it has just been cleaned.The brush's stiff bristles are strong enough to stand up to the floors, rugs and carpeting without scratching, although I would not use it on silk area rugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so glad I bought this brush!!!","review":"I purchased this brush for use on my steps. Alhtough I have the mini turbo brush that came with my dyson, it seems like it doesn't have enough suction power to even turn the brush bar when i'm doing the top steps. as a result, i gave up using it and have tried several different products to remove the stubborn dog hair from my carpeted steps. THIS BRUSH FINALLY DID THE TRICK!!!! The stiff bristles make it effective in combing the hair up out of the carpet and bringing it to the surface of each step. I find myself vacuuming my steps much more often now, because i'm so pleased with the results. Works great on my couches and the car too. I found that the bristles on the standard brush attachment that came with the vacuum were too flimsy to clean the couch effectively. This little puppy does just fine!!! Check out the soft dusting brush, too. I purchased them together and love them both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tool","review":"Although this seems like an accessory that I could have done without, I am very, very please how useful this tool is. It does a better job of picking up debris where the wall and the carpet meeting. I also used it with Absorb carpet cleaner. In the past I was not able to get all of the carpet cleaner up, but I can when I use this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"easily The One","review":"If you can only get one attachment, get this one. I have a lot of different attachments (flexi, soft, low floor, mini, and the three standard ones), and this one stays on my DC17 a lot more frequently than the others combined. It is especially useful for cleaning tiles. The standard brush is too soft and cannot scrub the dirt/hair out.My only complaint is that the base of the attachment cracked over time, but this time duct tape is a perfect solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I love sacred harp singing, which makes the bonus disc a great addition. Even if I didn't love the music, I think I would have still enjoyed the documentary on this nearly lost American art and those who preserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant, but sort of long","review":"Having thought that 'Awake My Soul' was to be a two-disc CD set of Sacred Harp singing, I was surprised to find that it was a DVD set that had to be viewed rather than heard. The first DVD centered upon interviews of many individuals concerning how they became involved with Sacred Harp singing. Of interest was the portion concerning the development and history, with brief samples of singing in church U.S. colonial times.The second DVD consisted of actual singing from several congregations in southeastern U.S. While very enjoyable to listen to, after the first hour, I wondered if they would ever run out of songs. The exposure was very informative, and I would no doubt feel comfortable in giving it a try, but I would have liked a little bit more introduction to the reading of the notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chef !

The jokes are mediocre and, very unfortunately, it has a laugh track. A really annoying, loud, \\"laugh here cause it's funny\\" laugh track. It would be much better without it; I don't need someone telling me when to laugh.I will watch a few more episodes but, so far, not a great series. I keep hoping for another Jeeves and Wooster, that show was great and didn't have, or need, a laugh track."},{"rating":"2","title":"A culinary classic","review":"Chef features the biting and hilarious wit of Lenny Henry as Gareth Blackstock - one of England's finest chefs. This marvellous collection, comprising all 3 series, features Henry pushed to his absolute limits with incompetent staff, budget cuts, naive diners and even crayfish escapees. His well crafted verbal attacks on staff often require replaying to truly appreciate his unique wording. The only down-side of Chef is the limited no of episodes per season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chef! - The Complete Collection","review":"I loved this series and wish it would come back on TV since cooking is so popular.

Stan Ridgeway's \\"Ballad of the Soldier's Wife\\" is another pleasant suprise. From there it goes down, though. Lou Reed's \\"September Song\\" is quirky and my first thought was that it misses the boat entirely- but it grew on me over time. Even with his limited vocal abilities (or perhaps because of them) Reed really delivers a performance that's true to the lyrics. Marianne Faithful's \\"Ballad of the Soldier's Wife\\" is another track that I didn't care for at first- and now it's one of my favorites. The rest of the album is a similar mix of small treasures, and a great introduction to Kurt Weill for modern day listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This magazine is the biggest rip off. I wouldn't even call it a magazine. In total it is 29 pages and there are 2 articles totalling 4 pages. The entire rest of the magazine is advertisements. I bought this magazine based on reviews I had read that said it was full of color photos and details about the island. The photos are all advertisements. So, basically you're paying them to send you junk mail. Don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love It","review":"I just got this camera about a week ago and I am absolutely impressed. It takes digital stills and video without having to do anything special or without any annoying pauses or interruptions. The video is clear and stable and the picture quality is really good. And it was easy to use right out of the box; a stong plus for a non-techie such as myself.In short, this is a great buy with numerous features, great quality, and a price thats unbelievable for what I got.Its a high end performer at a mid range price. If you find a BETTER camera at this price (which I don't think you will) you should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore at its best.","review":"I discovered Sick of It All by accident. I was listening to a radio show back in the 90s, and the DJ mistakenly said this was 'Anthrax with the new singer John Bush'. Then 'We Want The Truth' came blaring out of the speakers and I was floored. I rushed to my local record store to get Anthrax' 'Sound of White Noise', only to find out it wasn't them. One of my fellow headbangers told me that it was this hardcore band Sick of It All, and the rest is history.Actually, this should have been the album Anthrax should have made. But their loss is SOIA's gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick Of It All at their very best.","review":"In my opinion, this is the best Sick Of It All album available. It is the perfect balance between Blood Sweat and No Tears and Scratch The Surface.This is pure hardcore/punk. The album is heavy but manages to keep up the pace and intensity. The lyrics follow the topics the band often covers (the anxiety of living in the modern world, fighting injustice, firendship, betrayal)and the vocal delivery is amazing as usual. Bottom line; Anyone interested in some of the best hardcore available needs to hear this record. A great album by one of the best (and longest running) hardcore bands ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"This bag is lightweight, fashionable, and sleek. However, I only recommend it for carrying a few essential items (files, notebooks, paperback novel, etc.) since it is pretty slim and the straps are thin. Also, it has a really cute feminine floral patterned interior lining and it contains compartments for pens, cell phone, ipod, etc. This is a perfect bag for the office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the Series","review":"I have a somewhat different view than alot of this series' readers. I have read the later books in this series, although it never even excited me enough to make me want to read the pre-Lauren being Mrs. Gregory entries. I gave the previous entries I read 3 to 4 stars, because they were good, but Gregory pales in comparison to Alex Delaware, and Kellerman's series is really the only viable comparison to this series. And that's why I really liked this book. We saw less of Gregory and more of two great, great characters, in Kirsten/Peyton and Carl Luppo. Gregory himself is a slightly boring protagonist, but not so these characters. If White makes Kirsten, or even Luppo, turn up in later entries in this series, the series will become much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever from Stephen White","review":"I have read all of Stephe White's books. I have thoroughly enjoyed each of them......except The Program. The Program was slow moving, boring, and did not have nearly enough attention on the main and usual characters: Alan, Sam Purdy, Lauren, etc. I couldn't even finish it it was so boring, and usually I can't put down a White novel until I'm finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read","review":"One of the reasons I enjoy reading Stephen White's books is becasue I like the Colorado setting. The plot always goes from plausible to somewhat ridiculous, but you can count on being entertained and the characters are engaging. Nothing heavy, just a pleasant way to spend a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"The biography notes state that Mr. White is the bestselling author of eight previous novels. Apparently, that status intimidated his editor, who did a disservice to readers everywhere in letting this book reach print in this state. The writing is mediocre and the plotting is awkward. I forced myself through the first 200 pages, but it never improved. I'm not going to bother finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Furious","review":"It was an excellent novel with many things going on at the same time. It was filled with action and suspense and even dissapointment for the characters. I couldn't put it down. I would even wonder what was going to happen when I was doing other things during the day. I had to get back to the story. Buy it, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fast read","review":"Great novel...departs from the usual series characters, but very juicy....you won't want to put it down!

My advise is to get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great eats!","review":"I have made many things from this cookbook and they have been wonderful!

It has some famous recordings by Lester Young with Count Basie (in both small combos and the full Basie Orchestra) in the late 1930's on both the Columbia and Decca labels. There are also several excellent tunes with Billie Holiday on vocals. The sound quality of this CD is excellent throughout for music of this era. I think this CD is the perfect complement to Count Basie: The Complete Decca Recordings because you get some of the most important and famous Lester Young solos from the Columbia label without having to buy the Columbia Box set (America's No. 1 Band). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont Blink (or we may miss it)","review":"Nodes of Ranvier is a great album...although both are really good, the first album \\"Lost Senses, More Innocence\\" was a bit better and more enjoyable to listen to.

I do face painting for large groups of disadvantaged children (at homeless shelters, special events, etc.). Therefore, I have only a brief amount of time to paint each child's face. I usually show the children the book and have them pick out what they'd like to be. But they would be very disappointed in the final result if it doesn't look like the wonderful images in the book, which are enhanced by the costumes. Many of the pages in this book are only devoted to creating the costumes (often without any face painting even involved). So it doesn't suit my purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rice Bran Solubles concern","review":"I ordered 2 containers of Rice Bran Solubles and when I opened the jar it smelled old, so I checked the expiration date on both jars and they were dated good until 10/10/09.

It quickly became apparent that we didn't know how to handle it in heavy weather. Catamaran sailing really is a bit different.This book was exactly what we needed. It starts at the very beginning, and the early chapters were a bit *too* basic, but the later chapters fill in the level of detail we needed.

Tons of generic information on buying a boat, sailing and turning a boat. Hardly any specifics on any boat. I was very dissappointed.

Don't expect a lot from this particular movie (loosely based on Pearl Buck's book). It would never win an Academy Award, but not every movie is made for such shallow recognition. The Chinese women characters are stunningly beautiful, the location photography is breathtaking, and even Willem Dafoe is pleasant enough to watch in this film. This is one of those movies guys love because it has enough story to keep the girls interested, and enough slow periods where you can get a lot of hugging and kissing in. For that reason alone, I should have given this movie 6 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A period picture that looks like it was made in the fifties","review":"Don't buy this because you like Willem Dafoe, or because you loved Crouching Tiger. I couldn't believe how blatantly they exploited Dafoe's famous scene from Platoon, or how cartoon-exaggerated the characters were. The acting is inexcusably awful. It all sounded like a parody of a dubbed Asian film.

They'll only be understood if they want to be. I like dogs, but cats have it over them in the smarts department. I mean, let's take a look at how each responds to a suburban city street. A dog will wander out into the middle of the road without a thought in the world, careless to the danger of oncoming vehicles around him. The dog unfortunately will likely be struck and killed by someone not paying attention. The cat on the other hand, darts across the street, observant to its surroundings, conscious of its mortality. I also happen to agree with De Niro's character in Meet The Parents, when he talks about how cats make you earn their respect. That's mostly true. A dog is more fun to play with, taking it for walks, throwing the frisbee. But the cat's selectivity and aloofness make the attention it does give out more interesting and valued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"This video has nothing to do with the history of the chicken.

The title misled me to expect a history of the development or evolution of the species. No such thing, it was largely anecdotal stuff about one guy's problem with noise-complaints from neighbors or a lady's love for her one chicken, etc. Not even very entertaining, rather amateurish. A waste of money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got anything better to do? Do it!","review":"This was one of those movies I do know why anyone would bothered the time and money in producing. The title is deceiving as there isnt a single tid bit of history in this film. A few of the other reviewers mentioned how most all the people in this are nut jobs, well they arent kidding... Weird is one thing, but they are embarrasingly rediculous in a bad way! Like do I really care to watch some hugely overweight farmer show off his crowing skills for over 5 mins?.yeah sure he's good at pretending to be a damn rooster or hen, but come on?!! The film says to have been released in 2003 but much of the footage looks straight from the 70s.It's really too bad, because there is a growing trend and a whole new generation of people learning to be more self reliant right now in this economy and no doubt the chicken, one of the oldest domesticated animals in history is making a come back.Save your time, this film is a JOKE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it if you love chickens!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my mother who owns a flock of chickens.

Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is a lie.","review":"I ordered this expecting that a PBS documentary entitled, \\"The Natural History of The Chicken\\", would be about, well, the natural history of the chicken. Like how they originated in Indonesia and then tracking their domestication, breeding, and etc. Nope. This was a cute little video with little vignettes about cute little chicken stories. \\"Chicken Run\\" was equally as informative as this was.Maybe as a collection of cute chicken stories, this is a great video.

Not only is it funny, as many of the reviewers here have said, it is also very, very, sad. It tells some wonderful stories about chickens and the last one about the chicken who's chick is attacked by a hawk is quite moving. But, there is a dark side to this as well because it shows very clearly how human beings abuse and use chickens as pure commodoties.Watch this and you'll never feel the same about chickens again.And ignore the person who thinks it's mad - it's not mad, it's just that they don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"no history here","review":"No history whatsoever, though it does have some dated facts.

What history?","review":"This video has absolutely NOTHING to do with the history of chickens. The video is about a very few people and their oddball relationships with chickens. It's very heavy on anthropomorphism of chickens and trying to make those who love chickens look silly through extended scenes of people crowing and dancing about like chickens and bathing their darling rooster before taking him grocery shopping in their purse. If you're looking to learn something, this isn't the video to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute But Not About the Natural History of Chickens","review":"This movie isn't about the natural history of chickens -- not even a little. It's about people who love chickens and their chicken loving stories and opinions about chickens. It's cute at first, but meanders aimlessly into stupid, wholly establishing its pointlessness within the first 20 minutes. At about the 34 minute mark they talk about Miracle Mike. He was a chicken who lived for years with nearly his entire head cut off. Seriously, for all intents and purposes he had no head but got along well enough without it. They somehow managed to make even that boring. I don't know what happens after that, because I turned it off. Maybe it gets good at some point. Perhaps they mention Africa. It's hard to care after that first 20 minutes.

It easily evokes strong emotional responses from the viewer with its poignant and thoughtful messages.

These are tales told with a deadpan and a tongue in cheek ala PBS's Rare Visions show. Something here will have you chuckling...or clucking....and putting a big smile on your face.

There's also just a hint of that high-tech, ultra-brutal deathgrind sound that bands like ORIGIN and CATTLE DECAPITATION provide in abundance. The riffs are killer, and the drumming and vocals are more than solid. The songwriting is also solid, but this is the primary area where I feel that the band has room to improve. Also worth noting are the intelligent, sincere, spiritually-motivated lyrics, which are (for me, anyway) a welcome change from the typical gore/death lyrics.

Cosette's song, which should be a tear-jerking, plaintive plea sounded like a kindergarten kid rushing to get it over with. Jauvert's song should have been passionate and deeply emotional.

It makes a mess of my eyebrows and I end up having to redo them in a darker color. The applicator is not easy to use, the pencil is wholly useless, and I do not have patience for this product.

I bought this to hold me over. Ultimately, I like it. My only problems are that, I wish the pencil was a bit larger and I wish the gel was a bit darker.I got dark blond and the pencil is fine but the brow-set gel seems to be a much lighter blond, so when it catches the light you can see the difference between where the pencil is and where the gel is - not a fan. Next time I'll probably nab a light brown and just be more gentle with the pencil and go heavier with the gel. The pencil is waxy but pigmented, which is great fora brow pencil and the gel holds all hairs in place. If you need an inexpensive brow kit, I'd get this. Though I also suggest using an angled brush and a matte eyeshadow of the right color to go over the pencil work before setting, though you could definitely just use this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revlon Brow Fantasy","review":"I wish that the taupe shade had been available, but I really like the pencil.

Stevie is trying to uncover a secret that a young actress that seems so depressed over...Carole is trying to have fun but keeps worrying about earthquakes and Stevie is still brooding over the accident that nearly claimed Callie's life.

I can't see a difference in this series from the other one except that the Saddle Club can drive.

This is one of the most comprehensive works of the subject of gardening I am aware of and to top it off, it is even readable! The format makes finding information quite easy.

With over five acres of flower gardens, vegtable gardens and fruit trees, I find my self constantly returning to this volume for information. Cannot recommend this one highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLICK. INFORMATIVE. COLORFUL.

(Carry this one around and your green thumbs will be black-and-blue.) But if it's comprehensiveness you want, things are growing right here. Everything -- and we mean everything -- gardening gurus and wannabes need to know is here. There are handy plant guides, zone and frost maps, detailed garden plans, illustrated troubleshooting guide, sections on rotating crops, creating topiaries, plant diseases, planting bulbs, composing color, choosing garden accessories -- 1,000 slick, color pages covering more than 600 entries. Just add water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest bibliography in history","review":"This is the first book I read where the bibliography is half the book. The information given in the book is rehashed from his other books. He is churning out books at a rate of 2 or 3 a year. I guess you can do that when every book has the same information. I like Gary. I have been to many of his lectures and was a member of a support group he had. Unfortunately his books don't live up to his lectures and radio show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only half of the ultimate lifetime diet","review":"I bought this book expecting to receive a comprehensive 31-day plan complete with recipes. As I began to write out the recipes, it became apparent that nine of the lunch recipes were missing in the first week alone! Since the author does not respond to email at his website, I am stuck with a lot of expensive health food ingredients for breakfast and dinner, and no way of knowing what to do about lunch! It can also be very difficult to locate a lot of the ingredients, even if you can figure out what they are. I don't recommend this book for anyone serious about the specific diet plan because you will be disappointed. There are other points he makes about exercise and self-empowerment that are probably covered in many of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The season that runied Chef!","review":"The first two seasons of Chef! are absolutely brilliant and some of the most entertaining television one will ever watch. Season three, however, is virtually unwatchable - they changed director, changed from film to video tape, replaced many of the actors and the result is perhaps the fastest downfall of a great series in television history. I would avoid seasons three like the plague but do check out the first two seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than what has been said","review":"After reading some of the reviews here I was reluctant to pick up the third series of this wonderful Britcom. I'm glad I used my own judgement instead of relying on others'.First: The change from film to tape doesn't really change the feel of the series. It does look more 'sitcomy', but the atmosphere is retained.Second: The Premise. It shouldn't really surprise anyone that Gareth has been dumped by his wife, you could see that in series one. Granted, Gareth is more whiney in this series, but characters are supposed to develop over time. Gareth and Everton do just that.Although not up to the level of the first two series, series three had me laughing out loud several times and is well worth viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely celebration of decency surviving temptation","review":"Jones's first novel is a delight--the cleanly-told and poignant story of two friends and a huge amount of money that may or may not be counterfeit. It is at once a classic meditation on the ancient theme of temptation and poisoned fruit, and a near-perfect gem of a study of (somewhat downwardly mobile) suburban life in Marin County.Jones gives us vivid, endearing characters, high and low comedy, and a richness of compassionate observation. The book's deep affirmation of the ordinary--the money we sweat to make, the love we earn through faithfulness and endurance--is deeply felt and resonant. A gorgeous book--well worth scouring your local used bookstore for (though you may have to look hard and long...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to life debut","review":"I was drawn to this book initially because not only did I live in Marin County back in the 1980's (the very time and place the novel was written and is set) but I also actually worked behind the bar at the Shakey's Pizza in Terra Linda that provides one of the main settings for this novel. So it's a good bet that author Louis B. Jones was one of my customers at some point! The great thing about this - and Jones' follow-up, \\"Particles And Luck\\" - is that it rings true to life. The characters are recognizable from daily life and their dreams and aspirations ring true. This novel is to Marin County, California what the films of Bill Forsyth (\\"Local Hero\\", \\"Comfort And Joy\\", etc.) are to Scotland: a sweet and whimsical slice of life so real you can taste it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"If you are looking for good music and great organ work you must buy this CD.

I have an Intex Ultra Frame 32' by 16' with a 16\\" Intex Sand Filter with the Saltwater Chlorine Generator... living in a rural area there was only one sand available locally. I purchased the \\"no brand\\" pool filter sand and installed it. After backwashing and rinsing the sand I quickly found out the sand was too fine as it began pumping out into the pool. I emptied the sand and ran the filter without sand until I could find a suitable sand. Intex recommends a '20 grade' sand with a particle size between .85 and .45. The Quikrete sand label does not boast a grade but a quick visit to their website revealed a particle size of .85 to .425. I decided to try this sand and found the particles to be much larger than the local \\"no brand\\" sand. A quick backwash and rinse and my filter was up and running perfectly. Thank you Quikrete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work for my filter!!!","review":"This sand did not work in my sand filter and all I ended up with is a mess.

As a reader, I could predict what was going to happen in the next 10 pages. There was an unbearable amount of sobbing (not from me, but by the characters in the book) every few pages. The women in the story are all stunningly beautiful of course. Strangers start loving each other inexplicably within a span of a couple of days. I'm sorry but this story hardly reflects reality. I was so looking forward to a quality book but it seemed that Ms. Rice just put SOMETHING on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warming","review":"Cloud Nine by Luanne Rice is a 5 star book.

Now after reading Cloud Nine I am happy to say I have have another Rice title to add to those I loved the most. Despite that parts of this book were fairly predictable, I found myself moved by both the story of the main characters and their joining together as they race against time. I also found the plot had many of Rice's signature themes such as the love of a mother for her child and parent, the love of a man for a woman and a budding romance between two young people. If critics feel that Rice's books are too sad and sappy at times, I say while this may be true at times, nobody does these emotions better. Now I can hardly wait to read her latest book, The Secret Hour, inwardly hoping that once again I have another title to add to my best loved books by Luanne Rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Kleenexs ready!","review":"This is such a sweet book!

Here was a smart, funny, quirky writer who could skillfully blend elements of romantic comedy, melodrama and, yes, even a ghost story.Where did that Luanne Rice go? \\"Crazy in Love\\" retained that sense of quirkiness, but it's been downhill ever since. Her books are growing less sophisticated and more obviously designed for the mass-market romance crowd. She's capable of more. I've bought every one of her books in hardover, praying for that sense of oddball magic, but with this mess, my loyalty has finally reached an end.Oh... the two stars are for the portrayal of the teen girl, who manages to struggle out from beneath the syrup to engage the reader's attention just long enough to finish the book.

Luanne Rice takes the reader inside the hearts of the characters. She guides us through the process of living, loving and dying in a short time.

Consequently, I only take in about 25% of what Sean Paul is saying on this album (even though he is one of the easier artists to understand). The beats are mostly uptempo dance tracks that bang even though I can't do those moves they do in the videos! Just that one move that Sean Paul does.This is a fun album, definitely throw it on if you having a party that's about dancing. He also has some slower songs on here that are just as good as the uptempo songs. My favorite songs are Temperature, We Be Burning, Give it Up To Me, Connection, All On Me, Head To Toe, and Ever Blazin. The album is bumpin, although a little long, nonetheless hot. If you don't have this already then go out and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reggae Mon-Dancehall- Love it!!!","review":"Very good product. I love Sean, because I can understand what he is singing and rapping. Dancehall is great to listen too and chill out. He put 17 songs on this production. WOW!!! Well worth the price if you ask me. I like about 14 songs. \\"Give it up to Me\\", \\"Never Gonna Be the Same\\", \\"Ever brazin'''\\" \\"Head to Toe\\", \\"Connection\\", \\"Straight Up\\". Just buy it already!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for anyone who likes to dance","review":"This album by Sean Paul is named the Trinity because it took him 3 years to produce, it is his 3rd record and it was made in the 3rd world (Kingston, Jamaica). I think it's really amazing that he made this masterpiece in a tiny little recording studio in Kingston. The sound is unique to Sean Paul and I am certain it will be an international hit. I have danced to Temperature and We'll Be Burning in New York, Miami and Las Vegas -- it's at every dancehall and if it doesn't make you want to dance, maybe get your blood pressure checked."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"good album though not as close to Dutty rock.Sean seems to do well with slow jams.If you remember the one he did with Sasha.I like songs number 3..6,,7..8..9.They are guaranteed listener ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total dissapointment","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this cd.

They squeak like crazy after every bump in the road and going over speed bumps. If I could afford it I would get rid of them and buy better ones. I would not recommend these bushings to anyone.

The book contains a wealth of historical information on the Belk chain and some excellent photographs as well, though there are no color photos. It's an interesting and easy read that will please the history buff, the retail fanatic, or the casual reader in most, if not all. This book is out of print but highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun pedal!","review":"This is an interesting pedal. You can learn about the specs online. My impression is that it's got a really nice growl when the distortion is on; I really love that sound. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it trying it in a store, and I still love it. It's been a unique sound for me so far (I don't own a ton of pedals, yet!). Without the distortion, it can be a decent simple envelope filter. It doesn't have too many tricks up its sleeve, but you can get it modded to take the internal trim pots outside and they tweak further parameters (or you can tweak them from inside the box... the mod I just described makes it convenient). I haven't done this, though. A further note for those unfamiliar with this stuff: It's built very well. EHX is one of the foremost innovators in the effects world, and they make quality stuff. I have no complaints with this pedal (no noise, no pop/click when I hit the footswitch, no tone suck, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Dog Food","review":"After the recent pet food scare, I was looking for a natural dog food and treats that I could send my parents for their dog.

She loved them all, so I ordered them by the case and had them shipped directly to my parents. She cleans her bowl each time, so I would say that is a good indication she likes it!

Unlike many poets whose forays into rhyme and meter end up stuffy, hollow and nostalgic, these poems feel alive--because they come from a deeper place. They also reflect the substance of the poet's life without sloppy self-absorption. If you want confessional angst or self-consciously clever word games, look elsewhere. If you're looking for depth, originality and incisive wit, Rosser's poems deliver. Many contemporary poets cannot work in form. Rosser can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery Indeed","review":"Deeply awful poetry.

Before I work on my Volvo, I read the relevant sections from both books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This manual admittedly tries to cover a broad range of years where the cars went from carbs to injection, so Haynes gets kudos for at least putting something in print. The reality of such an effort, however, is that unless you are doing something so simple that you probably don't need a manual anyway, there are simply too many differences between the years for Haynes to put any detail into areas like injection, pollution controls, etc. For what I needed the manual for, it was completely worthless and there was simply no way to know that without buying the darn thing. Anyone want a used manual?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak electrical and fuel injection","review":"This manual is weak in certain areas.

The first track, \\"The Retaliation Intro\\" is an awesome way to begin this dual-disc set. As some reviewer(s) believe there are many filler tracks on this cd, there are none. Each of the songs are good, if you take the time to listen to them all. This group knows how to flow, and prove it in this album.There is one song on this cd which makes this cd worth every penny: Thug Luv (featuring Tupac). Everyone knows how to flow, and they show their talent in this song.If you like Bone Thugs, get this cd, because this is one of their earlier releases, and has pure Bone Thug rhymes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bone CD ever; even better than E. 1999 Eternal","review":"Art of War is the a really cool CD.

She is posessive of her father which whom she becomes obsessed with later on in the movie. As far as the plot, it takes on many facets which do not fit right for the theme of the movie. Through the protagonist's eyes, you can see how far away reality becomes, and eventually how she is corrupted through the events following her mother's death. At times, the incestual overtones made me queasy, and the end was sort of expected due to the lack of definition to the characters. Sometimes during the movie, one could get the feeling that it was more of a who-dun-it film than anything else. Although disturbing and dark to watch, there are not any scenes of nudity, just the adult situation, language, and violence content. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriuging","review":"I am a great fan of Julia Stiles and she really keeps yourinterested in this film.

Stiles plays a typically lippy teen who takes on her mother's role when the mother is gruesomely murdered. Since the DVD package contains a spoiler for the film, I won't be revealing anything here you can't get from the packaging.

The opening pre-credit says, \\"contains explicit sexuality\\". When I'm warned about something, I expect to see it. There isn't so much as a nude scene in this film.

Was in the library in college looking for a book and came across this one. I have read many true crime books since that time but this one always stands out. I have recomended it time and time again and have had everyone agree how incredible it is. I live in Texas only a few miles away from the murder scene. Many of the landmarks were familiar to me. I have read over 100 true crime books since this first introduction to this one but have come across few that are this good. I couldn't read fast enough...truly could NOT put the book down. Another great one is \\"Lethal Marriage.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding!","review":"It's rare that you get 32 out of 33 five-star ratings, but this book certainly deserves it. I read it a couple of years ago, after reading a magazine excerpt right after it happened in 1980. It's as frightening and engrossing now as it was then. This has all the elements of first-rate drama: an ax murder, an affair, characters you wouldn't think would be involved in anything like this. All happening in small-town Texas, where infidelity is a definite no-no, and people's lives revolve around church and community.It's still interesting to speculate as to what really happened that day, as we have only Candace's word. The final verdict that was rendered will definitely give you pause. A very good book, holds your interest all the way through, and when you're finished, you wish you could continue following the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"THERE IS ONLY ONE THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS BOOK. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST TRUE CRIME BOOKS I HAVE READ IN AWHILE. READ IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!!!","review":"With great trepidation do I give this one star, for I fear the wrath of St. Alphonsus. The author's ideas are wonderful.However, this edition of his work is absolutely horrific. This earned a single star because of the number of typographical, punctuation and spelling errors present in the text. On page 18, which is the first page of the saint's work, one finds five of these errors (including misspelling the Latin \\"sacerdos\\" as \\"SaceVdos\\"?!); three on the next page, two on the next, three on the next, and four on the next...and I could keep going, but I tire of this sort of thing. These are not grammatical oddities specific to the translator's time and usage. These errors are editorial ones made in transcription, and the blame goes entirely to St. Athanasius Press.I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Blasphemy","review":"\\"God Himself is obliged to abide by the judgment of His priests, and either not to pardon or to pardon, according as they (the priests) refuse or give absolution...The sentence of the priest precedes, and God subscribes to it. - Dignities and Duties of the Priest vol.12 pg. 27God is obliged to abide by the judgment of the priest..really.

Whether or not they made 1st chair, or scored a spot because of an excellent audition (how could one NOT make it??), they will know they did the best they could because of the steps they followed day after day with the plan Mr. Roberts laid out.

HOWEVER. I would like to be able to purchase the rock tracks that set the mood on several occasions (Boomkat - The Wreckoning is a good example).I am willing to buy these tracks on one CD. I am NOT willing to buy mutliple CDs at 25$cdn a go in order to get a small amount of tracks off of each CD. I'll burn my own, thank-you.Once again the recording industry attempts to force us to pay exhorbitant amounts of money for a CD on which we may (or may not) enjoy a maximum of 3 tracks; yet they whine when we download the music for free off of the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"This CD is a huge waste of your hard earned money.

It arrived on time but while I was trying to put it on my bike I noticed a faulty in the product, there was a small air bubble in the tube rubber when it was manufactured so it had a weak spot that would probably give way after riding, i don't think this is universal for all these tubes it was just that the one I got had a weak spot. I returned it to the seller and they kindly sent me another one that was fine (I asked them to inspect it). Also, the nozzel on this product is the newer kind so you'll have to buy an adapter at a bike store which is only about fifty cents if you're going to use the older pumps to inflate it. Hopefully get back on the road soon, i go about 15 miles 3-4times a week.

The movie seems at times to play out in real time which will enthrall some and exasperate others. Yet I feel that if someone has found the patience for subtitles they can dig a little deeper and muster the thoughtfulness necessary as the main character's grief process is painted in slow satisfying strokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I thought I was watching a documentary, not a filmI guess I should appreciate the movie for its artistiuc merit but there are certain things about it that bothered me.For instance the lack of dialogue, lighting and camera shots made it very difficult for me to keep my eyes open.At one point in the film, for some reason the widow is depicted cleaning stair steps for a good 1-2 minutes. Scenes like that spoiled the movie for me by making it very dull.Its not that I'm some spoiled American who only likes watching action movies.If you are looking to view a more interesting film try \\"Eel\\" or \\"Kikujiro\\"I just don't feel that this movie is for everyone. It certainly was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt work dull and boring","review":"interesting story line but shallow and goes nowhere. kubrick style drawn out and paced shots are unimaginative, poorly composed, and add little or nothing to the experience. looks like the ending is just a contrivance to exit a lost story line. i've lived in rural japan and it's the most boring place on earth (perhaps the intent here but hardly something you'd pay money to suffer thru or for masochists only), you dont think the younger generations flee to the cities for no reason at all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good gift for starting Manga artists","review":"This was a holiday gift for my brother (who is an adult). He has been enlarging and copying (by hand) Manga drawings for at least a year, and his work is beautiful. He just couldn't seem to make the leap to making up his own characters. I flipped through this book once it arrived, and thought it (along with 2 others I got him) would go a long way towards teaching him how to draw his own characters. I don't know how much overlap there is within this quite extensive series, but at least with these first few books there didn't seem to be much.When he got the books he praised them highly and he seems excited to put the new techniques to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good,but not the best","review":"This is good book, but really expensive and short.This is about backgrounds in manga,and this book teaches how to make background , what shows mangahumans feelings.This book has about 4 pages whit naked mangahumans, so this is up 13 aged.Im 13 and i like this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good from Start to Finish","review":"If you are a fan of good music that puts a smile on your face, give West by Hello Dave a try. From the opening of Golden to the last notes of Believe, this is a solid album. This album in my opinion is the best studio work they have done so far, and ranks with the best work of the Dave Matthews Band or Widespread Panic. I listen to golden every time I want to get my day off to a good start. Mountains is also a great song, I really like the lyrics of this one, makes me want to move to the mountains.Road Song is a personal favorite, I just love to hear it. Biminy and Brown Well hint at the fun of a live Hello Dave Show. Chicken Man is a cover that is better than the Indigo Girls original. and finally believe is a song that most bands would love to have at beginning of an album, let alone the end. If you got to the end of this review, what are you waiting for, go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for starters","review":"It has the essential PDA features -- touch screen input, hot synchs with the computer, 1 MB of memory, planner, memo, to do lists, time, currency converter, attaches to a keyboard... I got mine as a gift just before I was about to buy a popular brand and I am so greatful I got this for free because now I know the popular brand is hyped. There are some problems though. The unit hangs once in a while. The screen is smaller than the popular brand by about an inch. And the backlighting is not as clear as the one on the cellphones. In fact, it is hard to read in the dark. It also has no internet capabilities. But somebody graduating from the pocket planner should be okay with that. The only other major hitch is the 1 MB memory. But I think that shouldn't be a cause to worry if you regularly hot synch with your computer like I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"After reading the description before buying, I thought that this might be just what I wanted. Not so. Instructions are not too clear, and the display sucks. You have to hold it a certain position to be able to see the display to do anything. It is supposed to have a backlit display, and it does, but what a joke. You can hardly tell the difference between backlit and not backlit.

I really expected a whole lot more from Royal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favorites of the past","review":"All the famous favorites are here and done exactly as you remember them.

Many pieces I already knew but would not have been able to play them all together; this CD has done that for me. I would have liked even more of the mandolin pieces playing some Italian favorites. This instrument is particularly beautiful (the mandolin) and is so Italian and mediterranean. Lovely vocalists for the arias of some of the nicest operas, too! It was all very beautiful and relaxing to listen to and I felt my self reminiscing the few times I spent in Tuscany and other parts of Italy. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy But Disappointed","review":"I had heard this CD at a friends and loved the music. Great for quiet times or background music for dinner. The complaint I have is that although the CD arrived in a reasonable time and was completely sealed, there was a small nick in the CD which prevents it from playing the last song. I decided to purchase a \\"new\\" CD at a higher cost then I could have bought one used to avoid a situation like this. This was my first purchase at Amazon and I don't think I will ever buy like this again.

I wished the cd would contain more songs but nonetheless, a must have for Allison Moorer fans.

I honestly don't really see what all the excitement is about it. I mean, occasionally it can be fun--I think Sokka's rather funny--but for the most part, the voice acting isn't very good,and the dialogue definitely leaves something to be desired. The fights can be pretty neat, I will say, but there are lots of much better animated shows with better fighting.Of course, even the problems with the animated series are greatly dwarfed by those in the Last Airbender non-animated movie, which I think is quite possibly the worst movie of all time. But I still would suggest seeking out other animated shows. While it could be worse, it is overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opened and used but marked as \\"new\\"","review":"I was extremely disappointed when I received this item. My son noticed that the box that the DVDs were in was not in the best shape (looked like it had been opened) and when he opened the box one of the DVDs appeared to be missing.

And then she got the first two (individual) DVDs of season one. I AM HOOKED! The animation is superb! And the fight/bending sequences are pretty amazing for a kids show. I'm limited, but when Aang was in Zuko's quarter's (Episode 2) and when Aang fought is old friend (Episode 5) were fantasticly animted. And the voice acting puts it even higher.What isn't mentioned much here is the music. It adds such an element to the show. It is simple, sometimes just acapella, but it is spot on and cleverly edited.My DVDs are very blurry, which I see is common here. I hope, pray, wish that they re-release it with a better version. I am conflicted because I want to give 2 stars for the product. But the show is worth more than 5, and that is what people here want to know - if the show is good.LOVE this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just plain awesome","review":"This is just a plain amazing series. i was a skeptic at first and my friends got me to watch it and i finished all three seasons in one weekend. i literally could not stop watching.

It's well written and easily enjoyed by young and old. I'm 30+ and thoroughly enjoy not just the well done animation, but the top notch character development (you'll really feel for, not just the good guys, but the bad guys too!), and the way the story elements intertwine in just a way that you would not expect from an animated series. Every episode will have you wanting more! That's not to say it goes over the head of the younger audience either. My 10 and 5 year old nieces love the show and were shocked that I knew 'The Avatar' and would sit with them and watch and enjoy the show as much as they do.With this set you'll be getting the full first season, or \\"Book 1\\". All 5 discs are available individually as well, but buying this full box set not only is cheaper, but it gets you a bonus 6th disc only available with this set. Well worth it! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Great TV Show (and it's animated!)","review":"This show is quite amazing. The storyline is wonderful, the characters are intriguing and true, you even develop soft spots for characters who are suppose to be the \\"bad guys\\" aka the Fire Nation.But not only the story is great, but the effort the creators put into studying the different kinds of martial arts and their movements and attaching a unique \\"bending\\" element to each kind of fighting style.I'm a 21 yr old college student and this is one of my favorite shows of all time. I have NEVER bought a season of any show, but I am the proud owner of this complete series. Buy it, it's good.

It is really worth getting and you will enjoy it immensely.I do have a complaint, not with the show but with Paramount. They have commercials for their other Nick shows on each and every disc, mostly the same ones over. I feel that as a paying customer these should not be on movies that I purchase. It is so bad, they even have a commercial to buy Avatar Season 1. Think about that one for a second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV Show","review":"At first when I watched this show, I only saw one episode and judged it, but once I saw the first few episodes in a row, I was hooked and had to buy the entire season. This is an excellent show and this DVD set has bonus features that the individual DVDs don't.

Nick has given the consumer a poor experience by taking control of the DVD functions at the beginning of each of the 6 disks. It forces you to watch about 5 minutes of commercials, coming Nick shows, and shows that my children dislike. Other companies once did this and then quit on customer feedback. While we enjoy =eventually= watching the shows, the DVDs are not acceptable due to their hijacking of the DVD. Do what other consumers do, give Nickelodeon the feedback that this deserves and don't bother purchasing the first manufacture run of these until they release your DVD to allow you to choose what you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Force-Fed Endless Commercials","review":"Let me be clear: the series, Avatar, is worth of 5 stars. It's one of the best things to arrive on TV in a long time. It's a great, epic tale written with humor and filled with interesting, three-dimensional characters.The DVD gets 1 star. I put in the first disk, and was forced to watch AT LEAST ten minutes of commercials. I wasnt allowed to jump to the menu and start watching the show - the DVD prohibited that. So I PAID for this series and I'm forced to watch 10 minutes of commercials every time I turn on the DVD player? That's ridiculous. I say \\"at least\\" 10 minutes because that's when I turned it off and packaged it up for a refund.And the studios wonder why people prefer to download this stuff online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saturday morning cartoons","review":"I didn't get very far into it - it's very childish, with slapstick comedy and childish pouting. It looks like a very predictable Saturday morning cartoon show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good TV","review":"As has been well established, this is a phenomenal show, if you've ever seen an episode, which I allege you have if you're searching this box set, then you already know this. Amazon shipped the product quickly, as they are also well known to do. I bought this as a gift, so I can't really speak for any special features that would make this version the best version to buy, but it is pretty much the only complete volume available for the first season, and given the meticulous detail applied to the series it would be fair to say that you will get your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole New Dimension","review":"I love Avatar. Normally, I find anime and cartoon shows to be dull and shallow, but Avatar presents a whole new dimension. Rather then the same old \\"this character is good.\\" \\"this character is bad.\\" \\"this character is the good guy's friend.\\", the show contains dynamic characters, namely Zuko, that change dramatically during the course of the show. We see a deeper, more conflicted side of the feelings of all the characters, and although each episode can stand alone, the whole show blends into one big plotline rather then a bunch of fragmented ministories. -Alison"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avatar Rocks and DVD quality sucks!!","review":"Excellent series. We are all hooked with this funny and fabulous show. Picture quality is very poor. No subtitles. Can't imagine how they can release a DVD with a VHS qualty picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show is great, but DVD video quality hit and miss","review":"Episodes on the first disc have a pretty noticeable artifact that make them look blurry and poorly done. The issue seems to be confined mostly to the first disc, but there are still minor visual disturbances on the others. I'm hoping Nickelodeon will fix this issue and release an updated version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family friendly","review":"One of the few cartoons that any age can enjoy.

We see ordinary civilians having a fair, and Firebending is used to entertain, but then Zhao is in this episode. We are introduced to the character of Jeong Jeong, a deserter of the Fire Nation army, and he has quite a pessimistic view of Firebending, seeing it as destructive (something which Zhao lives up to in spades) Jeong Jeong is such an awesome character."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"This is a fantastic episode which gives viewers a look into Zuko and Aang's past, and what caused the two to start on their current life paths. Overall a very needed episode, and one that gains sympathy for both Zuko and Aang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My children and I watch this series when it first started.

I have actually enjoyed watching this. (I am a high school English teacher, so I thought I would find it juvenile and silly.) It is not perfect, but it is pretty entertaining, the story lines are intriguing, and there is a good dose of humor. The interactions between the main characters are charming. Once again, I have been pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh man","review":"I am a 16 year old girl and am absolutly in love with this show. I really am not a fan of anime and that kind of stuff, but this show is just amazing. The Plot line, the character development, even to the casting, just amazing. This being a show targeted for younger children, some things are a little corny, in the plot line, and being older, all you can do is laugh! i completly recomend this to people, the entire colection is great, especially the special fetures disc"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I am TOTALLY obsessed with this show and it was on a REALLY good sale when I purchased it (only $19.95!).

The Collector's Edition contains a full package of theAvatar The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 1 Collectionwith a preview of the upcoming art book and an extra, exclusive, DVD with another making-of movie on it. As if that wasn't enough, Amazon wanted about half the price if you pre-ordered it, making it cheaper then getting the normal Book 1 anyway!

It was definitely worth buying, and I will be sure to watch the DVDs over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only worthwhile cartoon now on nick","review":"Nick cartoons have really gone downhill lately, EXCEPT for the Avatar. It's an excellent, extremely well-written, beautifully animated series that is very engaging, dramatic and funny all at the same time. It is clearly well-researched, and serves up lots of Asian wisdom, not just a lot of silly platitudes. I love this show. Hurray for the AVATAR! I can't wait to buy the complete series as a Christmas gift for my kids (and me!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice cover","review":"This particular release is in fact a \\"repackage\\" of the original season one box set with a new slip cover and a making of DVD. The cover is cool and the making of DVD inspiring; however if you already own season one you may just wish to hold off on this purchase in case they release a true new version such as a full Blu-Ray collection of the show. All in all though it's a good purchase as long as your buying it for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I am a full grown woman and started catching these episodes with my son Patrick.

As a 23-year-old female, I can honestly say, this is one of my favorite go to shows. I don't like to waste my time on mindless reality TV and have important things like graduate school to worry about. This show is just good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to know the Earth Benders","review":"A fantastic episode that further lays the groundwork for the rules of this world.

I am exstatic that i have them in my collection now, for years of enjoyment, as you can easily watch many of the episodes over and over.If you are a fan like me get ,1 and 2, don't bother about series 3.Peter, Manly vale Sydney Australia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"As is the norm with albums done by Third Day, this one is superb.This has a definite rock flavor in comparison to their worship albums. The lyrics continue to be meaningful. The sound is top notch. Their musical abilities are amazing and Mac Powell's voice is incredible.This is a great CD for any fan of Christian music. It is also one that any rock fan can enjoy.Some of the really great tracks on this are as follows: Come On Back to Me, 'Til the Day I Die, Wire, and Blind.I would definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Day = the best Christian band ever.","review":"WIRE is Third Day's latest and best effort at pure southern Christian rock. The band continues to grow lyrically and musically to make some of the best music ever to hit the Christian scene. The CD is packed with rock songs that make you move, and inspirational songs that make you feel how blessed we are. For the life of me, I can't understand why this band hasn't hit mainstream musical success yet. If or when that ever happens, Third Day will become one of the biggest rock bands in the world. This disc is a must have for Christians, and a must have for rock fans. You'll listen to it over and over for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the point","review":"I have always loved Third Day, especially how they combine solid Rock N Roll with solid Christ-centered lyrics. Their Offerings CD's were much lighter musically but still solid biblically. I had hoped that they would return to their Rock roots and on Wire, they have done just that. Unfortunately, in the process, they have left Jesus out of the music (His name is nowhere to be found on the entire album). Several of the songs have absolutely no spritual value and those that seem to be Christian make only the slightest hints to Whom they refer. If you are looking for some good secular Rock N Roll, you will like this CD but if you are looking for any spiritual edification or Christ-honoring lyrics, go elsewhere or listen to their old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Disappointing","review":"I'm a huge Third Day fan as well. But this album has got to be their worst one. A completely secular album with only one good song on it (Come Back To Me). Songs #1 and #8 are OK musically, but they are lyrically pointless (in #8 Mac says he's got a message to share--well, he doesn't). The rest of the songs are not worth the plastic their recorded on. Compared to the rest of their work, they took a vacation on this one--hope they enjoyed the break. Don't buy it unless you want to be frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wire needs to get cut","review":"Third Days newest effort is 2 things at best.1. Sad and 2. embarrassingSad because these guys are trying to be a general market rock band and have lost their heart for ministry and worship. If you want to hear a good general market album, then buy it. If your looking for a christian album then stay far away.Embarrassing for the guys, since they have no clue that we all became fans because of the heart and passion they had for God, which is no where to be found on wire.The Wire needs to get cut.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly Average","review":"Being a huge Third Day fan buying any new release of theirs is never a question. Releasing an album a year seems to have made them a bit tired this time around. There's no stand out songs here, sure they'll grow on you the more you listen, but no classic Third Day melodies. It kind of feels like they've put all the songs that didn't cut it on their previous releases on this album. I don't have a problem that this isn't a 'worship' album it is still Christian, subtle enough to share with non-Christians, but you wouldn't really want to as there's nothing really worth shouting about. Sorry Third Day, I really really like you, but don't rest on previous successes. Strive to excel and surpass and be excellent, taking longer than a year is ok, we'll wait, I just know you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Unlike half the people who have posted reviews, I'm not a bias fan that is doped up enough to think that anything the band, puts out is awesome. Third day's new record stinks. Anyone who likes this 45 minutes of one big non christian song is deaf.Buy a Pearl Jam record you will get as much of a spiritual message out it as this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"If you're looking for a rocking cd, this ISN'T it.I'd go with the new Mercy Me over this one. Undone flat out rocks harder than Wire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I have Third Day's Conspiracy, Time, Come Together, Offerings. Wire is the worst of them all. This CD appears to be an attempt to cross over to mainstream as the songs/messages, I consider Christianity lite or water-downed. Many songs sound way too much alike on this CD, almost as if it is just a one song CD. I listen to Time, Come Together, Offerings frequently. I don't know when I'll desire to listen to Wire again. It'll probably just collect dust. Hope they can do better on their next CD. But I'll probably listen to samplers first before just purchasing it immediately like with the others. It's a good thing I only paid $9.95 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest Effort","review":"Overall their weakest effort. Also the least memorable lyrics. No need to purchase this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit uneven","review":"While I do enjoy most of the songs on this album, it is a bit uneven. The cd opens up with \\"'Til the day I die\\" and gets rockin', then track 2 \\"Come on back to me\\" kicks it up another notch...then you get to \\"Wire\\" (track 3) and everything slows way back down. It's an alright song, don't get me wrong, but it just messes with the rockin' out!\\"Rockstar\\" get back in the rock groove and \\"I believe\\" keeps us going...then we get to \\"It's a shame\\" and they do it again, mess with the rock by throwin' in a ballad!The rest of the album is similar with about every other song a ballad-y type deal in between the rock. Like I said, I like most of the songs, but I would prefer more than two up-tempo songs in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T GET DISSAPOINTED, GET INVOLVED!","review":"The new Wire CD from Third Day gave me everything I expected from the guys, hard rock, uplifting lyrics and pride to be called a Christian Third day fan.Now for those people saying bad things about the record let me tell you that your missing the point. First of all you should get all your spiritual \\"highs\\" from prayer and Bible reading not from a record. Second, if you encourage people not to buy this record your blocking God's work through Third Day.I went to see them live in Phoenix on 5/13/04, they are helping a lot of people, they just got back from Africa and they're comitted to help that part of the world. These guys are spreading love and awareness everywhere they go.SO PLEASE EVERYBODY, LET'S PROMOTE OUR FAVORITE CHRISTIAN BANDS BY SAYING GOOD THINGS ABOUT THEM. LET'S FOLLOW THIRD DAY'S EXAMPLE, THEY ARE USING MUSIC TO PROMOTE GOD'S LOVE TO EVERYBODY IN THIS WORLD.WE GOT TO COME TOGETHER 'CAUSE TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE IT ALL RIGHT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Creed, 3 Doors Down, Alter Bridge","review":"I have had this record for quite a while, and as it is without question the album of the year and Third Day's best ever, I figured it's time to review it. Other people are breaking this thing down, so I'm not really going to do that-- I just want to say that the mainstream scene needs to catch this record. This deserves to be played everywhere-- chills go down my spine when imagining the songs \\"Til The Day I Die\\", \\"Wire\\", and others on hit radio... this is definitely a wonderful rock album, but I'm not sure how much credit to actually give the band... much of the credit may lie in the hands of Paul Ebersold. At any rate, it's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work guys!","review":"You will not be disapointed. Third Day rocks hard on this album and doesn't let up. Rather than skimp on the songs, they offer up 13 songs on this CD. My favorite so far is \\"Innocent.\\" Although \\"Come Together\\" has some great songs, this is a much more complete and mature album. If you like this CD, you should pickup \\"Time\\" as well. There's something about Mac Powell's voice that sends chills up your spine. Keep on rockin' boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love this album, like all their others it is great to listen to to help remind you how wonderful our Lord is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Once again, Third Day proves why they are one of my favorite bands. And to those who say this album is nothing but an effort to cross over into the mainstream, I say, what kind of witness is it if you only witness to those who are already Christians? That kind of mentality does nothing to reach others with the message of Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Day at it's Best!!","review":"By far this cd goes beyond anything that Third Day has ever done in the past. Great job guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Book of the 18th Century","review":"After a hundred pages of categorizations and terms and concepts that repeatedly fail to meet \\"Hume's challenge,\\" you'll wonder why anyone is sitting around a poker table where someone called the bluff and made off with the pot three centuries ago.

It is uneven, hard to listen to, and none of the tracks really stand out. Ironically, the musicians on \\"Intuition\\" are better known and arguably superior to those featured on the first album. It just goes to show that individual talent does not necessarily make a good album. If you have his first cd, order it now. It is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD includes 2 of the 3 top Pardo's songs","review":"I have finally found \\"Poeta\\" and \\"Cuando te enamores\\". These songs are really beautiful. I couuld have been rate it 5 stars, but the hybrid versión of \\"Ya se acabó\\" is not good (half in mono <the original and the best> and half in stereo <remake>), and also this CD is too short. It worth the price. It's very difficult to find these early recordings of Juan pardo in CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ... Good CD!","review":"S.T.U.N has an original sound and they have original lyrics.Unlike those mainstraim poppy bands claiming to be in the punk genre. i saw S.T.U.N. live at warped tour this year they were amamzing they sounded great and they have so much energy on stage. Some Good Songs by them are, \\"Boys and girls\\",\\"Love and chaos\\", \\"Annihilation Of The Generations\\". Buy this cd and you'll see your self that there a great band and there not like any band out there today. Trust me you wont be dissapointed!!This cd is created well so the songs dont sound all the same..all of the songs on this cd are all good in a different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution of Energy","review":"I think the new CD by S.T.U.N. is incredible! Not only are they basing their songs on their outlooks of a whole lot of things; the music with the lyrics tie in perfectly, the disc doesn't have two or three hit songs and the rest are worthless (like some CDs i've bought in the bpast)..its a full on CD with hit after hit after hit. They sound so different from other artists, that's what's going to make them stand out among the rest of the 21st century songs. I suggest buying this CD whether you have seen them live, which will impact you more, or if you just like listening to coolcore music. Seeing S.T.U.N. at the Warped Tour here in SLC Utah made me realize what kind of underground music im missing. This CD is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"S.T.U.N.","review":"This album is awesome! Theres really no way to decribe the vibe S.T.U.N. gives off, listening to this cd makes you think. And you rearely find that now-days. It's refreshing to hear music thats not all about how much highschool [stunk] or, how big of a loser, or how broke the band is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible album, not 1 good song","review":"I'm glad I got this used for only $1 cause it's not worth a penny more so I don't feel too ripped off. I had heard of these guys but nothing by them but hey it was a buck so I figured I'd buy it anyways, and it's really bad. The lead singer is horrible, the music is too loud over his voice and it's not any good either. Nothing positive about this cd or this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I bought this cd with a lot of enthusiasm. After reading the numerous reviews here, I didn't think I could go wrong. Incorrect. This is a pretty boring cd. All the songs sound the same. The vocalist does sound similar to Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine. The music, at times, conjures up Rage. Maybe a little Buckcherry, as well. The guitarist, however, isn't even close to being in the same league as Tom Morello.The problem is the songs are kinda flat. There's nothing extraordinary here. Track two, \\"Movement\\", could be a RATM reject from the first record. It's S.T.U.N.'s attempt at writing a song similar to \\"Killing In the Name Of\\". The next two songs are more of the same. *yawn* From there, the cd just delves into deep relms of mediocrity.I guess if you're looking for something like Zach de la Rocha fronting Buckcherry, this is for you. If this sounds scary, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in the studio, better live","review":"I recently had the priveledge of seeing S.T.U.N. play live, and it was an amazing experience which caused me to immediately purchase this cd. The album is terrific, but doesn't fully their live energy and stage performance (not that any recording could). I highly recommend that you buy this album, learn the songs, and then go to the nearest live S.T.U.N. show that you can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I tried listening to the Evolution of Energy over and over, hoping to like it and pretend that I didn't waste $10... I found it boring, with repetitive guitar riffs and similar sounding songs. It's lacking in creativity and interesting melodies. The Evolution of Energy sounds like the generic and mainstream music so popular right now, and even though S.T.U.N. isn't incredibly well known it sure sounds like it. That being said, these guys have the potential to make it big. (I do like the singer's energy and voice, and that's about it.) The lyrics were really simple and I didn't think that they really made that great a statement, rather just a repetitive call for revolution, but I guess the lyrics would be okay if they had more talent musically. Just like someone else said, they had some moments that were similar to RATM, but really fell short- spare yourself from this \\"PUNKROCK\\" cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Manson Look Good","review":"I read that S.T.U.N. were going to be opening up for Marilyn Manson on tour & picked this album up to learn more about them (and then promptly sold it). Can this even be considered music? S.T.U.N. is the highly unforunate child of the Sex Pistols & Rage Against the Machine without ANY of either band's talent. They're simply not interesting. There's a reason there are so many used copies for sale at such a low price as I would warn anyone & everyone to avoid this release. S.T.U.N. is even worse live & I've a feeling Manson simply invited them along to make himself appear more talented & interesting (which is a poor excuse to make his fans suffer through S.T.U.N.'s set)."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"The S.T.U.N cd 'Evolution of Energy' is amazing. Their music is different, but in a good way and makes you want to listen to it over and over. Their lyrics are so powerful and filled with energy.

The guesthouse we stayed in, several of the restaurants we visited, and more than a couple of the sites we saw were drawn from its pages. I'm happy to report that its guidance was uniformly spot on. We tend to enjoy simply being in a place, doing things in a low key way and deciding what to do next as we take our time wandering around. This guide was perfect for that, easy to whip out of a bag over lunch or on a street corner, though I suspect that it would be useful for those who prefer to set down itineraries, too.For what it's worth, this has been our experience with other Lonely Planet guides as well (including those for Ireland and Yellowstone & Grand Teton National Parks)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula Fans!","review":"This sweet, compact guide measures only 7\\" x 3\\", but packs a wallop in the info department!

I didn't find anything new in the Dublin guide. Also, there were a couple of MINOR mistakes that didn't interfere with my enjoyment. One example is that the map included has two of the sculptures in St. Stephen's Green reversed (Countess Markiewicz and The Three Fates).

The entire tone of the CD is nicely void of glitz, with all instruments sounding raw and staticy mating with EPLEY's smooth vocals that sometimes sound ghostlike in the air.

There's nothing in SARAH that Dennis Cooper and others haven't done better. Even as a Copper pastiche it still falls way short of the mark.As for Laura Albert, this kind of writing/hoax seems to be a typical American phenomenon: girls, who can't get over the fact that they weren't born as boys. They invest a lot of energy to \\"re-invent\\" themselves as young males (who never really become adult men) and at the same time reduce their envy by putting boys down (just like in the case of \\"Anthony Godby Johnson\\").

In other words, it has used the persona of a street child not as a way to help others but, instead, as a way touse others in order to achieve it's authors goals of control and success: the author being a middle-aged woman who never lived on the streets or had the life she claims is J.T.s.

It's disturbing, actually completely unconcionable, that someone (in this case a middle-aged woman )with such and influence and personality and personal connection to the people that were reading his/her books and engaging with him/her would do something of this nature. You have to wonder about the mental sanity/stability of these people. Especially this one. It wasn't just one book as with Frey. This is a decades long saga.

Leroy. Unfortunately, I was let down. The book has an original enough plot, but Leroy's writing skills fail. Small annoyances aside, (he often repeats words in the same sentence when another word would've sounded much better -- [...]), the book lacks something. I can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but it was enough to cause me to lose interest in the story. At a short 166 pages (with large font, at that), he should've spent more time developing the other characters. When Sundae and Pie show up again at the end, you've practically forgotten who they are, due to the lack of development in the beginning of the story.This is a fresh, exciting story idea. It's a shame that Leroy (and his editor) didn't invest more time in bringing it alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lizard Roadkill!","review":"There is nothing redeeming in JT Leroy's debut novel.

(There is a reference in the book that \\"Sarah\\" is a saint because (s)he can walk on water). I really don't know what the book club I belong to was thinking when they picked this book.

I found the characters (caricatures?) in this story so one-dimensional that I was reminded of those in silent films. Good, guy, bad guy, poor little Nell. Their motivations often seemed pointless, as did many of the plot developments. The author's attempt to utilize the juxtaposition between the squalor of the setting with the \\"haute cuisine\\" menu of the truck stop, did little to affect the sense of surrealism he was attempting.

I will say, however, that it is profoundly derivative in a major way: oh, look, the author just read Flanner O'Connor...oh, and that's Dennis Cooper there...oh, there's a tad of Mary Gaitskill. The only problem is that it lacks the real talent and genuine vision of those writers. In other words, it's more like The Monkees than The Beatles, just not as good as The Monkees.

A year later I still find myself thinking about it. As I see it, the brouhaha about the author's identity is irrelevant. The book is not offered up as a memoir. It's presented and sold as fiction. So whether or not you approve of the author's behavior, there's actually no literary scam to speak of. I don't know about the rest of you, but when I read Sarah, it sure seemed like fiction to me--and extraordinary fiction at that. Instead of hounding the author, we should be encouraging this rare and extraordinary talent to write more."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, this book was a disappointment","review":"I read the blurb on JT Leroy in Vanity Fair and was very interested in reading his book. Sorry to say, the reality does not live up to the expectation. The book lacks engaging characters, a discernible plot, and any semblance of readability. I made it halfway through and that was an effort. However, the book made a strong enough impression on me to write a negative review, so perhaps that is a point in its favor.If you want \\"hallucinatory\\" fiction, read Burroughs (Bill).

If you want gritty realism, read James Ellroy.Save yourself the trouble and pass this stinker by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...sure, whatever.","review":"Thanks for dropping in, Laura, and singing your own praises.

In other words, the books are fiction but the marketing device to get us to read them was a lie, pure and simple. So that's how these writings by Laura Albert should be understood--not as stand-alone works of fiction but as a marketing tool to fool the public into buying them. If the hoax of JT Leroy shouldn't matter in regard to the books than why, I wonder, was it used in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inauthentic, corny and just plain awful","review":"Poor writing--not least due to its outrageous inauthenticity. Very like the \\"Go Ask Alice\\" of the third millenium: a novel purporting to be based on factual, lived experience--in actual fact, a cynical fraud. All of the words here are very, very selfconsciously 'street', preciously explicit, and come off as a third-rate pastiche of a John Irving universe as dreamed by John Rechy. in work like this, it really does matter who's doing the writing.

But, unfortunately, it has been learned that J.T. Leroy isn't a real person, and was invented by somebody named Laura Albert. So...Laura Albert wrote deeply untrue, disturbing stories of a childhood that didn't exist, taking advantage of the public's sympathy for abused children and using it as a way to make herself some money.

Let me see here, the first song sounds like a song they released a few years ago about Little Miss Honky Tonk. Then the 5th song sounds like every other ballad they have ever released. This is pathetic just like their careers. Singing about boot-scootin, beer drinking just cutting a shine ya'll. Don't ever call these guys old school. Old school is Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson etc.. How much more of this garbage are people going to buy? There is nothing that even comes close to being original here.

My favorite songs from this current fine CD are \\"When We Were Kings\\" and \\"Till My Dying Day.\\" The warmer and more expressive Kix's voice sounds to me, the colder and more brittle Ronnie's sounds.

I could not enjoy the sketches fully (although, as stated by others the Cribs and Tupac skits work on their own and are funny). Many of the skits were missing Dave's lead-in and seemed disjointed and confusing at times.Dave really makes the show - while Donnell and Charlie are funny respectively, it gave me a guilty feeling watching it - it's not their show. It wasn't right, it seemed really forced - not natural and genuine like Dave is.

Without Dave's sanctioning, these DVDs and episodes have aired. As anyone who has tried to watch one understands, its just not that good. These are clearly an unfinished product and Charlie/Donelle do not do a good job setting up sketches, probably because they didn't write most of them and Chapelle did not edit any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patchwork DVD","review":"That Chappelle's Show will be regarded as one of the funniest ever seems beyond dispute.

Donell Rawlings and Charlie Murphy are good, but they cannot set up a skit to save their life.

These episodes admittedly house several giggle-able moments and even some great stuff (I, too, very much enjoy the Tupac song), but the quality is under par, far under what one would expect even from an unfinished project like this one.

It occurred to me, at about the point that Tony Curtis ran up the castle stairs to confront the evil king, that I might have been watching The Princess Bride (\\"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya\\"), except that The Vikings, despite taking itself seriously, doesn't succeed half so well in making you care about the characters or the plot. The battle scenes are also incredibly weak. It seems fitting that in the final funeral scene, a good number of the fire arrows fall laughably short of their target."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Viking Nightmare","review":"Even though I haven't seen many good films about the vikings this is by far the worst. It could be a rather good comedy, sadly it is not! From the opening scene to the end this film is a total nonsense. The only thing this film doesn't have are helmets with horns (even though Kirk Douglas does wear a helmet with a giant eagle on top when attacking the 14th centry English castle in the final scene). What we can see though is an anglo-saxon ship from the 15th century (something wrong?), I just wondered where the gun-deck was, some wrist-watches etc. Still it was rather amusing to watch so I give it one star!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"One of the best movies made with Douglas and Curtis.

The film was shot on location in Norway and the cinematography is simply spectacular. The sweeping vistas, the recreation of a Viking village and the magnificent long ships all add to the rich fabric of this film. The acting is a little bit \\"pushed\\", but that was typical for its day. Simply a great classic MGM film with classic actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun filled adventure film with a fantastic cast.","review":"Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Ernest Bourgnine what powerful characters.

I came across it again like 3 months ago and just had to have it. It was so easy and cheap. I got the movie a few days later and it was like new. The movie itself has a great storyline easy to follow with alot of work on details and secenary. it's a must have fro any movies collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most perfect films ever made","review":"For what it tries to do, The Vikings succeeds on every level.

Sure, it is a simple action film, but the ensemble cast plays it wonderfully. It's the best Viking film of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intersting","review":"This is a good movie, a different kind. Both Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas made very good looking vikings!

However, if you want a very fun swashbuckler with good characters and fine raucous acting, this is as good as it gets. You get some glimmerings of history, but mostly just a good, if rather preposterous, tall tale. When I turn to Hollywood, this is frankly what I hope to find - it is still frsh and lively, it won't strain your mind, and is fast paced and consistently exciting. I am glad a bought it and my kids will love it.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love it!","review":"My family and I are great fans of 'old' historic epics like 'Cleopatra', 'Ben Hur', 'The Ten Commandments', 'Spartacus' and so many more. When I recently found 'The Vikings' I knew I had to add it to our collection.I was amazed at the beautiful scenery and the authenticity which was portrayed in this movie. They even used real Viking horses, for crying out loud!Yes, the story line is fairly predictable, but the action is superb, and the characters will win your heart in about a nano-second. Toward the end I told my kids, 'I honestly don't know which side to root for!'One of my daughters asked, 'Why don't they make this kind of movie today?' I told her they do, just generally speaking they aren't the kind that's fit for family viewing.'The Vikings' is great for young and old alike. I am happy it's joined our collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun, not lots of plot.","review":"This is a movie that is a pleasure to see. Watching this film for the first time in years (and the DVD for the first time ever) I find myself comparing it to the latest star wars movie....Here we see great performances (particularly Ernest Borgnine then again I can't think of any role he didn't shine in.)not much of a plot and a Viking village built actually in Norway. We see Vikings at their drunken best and worst. We see comedy, (\\"Mine isn't too tight.\\") we see action, we see wild eyed witches with hair blowing in the wind. What is there not to like?The only disapointment I had was my own fault. It always seemed the picture was missing a scene or two, (particularly when Curtis first gets to England) I always figured the scenes were cut to fit into the TV's running time. Guess not.Much like the Crimson pirate, don't spend a lot of time thinking about this picture. Just watch and enjoy it. You'll be hard pressed not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable in all respects!","review":"This movie has it all: great acting; great scenic views; historical content; and memorable scenes of Viking life and sounds!

I don't want to know the man who has a sex life, I just want to know about him. His personality, his life, his music. I strongly dislike this book. I call it, a Liar, Liars book!

This is NOT the definitive biography of Buddy Holly. This book is in the \\"Goldman tradition\\" of trashing the lives of deceased celebrities. Amburn misquoted and distorted what other people told him, and probably also made up some of it.THE definitive biography of Buddy Holly is \\"Remembering Buddy\\" by John Goldrosen & John Beecher. Another bio that is not too bad is \\"Rave On\\" by Philip Norman. As for what happened during the Last Tour, read \\"The Day the Music Died\\" by Larry Lehmer. If you can get a hold of it, I also recommend the 5 part series \\"Buddy Holly Day by Day\\" by Bill Griggs who is the expert on Buddy Holly; go to \\"rockin50s.com\\" to see about ordering it but please be patient about getting the series as Bill has been having major health problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been waiting for this thing to hit the market 9/2000","review":"I've been waiting for this product for a long time.

It falls short of the promise. Instead of getting an exhaustive and rational look at how this first book of the Bible sets the symbollic stage for the succeeding books, it's a list of types with little or no attempt to explain them through the lens of culture, history or Biblical symbolism.

The glasses look great, but they won't stay on his head properly even if you lay him down on his back and use gravity.

The Just scale contains intervals which accord with harmonic ratios, eg. a fourth is 4:3 and a major third 5:4, while all the intervals in the Pythagorean scale are derived from multiples of the fifth 3:2 ratio by octave transpositions. Therefore, starting on note C, the difference between Just E and Pythagorean E is 22 cents, almost a quarter-tone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I had fairly low expectations when I bought this dvd. This movie had no plot what so ever and every scene was the same; with a few shower scenes to waste time. A woman comes home and has tepid sex with her husband/boyfriend and then slices him and drinks his blood. The next scene he goes, has sex and drinks another womans blood. Next scene, she goes and has sex and drinks the blood of another woman. You see each person for two scenes each, then never hear from them again.

Perhaps that's a little over stated but for the first time in ages a band has finally come along that has successfully meshed diverse musical influences (from free jazz,to punk, alternative, latin, and electronic music) to form a mind bending , yet coherent album that gets better every time you listen to it. Simply put, the musicians on this album will constantly amaze you with the directions and original thoughts they express, as well as pure , unadulterated mastery of their instruments. To top it all of the energy of the vocals, and emotional rollercoaster of a journey through the subconcious mind of a comatose, suicidal artist, make for simultaneously dark and uplifting experiences, and stimulate thought and introspection in anyone that is willing to give it a listen.

On the other hand, Cedric and Omar have gone on to Mars Volta and made one heck of an album with De-Loused in the Comatorium. The guitar work is stunning, the lyrics are in-depth and interesting, and the entire sound is fresh.The Mars Volta are the complete opposite of ATDI, yet they offer a fantastic sound.

It manages to be harsh, melodical, beautiful, stunning, dark, and enlightening all at once. I was only a mild fan of ATDI and i like sparta a little, but this is definately better (at least for my tastes).Considering how incredible it is, along with the fact that it is available for a decent price (i got my copy for ten bucks), this would be a worthy purchase for any fan of this type of music (although \\"this type of music\\" can't specifically be identified)."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of God: BUY THIS ALBUM!","review":"It relieves me to the highest to hear such a spectacular album come out in the midst of what I think is one of the dullest times in music.

They all sound like they're trying to be the next Yes or Genesis, and they water it down too and sound corny. The Mars Volta on the other hand, do prog rock right, but they're not just prog. Think Pink Floyd meets '70's Santana meets At the Drive In (well duh!) meets Led Zeppelin meets King Crimson.The result of this insane mixture of sounds comes out sounding nothing short of incredible.I suggest that anybody who has a great love of music buy this album.

I usually give bands a few tries before judging but i like my ears, so i opted to throw the cd out my window and beat my ears against my steering wheel, an obviously more enjoyable experience. Everybody's entitled to their own likes in music; people liked Rush, i personally don't get it. IF YOU HATE THE GROUP RUSH LIKE I DO, STAY AWAY!

It is a combination of too much musicianship and pretentiousness, without any true musical character.

Hardly. There's absolutely nothing new on this album. Essentially, this sounds just like At The Drive In except the songs (and song titles) are longer. Oh, and totally unemotional too. I forgot that part. At The Drive In always sounded remarkably ferocious and physical...you know, like a BAND should. The Mars Volta don't sound like a band, they sound like a science experiment. Now, that could be cool if this album was truly experimental or if its chilliness served some greater musical purpose, but really, the Mars Volta strive for emotion and fail miserably here. This gets two stars cus that song \\"Inertiatic Esp\\" is still pretty cool and no matter how boring this album is, it's not as boring as the other post-At The Drive In band Sparta. All in all, I guess this album means well and gets points for trying, but I'll just stick to \\"Relationship Of Command,\\" thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"good title, laughable rock","review":"i read all the reviews for this album and then decided to buy. i regret that decision now. this is not pschedelic. it is mini-truck metal. buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!?!?!","review":"I've listned to this album and theres absolutely nothing special about it whatever. At times the album gets a little more progreessive in the occasional song but besides thoses rare moments this cd is horrible! I highly recommend you do not buy this cd. I've heard this cd called progressive metal and hard rock. What what are you people smoking this is like space emo crap!!!!! 0 STARS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Rating","review":"I haven't offer reviews before, relying on other opinions to broaden my music horizons. I just couldn't let this one go by. This would get a half star if there was such a rating. No value whatsoever.

Yes it is a beautiful Debut album, and does some very experimental things with the rock genre, but that's all it is, just one album. I wholeheartedly recommend buying this ablbum, if only because the music to dollar ratio is so great. But that's all it is. One album. Wait a few years and tell me where these guys are. I feel them reaching the... say... Foreigner type status. You know, remembered for a few things, but just not on the same level as the greats. Go ahead and rip me, fans, but you know it's the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moves rock to a new dimension","review":"To be true, it needs at least a few listens. But I thought the same about OK Computer, not sure at first but it grows with every listen and turns out to be a sublime classic.The drums are up front in the mix and this can be off-putting, but try to get past that and listen to the superb guitar and bass work with the vocal range exceptional.All the best albums tweak your curiosity with the first listen enough to play them again and this is no exception.Style: Unique, hispanic influences, wierd (unlike most everything else, except their previous work), jamming and full-blown rock-out.If you are a serious collector of music, this needs to be in your collection, it's in mine !"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing album","review":"this is one of those albums that works as all ten songs and not just a collection of them. there is so much emotion in Omar's voice it hurts. i cannot describe how good this album is, one would just have to listen to find out themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strap yourselves in, kids!","review":"I guess I have to say I am so impressed with the remainder of what use to be At The Drive In. Granted, this is a departure from ATDI, but the nonsensical lyrics and the falsetto voice is still there, which I love. It's spacey, full of motion, and makes me convulse in my chair. So that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Ever!!!","review":"After hearing the Tremulant EP, I didn't think there was much else The Mars Volta could do that would be better. But, I was corrected when I heard De-Loused. I can't even begin to tell you how incredible this album is - it's my favorite by far. So, order one today, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the ashes At The Drive-In","review":"Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the dregs of At The Drive-In regroup to create The Mars Volta, a band who you can listen to and never hear another band like it. Beautiful lyrics, constant changes, and brilliant instrumentals, all come together to form this unique sound, but you walk away from De-Loused asking yourself, \\"What does this stuff mean?\\" That, my friends, is the mark of brilliance, it leaves you guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mars Volta Rules","review":"Ready for an album unlike any you've never heard...Then pick up this bad boy. This album is for those of you that appreciate the bands out there that are breaking new ground and paving the way for an era of music that will not soon be forgotten. Cedric's new vocal stylings will leave you in a pile of euphoric mush...begging for more! Buy this album and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Mars!","review":"I can't believe the quality of this album. Please do yourself a favor and buy this album, don't download it. It's astonishing. Comparisons abound, easiest to start with is obviously At the Drive In, the members can't shake their past and I don't know why they'd want to. On subsequent listens one hears Jeff Buckley, Led Zeppelin, early Santana, Pink Floyd, Failure, and even the Flaming Lips coming through as influences. The songs are intricate and structured but still catchy as hell. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to build new synapses...","review":"...but once they are there you will get it. Refreshing break from the cookie cutter modern rock we see now days. Consider my rating 4 1/2 stars only because you can see that this disc is experimental in some ways and with any disc that realy pushes new boundaries you are going to get some not so good but with these kind of discs the good is really good. Often the beauty in experimental discs is the contrast that makes the good really good. To me one of the best bands at contrast were the Melvins but that does not mean I am comparing De-Loused to the Melvins. I would more describe De-Loused as a modern Yes with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, but De-loused is so much more. Highly recommended intelligent, rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please stop with the Rush comparisons","review":"First before i get into how much i like the album I am tired of all the people ripping the album because the lead singer of Mars Volta sounds like Geddy Lee of Rush. Yes he does sound like Geddy Lee, get over it. Rush are immensely talented musicians, simple as that. The music of Mars Volta is very complex and cannot be fully appreciated with one listen. By far the best song of the album is \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\". In six minutes, there is elements of The Beatles, Santana and Rush. You are not going to find that anywhere else. This song alone makes the album worth the purchase. The only complaint i have is that occasionally the songs become slightly disjointed like they could have ended 2 minutes before they actually did or could have been completely different songs all together. But other than that an excellent album"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's soooo gooood you guys....seriously!","review":"I rarely rank albums or even compare them, let alone make statements like \\"this is the greatest album since, blah blah blah...\\" but this is making me nuts. After 20 listens, I'm still a spastic Cartman when it ends. \\"Seriously, you guys, ohmygod oh god, sweeeeeeettt, seriously...ahhhh!! A \\"please don't stop\\" collage of many styles and sounds, powerful lyrics and singing, thundering, precision bass and drums, and guitar playing ranging from pure beauty to hell-wreaking ferocity. Jane's, Zeppelin, Santana, Hendrix, Mr. Bungle, Radiohead, Tomahawk, space rock, acid streaks of music burning liquid color showers amidst the stars of the desert southwest. Classic.Buy It. You Neeeeeeed It."},{"rating":"2","title":"complex, deeply nuanced and intelligent rock and roll","review":"The Mars Volta have managed an impressive feat with their first full-length CD: music that will appeal to listeners from just about every genre imaginable. You will hear and read comparisons to Rush, Santana, punk and thrash, latin folk music, Radiohead, and many others, and all of those comparisons, while totally viable, are somewhat incomplete simply because they fail to take into account the full range of massive talent evident in this recording. Even the spastic thrash of ATDI reappears at certain points in the disc, but only breifly and with great effect.We have been treated to some amazing music in 2003, including the blood brothers, Radiohead and now The Mars Volta. Don't miss adding this piece of brilliance to your music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can make this easy on music listeners!!!","review":"If you like \\"Rush\\" and \\"At the Drive In\\" then you'll love this album. However - if you do not like those bands, as I do not, well this album just plain sucks. I mean really you might as well go listen to a gig by your local high school Jazz band."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOISE?","review":"I like Metal, Rock, Prog whatever. But this album sounds like noise throughout most of the album, it has its moments....but most of it sounds awful in way that reminds me of Black Flag. I'm a touch disappointed after all the rave reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like nothing I've ever experienced before","review":"The ATDI boys plus some very talented and twisted cohorts (including the notorious Flea from RHCP) have managed to put out something that really breaks the mold. Can't really categorize it-just when you think it's hardcore, it's suddenly spins you into a psychedelic freeform daze. The more I listen to it, the more complex layers are revealed. And I have listened to it over & over & over again already. Even the songs that are remakes from the old EP are totally different. I will refrain from over hyping the album or making a bunch of comparisons. I'm done.Point is: the album is amazing. Go out and buy it. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush's 2112 meets modern progression","review":"the mars vota is what you would get if you threw Rush's classic meticulously crafted progressive rock in with Radiohead's elctronic experimentation and added a dash of Tool's Lateralus epic structure and hit blend. the record is a musical journey through the unknown. every song starts of subtly and gradually bouilds to a powerful eplosion of rock. its so good. its new, not recycled retro-rock. it makes an attempt to invent and add to the rock scene, and it succeeds in doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else is there to be said?","review":"What is there to be said about Mars Volta that hasn't been said already? They are incredible musicians. That's basically all there is to it. The cd is flawless, perfect, 100% amazing. From Jimmy Paige-esque wandering guitar solos, to upbeat almost ATDI sounding songs, this cd has it all. This has got to be one of the musically best cds within the last 10 years. After listening to this, everything else tends to sound dismal and weak at times. Give the cd a listen. However, it's not made for everyone. Also, to get the full effect of this cd, take an hour out of your day, and give it a straight-through listen. Intelligent cd, incredibly well produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"De-loused","review":"This album is one of the newest and best things I have heard in a while.

Please disregard this person who must Also think Sugar Ray is a Genius. This album definately requires repeat listenings, and grows with color and depth with each song. The Mars Volta came out with the two most talented mebers of ATDI. They will also gain more respect from everyone than Sparta for venturing outside of the bluprint ATDI sound that Sparta Sparta seems so bent on sticking on. This is something new, energetic, and exciting. An amalgamation of different genres with and avant-garde prog rock basis that will blow your mind away. Also attempt to get acess to the lyrics. altough sometimes vague, you will be able to see a story developing using quite poetic prose. Please give them a listen to. I would give them a 10 if this thing went up that far. P.S. the Mars Volta Live show is by far the best i have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfull","review":"Absoluely the best cd I have ever heard.

Then the second time around try to place yourself in the context of the concept....you'll be blown away! What an amazing album! Most of the album to me sounds like Rush at 500 MPH, especially the lead singer. Experimental/Progressive rock at its pure best, every minute it seems there is a new time signature or beat, but it all molds together quite wonderously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its just awesome!","review":"The songs explode with creativity, fusing jazz riffs, tribal rhythms, hardcore bursts of noise, and addictive rock hooks into one of the most compelling discs of 2003"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good album but don't go overboard","review":"This is an excellent album, intellegent song writing, odd meter, and time changes out the ying yang, and highly creative. Yet, many reviewers have gone a touch over board. This is not the most creative music on the planet... in fact its far from it. I would certainly recomend buying this album to anyone that has a newly developed interest in challenging music but these guys don't come anywhere close to bands like Mr. Bungle, Fantomas, Melt Bananna, or Estradasphere when it comes to creativity and talent. They aren't even in the same league."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing cd","review":"i had heard rumblings about the mars volta and at the drive-in but had never heard any of their albums. i read a lot of positive reviews so i decided to pick it up, only cost 10 bucks. wow. best 10 bucks i have ever spent! i admit it took a lot of spins for me to really start appreciating the music, but once you get it you're hooked. its the most mind-bending album ive ever heard. cedric is amazing. the mars volta is amazing. do yourself a favor and buy this cd! satisfaction guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"My Friend told me about these guys, so i checked em out.

Give it a try!!Evolta320"},{"rating":"2","title":"such to die for","review":"this album is so incredible. to be perfectly honest, it's quite possibly the most creative, unique, insanely genius thing I've ever listened to. I play it practically all day every day. I study with it, I read with it, I eat with it. I sing it in the shower. I'm not even kidding. I am thinking about buying the album again just to give the band twelve more dollars. its that great. Words fall short in describing it. One listen and you'll see, The Mars Volta is like nothing ever before or ever will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2003","review":"This is without a doubt going to be the best album of 2003. Every single song on this masterpiece is amazing, transitioning and blending together perfectly to create a modern work of art. The musicianship is apparent in all aspects of this record, never ceasing to take any breath away. Based on the life of the band's long time friend Julio Venegas, De-loused is a concept story that is nothing short of astounding. If you don't have it and/or you fully appreciate life and mind-opening music I suggest you order this NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"So many people told me I had to listen to this album. So far I've tried listening to the cd about 10 times and can't really seem to make it through. A lot of people comment about how deep all their music is and all, I think I'd have to ask if anyone has realized that this music just really sucks? I've seen it on here a few times after I came to the same conclusion when I first heard it \\"It just sounds like a really bad Rush impression\\". I think the best way I can say it in my own words is that is just sounds like one of those bands you listen to to be cool in college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative - uninteresting","review":"This kind of musical drivel is what happens when 5 bored musicians with nothing interesting to say take the extro from Bowie's 'Space Oddity' and stretch it out into an hour of atonal garbage.

That they have an audience only proves how many listeners there are out in the world who are completely devoid of musical taste or knowledge.This is a 'Perfect Coaster' CD. Good for nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow........","review":"This album proves that if you starve people of any real musicianship for several years, then give them a slight taste, and they will think it is the most brilliant, mind blowing thing ever.Unfortunately it isn't.If you like emo/screamo/flavor-of-the-montho, then you will dig this. It will also look good on your albums list on your iPod for when you are bopping around campus.If you want to hear some interesting new prog rock check out Deadwing or In Absentia by Porcupine Tree.I'm not going so far as to tell people their taste sucks as much as I am saying this isn't new or revolutionary in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why wasn't i warned that this reeks of Rush","review":"...

They're too busy trying to be as arty as possible whether it be the tuneless bombastic music or the ridiculously inane lyrics.

The talent these guys have is matched by few in the rock world, and the aesthic quality these guys bring to music is something that most bands would kill for.The vocals are probably the stand out. They're just ice. Even from back in the ATDI days, he had some immense talent, and it just keeps on growing. Pick this album up, and you won't regret it, even if you don't like \\"emo\\". But, be prepared for some extremely esoteric lyrics. Keep you minds and ears open on this one, and you'll be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath Of Fresh Air","review":"Finally, a cd I don't mind spending my hard earned money on! I can't stop listening to this disc. I have been so bored with all of the \\"wanna be / sound like that band\\" crap that I kind of gave up on the music biz. Mars Volta really doesn't bring anything new to the music arena. They've done a great job reinventing prog-rock. They've taken Yes' \\"Close To The Edge\\" album and added a harder edge, some latin rhythm flavoring, and a live feel I have not heard on any recording in a while. When I listen to this record, I get the feeling that I'm at their live show. I can't wait to see them tonight (they will be in town tonight). At The Drive In was good. Mars Volta, to me, is better. With the addition of Red Hot Chili Pepper's Flea on bass, this collection of songs is something not to be missed. Flea is excellent on this one. If you're a drummer, like me, you owe it to yourself to check the drummer out.

It's truly a modern classic, in my opinion. However, TMV is definatly an acquired taste. The first time I heard it I wasn't too impressed.

Every time I listen to the CD it gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"reoccurring first time experience","review":"This album is amazing! Most definetely one of the best that I own. The music blends psychedelic electronic sounds and rock fundementals. The combination makes this composition unbelievable, not to mention the lyrics.

Still today I enjoy it as much as the first time I listened to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW just WOW","review":"When i first heard about the Mars Volta i was curious and picked up \\"frances the mute\\" and it was alright but then i bought this album and i was blown away, I did not know music could be this good.

The singers voice may take a little getting used to but the music is insane. Punky and yet proggy at the same time.

It has a great sound don't get me wrong, but I was expecting Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin like other reviewers have said. Oh well, at least we have Mars Volta and Sparta to keep our At The Drive-In cravings satisfied! BUY THIS CD IMMEDIATELY and ignore my comments don't let them stop you from getting the CD, because it is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ATDI obviously was keeping Omar and Cedric down","review":"Anyone who has posted that DITC is anything like what ATDI ever did either has not listened to this album carefully, or knows nothing about ATDI. It is undeniable that you hear the influences of Rush, Zeppelin, Santana and Floyd throughout this album (which was never true with ATDI), but then taken to a level of madness that is undeniably Omar and Cedric. I have never heard Cedric sing as melodiously as he does here, and Omar's guitar work is as inventive and creative as ever, with the seemingly random-yet-fitting notes and licks he is so well known for. The mania that is so persistent in this album fits with its theme, and the story (and the man) behind it. It is a roller coaster ride of emotions that I certainly could do no justice with words explaining. It is, quite simply, an experience. Undoubtedly the best album of this millenium, by FAR better than anything i have heard from ATDI (and ATDI is amazing). Get it.

They lost me when they brought out the harp (oh my!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experimental Album","review":"If you like the flaming lips, you will like this. Very 60'ish sound. A Long Day should have never been included on this or it should have been stuck as a 30 second intro into another song. 36 minutes of drones is way too much and makes me wonder did they not have several more musical sounding songs to add to this disc. Other than that, you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Original","review":"This has got to be one of the most original recordings I have heard in ages. I first caught the end of one of their songs on a TV show in the UK (Later with Jools Holland) and I was captivated, though it is only now that I have managed to get hold of the CD and listen to it all. Some have said that this is just hippie twaddle, but it is fantastic uplifting tunes, with a truly amazing sound. The first time I heard It's the Sun at full volume I was blown away. This is music to be played loud. I think that the next CD is going to be better and a little more formed but for now this will do. But I have to only give this 4 stars. Though the songs are great, Section 10 Long Day is self-indulgent avant gard stuff. I have tried to hear what some reviewer hear, but I can't. But nine great tracks can't be bad.The Extra CD on the US release is a must, as there is a great live performance of Have a Day/It's the Sun, which might even be better than the Original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't quite was I thought it would be.","review":"When I heard this band on a few stations, I thought they would be a powerful, optimistic fusion of Sigur Ros and the Flaming Lips (if you could imagine that). I picked up the CD, and yeah, I did like it, but it didn't meet my expectations.When I saw that the CD had a nearly 40-minute track at the end (Long Day), I was hoping for a beautiful session of music that would utilize the talent of the 20+ members of this group. I was hoping for a great track that could be on in the background, but instead, it's a self-indulgent throw-away track filled with bleeps and sounds that would make even Radiohead turn in disgust. Without this last track, I would have given the CD three stars. Hopefully, they will have grown more for the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest band ever","review":"i love this band more than most things, and they are increadibly orginal and wonderful. they are my favorite band. my best friend discovered them and sent me \\"light and day\\" over the internet, and i haven't been able to stop listening to them since. my friend sent me their song only a few days after i came out the hospital because i had recently tried to kill myself, and they have helped lift my spirits and put be back to where i was only a year ago.i owe them and rob a very specail thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped up","review":"I was exited to hear this CD after hearing the single Soldier Girl being showcased on the radio. I am really disapointed as all the other tracks blend into a seemless soundscape of sickly sweet noise that eventually becomes a dirge.

I picked up this album after having heard a couple of songs on the radio and expected to love it. However, this is the first CD I have ever bought that I have considered throwing in the garbage. While I like some of the songs, notably \\"Light & Day/Reach For the Sun\\" and \\"Days Like This Keep Me Warm,\\" I found the majority of the album to be simply irritating. I have tried several times, but cannot get more than 4 minutes into the horrid \\"A Long Day\\" track before I feel like vomiting and my dogs start howling. I have never had such a visceral reaction to music before, and I hope to spare others the same pain.

To compare this band to Pink Floyd, The Flaming Lips, or any other band or orchestra with talent is an insult to these other bands. The closest thing I can compare this to is a band form the 60's known for the song \\"I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing\\" The New Seekers. Mindless pop then and mindless pop now.

I wish I hadn't.As the title of this review states, it is like listening to the jr. high glee club, with a little backing from some second-string band members with horns. The music and lyrics are sophomoric and amateurishly produced, all the way around. The musicianship is poor - notes are missed, horns are mostly just blown, not played, and the sound is murky.Nearly all of the songs are bland \\"uppers\\" - it's a new day, the sun is shining, come on everybody let's sing! I'm all for music that makes you happy, but nice sentiment is not enough - the quality of the musicians, singers and producers has to be there, too.Finally, be warned: the last song is over half an hour(!) of monotonal chanting - a couple of guys basically intoning \\"om\\" at a few different levels.

I'd like to believe the Polyphonic Spree is some kind of spiritually enlighened group experiencing bliss in robes, but they're just another drug band, so at the end of the day they're deceivers.Looking at the reveiws for this band, a lot of people like to be deceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cluster F***","review":"I just saw these freaks open up for David Bowie in Boston last night.

It's not the good kind of weird-- the kind that's funny or coherent or immediately preceding nocturnal emissions.

You really have to suspend your disbelief; otherwise you&#65533;ll really hate it. The prose is not really innovative, making it a bad accompaniment to the over the top events.

The relationship between the narrator and Clare, the nanny protagonist, seems promising when he is observing her from afar, but falls apart once they actually meet in the flesh.

It ended up being one of my favorite of all time. David Bowman's writing style is highly original along with his ideas.

The dialogue was totally forced, not to mention completely uninteresting. The anticlimax of the denoument was matched only by that of the storyline itself. The plot was shallow, the execution rushed and superficial, the characters completely unengaging and the style of the prose seemed to suggest that Bowman was TRYING to be provocative-- and failing miserably. The nuances of a modern society without electricity were the novels only redeeming qualities-- sort of intersting to think about what today's New York would look like power-less.

At first they were negligable, easilly mistaken for a spec on the picture itself, but I can fully attest that over time the dust will accumulate under the glass and your scans will have a considerable amount of noise. Sure your software can clean it up, but a quality scanner shouldn't make you do that manual work. So in short, I only recommend this scanner if you love dust!

The show takes place at the Roxy, a small club in Hollywood CA. This sets it apart from Live, and Babylon by Bus (which are both five star records in their own right) but there is a sense of smallness here, the show is more intimate, more focused. Imagine seeing a band who could easily sell out a stadium in an area not much larger than your own backyard. Bob and the Wailers explode on stage hurling massive amounts of energy throughout the small venue. The entire second disk is the encore, with the last three tracks meshed together, in a deep, stellar reggae groove, worth buying the album alone. This second disk provides a close look at the imporovisational talent of Bob, and the great jammin ability of the Wailers.Turn the lights down low and the stereo up and you'll almost feel like you're there. A must have for any fan of Bob Marley or even live music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoo Haa ! Bob Marley's Best Live Album Ever!","review":"Live at the Roxy is without question the best \\"live\\" album the great man ever produced. This is a tour de force - a wonderfully intimate experience with great audience particpation (lots of yelps and yeahs) - brilliantly recorded - and some of the most intense singing - moaning and groaning - from the dreadlocked guru ever caught on tape. Soul meets Reggae meets Funk. His earlier live albums lack this intimacy, and are recorded in much larger venues which make those albums much less vibrant for me.I am also delighted that many of these live tracks are from Rastaman Vibration and Burning and Looting and Catch a Fire (earlier albums) which are less well known that some of his later work. The band is hot and the I threes are pure magic. Believe me when I tell you this is a hidden gem - a must have. What a pity it was never filmed. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is, by far, THE BEST!!!","review":"Not only is this the best live Bob Marley recording, I feel it is the best live performance I have ever heard by any artist! If I were going to be stranded on a deserted island with only one CD (Ok this is a two CD set, but you get the point), this would be the one. The entire band is just so \\"ON\\" in this performance! Buy it, listen to it a few times, and it will change you at the \\"Soulular\\" level! I also highly recommend Ziggy marley's live concert DVD of \\"Love is my Religion\\". I know, I know... he's not Bob, but if you give that DVD a chance I think you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much love for Bob Marley","review":"Roots Reggae.

Two discs of the infamous concert at the Roxy plus the encore performances Marley did that had yet to be released before. If your a Marley fan, this album is a must for your collection. I can't get enough of it...the \\"I Shot the Sherif\\" track...great. Relive the concerts, or experience it for the first time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't miss on this one","review":"I read the reviews. I went out and bought the CD. They got it right. (At least all the 5 star reviews!) This is an awesome CD, great sound, great songs, great groove, just plain great. One guys says the show is SLOW. (??) Come on mon! It'sa reggae-mon! Got no hurries and no worries.I've only listened a couple times so far, but this is one of my fav Marley discs. I also recommend the Deluxe Edition of Exodus. With those two and of course the ever present Legend, you pretty much have a complete view of Bob Marley."},{"rating":"2","title":"great perspective","review":"This book helped open my eyes to what children go through when dealing with life's hardships.

I understand that when you write a book for a TV show it's really hard to keep the characters the same, and make the dialog work. I know that it must be very hard to write a book for, what I think is the best TV show ever. This book starts out great, the plot was interesting, the concept was great the set up was fantastic and then the book just falls apart. The ending was rushed, chaotic, dumb, and painful and not painful in a good way, a very bad painful. The only thing that saved this for a one star rating was that there really were some amusing parts in this story that I enjoyed. I really wish it hadn't gotten all wibbly wobbly in the end because this could have been my favorite Doctor Who book if it had held together."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was just...bad","review":"The story was ridiculous even if you take into account that Doctor Who isn't Shakespeare. It wasn't even in the category of so bad it was good. It was just bad. The author didn't come close to getting the character's \\"voices\\" right and it read like bad fan fiction. I would recommend either The Monsters Inside or The Stealers of Dreams instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew...glad I'm finished.","review":"I was enticed into reading this through an arcticle in Golf Magazine, but wound up a bit disappointed. Read the other reviews about the typo's, and yes, they're all true. Was an editor ever consulted? I'm sure Tim Rosaforte is a great writer, but he should have taken more care in this piece. Besides the typo's, time lines of events jumped around so often, that at some points, I didn't even know who won the event.The book was entertaining, but nearing the end, I kept counting how many pages I had left to read to be finished with the book...and that's not in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very thorough of biography of Tiger","review":"Tim Rosaforte's book gives a solid overview of Tiger's career and some strong insight into his life and sport. It covers everything about the Year 2000 including the incredible 6 iron at the Canadian Open. A very solid book."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE PROOFREAD","review":"It is absolutely enthralling to consider that we are living in a time where the greatest golfing machine of modern time is dazzling us. The book that captures this time is poorly written. Somebody please tell me was it 1998 when Medina held the PGA or 1999? Or was it both? Did Tiger win with a 270 at the Masters in 1997 or a 280 - Both are mentioned in the book.This book should have never gone to print; it insults the reader that there are multiple facts misstated throughout.TIGER IS THE GREATEST.THIS BOOK IS NOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read","review":"This is a very good book if you respect what Tiger Woods has done since turning pro. The author gives a very unbiased view about an extraordinary athlete. The only flaws the book has is it is a tad repetitive and there are close to a dozen typos. The good part of this book is leaving out the history of Tiger from the time he was born until recently. Most people already know that information. The book focuses on his career since turning pro and most of all the last three years which hasn't been done by a golfer in a long long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim's Done It Again","review":"Unbelievable. Tim Rosaforte has done it again. He continues to amaze my with his work. Tim does a great job of going behind the scenes in what was truly the greatest year in golf if not in sports. When I began reading it, I couldn't putting it down. There have been few books that have captured me the way this one has. I am a big fan of Tim's work with GolfWorld and The Golf Channel. I recommend this to any sports fan. It will be a read you won't regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Tiger Junkies Will Be Disappointed","review":"I have seen Tim Rosaforte on the Golf Channel and read an excerpt in Golf Digest so I was looking forward to this book. There were so many errors and typos--misspellings, wrong words, one whole section out of place--that it was hard to concentrate on the text. Many of the quotes were simply taken from Golf Channel interviews and shows. There was little evidence of research. It was clear that this book was designed to make money by capitalizing on Tiger's celebrity and was rushed to print while we were still talking about the 2000 season. Do publishers have editors and proofreaders any more? Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raising The Bar","review":"Boring. Boring. Boring.I almost gave up on the book after about 30 pages, but it was given to me as a gift and I like to finish that which I start.If this book had to be written (?) then it should have been written by someone who could at least hold your attention, if not excite.Tim Rosaforte shows little writing talent and one wonders what he is doing to raise his own bar. His readers and Tiger deserve better.Having read John Feinstein and having grown up with the writings of Jim Murray perhaps my bar is set too high.To anyone who wants to take a chance on this book I recommend the public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait till they lower the price or hire a proofreader.....","review":"I was genuinely distracted from the content as I found myself reading every page \\"looking for more typos, inaccurate facts, etc\\". Many are noted in previous reviews....Butch Harmon is referred to as Bruce....David Duval is later called Davis....etc. I do not know the publishing process but I would think an author should have a vested interested in proofing his product....as well as many others. It is obviously an effort to cash in (the book itself had interesting facts, if you can trust themmmmm)......but also seemed disjointed and like it was slapped together without connection between chapters....bottom line - an inferior quality product given it is a 24 dollar hardcopy new book......wait for the next revision......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowering the Bar","review":"While I find Tiger to be a fascinating individual, it amazed me that this book made it to press considering the grammar and spelling are the equivalent of a rough draft. If you can make it through all of the typos, and there are probably more typos than Tiger's career birdies, it is a pretty good read. I found myself looking for the next typo instead of enjoying an amazing story. Rosaforte, has lowered the bar for what is considered acceptable to print."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disservice to Tiger","review":"We all love Tiger (at least you can assume we do, if we're reading this book), and we're all hungry for information about him, especially since he has been \\"handled\\" so carefully by those that surround him.Thus, it is especially disappointing to encounter the typographical errors (I counted at least 30, then gave up), factual errors (Jack Nicklaus is said to be 70 years old), and fundamental writing flaws (\\"in lieu of\\" for \\"in light of\\") littered throughout this book.I felt cheated to have paid money for this book, which was obviously rushed to press to capitalize on holiday purchases. That's no excuse for editorial sloppiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Any New Stuff Here","review":"This is a wonderful book if you have a cursory knowledge of Tiger Woods and his brief career.But if you're a die-hard golf fan who has read EVERYTHING written about Tiger over the last 3 years, you'll find that \\"Raising the Bar\\" contains hardly any new stuff. Almost everything is a re-hash of the quotes we've all read. There are some exceptions, but not many. If you read the book's excerpts in the Jan. 2001 issue of GOLF DIGEST and found them compelling and intriguing -- as I did -- you'll be very disappointed with the book. You can't blame the author for this; Tiger and his team hardly ever reveal anything about themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowering the Publishing Standard.","review":"As an avid Tiger watcher, I was thrilled to receive this book as a gift. However, my excitement soon waned. The book--obviously pushed through the publishing process to exploit Christmas shoppers--contains a distracting number of typographical errors. (\\"Earning\\" for \\"learning\\" and \\"rage\\" for \\"range\\" to name a few.) Furthermore, \\"Raising the Bar\\" reads like three years' worth of sports columns strung together with a hard cover slapped on. This is all old news, kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice piece of History","review":"This book was a fantastic find for me, I love collecting old Army Wife stuff. This book's copyright is from 1942 if that tells you anything. My copy was an old library book that was last checked out on NOV 26 1945. A lot of the information is obviously outdated, however, manners will NEVER be old-fashioned, and that's why I love collecting these old books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"This video was great and well put together...The Coreography in this video is awesomeJesus Lives was well choreographed...I liked this video so much more than I liked the video of Chapter 3 even though Chapter 3 is my fav James Hall cd..."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Hall and Worship and Praise Video - Worth the price","review":"This is one of the very few videos available for James Hall. While the video was bit dark and not as slick as some of the new dvds coming out these days(2005). This concert manages to confirm my feeling that James Hall and Worship and Praise must be one of the best choirs around. The vocals are excellent and you can hear them clearly. The instruments are good. The choir movements or choreography is great.While I would have wanted some more of the James Hall anthems on this DVD (Like God is in Control, Caught Up,...) the fact there are very recordings of James Hall and Worship and Praise makes this video a required purchase for serious fans of this style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab this it is sooo hottt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"James Hall and W&P is so spirit lifting, it just makes you dance.

However there are 3 standout tracks that couldn't have been better (Skull beneath the skin, chosen ones, looking down the cross) Mechanix would have been cool too if Dave Mustaines vocal delivery wasn't so poor on that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to a brilliant career","review":"This is such a good album. The first time I listened to it I was absolutely blown away. The best songs are Last rites/Loved To death, Rattlehead, and looking down the cross. The riff for rattlehead is so fast and so good. The solo in loved to death is one of my favorite solos. and the intro to looking down the cross is really cool to. Another highlight of the album is Gar Samuelson's drums are absolutly amazing. The only complaint is the bad production but most debut albums are not as well produced as later relases. Another thing to consider is that it was produced by Combat records not Capital so you know it wont be produced as well as there other releases. This album is great buy It!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...but not nearly their best","review":"Someone submitted this album as Megadeth's best by far...that's simply insane. Nothing the band (or almost any other metal band) has done comes even close to the unadulterated genius and power of Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? Certainly Killing is My Business...And Business is Good is a solid metal effort with plenty of heavy tunes, but if you really want to experience Megadeth at their finest, pick up Peace Sells...it'll be the last peaceful thing you do"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start to a Great Career","review":"When Dave was kicked out of Metallica he had a hellava lot to prove and he was very pubecent and angry, this album shows that. Although there are the obvious flaws in recording and mixing the underlying material is good. Sometimes it seem though that Dave was more concerned with playing fast than with style. A lot of his solos in the first part of the CD leave something to be desired, Chris plays much better. Although it has some tarnish it also has some of the best riffs, Killing is My Buisness, The Chosen Ones. Metallica would have been better off sticking with Mechanix and Looking Down the Cross than Jump in The Fire and The Four HorseMen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, thank God Megadeth progressed from this....","review":"Some flurries of talent show on this disc, but what mostly shows on this album is how a man kicked out of Metallica loved using drugs and not using money on any production and not bothering to write many good songs. Loved You to death is great, but most of the other songs (including the awful original version of the Four Horsemen) do little for me....Their next album would be legions better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible production","review":"....I cant understand the words Mustaine is saying nor the music and many of the lirics {are terrible] eg \\"Mechanix\\"Two stars and a half because it has Looking Down The Cross and all songs have cool introsThe worst start of a classic ... metal band Mustaine later evolved their sound to a great metal band"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly bad album.","review":"I try not to exaggerate as much as other \\"metalheads,\\" but I think this is one of the worst albums ever made, in any genre, made even more pathetic considering some of the landmark thrash metal albums that were being released at the same time. Bad sound, lame songs, and Mustaine's horrible voice (thankfully it got a little better, later). The best thing about this album is that it is mercifully short. It's somewhat of a tribute to Mustaine that he recovered from this disaster to produce an album as good as \\"Peace Sells.\\" I think even \\"completists\\" should stay away from this, but if you have to have it pick it up at a used CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another \\"I've Been Around For Twenty Years\\" Sales Pitch","review":"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews on amazon. I didn't expect much because I remember the author from my management days at Merrill Lynch and true to form that's what he delivered. There is nothing new or earth shaking in this book that people in the financial serivces industry have not already heard a billion times, unless you are devoted to phrases like \\"envisionin the future\\" and you enjoy affected books containing quotes like the one by Thomas Jefferson in this book about searching for the truth. The author is great for taking what others have done and reguritating it back up. Genuinely new offerings are not his forte. Read Jeffrey Gitomer's Sales Bible, books by Brian Tracy, special books like the Psychology of Call Reluctance or Selling To Vito to get the real edge on genuinely helpful info that managers can use."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was bad from beginning to end","review":"A MaryJanish Davidson wannabe with the most unsympathetic protangonists ever - neither the hero nor the heroine had any redeeming qualities that I could see (the heroine actually takes stupidity and selfishness to a whole new level).

Not only do the two leads have no sexual chemistry, they have no sex, but are in love after two kisses, Please. I was so upset that I threw the book in the trash the day after i bought it. Stay away from this book and its author. They are both a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hugely enjoyable chick lit vampire tale","review":"What a fun book! The main character Sarah is hilarious and sarcastic... seeing the vampire world through her eyes was a hoot. I enjoyed every page and can't wait to see what the author's next one will be like. I've added her to my automatic buy list."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW... This book was so bad!","review":"Seriously, I almost can't believe how bad this book is. Look, I love paranormal romances, and I've read a lot of them. This book has got to be one of the worst I've ever read! I'm amazed that I actually finished it. The main character just gets on your nerves the whole time, there is very poor character development, and the plot is seriously lacking. The author's attempt at humor throughout the story is really just sad. Giving two stars for this book would be too generous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vampire Hater Loved This Book","review":"I'm not a big fan of vampires in general, so it was with some trepidation that I picked up this book. And you know what? After finishing this book, I couldn't remember what my problem with vampires was to begin with. Michelle Rowen's first book is simply delightful. The language sparkled, the characters were lovable, the plot was engaging, and it had so many funny, memorable lines. Sarah Dearly, the protagonist, is a *girlfriend* with three snaps and a head shake. She made me want to pack my bags and infiltrate the Toronto vamp scene. This book should be made into a movie.I am looking forward to Michelle Rowen's next book. And the one after that, and the one after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I could go on for ages about how awful this book is! With the language and writing style of a middle school girl, in addition to the total lack of character and/or plot development, it was a herculean task to even finish it. The main character is the most unlikable and unrelatable of any character I have ever come across. This book is a total and utter joke. I strongly suspect the good reviews on here are planted by the author and publisher. This may be the worst book I have ever read, and I read a LOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, the second star is a pity star","review":"I wanted to give it one star, but didn't want to be too mean. I did actually read it all. I wouldn't advise you to do so (seriously, you'll never get that time back!). I found the leading lady to be unsympathetic and somewhat annoying, the vampire hero to be predictable and a little boring. sigh. I was so disappointed by this book that I had to immediately reread the Twilight books. Now THERE's an interesting couple, and they're only teenagers (sort of...)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read! Good for MaryJanice Davidson fans","review":"Loved it read it in two days!!! I am a fan of MaryJanice Davidson and this book is similar in charm and vamp hi jinx! Although call me crazy I wanted her to end up with Quinn but I just realized this book is a series so who knows? But I always go for the couple that never gets together :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one?","review":"Am I the only person who has read this book that thought there was more romance between Sarah and Quinn than Sarah and Thierry? I wanted to like this book and I basically did, but I felt there were some major things wrong with it once I had finished. It was very humorous and I enjoyed the character of Sarah. I don't feel the author showed us enough of why Sarah liked Thierry and not Quinn. Sure, Thierry was dark and handsome, but there wasn't enough between he and Sarah in the book. I felt the romantic tension was lacking. It never came to fruition either. At the end, they were away together but we never saw how they got to that point.This was an okay book. It certainly wasn't a keeper like How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire. That was an excellent vamp book and I am eagerly awaitng the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe The Woerst Vampire Book Ever","review":"Ok I read a lot of paranormal romances, but this one is one of the worst books I've ever read. For one, there is every little romance in this book. Not even one sex scene. There is no chemistry between the main characters at all. For two, as a vampire book it leaves much to be desired. MaryJanice Davidson was quoted saying that Bitten And Smitted was \\"A charming, hilarious book! I'm insanely jealous I didn't write it.\\" Not sure why she said that. The book wasn't charming or even a little bit hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitten and Boring","review":"Sometimes I truly believe that there can be too much of a good thing. Vampire romance novels are one of them. We had Anne Rice the Queen of angst, homoerotic love, and bloodsucking history , and we have MaryJanice whos \\"undead\\" series is unique funny and very sexually explicit, We have many others on the sidelines that dabble in vampire stories like Kenyon, and Hamilton (whos anita blake series is seriously overrated), Feehan, Ashley, and so many others. This book \\"bitten and smitten\\" had a promising hook, but again it read to me like a used buffy script, or a rip off of Maryjanice, there wasnt anything new and exciting or even romantic about it at all. Thierry de Bennicoeur? did she go to a \\"cheesy vampire hero name generator\\" and pluck that one out? There was a skeleton, the barest of skin, sort of story trying to have its way onto literary infamy, but she just couldnt pull it off in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendiferous debut!!!!","review":"You know what I HATE? Reviewers who hate everything. Folks, this book is allll that AND a bag of chips! Smitten was given to me by a friend, and I loved it so much that I went online to order a few for my other friends, and it was while I was glancing at the reviews that I noticed Mkath's...or should I say \\"McWrath's!\\" review. Hateful! Don't be fooled - she hates every book she reviews, and seems to derive great pleasure from trashing some really wonderful novels. (Thank God none of us have to spend the holidays with her! Can you imagine?) Perhaps her next purchase should be some vaseline to remove that extra large stick up her butt instead of a book!Anyhoo - this book is terrific, fresh, original and funny, funny, funny! Pass the REAL word - Smitten is definately worthy of purchase, you'll love it and want to pass it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was edited, right?","review":"I was looking very forward to reading this and snagged it right away. I didn't have alot of fun reading it, there were too many inconsistencies, too much copy-catting of other successful books in this vein. I'm still trying to figure out how Sarah got her rental car back if she hitched a ride back with someone else. As an aside, the teaser of her next release book sounds good, I'm sure I'll give it a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly Read","review":"I found this book highly humorous. It was easy to read. Yes it is highly fluffy but fluffy is good. It is somewhat different than many books in this genre. It really concentrates on the vampire part more than the romance part. This is a good thing. However the ending itself is way too fairy tale. I am not sure why but I wanted something more to the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"great series!","review":"This series is hilarious.

It also allows one to experience the love involved in sacrifice and devotion to a task that does not serve oneself. For this I give the movie 5 stars. Study the history, sure. But, watch the movie and ask yourself ... what is my devotion? how do I sacrifice for others, even unto risking my life and/or leaving behind comforts of the world? Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Portrayal","review":"I was dissapointed to read the other review of this movie because I really loved it. Granted, I am a nurse so I may have more invested than a non-nurse viewer....even so I thought Jacqueline Smith gave a heartfelt and noble portrayal of Florence. The movie itself showcased some of florences best moments...standing up to the male hierachy of the British Army to be allowed to care for the wounded soldiers. I defy anyone not to be moved by Florence's dedication and commitment to her patients. Way to go Jackie!

While made in 2005, the 95 minute video does not share much of the industry activities that in many cases shaped the priorities of these three aviation pioneers. For those seeking information about these three aviation pioneers this will be a great video. For those seeking video of events during aviation's golden years, you should also be delighted. For those as interested in the broader industries activities beyond Boeing and Lockheed, the video will leave you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with lots of basic patterns","review":"This is great little book. I like all of the different useful and basic patterns. The images are pretty terrific, too. The sizes are for small to large (about size 2-10). The patterns are printed in miniature on the pages. You have to blow them up to scale. I've yet to make anything but know it should be easy once I take it to a copy shop to blow up the patterns.

We watched this many times years ago for a number of reasons, mainly the music and situations common to us and our touring lives and industry woes.

This product was recorded not much better quality then if you downloded it as a bootleg and burned it to disc. I was very disappointed with the quality and this new format for reducing inventory.On the positive side, you do get to see a good movie from 20+ years ago that otherwise may not have been available.My disappointed is from someone who collects movies that the process for burning is very different than mass produced discs. It would be different if you were paying $10 for a downloaded version, or steaming but I feel the prioce for this poor quality is very bad business and somewhat misleading in the fine print for those who don't read slosely or aren't aware of the meaning of a recorded disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corny but I like it.","review":"Movie is kind of corny but I enjoy the music and the band.

I bought the soundtrack album. But, still....Paul Simon wrote the script. I'm a writer, and artists from other disciplines often think they can just sit down and write a script with no apprenticing. They're wrong. Narrative fiction has rules and craft it takes a long time to master. Did you see artist Julian Schnabel's film he wrote about Jean Michele Basquiat BASQUIAT? A horrible film.Nonetheless, this film isan't charmless...and, hey, as a Lou Reed fan, it was fun to see him act, and especially act the part of a smarmy record executive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the underside of industry , but a side all the same","review":"This film was really inspiring to me when it first came out, and remains that way 25 years later. Having always been a Paul Simon fan, I eagerly awaited it's release. the story is a familiar one, but retains originality through its unique perspective. The cameos are refreshing, and despite an inexperienced sreen-writer and lead actor, I found that it has been a movie that has stuck with me for over 20 years. As a struggling musician who has flirted with success, I found that it really hit home. The casual fan of Simon will not find much to like about this film, but for a fan like me it is priceless. I bought the soundtrack to it when it came out (on 8-track) and wore it out. Not having an internet to obtain a new copy, I operated on it and grafted it back together. This is one of my all-time favorite films and for the Simon-purist, this one should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great taste of the 70s!!!","review":"Okay, the screenplay and the acting are not top notch, but think of it as a quite genuine and entertaining look of the end of the 70s. Also there are a few really cool cameos. LOU REED as a faggoty record producer trying to change up Paul's style and STEVE GADD, one of the most insanely talented, infamously drug addled drummers with some speaking lines. I really loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Version Long Past Due","review":"I agree that this film is seriously underrated. In my opinion, the story and the soundtrack have not dated, and it is a film that I find I still want to come back to every few years. My tired old video copy of this film is the only thing keeping me from getting rid of my video player - everything else in my collection has already been re-purchased in DVD format!

The shirt came wrapped perfectly and it will be a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Material, lacked tests similar to MCAT","review":"Very complete review of all sections. My major complaint was that the questions and passages were placed right after the material learned. This book is a good start on your road to the MCAT, but I would highly recommend more practice tests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer, be aware!","review":"This book seems to be a collection of public-domain material, printed only if you order it. It is a pain to deal with, because although the pages are numbered, the table of contents doesn't list any page numbers. It's just a big list of the stories and poems inside. So the only way to find any given story is to go foraging around and hope you find it. I plan to manually write in the page numbers myself. Also, there is no index.You may be better served to just go to wikipedia and print out any of the desired poems or stories yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended as a source for factual information","review":"As a biological anthropologist, I found this book readable, but far too full of straw-man type arguments. Nabhan mischaracterizes various hypotheses in biological anthropology, then cuts down the straw men with his own arguments. Rather than coming across as factually inaccurate, he could have and should have simply presented his own perspectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book to remember","review":"Parts of this book are worth reading. For example, the author claims the influence of genetics/food is bi-directional. I found this claim provocative.However, the rest of the book is uninspiring.Finally, I was puzzled that the author never addressed the claim that our taste buds have memories. (Whether he agreed or disagreed.) In other words, what we eat in our earliest moments of life, has an extremely strong influence on what foods we like (and eat) for the rest of our lives. This issue has been discussed in the science of nutrition and child rearing for many years now. Susan Robert's \\"Feeding Your Child for Life Long Health\\" is a great book that incorporates this fact into an every day guide for mom and dad. (I preferred Robert's first edition.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"dismayed Lettermen Fan!","review":"If you heard the original lettermen & their superb LP's of the 60's and 70's,you will rate this CD five stars.The new Lettermen recruited by the original Lettermen himself, Mr. Tony Butala is a big disappointment, their voices in this CD is quite unacceptable,doesn't blend very well(needs more practice), except for the last selection \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\"..sorry to say that the new Lettermen doesn't blend anymore to the new millenium.All their classic albums should be revived instead of compiling them from their different albums to contain the same songs in their different CD albums .I have collected 37 of their standard long playings the only problem though, playing them, skips most of their tracks..so this maybe an eye opener to the recording company,to re-record all of their albums in CD format.Why waste their melodic,harmonious voices in their existing short limited selections in one CD,there ought to be more.Don't waste your money with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've missed this for too long!","review":"This was one of my favorite cartoons from the 1980's.

Cynthia is one of the all-time greatest martial-arts stars, ranking along with Chuck Norris & Jackie Chan. So, imagine my surprise when I viewed this movie and saw that, not only was her role just an extended cameo, but she had no fights scenes. The only scene worth watching was a bedroom scene in which she wears a somewhat revealing nightie. This was a major departure from her established martial-arts personna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I was very disappointed with this. Poor workmanship.

There are only two real remixes, which the other tracks are derived from (radio edits and dubs, yawn), and they aren't that great. Average club fare. Considering the original's hip-hop influence I was expecting mostly R&B mixes but none are to be found. This song was released after \\"Bedtime Story\\" which utterly bombed in America (peaked around 45 on the charts) so maybe Madonna was jaded and didn't bother to commission anything too great, I dunno. Not much more to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point well taken!!!!","review":"I love this song! I get so sick of the world telling her that everything she does is wrong and in this song she puts these people in their places. She tells the world not to blame her for the way the world is. She tells them to live their lives and she'll live hers. She lets everyone know she's not sorry for who she is and I love that!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best retort to critics for anyone's life","review":"There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity. I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleeeccchhh","review":"Being a Madonna & Danny Tenaglia fan, I was quite excited to get these remixes. What a waste. The house mixes are ridiculous. Actually, they're kind of insluting to Madonna fans. If you like the original, stay clear of this disc. Oh Danny, what were you thinking...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Shame...","review":"Human Nature is a great song. Its one of the more R&B flavored tracks on her Bedtime Stories album. However these remixes are pitiful. It isn't wise to turn a R&B song into a dance remix first of all, she could of made R&B or hip hop type remixes. That would of been good, but these are pitiful. Don't even waste your money on this, just be satisfied with the album version on Bedtime Stories, because thats the best you will hear of this song."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I'm so sorry...","review":"...for purchasing this maxi. \\"Human Nature\\" is a fabulous song, in fact, I believe it to be one of her best singles. In fact, this song provides us with one of her best videos. But, then why in hell were the worst remixes possible commissioned for this maxi?!?!?I'd suggest buying the album from which this single comes, \\"Bedtime Stories.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpardonable","review":"ALright, if you thought that 1999's 'Nothing Really Matters' Maxi-CD single was degrading and a waste of money, check this one out. Though its chock-full of remixes, its almost insulting in its' blandness. Most of the remixes here sound like Paula Abdul's weak work on her 'Shut up and dance' and theres nothing 90's like about it at all.The video for the song, however, is memorable, but then again, this is NOT an enhanced CD, and you wont get to savor that bit of it. If you already own 'Bedtime Stories', then just be content with that, and don't even venture out getting this. An utter waste of money, and I'd have to certainly start rethinking getting anything Madonna for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DIFFERENT ( BETTER ? ) TROWER","review":"This CD proves that age doesn't weary them. This could have been recorded by a young / hotshot guitar slinger. The participants are young enough to be TROWERS off-spring. The raw energy flows freely from this CD and it sounds like rugged urban blues with an attitude. I would not have picked this as a TROWER CD. His attack on the guitar is a few notches heavier than in the past and provides a welcome edge to this CD. His tone is still as georgous as ever and his ability to play unconventional leads shines throughout. LIVINSTONE BRAMBLE provides some gut wrenching vocals and the backing is superb. I have all TROWER CD's and this one has shot straight to the top of the list.If you like BLUES / ROCK / GUITAR / TROWER , buy it. This is like a benchmark for this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trower Power Returns!","review":"This CD really Rocks! If you are a fan of early Trower you will like this record.

There's very little action in this movie, and what action there is shot from bad angles. Plus, the English subtitles are poorly done. There's not enough comedy to be a parody, and not enough action to be serious.This is a rental at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent off-center action comedy","review":"Neat action scenes, nice interplay between the characters and actors, and some excellent comedic touches add up to a movie well-worth getting.Jet Li is one of the most charismatic Chinese action stars and he is put to good use in this film as a would-be assassin with a kind heart. The supporting cast is also excellent.One weak spot in the film is the plotting. While some of the film's plot twists are well done, others seem arbitrary and out of left field. On the other hand, there was at least one predictable twist that they stayed away from (Li's character was handled differently than one might have expected from the first act).If you liked 'Romeo is Dying,' you will almost certainly enjoy this film as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitman Slays Contract Killer","review":"Contract Killer is the dubbed version of the film with the English title Hitman. Hitman is a good action comedy with excellent performances by Li, one of the few times he's not dubbed in the Cantonese soundtrack, and Eric Tsang with the two showing excellent chemistry.When preparing Contract Killer for release, Columbia Tristar appears to have gone that extra mile to remove the funny, cutting scenes where Tsang expounds on how to be a killer diluting his rapidfire monologs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Personally, I feel that Jet Li was stuck for ideas with this one. I thought that the \\"light ring\\" gimmick was ridiculous and was simply to make up for the bad guy's lack of martial arts ability. Jet Li needs to find new inspiration for his fight scenes before they all start to look the same. A shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"The King of Killers falls short","review":"The latest outing The Hitman aka King of Killers, I'm sorry to say is just another one of those Flicks to pass up.

After that, the entire disc became unreadable.

I tried using some of the advice on here, such as washing with soap and water afterwards or using it multiple times on a CD. It didn't work and made it even less readable each time. Now, none of them play, and they were filled with irreplacable data. Here's the thing. This product has an abrasive which supposedly helps salvage a CD/DVD. Guess what, lots of items you already have in the house have abrasives too, and ones that work far better than this, like toothpaste. Sounds unconventional but is completely true.

It sure doesn't improve things much, but it's a small improvement. I've tried several materials (elmer's glue didn't work... and anything like that might ruin the DVD drive...) and this is the best suggestion I've got.(By the way, I would NOT advise using the hand cleansers on eyeglasses etc -- something in the alcohol seems to dissolve certain coatings they put on lenses.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing I ever bought on Amazon","review":"There's clearly something wrong with this stuff.

But if your looking for the original sound as played on the radio, this will not please you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic watch at a good price","review":"This watch is simple but rugged with the bonus of indiglo - something you cannot get with any other watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and economical","review":"This watch has all the features I was interested in....easy read was the primary feature and on top of that is was very economical.

The date on the 3rd hour didn't change until noonish, and as each week went by I noticed that gradually became later.It is indestructible, but don't actually try destroy it.It is a bit small for me but it got it's job done. I now have the Timex Military Classic watch. It does everything this one does but 10 times better. If you like contemporary timex military watches, go buy that one instead. If I can go back in time, I would tell myself to buy that one instead of going through this one first.But this was a good stepping stone. If you're not trying to be stylish, not using this for work, and simply just to tell time, get it.

It kind of destroys the value of the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"A month after I bought it, after wearing it about half a dozen times, it died completely. Adding insult to injury, Timex wanted $7 (+ the cost of sending it to them) to repair or replace it under the warranty.

This is, hands down, the best watch I have ever owned. I like the simple design, which keeps it slim and comfortable.The aforementioned watch this was intended to replace has been through two years of extremely rough handling, and still ticks away, even the scratched face is easy to read at most angles.

Also amazon's customer service was horrible, shipping of the broken watch was 2 days late and amazon couldnt seam to understand that, refunded my shipping (reluctantly) and couldnt even do that right. Next watch is fine (as far as i know).i like the face its really nice, watch band seams ultra cheap but thats replacable. Ticks loudly, almost like dripping water(yes its that loud). I like that for this low price you get time and date with backlight that actually works quite well. overall watch gets 4 stars and amazon gets one star. i would reccomend buying this watch from target or timex as their cutomer service departments are well suited for actually servicing cutomers and not lining their pockets.pricing will be alightly higher but i'll pay 10$ anyday to not have to deal with amazon's customer care again. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch","review":"I like this watch. It is very affordable, lightweight and well constructed. The only problem with it is that the date, located at the number 3 position, is almost impossible to read. I can't imagine why Timex decided to make the date number white on a black field. You really have to squint to see it. Other than that, I would say, go for it. If you don't want any bells and whistles, and you like an analog format, then this is the watch for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy and fits my need","review":"I needed a reliable easy to read watchj that I could use without fear of it being broken.

Gameplay is not too dificult and gmaeplay is easy to master but stlll pretty fun if you get caught up in the fanatsy world. Another problem is that the viewpoint sometimes changes too quickly whic can be a little annoying. Like most games today it is pretty good but coould have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This new series stinks.","review":"I think it's nice that you're writing a series for older kids, but let me give you many peoples' opinion: After reading many Saddle Club books, some people began to tell me that the books weren't so good. I thought, \\"It is SO not possible for Bonnie to have written a bad book.\\" Well, I kept that thought in mind for awhile. Then one day in a bookstore, I saw the book, \\"Pine Hollow: The Long Ride\\". Since I loved the Saddle Club books so much, I decided to read it. It was awful! It was badly written and boring. Carole, Lisa and Stevie seem like totally different people. No offense, but you shouldn't be wasting your time writing these books. Stick to your widely loved Saddle Club books, and many of us will be much happier! Thanx!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An AWESOME book!","review":"This book was very well written. Scott still won't forgive Stevie for the car crash, but Stevie really wants him to. She gets upset with Phil, because he is spending so much time with Scott. Carol is so busy training Samson that she hardly has time for Starlight. Lisa feel pretty left out, because over the summer Carol and Stevie got to be very close to Callie. I really like that this book included more about Stevie and Phil than Lisa and Alex. I hope it stays that way! I believe that this series is a hundred times better than the Saddle Club. Since I am 14 Pine Hollow seems more realistic while the Saddle Club seems reather unbelieveable. If you are reading Bonnie Bryant, I want you to know I am sooooooooooo glad that you started the Pine Hollow series! PINE HOLLOW RULES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this book","review":"I loved this book, because a lot of it was based around Stevie (who is my fav. character) and she's got such a funny, awesome attitude. and even in a book i read, carole and lisa admit thats what they like est about stevie, that she doesnt get mad easily. is it just me, or do carole in lisa get in fights about stupid stuff. Ecspecially in the #6 Pine hollow book. i think they just need to take a chill pill. but, mrs. bryant, i want oyu to know if your reading this, that I LOVE the saddle club books, your my favorite author and you need to keep putting your thoughts on paper! thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control issue","review":"I heard great things about Meprolight, and it was cheaper than Trijicon by $30 give or take so I decided to try them.2 years ago I bought Trijicons for my P99 and they installed very easily.I recently bought a 2nd P99 and needed night sights for it. When the Meprolights came in, they looked similar to the Trijicons. The only problem was when they were installed, the front sight had a lot of play. The front sight wiggled like a loose tooth, but it wasn't because of the sight itself, but the screw that secures it. The screw's threads were not fully threaded, thus preventing the screw to fully tighten down to the slide.I have no doubt that Meprolight makes great products, but I want to believe I just got a bad batch.I returned the product and plan to buy Trijicons again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walther P99 Nite sites are awesome.","review":"The product showed up very quickly and as advertised.

Compared to the price of any Walther, $90 is insanely high. These sights are about 20% of the price of a whole Walther pistol. Think about that, 20% of the price of a new gun is in two tiny little pieces of plastic, The rest is in the metal and composite of the slide, spring, barrel, grip, trigger, 2 magazines, and the whole firing mechanism including the firing pin.

I appreciate Dodo Press's work in putting this into an inexpensive paperback edition, but the finished product is a bit disappointing.The edition is filled with printing typos. While that may be in the spirit of the old time \\"dime novels\\" where the story first appeared, it should've been edited more carefully for today's readers. It also contains no real background information about the story. There's no intro or afterword, no print history, no pictures (which is a shame, because the tale inspired plenty of artistic interpretations, even in the cheap reprints of the late 19th century). This edition is as bare-bones as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album and nice surprise.","review":"I ordered this CD thinking it was the Irish Brigade I was familiar with.

At least the Park Tool Big Blue Book Has some Information a Lot better than Nothing!! The person that said the Haynes manual was better must like the pretty green cover. That's why I bought this cause that person said it was better than the Park Tool but It is Not!! Save your money If you have a Townie or a Jamis Hudson #3 Internal Rear Hub.

Still, I downloaded the book on my Kindle to show Cynthia how the Kindle works, then I started reading the book and I found it difficult to put down. This isn't Conan Doyle or Agatha Christie, if you are into that sort of mystery novels (I am!), but it is several notches above some stuff I've read by contemporary authors. There is a good plot that unfolds at a nice pace; there are side plots that give depth to the main characters; there is a love story that is certainly not of the cheesy kind; and of course there is a surprising twist at the end. Really, what else would you want in a mystery novel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this book. The author really knows how to tell a good story and has a love of animals. It really is a good read. I could identify with the lead character except for the medical details. I look forward to reading other books in this series.

The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because the art is lovely. Even though you will see alot of red.(blood)Their trying to put so much in 100 min. It's just dumb. The only thing I could get out of the stroy was that their is a battle between two sides. And some guy (not the guy on th cover) was after some sword in a girls body, and the only way to get the sword is to kill her. Did I forget to say that they are bother and sister!!!

You have to watch it a number of times to get the entire plot, but it's not too complicated. There's alot of action and almost too much bloodletting, a few of the deaths were unnecessary.

It had so many loop holes that you were left confused when it's ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Series is better","review":"This movie is a waste of your time. I saw X in the theater and was horrified by the bad dubbing. The series is a much better pick. You get to know the characters more and the story is more interesting.

It's one of the best that CLAMP has put out. With awesome characters, tons of drama and cool battles it's a legend. X The Movie is a very quick summary of the anime series. It takes hours and hours of drama and emotion and tries to pack it into a quick little film. The whole idea isn't bad, but there is just way too much story to rush like that. The whole movie doesn't make a lot of since. They couldn't fit everything into it. So being a fan of the X series and all CLAMP anime, I have to say that this movie is a failure. If you are thinking about watching the movie and haven't seen the series. Just forget about the movie and watch the series. The movie is a bad representation of the story. The series, however, is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"By the series, not the movie","review":"I watched the series first. Then I tried to watch this... I didn't make it through.

The ending is different, and some of the characters have changed slightly, even parts of ths story have changed a bit.The overall feeling of this movie, however, left me feeling disappointed. It ended so suddenly and seemed too quick for the seriousness of what this is based around. This was released a year before the first X series DVD was released, which leads me to believe X the series ws a result of this to deepen the story where this one lacked it.I was disappointed with how this seemed to be rushing through everything to get to the final ending which was lacking. Exciting none the less, it is sitll X, which I greatly enjoy, however never plan to see this again, once was more than enough to compare the series to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"A very formulaic film. It has one of the most disappointing endings in anime. Very non-climatic.

I hear the Manga is great too but I havent read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad.","review":"The animation in this movie is of great quality. Which makes it really sad that the movie is just plain bad. The makers of this movie just expect you to know too much stuff in advance in order to understand what is going on. Stuff happens and you have no idea, no clue, no anything. Now I don't like my movies to be explained to me in full painful detail, I'm not an idiot, I like figuring things out for myself, but this movie has huge plot holes. The plot is like an abbreviated version of the comic's, and that's too much material to cram into a movie. The same thing happened with Akira, only Akira is actually a great movie. Both the comic and the movie Akira work independent from one another. X, on the other hand is not so lucky. If you've read the comic you'll have a clue as to what's happening but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. Don't waste your time watching another bad movie. Read a book, it wouldn't hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kills an hour or so.","review":"If you just have to watch it buy it used or rent. After watching it once its not worth a second viewing.

However, I do recommend the TV series."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been worse...but not by much...","review":"So the series is fantastic! Lots of character development etc. to make you just LOVE all the characters (no matter how evil they are). The movie...yeah...about that. They developed two characters (the main two, Seishirou and Kamui) and they didn't even do a good job. Not only that but they kill off two supporting characters in the first five minutes. The only entertainment value this has is for drinking games involving counting how many times Kotori dies.The series is worth watching. The movie...well...that's your choice..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Epic Let Down","review":"I used to own the Unflipped Manga, and recently replaced my copies. Rereading it inspired me to buy the movie. I knew it would not compare with the beautiful art by the CLAMP artists but the movie was horrible. The sense of plot you can get by reading the Manga was destroyed harshly, though the frame work of the idea is still there vital details are missing and so it misleads you about the entire goal. There is utterly no character development and its a dispassionant episode that is hastily thrown together. The art is still beautiful, but that is all. The imbalance causes collossal dissatisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sorry, But I Just Simply Had To Say This...","review":"Well, just the other night I rented this movie from Anime Planet, not able to get the 7th volume of the series (had already seen 1-5).

And once I was done with it...I watched this.So sorry to all of you bigbigbig fans, but I was quite disappointed.The manga rocked hard and I simply adore the series. But this movie was so- pointless that it's making my insides burn. I'm extremely sorry, but watching this was torture. The series is GREAT! This...isn't.In other words, I hated it.Go readers; go X-fans...go see the series for the first time or again. Go read the manga. Just...just don't watch this. It will simply destory your view on X.Oh, and to to all of those who love this movie; simply sorry. I just had to write this to get the burning out of my chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Plot","review":"This movie did not fulfill my expectations. X is a paradigm example of anime: nice art, nice concepts, bad story telling. X's plot resembles a mere plot proposal: a structure but no originality, no character development, and no literary complexity. I felt like I was watching a video game laden with bad one-liners (eg. \\"An impressive force shield, but is it really necessary?\\")The opening scene revealed some potential (although it was soaked in Freudian metaphors), but the story went downhill from there. If you're an anime fan because of violence and nudity then this film is for you. If you're an anime fan because the first anime you watched was something like Akira, then this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I knew bad anime existed out there, and that one day I would be unfortunate enough to come across it. That day arrived when I foolishly rented \\"X\\" on DVD.Is there a plot somewhere in this piecemeal mish-mash? I looked hard and came up emtpy handed. The movie suffers from far too many characters that are utterly insignificant and weak. The dragons of heaven die off like doughboys in the wrong trench, without a thought given to their character development. Once the dragons of earth start dying, the movie just becomes laughably bad.At least the action sequences are half-decent, but they dont even deserve to be compared with the edge-of-your-seat battles in Neon Genesis:Evangelion. To conclude? This is a terrible anime that wastes any scrap of potential and flat-out bores it's viewer.

The movie was so shallow that I watched it with no sound, and fast foward and I could swear I didn't miss a beat of the damn plot. \\"oh no, they're gonna get the dragons. ha I have found them... no let me use my psychic powers to make a big stupid polygon over 5 blocks of a city... yea...\\" That is in fact the entire movie.

X is the Sci-fi/Horror adventure of Kamui and Fuuma who must decide the fate of the entire world. Kamui must decide between becoming a Dragon of Heaven, or a Dragon of Earth, and his best friend from childhood, Fuuma, is destined to be his enemy.The story is wonderful and the art is gorgeous, however, the movie was actually based on the X/1999 manga that was (I believe) 8 volumes long. The movie was abridged to fit into the space of 90 or so minutes, so you don't get the same feel for the characters.Nonetheless, this is a worthwhile buy. The dub side isn't great (the voices seemed a bit unenthusiastic), but it's worth the money if you like the artwork and don't mind the lack of character development. I give it four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disapointment.....","review":"Wow this one was really boring. It sort of picked up in the end but just didnt have enough to make this one a fun film to watch. The art work was amazingly gorgeous but that was about it. That is why I gave it a 2 star. This just did not have enough action or plot to make it even close to being a 5 star. I was excited about watching this one in the movies but it didnt get into theaters where I live and I was looking at what it made in the U.S. and it didnt make really anything and so I started to wonder what in the world was wrong and now I know. This film is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful piece of junk","review":"This movie has beautiful art, but lacks any character development, an understandable plot, and a satisfying ending. Apparently, the author wasn't even finished writing the manga before this movie was published. The ending was so abrupt and horribly done, I was left staring dumbly at the tv as the ending credits rolled by.A RAY OF HOPE!!!! The official Pioneer Animation site...has announced it will be releasing the first volume of the X TV Series in the fall!! I have seen most of this series already (including the ending) and I am itching to get my hands on it. Very well done, beautiful art, character development, and a satisfying ending!! Save your money for this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but empty","review":"X is nice looking, but has litle substance. The plot and characters will be somewhat confusing for viewers unfamiliar with the manga, because little effort is spent on exposition. There's not a lot of plot, but once it gets rolling, it's quite predictable. The characters are well designed, but not well developed as characters. They kill each other. Will the earth be saved? There's little in this formulaic film to make one care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Either you will love it or hate it!!","review":"X is a great Anime for those who are familar with its manga'a or if you have been an hardcore Anime follower for a while. IF you are any of these i recomend it totally. But if you are just getting into Anime or not into the weirder parts of anime i do not recomend this at all. In my opinion it was great work of art.

It is very well done taking that into consideration and I found some of the fights scenes intriguing, because they moved slowly. Unlike fight scenes that I'm used to, which are very fast and furious, at least the first fight with Kamui against Nataku and the other man (Gomen, his name escapes me right now) was very slow and had a very strange but very interesting feel to it that I enjoyed a LOT. It can be very depressing, but still is an excellent movie and worth looking into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie^_^","review":"This movie is just great...it's moves ur feelingz and emotionz...and you'll cry too!

I saw it in a theatre with a group of 4 or 5 anime fans and we all felt stupid we blew $9 on this sub-par garbage. We all sat around afterward ridiculing the final shot (one character cradles another character's decapitated head in his hands while crying--pathetic.) Do not buy nor rent this crap. I won't bother describing the \\"plot\\" (OK I will: Freaky dream sequence, Dragon of Heaven fights Dragon of Earth and gets killed, Freaky dream sequence, Dragon of Heaven fights Dragon of Earth and gets killed, Repeat, Repeat, Decapitation, Boo-hoo, End credits, you realize you're $9 poorer.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mindless mess of puddly black goo....","review":"That seems a little strong when describing a movie. That is however what this movie seems to me. It was bad enough when theyk illed off Subaru within 5 minutes of the movie! Come on! They said they based this off of Clamps work?! More like stole the characters and pasted them onto a completely different plot line.Yes the animation was good,but the story developed to fast with no real plot. They didn't even do a semi-good job in developing characters. Your left with a dry taste in your mouth after watching it. Not to mention the ending really sucked.The only good thing about it is the squishing noises made whenever someone got their arm teared off or a sword ran through them(very nice indeed!).Listen if you want a nice looking anime that doesn't follow the plot of even the tv series then watch this...otherwise don't bother. You will only be sorry you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the series but told in 100minutes","review":"like i said, this is the series but told in 100 minutes that you really don't have much time to actually know what's going on. I've seen it in english and i thought it was alright. I watched it in Japanese to see if maybe it'd be a little different but NO, its the same confusion of which destiny will the main characater,Kamui, choose. The animation itself is pretty good i think and the ending song is great. But really the ending pretty much sucked, and as for the end of the world? Yah its pretty much a lousy end as not much fighting took place with Kamui and his twin star,Fuma. The series is better i believe but even the ending to the series lagged alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!!!","review":"I don't see why people dont like it. The art is amazing! But the story line sucks... Im a HUGE fan of X/1999 and I liked the movie. But compared to the books it has no chance. It's not possible to fit the story into 90 mins when it has over 18 manga! Any way the story is different but the arts good and if your a fan of X/1999, you should at least see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good but.....................","review":"The movie had one major flaw, too short. They took a story that should've taken 3-4 hours and crammed it into 1 and a half. To cut back on time everybody died quickly. Watch the series instead. It's the same thing but longer. Trust me, you won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't excite me...","review":"Simply put, you had to have seen the series (X) to understand what is going on in the movie; or rather you had to have seen the series to appreciate what the movie is about. I had the unfortunate experience of seeing this movie before watching the series. I felt it was extremely corny and it didn't explain much of the action that happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty at its best...","review":"Being my first wave of CLAMP animation, this nearly broke my nose when it blew me back. The animation was beautiful, and although the plot was a bit rickety and the voicing could have been better, the visuals easily make up for the loss in those.And, of course, being the X-Japan fan I am, \\"Forever Love\\" as the ending theme was a huge treat. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie, but the ending sucked","review":"As my title suggests, I loved every bit of the movie except for the ending. I'm not going to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but those who have will probably agree with me. To me, the ending was quite dissapointing, you feel like \\"Gee, all that for nothing.\\" But other than that, it was a great movie. Fantastic animation, excellent battle scenes, and an awesome storyline, but the ending should have come out differently. But hey, it's still worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the manga, but VERY DISAPPOINTED with the movie","review":"Hey. What can I say? It just plain [stinks]. First of all, I love the manga series to death. It was one of my favorites that I was really looking forward to the movie. But when I saw it, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Yes, it had a lot of action and blood and magic. I'm never queasy about any of those things. But it's also confusing, probably even more so if you have never even read the manga. You can't start to \\"care for\\" the characters because the chemistry just isn't there. I guess its one of those love it or hate em movies. But I hated it. And where's the plot? Sorry CLAMP, I love you girls, but this just plain BITES. Go watch Card Captor Sakura or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rifftrax, nuff said.

The manuscript attempts to condense future time by introducing the concept of cosmological decades, i.e. time is transformed to a logarithmic scale.In doing so however, you can no longer claim that a billion years equals to 9 decades, that depends fully on WHEN these billion years happens. A second concern has to do with life expectancy: If a particle has a life expectancy of a million years and a pool of 1 million particles is available than it does not mean that every year a particle decays. In other words, the autors assume a uniform distribution where a normal distribution is more probable.Issues like the onces described caused me to abandon reading the book about half way. Despite the interesting concept I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bold and grand tour of astrophysics","review":"Five Ages is a magnificent tour through modern astrophysics, from the flitting realm of elementary particles to the grandest imaginable scales of space and time. The range of focus is bold and fascinating. For example, the authors relish in discussing evolutionary processes that are so slow that the current age of the universe is merely an inconsequential fleeting moment.Most readers will find most of the explanations of widely diverse phenomena and theoretical concepts illuminating. The authors do, however, in a few instances, wield terms that most uninitiated readers will not recognize. But, considering the extremely broad scope and limited length of the book, limiting such infractions to a few isolated cases demonstrates considerable skill.I recommend this book to anyone who is even mildly interested in cosmology and is looking for a good mind stretcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw this on Discomusic.com and had to pick it up!","review":"While this collection features the 7\\" versions of some of the best disco songs ever, I still liked it a lot.Being a Dance Music afficianado, I rolled my eyes at first glance. Then when I saw Bernie's recommendation at discomusic.com, I clicked the link which brought me to Amazon to buy it.With a glut of dance compilations on the market I have to give the producers of this collection major props.

The characters and how they relate and/or interact certainly had more potential, but it was unremarkably written.Getting to the root of the plot is rather exasperating and only moderately explained. Many times I was left wondering what one circumstance had to do with the other and the purpose of some characters.

Hattie was strong and smart with John but then so weak with her horrible husband. There was no development with these two characters, specially in the emotional/love area. It was all lust with nothing redeeming, nothing that wanted these two to get together, really. The Aunts, Albert and Snowdrop were great characters. The story could have been so good. First book I've read by this author. Probably wouldn't read another. Too bad, it had so much potential. I hate spending money on and wasting time on a book that's premise could have been so good.

I researched several different models and brands, very few clearly indicated if they worked with the Nano 5g. This product specs also list the Nano, but does not specify which generation. The problem? When docked the sound still plays through the Ipods internal speakers and not through the audio output of the cradle. This is the same problem I had with my previous cradle (worked perfectly with nano 1g). Charging and syncing work as expected, but audio out does not. This is a deal breaker for me, I use my ipod with headphones, at work, and keep it docked so I don't have to worry about recharging.

Someone pressed a reset button? Things just happen for what seems to be no reason at all. Author sucks you in into a story by well defined characters and great premise, shows you glimpses of a secrets (powerful artefacts, importance of collecting demon's tusks) and then just forgets about the whole thing. It's just wasn't enough for me to get curious to read a next book.I will summarise in a words of Kael: \\"It was so chaotic.

Her story brought back so many memories of my six years living with my Shiite inlaws in Tehran during the sixties (Daughter of Jersalem). Although I did not have to wear a chador (except for religious holidays), I could easily relate to this story. I wanted to write to Elizabeth Fornea only to find out she died last year. As a writer of fiction(The Samson Option) and creative non-fiction, I have to take my hat off to Prof. Fornea. Her prose, style and humor are first class. Of course, as some critics claim, she did not dwell on the darker issues in this society. I also used restraint in telling my story (and I was deported without my sons!) But her depiction, of real women, living real lives is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbiased, educational, excellent","review":"Given the attention on the Middle East, and Iraq in particular, this book should be considered a 'must read.' I still find myself wondering what ended up becoming of the village that showed Elizabeth and Robert such hospitality and acceptance before Iraq became a dirty word to Americans. This book inspired me to locate more books written by Elizabeth Warnock Fernea and I anticipate equally enthusiastic reviews of her other open and honest accounts of life in Arab countries. She has had the opportunity to experience Middle Eastern society in a way so few of us could ever hope. I especially appreciate her objectivity and her ability to respect the way of life that so many people in the West automatically view as inferior. This book is truly a treasure for those open-minded enough to want to learn more about life in the Middle East."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I really loved this book. She travelled as a new bride with her anthropologist husband to Iraq in the 1950's or '60's, I believe. She had so much to learn and go through adapting to a new culture. It's great that she's there because her husband would never have been allowed to talk to the women. They were very segregated, so Ms. Fernea learned all about the half of the society that male anthropologists usually can't even learn about due to lack of access. She made friends, had to relearn how to cook rice (different water amount), and you really get a personal look at the culture. She kept in touch with many of her friends from that time. I can't wait to read her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Attempt","review":"What is this trend that we Americans seem to be following? We visit foreign country, meet the natives, learn very little about their culture and customs, and suddenly we are experts worthy of writing books on our experiences. This is the unfortunate case in this travesty. Elizabeth Warnock Fernea is the only person who could have celebrated Ramadan in Iraq without understanding the significance of the celebration. Her prose is boring, and every chapter is merely a very brief overview of the subject. I spent the entire book hoping the next chapter would be better than the one I was reading. It never was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Sheik's?","review":"Guests of the Sheik : An Ethnography of an Iraqi Village by Elizabeth Fernea is a very old book, published first in 1965 and then 1969. A lot of major things have taken place in Iraq since then including the Gulf War and in its aftermath the strangling sanctions, so I find that the book although it has a catchy title does little to reflect what life in an Iraqi village is like or has been in the last decade.

Pure Garfield down to the last panel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"This was my intro to Blues Traveler, and this album brought me out of a depression and I'm forever indebted to Popper and Sheehan for it. One thing it has going for it is it's not as 'pop'py as their later albums like Four and Straight on Til Morning. Too bad you can't hear Onslaught because it rocks. Listen to What's for Breakfast or Optimistic Thought and you'll get a good idea of the wild and carefree jubilation and exuberance that this album inspires."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Letdown","review":"The debut Blues Traveler CD was truly fascinating. Great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as Gina, But Anyway, Warmer Days, and Sweet Talkin' Hippie.This follow up Travelers and Thieves CD has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes. As talented as the instrumentalists might be, after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present. All In The Groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody. Mountain Cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between John Popper and guest, Greg Allman. In time I could appreciate it a bit more. Onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic.However, the overall impression is that of boredom. The tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality. Even Popper's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this CD.The discriminating fan will choose the first CD, Four, and Straight Until Morning and pass on this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"While I love Four, this CD is terrible. It sounds like a different (dare I say terrible) band. Save your money, and your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool CD from a cooler band","review":"This is a great CD. It's got John Popper's great harmonica, and the rest of the band as well. But those who are into the band because of songs like 'Run-Around' and 'Hook' should beware, this is not the Blues Traveler you know. It's better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains one of their all-time best songs","review":"It gets the job done, like most of their other albums. But Optimistic Thought just stands apart on this CD. It might be my favorite song of all time. It hops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddened","review":"I thought this book was extremely demeaning to both African Americans and Native Americans. I do not think that it accurately captured the attitudes of the black soldiers who were confronting all levels of racism from their white superiors. Nor did the black protagonist ever stand up to or confront a white over the issue of racism. He was happy in his subservient role. He wasn't offended when whites called him nigger. The Native Americans were basically portrayed as savages who without provocation attacked innocent whites. There was never any mention of their inherent rights as the first settlers of America, nor any significant recognition of the injustices they suffered as a people.This portrayal of life on the frontier is basically a myth which should have died before it was spawned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accused - 'Martha Splatterhead's Maddest' (Relativity)","review":"I forgot ALL about these splatter-rock thrash metal henchmen. Classic 1991 release. I even saw The Accused on this very tour in some dumpy shack right outside the town of Lawrence, Kansas. I have to give this CD a four-star rating for their somewhat butchered cover of the Ten Years After gem, \\"I'd Love To Change The World\\" alone. Other tunes off this record I sort of liked were the frantic opener \\"Psychomania\\", \\"Sick Boy\\" and \\"Scared Of The Dark\\". Should draw in fans of Cro-Mags, S.O.D., Slayer, Carcass and D.R.I. Give this CD a spin if you dare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal, Yet Dreamy","review":"Transmission0 is a promising new post-metal band that follows the principles of its closest influence, Isis. However, Transmission0 set themselves clearly apart from Isis with their emphasis on the heavier riff-centric segment of post-metal. My only complaint for this album is that the last three tracks are not up to par with the creativity witnessed in the rest of the album. In summary, Memories Of A Dream is an excellent listen (minus the last 2-3 songs). Fans of Isis's heavier material, you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This cd was a holiday gift that I've been trying to find for two years. I was glad to be able to get it this Christmas and enjoyed listening to it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corigliano Lite?","review":"Found this CD at a good price so I snapped it up, even though I had misgivings because I hadn't much cared for other Corigliano I had heard. It had always seemed that he was canceling himself out, harmonically, so what came out was bland and dry, intellectually and spiritually lucid and valid, but emotionally not engaging (unbelievably, that even applied to the First Symphony).Here in this CD on the the other hand is the enthusiasm of a young composer who is solid in his skill and knows it. The music fairly leaps off the page (and the CD). None of the pieces are especially \\"important,\\" but taken together it's a really good listen. Let your intellectual guard down and just revel in the sounds of a compelling artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pyrrhic victory of sorts","review":"This book - and it is subtitled achieving sucess in business and personal life so no confusion as to its aim - is a good read. PLenty of white space within the pages so you never feel you're sitting down to read a tome on military tactics and strategy.However, despite some interesting historical anecdotes, the book feels a little light on and simplistic. \\"Concentrate your forces\\" sounds great when supported by the single battle where it was employed to effect. However, in business terms, the same principle goes against standard practice of having a reasonably broad portfolio. If it all comes off - you look like a god. if it doesn't - you might just be another schmuck who tried and failed.It's the kind of book that's great in paperback - less costly and something you can easily digest during a commute. at hardback price it's a little costly and a little light on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brian Tracy Winner!...","review":"I have been listening to Brian Tracy's tapes, attending his seminars, and reading his books for several years. I have never found any of his products anything by EXCELLENT! His information is practical and useable and, if implemented, anyone can achieve anything they want. I read a lot and Brian is by far my favorite author/speaker. This book is one of his best, no question. For even more great info once you've read this book, order \\"Create Your Own Future\\", \\"Maximum Achievement\\", and all of his other books. You won't be disappointed. And, whenever Brian authors another book in the future... just buy it - it'll be another winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to recommend in it.","review":"A book with filmreviews like Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide but here are, of course, just horrorfilms mentioned. There is also information about actors and directors. The strange thing with this book is why Maxford wrote it; he doesn't seem to like many of the films in the horror genre. It's only the mainstream stuff, like Silence of the Lambs and such films, that get positive reviews. And don't expect to learn something when you read the directors/actors entries; Just some information where and when they where born plus a listing of (genre)films they have made. The reviews are rather boring to read, you get the feeling that Maxford was ashamed when he wrote this book cause of the subject matter. If you are a fan of horrorfilms and want a film guide I would recommend John McCarty's Official Splatter Movie Guide part 1 & 2 and John Stanley's Creature Features insted."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just a huge list of horror movies.","review":"I expected some insight to the great horror movies but it is just a huge list of every horror movie in existence.

This new edition of the sountrack is really good. The only thing I miss from the new one that was on the old one is a track called \\"Flying\\".(I don't own the old one, but my parents owned a cassette of it and I use to listen to it) But other than that this one is really good. And it has some new music that was left out of the old release.The best tracks on this album are Escape/Chase/Saying Goodbye, Far From Home/E.T. alone, E.T.'s Powers, The Magic of Halloween, and End Credits. Of course, all of the music is great. But that's some of the best parts of the score. Especially Escape/Chase/Saying Goodbye. This is such a great cue, and if you don't know. Williams couldn't pull this cue off to fit the movie so Spielberg cut the movie to fit the music. Good job Steven. And good job Williams!This is a must have for any soundtrack fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Symphonic Soundtrack","review":"The first time I listened to this CD all the way through, I cried-- and kept on getting chills down my back! This score completely tells the entire narrative of the film. I believe this has some of Williams' most finest suites ever recorded. He plays with different themes throughout the entire album, and only in the last song does the listener understand what he was working to achieve during the socre. The entire score works up to the last song, and when you have listened to the soundtrack, not only do you feel exhilerated, but you feel hopeful. A truly uplifting score!! John Williams fans must have a few certain scores, the S.W. Trilogy, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Superman and of course. . . E.T. This is a much better expanded CD than the other E.T. that is out. But I do suggest buying both, the original if not only for it's sweeping piano rendition of \\"Over the Moon\\"-- simply my most favorite piece in E.T., and definately one of my favorite Williams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Soundtrack is Great !","review":"Through watching this film I felt that the music made it what it is. I only just decided to listen to the soundtrack a few days ago and i think it is interesting and varied. I have to say that the older edition of the soundtrack is in my view the better, in comparison with the remastered version. I really have enjoyed listening to the soundtrack i feel that John williams captures the character of the film with just the right approach. Many people will know of this theme through the famed grandeur of the Flying scene. However my preferred tracks are the ones which have captured that relationship between E.T. and Elliot. When i listen to Track 16 E.T. is alive it always seems to make me emotional, I really adore the way that the melody of the strings glides. I also really enjoyed the end credits , mainly because of the piano solo, which i think its utterly amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERHAPS HIS GREATEST!","review":"This soundtrack is one of the best works John William's has ever created. As Steven Spielberg said, referring to John Williams, \\"He can take a tear that's just forming in your eye and he can cause it to drip\\". My favorite songs are Far from home/E.T. Alone, Sending the signal, Escape/Chase/Saying Goodbye, and the End Credits. I hope my review has helped you in choosing a CD just for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Scratch my entire earlier review.

Evocative photographs, and elegantly written by Roger vaughan, who really got it right. It would have been easy for Vaughan to have gotten overly sentimental, given the nature of the photographs, but he let them speak for themselves -- which they do extremely well -- and added just the right combination of fact, humor, and whimsy to pull the whole thing together.

And it probably would be a great subject for a book if undertaken by anyone with any sense of adventure or, better yet, someone with more degenerate qualities than McCamish. There is no question that such a voyage, especially one that is essentially arranged by a travel agent on the writer's behalf, is not going to necessarily live up to the cartoonish view of salty seamen brawling and whoring (although a fair share of the latter appears to have survived). However, the adventure is a basically sound concept that would have been better had it been vicariously lived through someone who was completely willing to immerse themselves into it instead of calling his wife at every port and trying to avoid prostitutes. McCamish's story is that of an obviously well-to-do Australian keeping an arms length distance from his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"A timid tome from a timid traveller","review":"As a simple account of one man's voyages, this is barely acceptable. On the other hand, great disappointment awaits those who, like me, bought this book in anticipation of an in-depth insight into travel on cargo ships. McCamish writes badly, and is seemingly concerned more with destinations than getting there. Even then, he resorts frequently to quoting the descriptions, often archaic, that others have written about various ports. He is overly concerned to the point of immaturity with a romanticised notions of barnacle-encrusted sailors brawling in bars where scared civillians like he fear to tread, and other cliches attached to men of the sea, and is then disappointed when he can't find them.Throughout the reading of this I hoped he'd stop his moaning and nervous uncertainty, get on a plane, and go home.It's the worst book I've struggled through in a long time. And I learnt next to nothing about travel on cargo ships."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is a must have for anyone into speed/death metal. When this album was released it received some scathing reviews from journalists who had never heard anything heavier than Bon Jovi or Motley Crue, but those of us who enjoy true heavy metal fell in love with it.

The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the lyrics hear are gore metal lyrics and do not delve into the deeper philosophical and social issues discussed on later albums. But the music is intense, possible Death's most brutal work. If you want a talentaed and intelligent death metal, listen to Death!

Incidentally these have been hotly debated issues during he mid term campaigns in the USA. Pro Life...Pro choice.Eusthanasia... Mr Schuldiner had an opinion about each and all of them. The musicianship is not as tight as the following releases but the solos are still mind blowing.

It's a real shame Neil didn't have the sense to hire a good lyricist -- it would have made most of these songs so much better! All in all very inconsistent like all of Neil's albums. Its a shame because most of these albums had 90-95% great tunes but with only 1 or 2 songs with even decent lyrics.

The recommendations from other authors (on the book sleeve) seem like professional quid pro quo, as the same authors are given as references inside. The book fails for several reasons. First the author lacks the in depth knowledge of her subject matter, and is frank about that. The interviews all take place decades after the events, they lack the kinds of vivid details that make other books great. The biggest problem with the book is that it reads more like a fictional account. The witnesses present us with unverified first hand accounts. They are free to withhold more revealing details, or to embellish their accounts. Several of the accounts just don't ring true, and one gets the impression that a story is being told. The author lacked the resources/ incentive to provide a more researched book.

What were the lives of German women like in Nazi Germany? There is no single answer, of course, as the answers are as varied as women themselves, despite Nazi-enforced conformity. Here are interviews with sympathizers, resisters, communists, apoliticals, rich, poor, middle class, East Germans and West. This book made it clear to me how idealistic youth could be sucked into the Nazi vortex. This is a dense book, and the interviewer does not succeed at being totally objective.

These women had interesting things to say without being pushed in one direction. The other reason I didn't enjoy this book was that the tempo was staggering.

This book stayed with me long after I finished it and I still think about those women and I wonder if I would be able to have the physical and mental fortitude it took to survive those horrible years.Alison Owings has brought history to life in the narratives of these women.This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst work on Howard Ever Done","review":"Sprague de Camp -- and I knew this guy for many years -- was the ultimate opportunist. Oscar Friend -- the original agent for REH's works after his death -- made the mistake of letting him in on Conan and over the decades -- from the 1950's through the 1980's -- made a pretty good living off Howard's cold dead body. This \\"bio\\" makes his one on Lovecraft seem fair and accurate. Nope, not at all. De Camp had the really annoying habit of trying to psychioanalyize other -- always dead -- writers. With this one he brought in his wife and some child psychatrist. The result is a really bad look at Howard from a guy --who despite the fortune he made off of him -- who deep down didn't like Howard or perhaps resented the fact that dead, Howard was still more popular than he could ever be. There are better works out there. Try them first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I clearly missed something the other reviewers got.

After reading several reviews it seems that buying this unit is a large gamble. It works for a few and doesn't work for most.

The author is highly opinionated and some times condescending toward people with different ideas, which is very distracting. The book is slanted towards the Mediterranean and Europe and is more an account on their experience from their travels.

His information is totally up to date and backed up with studies. He dispels many common myths (i.e. breastfed babies require extra water when the weather is hot, you cannot breast feed while taking many common medications...)about breastfeeding. The information is very well layed out and easy to find. It really opened my eyes to the unsung values of breastfeeding (and the dangers of not).

I learned a lot about latching, medications, and came up with ideas for the sore nipples I was resigned to before I even brought the book home. If I were to start again, I'd buy this book and the Sears Breastfeeding book, and skip the others. Both are excellent references for problems you don't think you'll have until you're at your wit's end on a Saturday evening when there's no one to call.Dr. Newman seems to have a lot of practical experience with breastfeeding problems and presents many case examples along with good general instructions for solving problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" for Any Breastfeeding Mother","review":"Definitely worth the price and more!

I also found the book humorous and encouraging.His primary points are that breast milk is best and a good latch solves most problems. His humor shows throughout the book (and in the title). He uses terms like \\"absurd\\" and uses humorous analogies to debunk claims that some breasts just can't breastfeed or that formula is as good as breast milk.I found this book a great read (laughed out loud many times) during my third trimester while waiting for baby as well as helpful and encouraging during nursing and getting through those critical first two weeks.So if you or someone you love has been told their breasts aren't right, or their milk isn't right, or their nipples aren't right for breastfeeding, but they want to breastfeed, then get them this book and find out how to make it happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers : The Most Comprehensive Problem-Solution Guide to Breastfeeding from the Foremost Ex","review":"This is an excellent book for both parents and educators.

However, the author goes on and on about nursing a child until he/she is a 4yr toddler and on the other hand has no information for a working woman. The author assumes, every woman is a homemaker and a mother's only purpose in life is to breastfeed. The worst part is, the book almost makes you feel guilty for leaving a child with a caregiver.

I could do less with the preaching about breastfeeding and more with the practical business of getting on with actually doing it.

Shame on them all for allowing this to get to the screen in this fashion. The only slightly redeeming quality is the beauty of some of the images, but since they relate to nothing meaningful whatsoever they are just kind of marooned and wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this movie, unless you've read the book...","review":"Reviews of movies based in whole or in part on novels are replete with warnings like, \\"Not nearly as good as the book,\\" or \\"Don't waste your time on the movie, just read the book.\\" In the case of Hearts in Atlantis, the movie just doesn't make sense if you haven't read the book. From a performance standpoint, and as a \\"coming of age\\" story, the movie gets 4 stars. But for the story, where it would be nice to know about the Breakers and Low Men in Yellow Suits, the movie absolutely fails. Folks, there's a whole lot more to the story than what you get with this movie... so, you might want to skip this one, unless you've read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankly A Disapointment","review":"Despite having read the book and having some anticipation for the film on that basis I wanted little else but to sit back and be entertained. I found the film to be flat and meandering with little drama nor coherent plot line. Anthony Hopkins a gifted actor was enjoyable to watch but really seemed only to be playing this part by the numbers. The film just never really seemed to pull itself together and take off. It occurred to me that probably watching this film accompanied by the Directors commentary would prove to have been a more satisfying experience. I would let this one go and rent it on VHS the next time you visit your local video store. Pity as with many films it could have been remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent on its own, dissapointing compared to the book","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is a heart-warming, beautiful coming-of-age story, similar to King stories such as Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. The acting is excellent, and the flow is wonderful. However, the movie is a total change from the original , much better, story in the novel. The title loses all original meaing, the main premise to the \\"low men\\" is changed and not fully explained in the movie, and the overwhelming feeling one gets after discovering the truth of anthony hopkin's character is different in the movie than the book.Yes its a great movie, but if you've read the book, you'll find yourself dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not stream well","review":"The video was easy to access but would constantly stop and reboot very frustrating. Took several hours to watch the whole movie. i am just glad I bought the DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie but poor Amazon video quality","review":"The movie was fine. The quality of the \\"instant\\" format was terrible. I will never rent a movie from Amazon again. They should make it clear which movies can be downloaded and watched at a decent quality and which are only available to watch streaming. I wasted my money on this one. Next time I will rent the DVD locally"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"One of my all time favorites! Anthony Hopkins is superb as usual.as many times as I have seen it it still gives me that lump in my throat but it is a feel good movie.About loyalty and believeing in yourself,having faith and accepting things in life u simply cannot change and having the heart of a lion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Very Young Childen, but a Must for Everyone Else!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies, which I recently upgraded from VHS to DVD. It is a stunning story--full of nostalgia, historical atmosphere, mystery, suspense, innocence and lost innocence, realism and intrigue. A young teenage boy befriends a man who is so wise and fascinating that he becomes not just a friend, but a legend. But the man, portrayed by the master, Anthony Hopkins, is also sad and strangely calm about something he is terrified of. DO see this movie and OWN it! You will want to watch it many, many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine screen adaptation on a Stephen King story","review":"Earlier Stephen King movies were almost embarrassing to watch, not this one.The movie on its own is quite good. Hopkins is solid as ever, the young actor playing Bobby Garfield was especially good as were most of the main actors. One seldom enjoys the movie as much as the book and often portions of the story is truncated or changed to fit into a time-restricted screenplay. The book had a tad more fantasy aspect in regards to 'the low men', their vehicles and references to 'the beam' from \\"The Dark Tower\\" series. It misses out on how severely cold and dysfunctional Bobby's mother was and how messed up Bobby ends up, which of course makes for a shinier ending in the movie.The small and larger changes to the story don't necessarily hurt the film at all. I'd say the book was richer in story while the movie of course winds up with the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchering Brilliance","review":"King, I'm so disappointing with you for allowing them to butcher your story. I wouldn't have minded that they only concentrated on the first short story in the book if they hadn't completely butchered even that. (Even though it's the books second story that I'm passionately in love with.)The cheapness of cutting out all the supernatural elements of the first story in the book and changing the whole meaning of the story to save money is pathetic. They just didn't want to spend the money on the special effects needed for the sci fi element.If you have read the book you will be sorely disappointed with this syrupy \\"nostalgic\\" nonsense.The film is watchable and has it's good points, but considering the brilliance of it's original source it is still an abomination so I'm gonna stick with one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but confusing at times..............","review":"Once again Anthony Hopkins does a wonderful job in this movie. Anton Yelchin (Bobby Garfield) is wonderful.While I watched this film I could not help but think of two other movies based on Stephen King novels, Stand By Me and The Green Mile. I also had thoughts of A Beautiful Mind.A complete stranger comes to town and changes an 11 year old boys life for the better. You will experience Bobby's first kiss, dealing with bullies, his uninvolved mother, and his questions about his deceased father. You can not help but feel close to Bobby.I was uncertain what was actually happening to Bobby and his ability to read other peoples minds. I kept asking myself, \\"What is going on here?\\" The ending does help to explain this.Over all a very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storytelling at its finest","review":"When we will finally let Steven King take his rightful place among the great storytellers of our age? Yes, he's the King of Macabre. But the thing that makes him so good at scaring us is that he understands our collective heart and soul. Every character he creates -- scary or otherwise -- is richly textured and multi-dimensional. If you're still convinced that King is one-trick pony, you're missing some beautiful literature. King's \\"Hearts in Atlantis,\\" along with \\"Stand By Me,\\" \\"Shawshank Redemption,\\" and \\"The Green Mile,\\" should stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Kurt Vonnegut, Salman Rushdie, John Irving, Philip Roth, and Tom Robbins. Read this book or watch the movie. Both are terrific, but of course the book has a much wider arc. Hopkins is (as always) a marvel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard","review":"I personally was incredibly disapointed with this film. First off, i understand that it is very difficult to write a screenplay based on a Stephen King novel, they are very involved and discriptive. This movie only had a basic skeleton of what actually occured in the book. I think they skipped over very touching parts that should have been included, and i agree with the above reviewers in their thoughts on the low men and such. I was dissapointed to see that absolutely none of the other parts of the book were included, which led to viewers being puzzled as to what was going on. I found it very vague and sappy. I was disapointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can skip this one","review":"I love Anthony Hopkins as much as the next person, but this movie had several flaws:(1) nothing much happens;(2) Anthony Hopkins speaks with a slur that I guess is supposed to imply world weariness, but instead is just annoying;(3) Anthony Hopkins spouts trite observations (\\"we're all just passing through, kiddo, just passing through\\") that are meant to imply wisdom, but instead are just annoying;(4) the movie could have ended at any one of its last four scenes, and nothing would have been lost.However, I don't think the movie's awful. There are a couple of scenes that are outstanding, the best of which is a conversation that Hopkins has with a local bully. And the young protagonist's girlfriend was perfectly cast and excellently played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"I just finished reading the book for the second time last week, and I just got done watching the dvd tonight. I've read everything by Stephen King and I think this book may be the best. The movie is not bad; Anthony Hopkins is well cast and does fine here, but the movie is like a reader's digest condensed version of a masterpiece that should not be touched. I know - you say that the book is always better than the movie. But this time the heart of the novel was removed. The characters were so much more developed, the story more supernatural. The book is a masterpiece that captures the spirit of the 60's, the magic of childhood, and the inevitable loss of everything. Skip the movie and spend an enjoyable week reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could go lower I would!","review":"As a movie, I guess this was all right... but my rating is really based on the fact that I read an amazing book a few years ago and went to see what I was hoping would be an amazing movie, only to find that it wasn't. Anthony Hopkins was (as usual) hauntingly distant and the child actors were very good and all... I just feel like they took the name of a really good book and made a completely different movie under the pretense that it was an adaptation.There were three very good, very poignant parts to the book, unfortunately this movie only covers one and a half... I say half because for some very odd reason, they decided to completely change the ending. If you're looking for an all right movie, then I guess you could always catch it on HBO when they're playing it on a Saturday at 3am... but if you're looking for a movie loosely based on a really great book, this is not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book - Worst Movie","review":"This movie is really bad. I red the book (and belive me the book is bad enough), however I thought that it would be fun to see the recreation of the Sixties. But guess what, no sixties in the movie!!!!!.Is just the absurd story of the Old Ted and Little Bobby O. Is basically a bunch of non-sense \\"Low Men\\" (of course you will never know who they are or where they come from) searching for and old idiotic guy, a little kid and his friends that think that the old guy is cool and a mom that hates him.Save yourself 16 bucks don't buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I previously read this book and it was great! Making a movie of it was a brilliant idea! Although they must have edited a lot of it because there was a lot of use of the \\"F\\" word (just in case any kids are reading) and a lot of sexual references. It's quite depressing though.(Just a word of advice, hehe.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wastin yo time","review":"Hello all. I must say, this movie does NO justice to the book. I can't stand the fact that it \\"rushes' through every important character and leaves you with Anthony Hopkins describing some BS to a kid. Of course, when AT character says it's the CIA looking for him, the story doesn't break a beat. However, in the book, this story is a part of a whole series (see other's). I don't want to kill everything for a \\"layman\\", but this holds no grounds in my case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Your Time","review":"Overall this was a good movie. The storyline was original and kept your attention. There were a few slow spots but I thoroughly enjoyed it as a whole. For the most part, it was a movie that made you smile thinking about being a kid during the summer in a much simpler time. It reminded me a little bit of \\"My Girl\\" with Macauly Caulkin. I would recommend this movie to people. P.S. - Not to give anything away, but I wish they had at least told the audience how Carol's character died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book, Skip the Movie","review":"I read the book first and it was fantastic. First off, the book contains 5 stories all related back to the first one. The movie is based on the first one, and I guess the fifth although it changed a lot. Yet, about the movie, it was boring, to be blunt. The movie skipped all the good parts of the book and if it didn't skip it, the movie had it different and for the worse. I was expecting a much better film so I of course went out and purchased the dvd. If anything- rent it. And if you haven't seen the movie or read the book then I highly recommend the book and skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens!!!!!","review":"Thismovie hasnothing: it has no climax, no definite plot, no strong characters, no moral lessson, only great performances by Hopkins and the kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stephen King book Makes a Great King Movie","review":"While Hearts In Atlantis is rather unexciting movie, it is interesting to see how events progress throughout the movie. Anthony Hopkins puts on a great performance as a man who becommes a tennant in a house with a young boy and his selfish mother. Over time the man proves capable of an amazing gift but his time with the family is cut short by men who are seeking him. Other dramatic events occur throughout the movie that attempt to hit on certain issues and I suppose teach valuable lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great story turned bad","review":"If you haven't read the book by Stephen King, you should. It is one of the best stories I've ever read. The story was very original and imaginative. Not that that's a rarity for a Stephen King story. Many of Stephen King's brilliant works have been turned into excellent movies and many of his stories have been turned into terrible movies. Unfortunately, Hearts In Atlantis falls under the second catagory.This was by far the most dissapointing movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and unclimatic","review":"Hi everyone,A couple of nights ago i found myself going to the movie rental place in our local town, probably to select a gory and extremly scary horror film from some great author such as Stephan King ( I have everybook ever written by him) and my day was completely enlightend when the clerk told me she had just recieved a copy of hearts in atlantis, i rented it went home made a big bowl of popcorn and sat down expecting a great film made by the king of kings in horror & thriller movies, what i got was over barring, gut wrenching FILTH it was horrible i would have watched a science documentary before that if i would have known what i was about to watch. TH whole FBI thing was way out of line, the homosexual bully wasnt needed , and it followed the book on a mere couple seconds. I defintitly will think twice on renting a movie before i check out the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best movie i have seen in awhile","review":"Im not going to say what its about because you probably already know. I just want to say thats its the best movie i have seen in awhile. Dont listen to those stupid critics that only give it 2 and half stars. What do critics look for anyway. When they say a movie is good i dont like and when they say its no good I end up liking it alot. If you like movies w/ meaning and that make you think this is one you must see. This is a fun movie to watch and it brings you back to the past with great music and it also brings you memorys to the good old days. The movie also has very interesting quotes that I payed aloy of attention to and that made me think a lot about. Although its sad it is a grrreat movie. A must see and a buy when it comes out on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearts in Atlantis, a tentative opinion","review":"I have read the novel, Hearts in Atlantis, and it's clear from the trailer that they will only be doing the first and final segments of that book for the film.The actors and the scenes in the trailer appear top notch. However, I am afraid that the movie will not be able to do the book complete justice, as a large portion of the novel, which was written in five segments, each one reflecting a different story. Also, the book ties in very heavily, especially the first segment upon which the film appears based, to Stephen King's great opus, The Dark Tower Saga, which, in and of itself, isn't even complete yet. References to that work would either have to be cut or modified.Ideally, though, Hopkins is an ideal choice to play Ted Brautigan, a man with a secret ability to find the truth in others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the other two thirds?","review":"This movie is fair as far as it goes but it only covers 1/3rd of the book. They left more out of this movie than they did of \\"The Shining\\" and that was a disgrace. Rent, but don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK movie, but regretably it dove into stereotypes.","review":"The plot wandered without much purpose for half of the movie but was not particularly bad. However when the inevitable representation of evil was selectd to be a (probably) self hating closet teenage gay (or maybe cross dresser - you couldn't be sure)I was [angry]. I thought that the era of Hollywood gay stereotyping was beyond us. ... Worse, the lesson that Hopkins' character gave to the little boy was that it was dandy to blackmail the evil teenager to shame him into submission. What a message. Shame on you. If you have gay sensitivities, this unnecessary plot line will dominate your impression of the film and kill it - justifiably so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"I was very pleased to find that the screenplay was very true to the book. Anthony Hopkins made an outstanding performance of the mysterious Ted Brautigan. I found it to be quite entertaining and would recommend others to see it. My only regret is that it probably would have been too long to incorporate the other interconnected short stories into this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse adaptation ever!","review":"If you enjoyed the book this is based on, don't waste your time watching this piece of dreck which is similar only in title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Not like a Stephen King story.","review":"Although Anthony Hopkins is one of my favourite actors, even he couldn't get this one going for me.I though the children were good actors, but the story line lacked something. I didn't know anything about this story before watching it ,( I prefer it like that if possible) so went in with an open mind.I appreciate what the story was getting across, but it didn't make particular good viewing. I read the write-up on the back of the DVD and it stated, \\"it'll grab you...and keep you hooked\\" I didn't feel this at all. It also calls it a \\"tear-jearker,\\" didn't agree, ( and I usually cry at anything in films).Disappointed with this film, not what I expected from a combination of Stephen King and Anthony Hopkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"I must admit that I am reviewing this with a little bit of bias because I am a fan of the original Stephen King story, and I feel it would have been better if certain supernatural elements were left in. I can understand why they were left out thought, it would have been confusing to non-King readers. The movie itself is passable enough. It is nothing the would stay imprnted on your phyche for any amount of time. Anthony Hopkins delivered a good preformance as usual, the kids in this seemed kind of wooden at times and some of the dialog seemed down right silly. ie: \\"I thought we were going to fall to our doom!\\" or \\"You can sleep on the pullout couch it is ever so comfortable.\\" I expected a little better out of William Goldman. See it if your a fan just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought back so many memories!!","review":"I loved the movie..., I always love Stephen King adaptations. I haven't actually read the novel \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" but it made me interested in it. But ya know what?! I'm not talking about the book! Anthony Hopkins was amazing, he is one of the greatest actors of our time! I loved the scenes with the children playing, it brought back so many memories of my childhood. The ending was of course a tear-jerker and not a cliche one at that. It was a very sweet and enduring movie that I will enjoy again and again. BRAVO!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence in Cinematography and Acting","review":"Mesmerizing use of cinematography as we are transported back in time to discover and evaluate important events in our lives we might have overlooked or under-appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow indeed compared to the Book.","review":"The book has been gutted to produce an easy to direct and promote screenplay. Some of the other reviewers have said that two thirds of the story are missing. I'd say more like three quarters deleted. No real special effects to muck things up.After youve read the excellent novel-- this movie's production feels like rich kids at play--on a budget. Is it horrible? No. Is it good? No. You may like this movie, of course. However, if you love this movie, it would usually be out of sentiment for it's treatment of the time period in which it takes place. A remake is already in order. Stephen King's coattails must be a great ride, all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swayed to far from the book","review":"Hearts in Atlantis was a great book unfortunately (in my opinion), the movie only rates a 'good'. Too many wonderful parts in the book are left out and as usual, someone felt the need to change a perfectly wonderful good ending! Even so, if you have not read the book, you will most probably like the movie and not know that it could have been even better than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great soundtrack, but something missing overall...","review":"Just watched this movie for the second time and remembered why I didn't add it to my list of favorite films. The movie has the potential to be great but seems to try too hard to be another \\"Shawshank Redemption\\", losing focus and glossing over parts of the film that might deserve more, while paying too much attention in other areas that don't improve the viewer's experience.The oldies-filled soundtrack is one of the best things going for the movie, offering familiar and mostly upbeat tunes, even if the placement might feel too obvious. Others have mentioned what a fantastic job the younger actors do, and Anthony Hopkins is competent here, though it has to be noted that he wasn't working with stellar material to begin with.Overall, Hearts in Atlantis offers some good scenes and music, but serious Stephen King and Anthony Hopkins fans are likely to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother if you are a fan of Stephen King","review":"This movie version of the Stephen King book falls way short. If you have never read the book, or are not a fan of Stephen King, you will probably enjoy this movie. The problem is, the movie only covers the first HALF of the book. The book is written as five separate stories that all connect in the end. Ironically, the section of the book titled \\"Hearts in Atlants\\" is NOT even featured in the movie. READ THE BOOK!!! Other then that, Anthony Hopkins does give a great performance. Blame the screenwriter for butchering the original story, even the ending of the part of the book it does feature is totally changed from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've already read the book...","review":"... this will be a very disappointing film. Only the first segment of the book is covered - Bobby Garfield and Ted Brautigan. The characters are well-portrayed - Bobby, his mother, Carol, and Anthony Hopkins as Brautigan. Hence my two-star rating. But the rest of King's fine book - Bobby's depression and descent into juvenile delinquincy, Pete Riley and Carol at college, Carol's transformation into the political radical \\"Red Carol,\\" the \\"penance\\" of \\"Blind Willie\\" Shearman, and John Sullivan's bizarre death - are all missing. We're told at the end of the film that Carol is dead. The final reunion, which so beautifully concluded the book, is also missing. Bobby never hears from Brautigan again - no rose petals. It's hard to believe that King allowed this stripped-down version to be filmed. Even the title - \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\" - is meaningless in the context of this film. I thought King cared more about his work than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This movie has all the positive things mentioned in the other reviews on this site (cinematography, acting) but I don't think it tells much of a story. There are too many elements which are never really addressed. This movie is essentially a rather dull coming of age story, except the kid's neighbor is a psychic pursued by the government. I love Stephen King, but sometimes Hollywood fails to adapt his works well, and I think that this is one of those occasions. I just thought it was a dull, mostly pointless movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Whats the point?\\"","review":"After reading the book and only being mildly entertained, I hoped for a condensed version of the entire book--rather than just the beginning saga. I did feel that the movie did a good job following the story line, until the low men were portrayed. In the book these 'men' were portrayed as evil beings from some weird parallel universe, not evil businessmen. In the book the cars they drove were glowing, monstrous variations of actual luxury cars. In the movie they were just big black cars. The portrayal of Bobby Garfields mother was not nearly as heartless in the movie as in the book. I felt that this movie was a typical flop when compared with the book. I'm sorry to say I don't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another high quality Stephen King adaption...","review":"Set in the early 1960's, Anthony Hopkins plays a mysterious elderly gentleman of unknown background with powerful psychic abilities. He rents an apartment over a house in the suburbs. Downstairs lives a single mother and her ten year old son. Anthony Hopkins develops a grandfatherly relationship with the boy, but his mother is very suspicious of him.This is the time of the cold war, and it seems that Anthony Hopkins is also hiding from government agents who have been forcing him to use his psychic powers to gather intelligence from the Russians (I assume).Very good movie. Based on a novel by Stephen King. I have yet to see a non-horror movie based on Stephen King material that was not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm... Not what you expect from Stephen King","review":"This is an interesting film. I have so stereotyped King into the horror and terror category that this was quite unexpected.Set in the days of J. Edgar Hoover and the tracking down of Communists. Anthony Hopkins is on the run from Hoover's men. It is not really explained why. But as the movie progresses you discover that he has a very powerful psychic personality and that has something to do with it.The little boy does a wonderful job. I am not sure if they got any awards for this film, but they should have at least gotten some high level recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Hopkins at his best","review":"This film needs watching more than once. The theme is beautifully developed and Anthony Hopkins and Anton Yelchin interact seamlessly.Scott Hicks does a masterful job of creating the 60's mood with lighting, music and action.This is Stephen King at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster effort","review":"I love Anthony Hopkins, but this movie just did not move me. I watched and watched, fully expecting the plot and characters to become more gripping, but it just never materialized. This very well may be the weakest film I've seen with Sir Tony. The plot manipulations are rampant and sentimentalism the norm in this formulaic effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Butchering of a Stephen King novel","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie, as I usually am with those adapted from Stephen King novels. I read the book first (big mistake if you want to enjoy the movie), and found myself utterly let down by the re-writing of the story. I was really hoping to see the plot on the big screen, and instead I saw someone else's misguided attempt to play down the intensity of a profound topic: war. This movie should never have been made if the writers/directors did not intend to stick with Stephen King's exact writings, with exceptions made for time constraints. Frankly, they didn't even scratch the surface, and the changes they made were appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read the book..... DON\\"T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!","review":"This has to be the lamest movie I've ever seen. Having read the book and loved every page, I can say that this is NOTHING like the book. They leave out everything important. The portrayal of the \\"low men\\" is probably the biggest let down of the movie. The book was way too long and in-depth to ever become a movie, anyway. Why they thought they could pull off the switch is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearts In Atlantis was a pleasant surprise!","review":"Every now and then a story will come along that you place no expectations on but will leave you pleasantly surprised, Hearts In Atlantis was that kind of movie. I'll admit here that I'm not a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins and I still find it hard not to think of him as Hannibal Lecter from Silence Of The Lambs, but Hopkin's role as Ted Braughtigan was truly memorable and a huge testament to his acting ability. The line \\"sometimes when you're young, you have moments of such happiness, you think you're living in someplace magical, like Atlantis must have been... then we grow up and our hearts break in two\\" will stay with me for a long time. No doubt I will end up buying the book by Stephen King on which the movie was based. This is indeed a coming of age story rich with an element of supernatural suspense that I will enjoy watching again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done emotional tug","review":"Hearts in Atlantis is a well done, clean, emotional movie. It's comforting reminder of our childhood, confusion, and reaching personal triumphs left me very satisfied. The tension in this film comes to a nice point prior to releasing the audience . Casting is excelent. Directoral direction was well defined without superfluous scenes. Hollywood can make real movies about life without tired action and sex - and Hearts in Atlantis is the proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie","review":"I found the easy pace relaxing and the story interesting without being threatening. In fact, for what has happened to our world lately, this movie smoothed away some layers of stress for me. All the smoking was not fun for this \\"quitter of a year and a half\\" but I know they all smoked in the early 60's. Although I gave it 4 Stars- the big screen and sound are not that important for this film so you could wait to see it at home.Think- Cider House Rules but not quite that high in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was robbed","review":"I gave this a one star for one reason. I was not able to select zero stars. I WAS ROBBED. I bought this DVD elsewhere, also I bought it because Anthony Hopkins was in it. A gentleman whose work I admire. More importantly I bought this DVD AFTER I read the book. I am angry and disgusted for having wasted the money buying this trash. They took 75 percent of Mr. Kings fine novel and threw it away. This movie is only a brief portion of the book. Of the portion that was portrayed there was so much missing. I was so disgusted with the movie that I threw away the DVD. There was a tremendous amount of the story that was simply disregarded. I was as disgusted with this movie as I was with the movie version of IT.

I think that Mr Bell's brain must have been replaced with composting pig manure when he wrote it. If your garden is the size of a flower pot and you live in an ideal environment then you only spend 60 minutes a week on the whole thing. But I live in the real world where I spent more than 60 minutes one week alone diagnosing a fungus on my tomato plants. This book doesn't even cover important topics such as that. This book is crap the one thing it is good for is shredded compost."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears are bleeding, make it stop!","review":"If I could rate this any lower I would... the singing is horrid, it sounds like a bad night of karaoke...

Save your ears and mind's by getting Michael Crawford, or... anyone... but these people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's GREAT!!","review":"In contrast to the other reviews for this CD, it is one of Webber's best. Many people think Music of the Night on this CD is bad but it's the best one I've heard!! I am currently trying to find his name, but with no success. The music (especially the drums) are different from Michael Crawford, but the first one to sing the song isn't always the best!!! This guy sang it with some energy.

I read it last year, but I remember how much I enjoyed it. You will learn so much about their lives and about the times they lived in. You will also learn about a woman named Grace Dalrymple Elliot. She was a courtesan who kept a journal. You can look that up yourself. This kind of book opens up the imagination and leads you on and on to the next interesting book. But be warned. As the author states, some biographies were written by people in their inter circles who didn't like them.

Spurred me to want to read more about some rulers who I had never had an interest in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"As a history buff, I found myself humbled by my lack of knowledge regarding these historical characters' often loathsome actions. I enjoy English history and found Farquhar's discussion of Henry VIII and his six wives the highlight of the book.I highly recommend this book--it does not intimidate and, more importantly, bore the reader. The writing style is sharp and funny and is a welcome relief from the often times dry history books readers endure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"This is a really entertaining, and educational to some extent, read not only for those who love history but those who nodded off in class back in high school, too. Farquhar peppers the stories with lots of humor. Very enjoyable!

I keep this book in my car when I have a spare moment between appointments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulously entertaining","review":"This is a great voyeuristic read! Well-written, well-researched and impossible to put down.I was so excited to see that he had released a new book on American Scandals and I am ordering it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious AND educational!","review":"A terrific, really well-written book which shows us that scandal is NOT exclusive to the present-day. It's great fun to read about the atrocious goings-on by various royals and popes--but this is also one of those books where you learn a great deal in a fun, painless way. I wish all history were written like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tid Bits of History","review":"I love history but I didn't want to read a 600 page novel that read like a textbook. This book is perfect. Fun, and straight to the point. I learned about all the dirty details of some of history's famous characters that my teachers and professors never bothered to mention. History + sex + murder= good time. The book educates you and entertains."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"As an avid European history buff, I enjoy reading about the \\"nasty little secrets\\" that weave in & out of history. This book certainly lived up to my expectation and more. I found it as a CD book in my local library and thoroughly enjoyed having it read to me. I had to buy the book. If you are at all familiar with European royalty in the 16th thru 20th (yes 20th! remember Edward the 8th and Wallis Simpson?) centuries then you will enjoy this book. I discovered that even though I was aware of the scandals covering about 3/4ths of this book, it was genuinely enjoyable to listen and then read about them in such a light and comical style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"This book covers its subject matter clearly and with humor. Not a dry book of historical dates and battlefields, but a book that deals with some quite famous and interesting personalities of history and some of the things they did.It's quite amusing to read about priviledged folks of history and their quirks and picadillos. They may have been 'royal', but many had the morals of an alley cat and the compassion of a viper.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such is the stuff people in power are made of.","review":"It should be no secret by now how the rich and powerful abuse their stations in life. I already knew some of the content and found the tidbits I didn't know entertaining. I don't think in our era of available news and media that there could be much that I would find shocking. However, this book is not for the prudish or faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable","review":"This book was obviously written more for entertainment and shock value than historical accuracy. While a fair majority of the tales are well-written, the incorrect information is keeping me from enjoying the book. The relationships between royals in particular are exaggerated and described in a very one-dimensional manner. Not sure if it was worth the amount I paid for it. Eleanor Herman was a much better investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbound!!!","review":"I usually read fiction but I'm so glad that I made an exception with this one. Informitaive, captivating, and completely engrossing was this book! The true stories included in this book will fascinate readers of any age, gender, or literary preference.I was so completely taken with this work that I read it in one sitting. I then shared it with my friend who read it just as quickly. I was so blown away that I purchased a second book by this same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and salacious","review":"If you enjoy a bit of history with a bit of smut, this may well be the book for you. No story is covered with great depth but there is a nice trip across time to see how the more famous have misbehaved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected Little, Got Quite a Bit","review":"Let me suggest that prospective readers take at least some of the more censorious reviews with a grain of salt. This book was obviously conceived, written, and published as a \\"fun\\" read. Given that, it perhaps goes without saying that anyone even moderately widely read in history will find little or nothing new here. On the other hand, \\"serious\\" histories often gloss over the more titillating aspects of the subjects and events they address, and Farquhar concentrates on nothing else. And he does a heck of a good job of it. The one gripe I have is with the organization of the mini-chapters: there doesn't seem to be any. The individual sections are brief enough that this back-and-forth doesn't cause any confusion; just annoyance. Having said that, it's a good read and a great gift for a broad-minded friend you've been trying to introduce to history reading: who knew it could be such fun?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best royal scandal stories all in 1 book, who could ask for more??","review":"I love history, always have, always will. I've always had a huge interest in Europe's royalty both ancient and contemporary. This book tells of all the naughty and odd behaviors of some of the most famous leaders in history and squeezes it into this witty, well researched masterpiece. I've always enjoyed learning what they don't put in history textbooks, and this has definitely quenched my thirst for that. I have a strong backround when it comes to these topics, but it can appeal to anyone even if they don't know who Henry VIII was. I'd give it 10 stars if it were an option!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun","review":"If you're a history buff, true-crime nut or \\"regi-phile,\\" this book is a must-have. If you're all three (like me), it's a jackpot! You've heard (most of) these stories before, but never told like this. Farquhar's sometimes biting wit will have you grinning everytime you pick this book up. Fun, easy, informative - what a great summer read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as I'd hoped","review":"The cover picture is a bit misleading, this book isn't really very funny. If you don't know anything about European history, you may find it interesting, but if you do know anything about the sujbect, there isn't lilkely to be much in here to surprise you. Mr. Farquhar has strong prejudices, he doesn't like Queen Victoria, who he refers to as a 'sourpuss' (she wasn't) and prefers her lecherous son Edward VII. He tells us that George I was a 'distant' relative of the Stuarts (actually he had as much Stuart blood in him as the Pretenders, which is to say not very much). The book is divided up rather strangely, anecdotes about various monarchs are scattered through the book, so there are bits of Elizabeth I in one part, more bits in another part etc. Will Cuppy did this sort of thing so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to start your journey....and with humor","review":"This book is a good work for someone who is starting to read about royal scandals because the author explains with good humor and good narrative some of the mayor scandals in the history of royalty.I spceially like the section about popes and all the things some of them did.Good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"This book was one of the most amusing and shocking of all those I have read on the royals. Our world's royals were very odd people! Very funny and very interesting. This book makes you want to continue to find out more about what some of our royals were really up to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Royally a delight","review":"I read this book for a history book review. I found it entertaining, yet informing. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes to read interesting books that aren't about everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"While the book does give factual information, it is extremely biased (the author calls one of the characters a \\"nincompoop\\"). He constantly refers to the previous chapters and everything he writes is extremely repetitive. This book is not for historians looking for an interesting and unbiased read; rather than being historical, it seems to come from the pages of a gossip column. Save your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing..","review":"I was excited about this book when I first came across it, but as I read into it, I was very disappointed. Not only is the author's writing style a little elementary, with several cliché and phrasing that made me cringe, but also much of his information is hearsay and assumption. I suspected as much as I read through the novel and my suspicions were confirmed as I read over passages that I knew to be factually incorrect(eg, the assesment of Marie Theresa's marriage). It seems that the author has attempted to make this subject appeal to a soap opera type audience and it simply isn't historical. For a work of fiction, it is mildly entertaining, although, as mentioned, poorly written. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth","review":"A flat narration of some historical events. A surprisingly boring read for such a juicy subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too dumbed down, even for fun history reading.","review":"True, I did want a fun historical read, a sampling of royal and papal blackguards, but Farquhar's book is clogged up with cliched prose. It is just not skillfully written or edited. He takes the old historical chestnuts and does little with them but paraphrase such works as Suetonius, etc. I'm surprised at the Penguin imprint--I expected far better. This work is so light, it is often juvenile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this as I love history and a book of royal scandals sounded interesting. Unfortunately, Farquhar writes about the scandals that are too well-known and have been thoroughly covered for hundreds of years (did you know that Henry VIII had 6 wives and had 2 of them beheaded?? Egads!). It would have been great if Farquhar could have chronicled more interesting, unknown facts about these famous scandals, or even dug up scandals that haven't been covered a million times (there are no shortages of those), but if you know anything about history, you will learn nothing more from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time","review":"A waste of money at any price.Flat and uninteresting.Farquhar has no sense of humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Unfortunately the author demonstrated the intellectual rigour of a man who has found himself writing for the children's section of the Washington Post - not that that is not a perfectly acceptable journalistic endeavour. My children enjoyed him in the past so I thought it might be worth my time and money to give his adult fare a go. However I was terribly disappointed. Perhaps he should write for a Hollywood scandal sheet or tabloid and not endeavor to pen anything that might be mistaken for documented nonfiction. Very little effort to validate his tales taken with his emphasis on a snappy quick read should have confined him to writing for magazines in serial form. Sorry I gave it much consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly not dirty enough.","review":"We all know European monarchs and royals were bunch of perverts. So, as an astute student of dishing the dirt on historical figure, I picked up this book. I was ready for some sick stuff that would make Monica Lewinski's dress look sanitary.I was wrong. This book is too nice. Stories were filtered and all you get is a glimpse of those sick people and their dirty deeds.Not worth your time and money. Move on to the next one on your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Written With Flair","review":"This is a wonderful book that spans the history of European monarchy, from the Roman emperors to the first half of the twentieth century. Farquhar has a real feel for the telling anecdote, and this treasury is filled with them. I was amused, entertained, and enlightened throughout. I can't wait to read his book on Great American Scandals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HISTORICAL ENTERTAINMENT","review":"I found this book to be very entertaining, sometimes even jaw dropping. The author, Mr Farquhar, has a deliteful wit when it comes to the comments in the book. His comments mostly aim at those with a sense of humor. I think that this book would be a delite for those that have already read all the more detailed and descriptive accounts of the royals and need a break from the norm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TREASURY INDEED!","review":"This is a terrific, well-researched book that left me laughing and learning at the same time. I highly recommend it, especially to those who were turned off by their American history classes growing up.

You move this stupid jumper to the song you want. I mean come on. Did this company ever here about posh buttons? I am so upset with this awful product. It should get recalled. The reason i am so upset is that i wanted an easy to use wireless musical door bell with a lot of songs. This is not that. I am very unhappy. I will never by this thing ever ever ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Door Chime","review":"Pleased thus far with this musical door chime!! I did take away one star because it is a bit tedious to change the tunes. I had to use a pair of tweezers to change the tune selection. There is a tab that fits down over the tune selection pins and you have to look at the list of tunes printed on the cover and then count the number of pins that coincide with the tune selection. Volume is great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heath Musical Wireless Musical Chime","review":"I was 110% pleased with the Heath Musical Doorbell Chime. Very easy to operate and can be heard throughout my home much better than the traditionally installed chime I currently have. I also like the fact that it is mobile and I can take it with me in the event that I move. I highly recommend it. Fun to change the tunes according to holidays or your mood of the day. For ease of changing tunes often, just set it out of sight on top of something high like I did instead of actually installing it on the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - never worked, put new batteries etc.","review":"I bought this about six months ago. It never worked properly. I changed the batteries in the main unit as well as in the bell but this POS never worked for me. I have the main unit within ten feet of the door. It rings once every ten times the button is pushed as installed. It skips the chime even when the units are right next to each other. What a piece of garbage!UPDATED - I got a replacement after i wrote to HeathCo. The replacement worked well but in cold weather the performance is suspect. Doesn't work always. Stay away and spend more if you want reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor range of operation","review":"Even though the manual claims upto 100 feet range, it doesn't work at even 15 feet!. My previous unit made by Desa (that company has the same address as Heath Zenith)was amazingly powerful. It easily went thru four walls. I don't need 64 chimes, just one I can hear 20 feet away. Don't buy this unless you need a very short range of operation. I give this unit only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rin Tin Tinny","review":"Not recommending this product. Very tinny sounding considering it has a decent sized speaker in it. Very hard to get both the main unit and the doorbell apart. 3 D cells make it weigh a ton. Song selection controls are very antiquated for this day and age. 16 embedded DIP jumpers and a slide switch. Still the unit does work and plays songs but is hardly what you want in your $240,000 home. My old fashioned wired ding-dong chime sounded better! loud even at the lowest setting. Have not had a chance to get it all setup yet. Will add more if I change my mind about it. On the plus side has a 5 year warranty - won't do me much good since I bought it on the Bay.Blessings,John 20:29Update... 6 months down the road and the doorbell stopped working. Guess the batteries are dead in the doorbell transmitter and I placed fresh ones in it initially. What a let down. Good for nothing!Need a good wireless doorbell look to other then Heath/Zenith... Or stick with your wired one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No range, doesn't work through walls","review":"I purchased this because our townhome is situated where our back patio faces the parking so when deliveries come they always go to our back door. The gate to our patio is about 8 feet from the back doors.I initially wanted to place the doorbell near our front doorbell which is mounted in our stairwell between the first and second floors so we could hear it from both up and downstairs. This placement was about 20 feet from the button and the signal would need to pass through our sliding glass door and one wall. It wouldn't work.Second we moved it all the way upstairs to the hallway where it would be closer to the button and the signal would only have to travel through one wall. Still nothing.Finally we put it on the windowsill of the Master Bedroom overlooking the button and it worked. Only now, we can't hear it if we are downstairs. So we ended up putting in on the downstairs windowsill 8 ft from the button and it works.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heath wireless door bell","review":"Installed this on my house I purchased about a year ago, the previous owner took the original door bell.

I am a 1995 Graduate of UConn. I was at the school for a chunk of this miraculous decade. And I have never felt more proud of that school or that amazing basketball team than I do after reading this book. Jim Calhoun is funny, strong, tender and candid in this book. A man whom we don't often get an insight to (other than reading a few four letter words on his lips from the sidelines) opens his heart and soul to us in this book. He shares the moments that tore him down, and the moments that made him realize he has the best job in the world. He is an inspiration. A leader. A great coach. And, a champion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Huskies, Hate the Book...","review":"The other readers must have read this right after the Huskies won the championship--the fact that it was such an intoxicating moment for UCONN lovers must have hurt their judgement. I for one *LOVE* UCONN, yet this book reads like a rough draft. Calhoun also reveals little about the season that a devote UCONN fan wouldn't already know. I reccomend \\"Huskie-Mania\\" by Jim Shea for Huskie fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Treason","review":"Finally the truth,as close as we'll get, to the conspiracy behind thd JFK murder. It is well documented and a great reference to dedicated reseachers from previous works such as David Lifton's \\"Best Evidence\\".MIKE WILKERSON"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Combines important new material with an excellent overview of the major evidence for conspiracy. Full of photos and exhibits supporting his claims, including several frames of the Z film. Decide for yourself whether his claims about the film are correct. The frame in which Conally raises his right hand while holding his white hat is especially good, its something I never noticed seeing the film on television. Even if Twyman is wrong about the Z film being altered, this is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questionable conclusions but undeniable information...","review":"The fascinating aspects of Noel Twyman's work lie not in his conclusions. His conclusions are, in fact, quite questionable. But the meticulous investigative approach he uses, and the myriad of information revealed is what makes this book worth its weight. He works backwards from the murder, outlining what needed to happen in order for the assassination to occur as it did, then working on what forces had the means/motive/opportunity to achieve each, and whitling down his list of suspects from there. It's an incredibly objective and revealing account of a great many things. I have told people before about how Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" is worth watching not because of what he thinks happened, but for all the information that is revealed along the way. This book mirrors that opinion and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"HONEST APROACH","review":"The writer made a honest approach to the case, trying to be neutral and lucid all the way. The only flaw, in my humble opinion, is his emphasis in the forgey of the Zapruder film. I don't buy it. Anyway, even without taking that in consideration, there are a lot of evidence leading to conspiracy. Please, take a look at one photo showing Kennedy in a public speaking moments before the murder. Watch the way Lyndon Johnson is staring at him. THis will say more than a thousand facts...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal read","review":"As an avid reader / consumer of JFK assassination literature my curiosity was piqued after reading the reviews of Bloody Treason - Noel Twyman's book on Amazon. I decided to 'splurge' on a hardcopy of the book after one reviewer commented that Noel's book was the most comprehensive read on the subject....I was not disappointed - so much so I decided that i couldn't wait to get back from holiday to keep reading the book and bought it again on Kindle.Buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE WAS CONSPIRACY !","review":"And this is made clear in this outstanding book, easy to understand and clear. Of course Twyman can't say who pulled the trigger (s). But he gave a very good idea of who ordered it, who covered it. There was conspiracy! OTherwise, Oswald would not have been killed in the midst of dozen policemen !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review #2","review":"I reviewed this book (it appears no one has since) and admittedly was very colorful about initially being duped about LHO acting alone and how Mr. Twyman made it very clear that there was, in fact, a huge conspiracy. Well, good people, I DID get on the wrong bus. I got on the one that made me think anyone other than LHO killed JFK. I have since made a 360 degree turn, am compelled to retract my previous review, and feel that I at least owe you this information in case you want to purchase this book based in part on my previous review (someone found it useful). I still believe the book is easy to read and is well written, but it has found it's way to the bottom of my bookshelf. By the way...out of respect for Mr. Twyman in this review, I will not name the source of my revelation, but will tell you that the author's initials are \\"GP\\".

Hell, it's true that music is the soundtrack of our lives!His dvd is definitely 2 hours of fun that every R. Kelly fan should own. The only downside is the missing dance sequence.

In fact, I like it alot. More then likely this record may find a way into my top ten records of 2002 at the end of the year.The music on this record is more honest, more sincere and just more melodic this time around. The guitars are thicker and heavier this time around. The drums are pretty much the same as the drums that were on \\"The Opposite of December\\".

I couldn't beleive what I was listening to at first. None of these tracks did anything for me, they simply don't have the impact of their older stuff. Most of this sounds like Wil Haven crossed with Deftones. This would be easier for me to accept if the songs were great, but there is nothing on here that even comes close to 'Sliced Paper Wrists' or 'Nerdy'. I am gutted about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mockery of hardcore","review":"this album disgusts me, especially coming from the hardcore greats they are in opposite of december. what a letdown. i see no place in hardcore for winy emo, i think il just stick to true greats like burnt by the sun, zao, and the dillinger escape plan. absoluetely awful, dont even waste your time downloading songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Sad Actually","review":"I'm a fan of a lot of music but this album can only be described as music very loosely. I am a little old for teen trends and to be honest didn't understand trends when I was a teen. But, I do remember when a guitar sounded like a guitar and didn't sound like a car engine or a boiler. I also remember when lead singers, you know, sang. This is just noise. I bought the album thinking it was a new album by a band I am a fan of. Lets just say the sticker covered \\"The Wheel\\" up. Just very obnoxious noise, I feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"''intoxicate me with all your voices''","review":"a good release by ptw. but, nowhere near as good as opposite of december. on the other hand, it's nowhere near as bad as the new cd. pick up this one after you've heard opposite of december. standout tracks: rings from corona, turn down elliot, and parks and what you meant to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new kings of bi polar hardcore","review":"With beautifully brutal guitar riffs and drumming that is faster then an adrenaline rush, Tear from the Red is one of the greatest album of the hardcore genre.

Although it took me on the third time through listening, \\"Tear From the Red\\" is such a great album. They picked up some more melody but kept their hard touch. I will admit it took some time for me to get into it fully, but now that I have it's stayong on repeat. My personal favorites are \\"Lazarro\\" and \\"Sticks and Stones Never Made Sense.\\" There isn't much else to say. It's just good, so buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly ridiculous","review":"I, like many others, was a big fan of \\"Opposite of December.\\" It was a very solid release. Having said that...this album is mediocre at best. It seems as though any time that a hardcore band begins to incorporate melody into their music, they are immediately praised as visionaries. To be honest, most of this album reminds me of Incubus combined with a group of monkeys screaming randomly. Yes, it really is that bad. So many bands blend melody and hardcore music well. Poison the Well is not one of those. I do respect the hardcore PTW fans who stand up and defend this album and the band's right to be different. Unfortunately, different does NOT always mean good. You can do much, much better than this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is good, if you like anything BUT Poison The Well","review":"Do Not Get this album. This is NOT Poison the Well. The band has become slower and the songs simpler. I LOVE the old Poison the Well stuff because of Jeff's vocals. In this album, the vocals aren't good. I found that the tempo of this album was really slow. All the songs sound the same. There are only two good songs, the first and the last. There is even a \\"Dashboard Confessional\\"-wannabe song with Jeff and an acoustic guitar. When I purchase a Poison the Well album, I want Poison the Well. I do not want some cheap over-produced album where all the songs sound the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"high school music","review":"like old times being back in my senior year in 83 and i really love this old school music brings me back to high school, i really love y &t"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meniketti is the man!","review":"Great best of from a legendary hard rock band! I just picked this up because I only have \\"Contagious\\" and \\"Ten\\" their late 80's early 90's output. I'm glad to see their old classic albums like \\"Black Tiger\\" have been re-mastered but they are not cheap so this is a good place to start.Stand out tracks on this for me are 'Meanstreak', 'Black Tiger', 'Midnight In Tokyo' & 'Lipstick and Leather' great riffs, solos & lyrics. Dave Meniketti is a great songwriter and rocker! Definately 5 starts bacuase of the quality of material...the only downside tho for me is it dosent have that modern re-mastered sound which you can get with their new best of cd but I didn't purchase that one because it don't have 'Lipstick and Leather' on it.

Unfortunately to allow it to fold has compromised it's integrity for items over 50 lbs. It's rated for 150, but I'm sure it will break if I try that.I attempted to move an apartment sized oven, which is about 50-60 lbs, and it creaked when I tried to lean the oven back. It rested very unstably on the cart. I was afraid of breaking the cart and dropping the oven, I ended up just carrying the oven by hand (it was that light).Get it if you only want to move small items, maybe a few boxes of paper or something.

It folds up into almost nothing. However, the lip needs to be longer, and the wheel housings need to be made of metal. I had mine for one day before it broke, carrying a couple boxes.

Would love to buy it again if they can fix these major flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is AWESOME - buy one","review":"I bought this hand truck for our office. More specifically for use by sales and marketing when dragging stuff to various vendor events. When folded up the cart is very slim, super light, and easy to store.

Best $30 I think I've ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further, this is the one you want!","review":"I realize there are already many reviews for this, but I felt I should add mine as well. This is an AWESOME hand truck. I love how compact it is. I remember seeing it folded up when it arrived wondering how something so well compacted would expand into a sturdy hand truck. But wow, it easily expanded into its full size and is the perfect size for moving things around. We are in the middle of moving and this is perfect for lugging a couple boxes from one room to another. We have Ozarka water delivered to our home as well and found this is PERFECT for grabbing those water jugs and transporting them inside. When you are done using it, you can simply fold it up and store it. It doesn't feel flimsy, like I expected it to, and I love the foothold, which makes it easier to start your lifting. This was inexpensive. For something this excellent, I would have paid twice as much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Made Small Hand Truck","review":"I almost didn't bother to write this review since so many others have noted this item's qualities. Personal or medium sized is likely a better description of its size & handling capacity than small. This product is very nicely designed and constructed of stout materials. It has easily dealt with the load demands we've used it to transport. Cases of beverages, large bags of pet food or groceries are a snap to get from the car into our house now with the Magna Cart. Now we get it done in one trip instead of 2 or 3.Anyone that has the need to move items weighing less than 150 lbs. from point A to point B can do it with ease at a quite modest price.

There are critical parts that are load bearing which are made of plastic. The cart lasted for three photo shoots. The design is OK and it is a decent quality but light duty item.

My husband (6' tall) and I (5'3\\") were both able to maneuver the cart without any problems. It does handle better when stacked higher, and we did not strap the boxes to the cart. I couldn't lift it up some steps, however that was more likely due to the weight and not strapping down the boxes rather than the cart's ability.Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Set of Wheels!","review":"My reason for buying this product was to help me manage all of my quilting supplies for the Quilt Camp I was going to.

I haven't had problems with balancing the loads as other people have mentioned in some reviews.

Love the portability of it. It folds very easily and fits anywhere. It rolls nice and smooth. Good for a lighter load. It is a little flimsy and hard to tilt back to roll when you get up towards 100 pounds or more. It has a 150 pound limit. If you are going to push the limit I would go for a 200 pound cart or more.

Both have the same problem - one of the wheel gets stuck and you can't unfold it. When you do it's crooked and there's nothing you can do about it. It wouldn't unfold on it's own either - you have to flip it out and hold it as you open the whole thing.I am also tall (6'5) and the handle is short for me.I've had these for about 18 months now and use them on daily basis.

I just received one of these for work and subsequently bought one for home. I'd been wanting a hand cart at home, but most of them take up a lot of space. This one folds up so flat and small, I can tuck it pretty much anywhere. At work, I have to carry heavy patent files around sometimes (sometimes a few files) and that is too much for a little person to do. I also need to bring 40 pound bags of cat litter from the car to my condo (I don't have to carry the litter 100 feet from my car to the stairs), or lug a palm tree back outside to the balcony in spring. It really helps take the burden off my neck, back, shoulders, and arms. It collapses down to about the size of a large picture book. I usually keep it the trunk of my car for the litter.

About $27 at Menards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magna Cart Hand Truck","review":"This is a good looking product, sturdy and well designed. It can easily handle the advertised weight. The cargo platform itself is pretty short, so the cart cannot be tilted back easily without simultaneously holding the cargo; buy straps if you decide on this model. The only other observation is that if you're tall, you will probably be better off with something else. I'm 6'1\\" and have to bend over a little more than is comfortable to keep the cart on balance.

It might not be long enough if you're really tall though. Very quick and easy to fold and open: just pull from the red bar and voila! there it is, ready to roll!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not going to work for heavy loads","review":"I got this cart as a gift and broke it on it's first day of use. I made sure that I never loaded more than about 100 lbs on it (it's rated for 150 lbs). The problem is not how much you can push with it, but getting it to tilt back with a heavy load without bending the rods in the back (which are very cheap and thin). Once the back is bent it will no longer collapse down. The back is also not very high, which means for a heavy load you have to tilt it back very far and lean down as you walk.I did appreciate the maneuverability of the wheels and how small it collapsed down. I think that if you are looking for something to use every once in a while to move small things, the Magna Cart will work fine, but if you want something that you can use on a regular basis for loads of more than 50 lbs, this will break in no time flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Travel Companion for busy Moms!","review":"This great cart fits snugly under the seat of my minivan... and although originally purchased for lugging 'supplies'(and tent canopy) to kids soccer games, it has come in quite handy on several occasions when bulky or heavy items needed to be carried from one place or another.

I think $30 - $35 is a great value. I did see a cheaper model at Big Lots but seems like it did not have an adjustable handle. Will probably use this to move heavier things around the house when the time comes.Lessons learned:*You'll need bungee cords to keep the boxes or items from shifting*The handle doesn't always stay put when you push it in. Don't let a child play with it! My daughter was checking it out right after I opened the box, and the handle popped out without pushing the red release bar, and the bottom smashed to the floor right onto her toes. It wasn't bad but could have been worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gig Gear","review":"Its a highly compact hand truck that lets me take my guitar( In a hard case) and 15 watt amp and BOSS GT -5 Processor all in one shot .. If you have a bigger amp you might need two hand trucks ( which would still be cheaper and would take up less space compared to any the carts being sold in guitar center or musicians friend ). Even though the guitar case is taller than the cart - the recessed handle ensures that handling is breeze. Make sure you buy Bungee cords ( 2 or 3) - the truck does not ship with one.Bottom Line .. If you are musician looking for a hand truck to lug your gear --> GO FOR IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for moving boxes and things","review":"I bought this hand truck for moving small things, like stacks of boxes, and it works great. I also like the fold up feature, as I live in a small place and I don't want it to take up too much room. I like how the wheels fold flat, or pop out, when you lower the front of the hand truck. It is very well made, and sturdy, I'm sure it could hold much more than I use it for. The only thing I wish it had were some attached straps for securing things, but I got some bungee cords at the dollar store that work well for it. In addition to using it for moving boxes, I've even used it to bring in groceries from the parking lot to my apartment.

The one drawback is if you want to secure your load with a bungee or strap, the flat bottom makes it awkward to attach. The best fit is to attach at the bottom of the handle, go under the whole flat tray, and up and around -- but then it won't sit quite flat. That's not a big deal as it's only a minor tilt or bump on the ground. There aren't great attaching places for a strap, either. It might not be necessary to have straps on your load, as the tray is pretty good size and the wheels are fairly large and have a good distance, but if you're travelling over rough areas and you want the security of straps, then it's something to consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little cart!","review":"I bought the Magna Cart for my 87 year old mother for Christmas. She's a very young 87 and lives alone in her own home.

I thought maybe a hand truck would work but on a smaller scale. Then I found the Magna cart! It is pretty sturdy and it's easy to open just by squeezing the handles together and pulling and then folds flat again for storage. What an excellent product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking and well made cart","review":"This cart is nice looking and is well made, good materials. I would like this product to be a litle lighter and it feels a litle loose."},{"rating":"2","title":"MagnaCart Magnificent","review":"This cart is just great...it collapses to a small package...but, when opened, can shlep a bulky, heavy item"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"At first use of the MagnaCart the folding mechanism stuck in the open position. On the second use of the MagnaCart the handle separated from the frame causing the 20 lb. load to tumble down the stairs. This cart is a WORTHLESS. I could not be more displeased."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR TRAVELING AND TRADE SHOWS","review":"I love this little hand cart because it is lightweight, yet durable enough to handle the stuff that I need for outdoor tradeshow or festival events. It is very handy to have when you have to lug around stuff to set up. It is also very unassuming and takes up little space. I highly recommend this cart for those that need that type of light support when traveling with business presentation stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WHAT WE NEEDED!","review":"This personal hand truck is exactly what my husband and I needed. We're both in our mid-70's and while we're not decrepit, we are now able to move heavy items around much easier, both outside the house and inside. The hand truck is lightweight, the handle telescopes in and out very easily and, as advertised, holds holds up to 150 pounds. An excellent item at an excellent price! I can always find what I want/need at Amazon.com. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I took my little Magna Cart to an art show recently where I had a serious \\"load in\\" and \\"load out\\" situation.

Sturdy and well-made. I bought it because I liked my daughter's. She has had it for some time and it has held up very well. The foot part could be a few inches deeper, but a bungy cord takes care of holding a wider item in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Great value for such a little truck, and incredibly portable.I purchased this for one end - to move my small wine fridge in my basement. It's full of about 50 bottles of wine and I didn't want to go emptying it out to relocate it.Worked great, collapses very small, extends well, and was surprisingly sturdy, which was my fear, that it would be a little flimsy. But it wasn't.One of the other reviewers mentioned the placement of the wheels, which I agree with wholeheartedly, that they're set too far back and so there's no good feel for picking up and lowering the load - rather than being balanced you're putting a lot of effort into picking up and lowering the load smoothly... But even with that caveat, it works very well especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little hand cart","review":"Nice design; seems sturdy. My only complaint - and maybe I should have figured this out from the picture - but the toe plate which they describe as 11x15 actually only has 9 inches usable space forward of the vertical handle. I really needed 10 inches so have had to modify it to my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SHORT and WHEELS TOO FAR BACK....!","review":"This hand truck is way TOO SHORT and the wheels are TOO FAR BACK that it causes this hand truck to try and UP-RIGHT itself while pushing it... You have to use too much energy trying to keep the hand truck TILTED BACK, so it really doesn't make the job much easier.If they make this hand truck about a FOOT taller to compensate for the WHEEL placement, or move the wheels forward, that would make BALANCING your load much better so not to have to FIGHT with this hand truck to keep it TILTED BACK while pushing.. Btw, I'm UNDER 6 feet tall ( 5'9 ), so my saying that it needs to be taller is NOT so to match my \\"TALL\\" height.This hand truck is simply poorly designed and doesn't allow a person to BALANCE the WEIGHT unless you BEND OVER while you are pushing it.I would NOT recommend this product, it's NOT worth the money!,, and I'm usually NOT this critical of the items I purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand cart works lile a charm!","review":"I bought this for my wife to carry her guitar amp and music.

Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing cart for the money but wish the handle was longer","review":"i took this cart with me on deployment to the middle east in 2007. i folded it right up and placed it in my military baggage. the look on people's faces was priceless while they struggled to handle the multiple gear bags weighing hundreds of pounds and i just pulled this thing out, loaded up my bags and walked away. i well exceeded the 150lb capacity and rolled it successfully over varying terrain. by the time i got back to the states the frame had slightly bent from pushing it beyond its design limits but it never failed and is still in use today.one thing to note is there are no built in cargo straps so the purchase of some good bungee cords may be in order for your application.my only complaint at all is that i wish the handle was longer (only 39 inches). i find i have to walk hunched over in order to tip the cart back as far as it needs to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cart!","review":"The Magna Cart Personal Hand Truck works very well for me. I haul boxes of paper and books and electronic equipment for my job. The wheels and the wide base or \\"floor\\" allow me to go over bumpy sidewalks, streets, or parking lots without tipping over, which was a problem I had with other carts. Folding up and unfolding this cart is extremely easy. You do not need a great deal of hand or arm strength. If you have physical limitations regarding bending, you can use your foot/toe to easily press the \\"floor\\" of the cart down to load or to press it into the flat mode for storing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Solid Personal Hand Truck","review":"I purchased this cart after looking at several. It is sturdy, and can handle 150 lbs. I use it mostly for transporting 40 lb. bags of wood pellets for our pellet stove. I like the ground-level platform that means I don't have to lift items up onto the cart. Slightly larger wheels would make it easier to roll up stairs, but that may be incompatible with the folding wheel feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is an engenious product.

I bought four more because everytime a friend or relative saw it, they asked if I could get one for them.It is a well made product at a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It breaks very quickly","review":"We had three of these handtrucks at my work. All three broke within three months.There are two main problems, the first is the telescoping handle. This part broke on all three trucks. The second problem is the light duty linkage on the flip down tray. After about 1 week of using the product it is clear that this product is not meant to be used. The force that is needed to push the tray down is incredible.So for me, if I bought another of these I would expect it to last 3 to 6 weeks, then it would be broken and in need of replacement. I do not think that this product is worth buying, I know my purchase was a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"One sweet little cart","review":"My Magna Cart arrived quickly via USPS. When I unpacked it, I was surprised at how sturdy it looks and yet also is very compact. From the cast aluminum foot to the auto extension of the wheels, everything seems to be made of highest quality. It's a well-designed hand truck that's more heavy duty than I expected. I know I'll enjoy using it. It's better than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and works well","review":"I keep this hand truck in the back of my car for all kinds of uses. I had originally gotten it for my job, which constantly had me transporting equipment between locations. After using this for awhile now, I've found that it helps with everything from bringing groceries into my house to carrying laundry to the washer.Not only does it save trips, but it reduces strain that I might have put on my back and knees.If I were to purchase another hand truck, I might look into finding one that's a bit taller. I am 5'10\\" and I have to slouch a little bit in order to reach the top of the handle; otherwise, it would be too low for me to reach.Still, it's an excellent quality product, very sturdy, and takes up little space when it's folded up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everyday use","review":"Just bought this cart for our occasional use when transfering boxes in the office after ours broke a couple weeks ago.

It is just the right size for bringing items into the house that we buy at the big club stores. It is easy to fold up and great for storing. It was exactly what he wanted and couldn't be happier with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"This cart is solid, sturdy, easy to fold and unfold, and yet incredibly light. It is large/wide enough that boxes don't fall off. The wheels fold automatically when you move the base, so you don't have to fumble with it. It folds up small so it's easy to take along. Great item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magna Cart Personal Hand Truck is just what I needed.","review":"I love this cart! It folds up to a compact, space saving size, it's easy to open it up.

I used the cart, loaded with plastic tubs full of craft fair items, for multiple trips in and out of a building."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oolong and Ginger don't mix.","review":"I've had this tea. Oolong tea has a light subtle flavor, it should be brewed almost clear. You don't obliterate that by throwing ginger in. Pointless. This tea is obviously more about marketing than trying to make the best tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and unusually useful novelty cookbook, this!","review":"I am surprised at how much I love this book! I would call it a compendium of social, industrial, culinary, agricultural, USAmerican women's history. And yet there's nothing pretentious about it-- it's homey, in fact, and quite usable for a cookbook with such a theme. Crumpacker pulls off quite a feat: updating old-fashioned American recipes without making kitsch of them, which other similar books do. I recommend this book to everyone interested in cooking and the many contexts in which recipes are invented, reproduced, and prepared, and I plan to give a copy to all my foody friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthem","review":"I believe that I've now read this book about eight or so times. It was only recently that I discovered what the story means to me. I finally realized the meaning of the title, this is a discovery of what it means to be human. He experiences everything for the first time, curiosity of the world around him, friendship, and most importantly, love. The poetic style draws you in to empathy and builds a yearning in yourself for him to be free. Ayn Rand, unfortunately, gets too preachy a few of the final chapters but writes a truly incredible piece of definitive literature despite that flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Aside from the fact that this basic idea had appeared at least 2 times before Ayn Rand decided to take it up, Anthem is a rather boring book. It conveys certain aspects of her philosophy decently, I suppose, and is yet again a warning that we should be on guard lest we all become meaningless automatons at some point in the future -- but that's all. As fiction, it is generally dry. It was interesting enough to hold my attention through to the end, and you'll probably have a few things to think about upon finishing -- all well and good. But overall, it feels more like intellectual propaganda in the form of a dull little parable stolen from better authors, rather than a vital and enriching work of original literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-so-subtle Rand","review":"Orwell used wit and a highly individualized writing style to argue against repression. Rand's Anthem, however, is witless and styleless. This overbearing book might just have finally made the convincing argument for the need of people to cooperate in its own blind, foolish rush to categorize any group of people as stupid. But she undermines her own argument because the Science officials, who do not pay heed to Equality's invention of the light bulb, are obviously not looking out for the best of everyone, so she really doesn't argue against utilitarianism. Why did she write a book when she could have simply written \\"I\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rand is genius.","review":"After reading The Fountainhead and just finishing Anthem I would have to say that Ayn Rand is one of the best authors I have ever read. I recommend this book very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Short Novel","review":"Ayn Rand delivers this brief didactic story in a powerful way. It is short, but sharp. It clearly and quickly brings across its point. It reveals the philosophy of objectivism.I don't totally agree with the philosophy evident in this novel. However, I do find many good things about it, so I do feel there is a great of value in this novel. It has value in that it attacks collectivism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and badly reasoned","review":"On a literary level this book was very badly written. My gosh it was written as if she was yelling at me. What poorly written propaganda. Her book read like Maoist or Soviet propaganda. It just was not artfully done. I've read quite a few dystopian novels and this has to be the worst. In fact, it one of the worst books I have ever read! Read We by Zamyatin, 1984 by Orwell, or Brave New World by Huxley instead.On a political level I also hated this book. Her notion of lassaiz faire capitalizm and individuality have helped lead to the excesses of the Wall Street bankers and multi-nationals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthem","review":"This book is horribly contrived and boring. Ayn Rand manages to take a potentially interesting topic and destroy the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put on the hip waders for this one","review":"This parable is pretty much the anti-Steinbeck. Where Steinbeck has marvelous prose and love for his characters, Rand has stilted language and remarkably two-dimensional portrayals. The central message appears to be that the magic of \\"I\\" is all anyone really needs. An appalling book whose near-fascist tendencies should have long ago consigned it to the junk-heap of historical curiousities. There's no real merit here at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthem- a book I only read because I had to","review":"This book is a lot like the Giver. You know I didn't really like it. I just read it because I had to for a class. At least it was short and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"booh","review":"this was aterrible book on so many levels. but my biggest beef with this book is that ayn rand's fictional writing is so heavily laiden with her rhetorical nonesense that she has failed to win audience before revealing the reason for the story. it's just too transparent for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"gag me with a spoon","review":"what a HORRIBLE book! Okay, the first line was good, just like all Ayn Rand's first lines are good, but after that? Geez, I felt like I was reading a lame take-off on 1984. Get your own plot next time! If you are going to read an Ayn Rand book, I recommend We The Living (or the other two books everyone knows). But please skip over this one and save yourself an afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfair Review","review":"This is a completely unfair review to make. I'm not a Ayn Rand fan, and I usually try to avoid reviewing books about whose authors I am more or less ignorant and uninterested. That said--and all readers having been warned--this is one of the few books I have ever read in my life that I completely and utterly and absolutely loathed. If I ever had the slightest inclination to read The Fountainhead, this book squashed that interest to ant-like proportions. I found it narcissistic, chauvinistic (even by my relaxed \\"Hey, patriarchy has some good points\\" standards) and bovinely incompetent in its logic. The hero's solution to his anti-individualist society by creating an \\"I'm the only individual that counts\\" society (in other words, ANOTHER anti-individualist society) plumbs the depths of idiocy. I've been told that Ayn Rand did better than this, but I can't bring myself to find out.To play fair, other reviews are much more positive so keep reading if I've thoroughly annoyed you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to this one...","review":"I haven't read any of Ayn Rand's other books but this one was extremely dissapointing. The theme was very simple, and delivered so that the most simple minded would have difficulty not understanding it.I just didn't feel like this was particularly creative, the worst part being that it is simply a poor piece of literature.I hate to give one star but the story was seemed trite and simplistic and the writing was poor so I'm not sure if it had any redeeming factors that I could perceive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies and gentlemen, we have tripe.","review":"Bad. Bad. Bad. This being the only thing I've read of Ayn Rand's, I have a very low opinion of her. The writing, and the ideas expressed in this book are overly simplistic. It all comes off as an very poorly. I know that everybody raves about how wonderful Ayn Rand is, but if this is an indication of her work, I think it would be just as well to skip her all together. There are plenty of other anti-socialist novels out there; many of which are far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may have been groundbreaking 70 years ago, ...","review":"but if an unknown author wrote this today it would be derided by everyone who read it (and that wouldn't be very many because it would never get published) as boring, simplistic, passe and irrelevent. Yeah, yeah, yeah, ... the evils of collectivism, the Borg, socialism is bad, individuality rocks, yadda yadda, been there, done that.The story itself is basic individual v. collective ending in a 10-page social/political diatribe by the author. The politics of it were no doubt relevent to a communist exile 70 years ago, but are pretty corny to a 21st century American.So, my review is not a knock on Ayn Rand. The story was probably new, exciting and relevent when she wrote it. But unless a reader has had their head in a hole for a long time I can't see how this book will make much of an impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"this was written for reagan. very cold war/1984. all the libertarians and anarchists that i like worship this author but she may have had a bad bag the day she wrote this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and philosophical","review":"This book really makes you think if the needs of the many actually outweigh the needs of the few. Ayn Rand will make you ponder this for years to come. Ayn may make you see it in a completely new way and may even change your opinion. Ayn shows that having a big ego is not bad at all. Ayn was absolutely phenomenal throughout the entire book, but Ayn shined in the last two chapters. Ayn has made an amazing philosophical book that even though was short, is now my favorite book. This book is hard to understand, so I would not recommend this book for very young children, but older kids and adults. This book might have changed the way I look at life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Socialism has been tried","review":"Loved this book. It paints a picture of soviet society that existed and thetotalitarianism and tyranny that is required when the free market is nolonger allowed to function! Unfortunately the west seems hell bent onrepeating the experiment in the naive belief that democracy will be thecure for what was wrong with the soviet experiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Value of Self","review":"I enjoyed Ayn Rand's Anthem, because it was a quick read and addressed some interesting issues. Anthem tackles self-identity in extremely short form. In Anthem, people are enslaved by society by removing their ego. It was enlightening to see how Equality and Liberty discovered their true personalities and created new identities.I would like to ask Rand, do you think social networks have impacted self-identity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Not the first Ayn Rand book I have read but sure to be a favorite. This book should, as one other reviews puts it, be read by all over the age of 10. A great intro to those just discovering the work of this remarkable author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great, Wonderful.","review":"I read this book twenty times over. The adventure of Prometheus in the collectivist society is remarkable, and gives us a deep (very) lesson about life, individual, and the society. Every aspect of ethics, politics, and personal life is explored in terms of collectivism and individualism. Better than any other Ayn Rand's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read. Unique work among Ayn's others.","review":"There is less philosophy in this book and much shorter than her others. Like \\"Planet of the Apes\\", it takes place in our future, with man's past lost.

Atlas deserves a hundred stars.Still, it's much better than Orwell or others."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT NOVELETTE","review":"I read this book as a school assignment but to my great surprise it was actually GOOD.

She writes almost devoid of emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best dystopia book!","review":"Read Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World instead. Although short (you don't have to suffer the endless tirades of Atlas Shrugged), I had problems keeping attention through the whole book. Rand has a very boring writing style.

In a future where the I has destroyed the world, We is the way to assimilate and ensure flat, even, consistent survival.But having not read the details of the book was a mistake for me, I think. I was about 60% done with this book and said to my husband, \\"I think this book is about robots\\" :). I could understand taking away the my, I, and other possessive pronouns... but it was the names that gave it the robotic feel. It wasn't until I got to the \\"Mating\\" thing that I doubted my theory. Even then, I wasn't sure I was wrong.The book was a quick enough read, and I'm not disappointed I read it, but it just wasn't that good of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, derivative, wrong-headed.","review":"Her escape from the Soviet Union left Miss Rand with the notion that yes, the Communists were right: materialism is all. She just disagreed with them about how to cut the pie. Her vision is as dreary as theirs. That said, there remains no reason to read this trite book in the vein of _Brave New World_, for its prose is lame and its storyline is predictable. If you're a Christian (even a Protestant or Roman Catholic), you'll want to steer clear of this; if you're a materialist, you'll be insulted. Who likes this stuff?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was really bad...","review":"Always say something positive first...hmm...let's see...well, it was short. Really short, 105 pages. Other then that, I hated it. It had no plot, no story, no characters. the main character was totally uneduring, flat as a board. She can't write at all. Anyone wanting to read this should try 1984, a true masterpiece, or The Giver, along the same lines and nice as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars is more like it...","review":"This book is pathetic. The ideas presented are repeated many more times than necessary. Rand took a treatise on government and society, dressed it up in (bad) prose, and presented it as a novel. There are much better dystopian novels: Brave New World, We, etc. The writing is bland and didactic. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Very interesting book.

I will never understand how people will tear apart a book just because they do not agree with the philosophy behind it.

The book was pretty good - not a strong plot(at all), but readable - up to that point. Then she went on and on about ego! Where's the plot in that?

One being forbiden love. Two sexism. Three no individualism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Preamble for The Fountainhead","review":"As a story, Anthem is not in the same league as Brave New World. However, much like Roark's Temple for the worship of Man, it is admirable and inspiring. Ayn Rand has a way of making you believe in things the way only religion is usually successful in. Anthem is a response to a philosophical threat, not a concrete one. It is important to its time and the Socialist Craze of Ayn Rand's era. Please read this first if you intend to read The Fountainhead. If nothing else, Ayn Rand inspires - to think , to do, to become happy. She offers solutions to problems that don't seem to have any. She does her part to create goals in life. Do you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopped","review":"This Kindle version of Anthem is incomplete. It leaves out the most important part of the opening chapter -- the words cut in the marble:\\"We are one in all and all in one.There are no men but only the great WE,One, indivisible and forever.\\"Without these words, the story packs zero meaning. This fatal flaw kills this story. Seek another e-copy elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"philosophy in a scant literary outfit","review":"Ayn Rand is so concerned about espousing her outlandishly individualistic philosophy that she seems to neglect some of the basic tenants of storytelling (plot, character development, etc.) I would have been happier with this little volume is Ms. Rand had dispensed with the pretense of story and simply allowed me to be convinced by the inherent weight of her ideals."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, yeah...","review":"A friend of mine demanded I read something by Ayn Rand. I looked and they were written in like the early-ish 1900s. This was the shortest one, so I decided why not. Wow. This was just weird and bad and bizarre. It was way too short for the story. And I think it could have been great. The concept was exceptionally well thought out, but it wasn't executed well. The story was too deep, yet too simplistic all at once. It was rushed, yet too slow. I'm not sure if my review makes any sense, but I think had it been done today with a really good editor, it would have been more my style. I get it was ahead of it's time and probably controversial back in the 1930s, so I'm giving it two stars for that, but I think so much more could have been done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayn Rand's Anthem","review":"I just finished Ayn Rand's 'Anthem'. Anthem reflects the emotional outlook of a small child, systematized by an adolescent, somewhat eloquently expressed by a thirty-something. Boiled down to its essence Anthem is Nietsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra for complete idiots. If Alan Greenspan is really a disciple of Ayn Rand it's no wonder that he helped run the economy into a ditch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that.","review":"When I was younger I thought that this book was amazing.

Unfortunately, we see our enemy every morning in the mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I\\" write this review free of government intervention","review":"Anthem by Ayn Rand truly is a, if not subjectively sugested, wonderful piece of literature. As previous reviews have suggested should not be the first piece of Rand to be studied. I personally take no stance of this because it was the first text of Rand's that I have studied. I loved the essay/novel in all entirety because of its naration that immediately involves the reader into the background and plot to the story. I stongly suggest this text to any person, even if they are only remotely interested in the ideals of Ayn Rand, indefinately. I read the text out of curiousity, and was stunned at the depth it invoked thoughts. Its a short text that is affective in promoting an idea and sufficiantly, not over done, explaining and it allows the reader to run off in all directions with the thought as they read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book owes me stars! (It's not even worth one.)","review":"I agree with Mr. Topp.In _Anthem_ Rand preaches selfishness and disregard of others. For her efforts she has been rewarded with a following that calls her a \\"visionary\\" when she is obviously doing nothing more than following the current trend in America to bash communism, socialism and any political theory that does not promote capitalism and competition.In this novel Rand presents a Utopian society as fundamentally evil because it suppresses technology. What Rand forgets is that a society's worth should NOT be judged solely on its technological advances. If so, what would life be? A game to collect the best and most numerous quantity of robots?_Anthem_ is weak philosophically and written with mediocre literary finesse. I am still regretting having wasted my money on it. But it's your choice... I hope the book store will let me return it. I think I'll buy some Faulkner."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sure like this book in Caracas","review":"Wow! NINE reviews from Caracas, Venezuela, all submitted on the same day - most of them with hotmail addresses, a couple with no addresses at all, and ONE from an AOL account. Nothing fishy *there*.Say, gosh, this must be one heck of a darn good book! Guess I'll get a copy and reread it even though I thought it was a stupid piece of kludgy, heavy-handed melodrama the first time I read it! Maybe it's not too late to fish my old copy out of the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda for you Randroids.","review":"Ayn Rand is a master at fooling mindless white people. The great Objectivist was more subjective then selfish. Its obvious that her hate for all altruism comes from her flee from soviet russia. She hated the Bolsheviks so she invented a philosophy that was in direct conflict with collectivism. She over-simplifies the facts and gets to her point by the second page but it keeps on going for another 120. An even better example why we are all creations of culture and our environment. To deny such is to blind oneself in subjective objectivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Melissa.","review":"I read this book for school. It was interesting at first but it ended up being...well...stupid. A little prideful, aren't we? Anyone who seriously enjoyed this ought to get a hobby. Boring, boring, boring. Read Les Miserables instead. It may be long, but at least it's interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong on both counts!","review":"I disagree with the reviewer below on both counts. Rand obviously didn't \\"coppy\\" this book from Rush's album 2112, and it's a stupid book anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tolerable writing excercise by Rand.","review":"Listen, this work cannot be properly understood with first reading \\"WE\\" by Yevgeny Zamyatin.Rand readers struggle with the purpose of this book. It is merely a writing exercise, an annotation and partial re-write of \\"We.\\" There were certain philosophical elements which Rand disagreed with in Zamyatin, so she wished to set out a bit of prose to complement it.The book does not stand on its own without Zamyatin's.We"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compelling","review":"This book is neither compelling, nor interesting. It is a short story designed to make a case for Rand's egoistic philosophy, but it reads more like propaganda than philosophical fiction. A better representation of her philosophy can be found in her longer works, or perhaps through reading her wikipedia article.The story is science fiction after a fashion - a world that has forgotten all its technology after descending into a new dark age with the death of individualism, seeks to prevent any individuality in the people that now occupy it. Others have written this story much better - perhaps missing the egoist angle - but that is really Rand's import into the story in any case.This storyline is better carried out in H M Hoover's \\"This Time of Darkness\\". That book is the story Rand should have written here.In her defense, this book was written many years ago, and before much of the later science fiction work we now have - but it is not a work that stands the test of time, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate in Equality?","review":"I read this in an afternoon, being only 105 pages. This book covers the loss of individualism and the onslaught of total community. \\"I\\" is abolished and \\"We\\" takes its place, almost like a prototype for Star Trek's \\"Borg\\", although in this story, their minds are not necessarily joined mechanically. It's closer to _1984_ than _Brave New World_, and particularly frightening for an equality-driven person like me.Another idea that is covered is that of individuality rising. The main character begins to realize that he's not like everyone else, and he wants to escape, even though he doesn't until he's forced to. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthem","review":"Anthem's language and style are the reasons for its very real narration, but I was left unsatisfied with the conclusion. Although it wasn't meant to be a book read for its plot, it left too much undone. I felt like too much was being crammed into the last two chapters, like it was just an effort to make the book end sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Society I would want to live in......","review":"Good read, and obviously fiction. Rand is a good writer, holds your attention. I got this book to help understand the underlying belief system of Paul Ryan, or get a glimpse of his thoughts. It is not an example of a society that I want to live in, but to each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Significant Work Burdened by the Narrator","review":"The audiobook narrated by Christopher Lane is tough to listen to, even as brief as the book is (3 CDs). If he was trying to sound monotonous and with an unpleasant edge to his voice, he succeeded magnificently. He reminded me very much of an audiobook version of Catch-22 that I tried to listen to 5 or 6 years ago but had to stop because the narration of that book was completely annoying. I don't know whether this is the same person, but I would recommend reading the printed book in any case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"Set in a dark, collectivist future, one man must discover the word \\"I\\" before he can find freedom. This short story lays out some of the basics of Ayn Rand's protest against collectivism in a format that is accessible to teenagers and adults alike. The last two chapters are really the \\"anthem\\" of the book, and I have gone back to read them again several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Ayn Rand's Anthem","review":"I just finished reading Anthem and I have to say that it was amazing. The story is of a future where the word \\"I\\" has disappeared and society has formed into a collective society where no individual thinks of themselves but rather thinks only of the collective group. The story follows one individuals process of freeing his mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This book was great. A quick read that brings a powerful point. Ayn Ryand is an amazing author, who has an exceptional way of bringing out powerful stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Rand book","review":"I gotta say that I read this because it was the inspiration for Rush's 2112 Album.I am a little worried that it is a little too realistic as to where the USA is headed. I did enjoy the book however and will be reading more of her books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warning of our slide","review":"Ayn Rand examines 'collectivism' from a slightly different perspective. The willingness of mankind to submit to slavery to the collective is juxtaposed to the native satisfaction of what the individual brings to life; calling it a sacred thing. It was a fresh face on a classic theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human spirit triumphs","review":"The world has become a society where people have no self will, no names, no choices, no opportunities to grow and learn. One man rebels and finds himself in danger. He realizes there are others who think like him; and he vows to change the lives of his fellow men. Very good story, intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand","review":"Anthem [and her Atlas Shrugged] are excellent books of intriguing ideas. Because Anthem begins differently than many stories, it takes a few pages to get really started at it. The idea it portrays are something a person might never forget. During the political period we are in these days my mind keeps coming back to the subject of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave New World written by a high school sophomore","review":"This is a story about a world of automatons which was the result of some unexplained disaster to the human race. Our hero finds himself and a female companion and they escape into an individualist nirvana, taking a newly rediscovered scientific marvel with him. While the concept of idiviualism and anti-centralized control is classic Rand, this is so ham-handed as to be comical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd leap","review":"So the automatic reaction to totalitarian collectivism is radical individualism and the worship of \\"EGO\\"? I can't believe such simpleminded notions have the vast influence they currently have in American politics. Hogwash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've read in my life","review":"This is far and away the worst book that I've read cover-to-cover in my life. It purports to demonstrate the \\"logical outcome\\" of collectivism, and fails miserably at this task. What's more, it's written in a \\"biblical\\" or mythical tone, something that Rand does not pull off in the least. This book succeeds much better when read as a critique of Rand, as her ideas are potrayed in an utterly pathetic manner.To be fair, this is one of her earlier works, when she was still experimenting as a writer and at expressing herself in English. I was inspired to read it after having read her excellent novel on individualism, \\"The Fountainhead\\". If interested in reading some Rand, I very strongly recommend that you read that book instead. To make it clear: I don't hate Rand; I hate pretentious writing and philosophical work that consists of constructing flimsy strawmen and tearing them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, yet scary","review":"This title actually deserves 4.5 stars, but you can't put that. This book takes place in a time where individualism has been demolished: you cannot make your own decisions, you cannot create anything on your own, or that isn't approved, and you can't speak out if you find something unfair. Our hero, Equality 7-2521, watches someone burned at a stake for discovering an unknown, 'evil' word, when he is but a child. This inspires him. He wants to know EVERYTHING, but is sentenced to be a street-sweeper forever. This is his story of finding himself, and his plan to save his world. At first, this book is confusing and seemingly pointless.After a few days of meditating on it, though, you realize how much this book makes you think,and how fantastic it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rand's Objectivism","review":"Ayn Rand's novela is inspiring because she sets a story/poem in the upper dark age without using the word \\"I\\" for first-person narration until the last two chapters. That is what I find to be impressive. This book is so anti-collectivist that it strikes much pathos. While the book was impressive, it wasn't an action-based plot and appeared to be a statement of facts. However, the true appeal to the story was the theme of ego and the individual vs. group relationship. I liked it. It was to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Wonderfulness of the self\\"","review":"I have read most of Ayn Rand's work-brilliant intellectualism, cold, determined, dynamic characters, and of course,artfully depicted ideas of \\"objectivism\\". This is definitely a departure. She creates a more colorful, compassionate web of \\"humanism\\"- a new way of describing to her readers how the individual reigns above all. Short, sweet, RAND."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangers of Communism","review":"With Anthem, Rand delivers a powerful message concerning the dangers of extream Communism. The style of this book highlights the problems encountered in collective societies, and it would be an extreamly interesting read to anyone interested in political thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Portrayal of the Future Gone Bad","review":"\\"Anthem\\" is an absolute gem of a book. It is a dark tale that makes the reader consider the negative aspects of collectivism. At the same time, it provides the satisfaction of \\"hope for the future\\" by the end of the novel that 1984 lacks. It is short and concise, providing just enough detail to spark the imagination and feed the soul (unlike some unsatisfactory pieces that are crowned with supposedly flattering words such as \\"sparse\\"). Therefore, I highly recommend this book--in only a couple of hours, you can get all the moral eye-openers and romantic elements that longer reads such as \\"1984\\" and \\"Farenheight 451\\" provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably the worst \\"good\\" book i've ever read.","review":"I read this book because i was told that it was extremely bad by two of my moderately intellectual cousins. I can't say I disagree. The book's main point is that individual identity is more important than a harmonious society, which is true. But the book has no characters and no real plot and seems like a well written book rewritten by a fifth grader. This book could make a good short story, but the fifty pages it takes up are completely wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"My thoughts","review":"The philosophies of Ayn Rand are the weakest defenses of capitalism I have ever read. Her insistence on the right of every man to his own mind and body are easily flipped against her. Under capitalism, all working people are tools. Their work(which takes up most of their life, and therefore their mind and body), is only a means to advance the profits of their employers. Her insistence on the domination of reason, fails to recognize the inherent prejudices and flaws of Socratic \\"reason.\\"Her faith in reason is devastated in the works of Sigmund freud and Frederich Nietzche. Her and her followers merely are repelled by the perversions of collectivism in Russia and are drawn to the romantic heroes of her work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthem Does not pass the test of time","review":"Anthem - I quick read, may have been provocative when it was writeen, but has since been reproduced in low budget sci-fi films that \\"Mystery Science Theatre\\" would not review.

My order was for a new book but I received a used one. Had it been in relatively good condition I wouldn't have complained. Morever, about 150 pges (ove half of the whole book) were full of ink marks. When I say inc marks, don't expect just spots, sentences are deliberately blotted out so as you would not be able to read them. Some pages, some body have scriblled in his own paragraph, after wiping out the original content of the author.If half of the content is purposely marked up on to obscure its eligibilty, and if the other half is is filled up some lunatic's stupid scriblings then what is left to read?Almost nothing, the \\"book\\" is usless. If I want to return it it will cost me more than to buy a new copy. so I will simply throw it away.This seller is a cheat, don't buy anything from her/him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayn Rand lovers, back off of Orwell","review":"Orwell wasn't a \\"once socialist\\". He was always a socialist. And I'm most definitely not a \\"USA educated Hollywood kid\\" or whatever you want to conveniently label me as. My father grew up in the USSR and my grand father was killed in a gulag. Yet, they were not so ignorant as to believe that socialism was the same as the horrors of the Soviet Union. Ayn Rand makes the mistake of equating collectivisation of resources with the horrors of state repression and tyrrany. They are not one and the same. So please, before you read this book and mindlessly take to heart everything that she says, please remember that the horrors she describes are not necessarily connected with socialist or socialistic economics. If you want to see the very real sufferings caused by unrestrained capitalism, just look at the global south, the working poor in america, the indigenous populations of South America, why hasn't Ayn Rand written about this kind of oppression?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Kindle free edition","review":"First thjnfs first I love Anthem.

As I read, I felt connected to Equality 7-2521 and grieved when he grieved and smiled when he smiled. It was like he was a real person with real feelings, like there was actually someone trapped in some insane society somewhere in the world. That said, the plot has a good meaning behind it, in the sense that we should be careful with strong governments and overregulation of procedures. I'd recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind and a spare hour or two to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthem review","review":"An insight into the soul of a individualist/scientist living in the ultimate collectivist society.

ANTHEM presents the beauty and power of Rand's philosophy in an highly-accessible and intriguing story. I am reading it with my 9th grade English students for the first time, and it is holding their interest and challenging their world view. This novelette has taken the place of Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN in my curriculum. While beautifully written, Steinbeck's work carries a tone of hopelessness that already pervades my students' lives. ANTHEM uplifts their souls, challenging them to utilize their talents and be the masters of their fate. It is an important work that I will be sharing each year with my students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Student Edition","review":"Although the book is in fine condition, this is NOT the student edition. It is a large copy that contains several different versions of the book. Ordinarily I would have appreciated this, but I needed to turn the student copy into my teacher.

Acquired taste or high school/college reading assignment, most of us first experienced this writer as the latter. Anthem is an early work and it is very apparent in this novella. I found it difficult to finish, and it's only a little better than 60 pages. Simply put, I did not enjoy this book and I wouldn't advise it as an introduction to the author's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but good","review":"I read Anthem after first reading The Fountainhead-- becoming obsessed with that--then reading Atlas Shrugged and being disappointed. This came out before the Fountainhead, so I thought I'd give it a try. It was short but fun. Clearly a beginning step towards the longer novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Individuallity","review":"In today's society, one is constantly hearing in the news about mergers and corporate buyouts, but where is that taking us?In the futuristic world of Anthem, the expression 'all for one and one for all' has become the way of life. Society has become so collective that the individual no longer exists. The concept of first person expression does not exist. There is no I only WE.Anthem show what happens when one person refuses to be anonymous."},{"rating":"2","title":"I","review":"One of a handful of books on individualism I've read in the past year. This is a little bogged down by Rand's writing (I wasn't crazy about her style, as she couldn't decide whether she was writing a novel or about philosophy at times), and the ending is quite preachy. I feel the ideas behind Objectivism scream out at you in the story alone, and she did not need to place any added emphasis, such as she did to end the novella. Still, this is a good, quick read for one becoming interested in Rand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheeesh !!","review":"This story is not even up to the quality (and writing level) of the Science Fiction being written contemporaneously. It was a good idea run amok. I would refer it to no one, especially not to a serious reader of early sci-fi. I can't remember specifics, but there are a lot of clearly impossibloe projections.Les"},{"rating":"2","title":"A first time Rand reader","review":"After seeing that this book has been required reading for many high schoolers, I decided to give it a try. I missed out on this book as a teenager. You cannot compare Rand against Orwell, as many other reviewers have tried to do. 1984 is in a different league than Anthem even though the themes are similar. If the idea of the individual is removed from society then mankind is sure to crumble. The hard truth of humanity is that some will prosper while others do not. And if our government does not get that idea out of their heads, we may very well look forward to a WE society like in Anthem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthem","review":"Just read Anthem for the first time. Very intrigued by the way the author started out in third person (using \\"we\\" all the time) and eventually switching.

I really enjoyed reading the story, and thinking about true it could become. I would have given 5 stars, but I tend to like books a little longer so the characters can be developed a bit more. However, given the story line here, I can understand how the length was appropriate in the authors view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand - Anthem - A powerful read","review":"This book was very enlighting.

It had an OK concept, but the writing was boring, too intelectual, and long winded. Some phrases were powerful, but many of her sentences didn't hit me the way TALENTED writers, like Jane Yolen write. This book ANTHEM made no sense, and the way Ayn Rand used the \\"We\\" and the \\"They\\" confused me.

If Alan Greenspan is really a disciple of Ayn Rand it's no wonder he helped drive our economy into a ditch. When it comes to fiction or drama I'm something of a whore. I'll suspend my disbelief for just about anything.

So, it must be important! Since it's a book with words, that means my self-absorbed infantile ideas must be valid!Yet another reason why America is having the problems it is.

I know people laud her for her visionary views on anti-communism/socialism, but personally, I find it banal. If one is looking to sway someone towards either democracy, or the idolism of the ego (self), then one may find it enjoyable. I find her ideas commonplace and would give it a Homer Simpson \\"Doh!\\" if I could. Her work could be relevant in these times of extreme right- and left-wing politics, warning of the dangers of being too one-sided, but again, common sense should dictate that in the first place.

A Utopia is a person's idea, or group of people's idea, of a perfect place. This book takes place in the future. In this world the wolrd \\"I\\" doesn't exsist. It is always \\"we\\" or \\"us,\\" and \\"them/they.\\" People there don't really have a real name. It is a word and then a number after it. The people there also have id bracelets that have their so-called \\"name\\" on it. When they are born they get sent to \\"The Home of the Infants.\\" After that they get sent to a place that has a job and then they get sent to The Home of the Useless.I would recommend this book to people who are interested in reading about Utopias. Part of the reason for that is so people can read a good book. The other part is to realize that the world can never be perfect and never will be a Utopia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic introduction to Ayn Rand","review":"This book is a tale of a future were people are not permitted to pursue their own endeavors for their own reasons at their own ability. It chronicles the rise of a man who is held back by restrictions placed on him by those who \\"know better\\".

Though they were Nokia branded, the batteries I ordered from CCM Accessories did not come in original manufacturer's packaging. After a day or two of use, I noticed that they did not hold a charge.

However, there was no holographic sticker like on the original to certify it as genuine.In short - they work, seem to be constructed identically and there is no reason to suspect at close scrutiny that they are knock-offs. I'd call them a good deal for the money, but, as stated in the first paragraph, the only way to know if they are worth using is to see if they still work a year from now (and of course, you can't wait a year and still post a review...).I gave the product 5 stars for pricing and apparent construction quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Times a Charm","review":"I ordered this battery on behalf of my father so that he would not have to pay for a new phone as his is somewhat dated, but suits he needs fine.

Unfortunately it was completely dead and would not charge. My father e-mailed informing of the problem and probably wasted $3 and change shipping the bad battery back.

It's definitely the best book on the subject apart from Neftci's \\"An Introduction to the Mathematics of Financial Derivatives\\". Baxter and Rennie spend more time on probabilities than Neftci. One word on introductionary books on the mathematics of derivatives. Introductionary is meant for people who have a strong mathematical / quantitative background. For all the others, a book like \\"Quantitative Methods in Finance\\" might be a better book to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a fair mathematical background.","review":"Major steps were skipped. A reader without a fair mathematical background would not understand why suddenly a statistical result could be used to replace the whole martingale equation. A lot of assumptions were made on the knowledge base of readers. Therefore, it is not an introductory text. If the reader has a fair mathematical background the reader needs not start with this book. If the reader does not have the background, he can't understand this book. This book is in the middle of nowhere. In short, the authors skipped too many steps.

Perhaps it was Duffie that started this needlessly complicated approach to texts on quantitative finance? Baxter and Rennie attempt to simplify the learning process but their effort remains too terse to be self-contained. Be prepared to have a couple of good references on probability and calculus handy if you don't happen to remember how to perform Erf(x) substitutions and apply DeMoivre-Laplace.Neftci's book is a better place to start this material. He's criticized for too much hand waving but it is an *INTRODUCTORY* text! Though not sufficient, it is far more accessible than other offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book, But not a Good Intro","review":"Baxter & Rennie's book is really very enjoyable if you have already had experience with stochastic calculus, martingale methods, including Girsanov's Theorem, the Black-Scholes, and so forth. The writing is subtle and very concise, and every sentence is informatio-dense (to the point that it may be necessary to reread sentences over and over again to be certain that you have extracted the idea). A beginner receiving his first exposure to derivative pricing, however, unless he is mathematically very sophisticated, will not be pleased with this book, as it presumes more mathematical sophistication than the preface states, and focuses the crux of derivative mathematics (i.e., stochastic calculus) in one chapter. That said, this is a very good book and will be the standard for more advanced courses on the subject and for practitioners."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biased book that confuses all the issues","review":"I read this from the perspective of a philosophy/theology teacher and found it, quite simply, awful.

The film's slow pace is especially effective at drawing us into sympathy and compassion for these characters, making the ending so devastating. The use of visual space to suggest isolation, loneliness, and the difficulty of connecting with others is powerful too (it reminds me of Todd Haynes' excellent SAFE in this way, and in others). Even though modern/postmodern life mostly offers a dehumanizing set of changes, there is hope in the filmmakers' use of cinematic magic to encourage affection and compassion for these three lonely people.

Many of the Rangers personal versions of their experiences at D-Day are combined in this book which makes it an eye-witness account of sacrifice and uncommon valor.

Included in the narrative are anecdotes about the train-up of 2nd Ranger Batt. from the creation of the battalion in 1943 thru the execution of the assault on Point du Hoc on D-Day. The author, a combat veteran, gives the details from a soldier's point of view. Though at times the listing of names of soldiers during the story distracts from the point of the moment, it does provide a level of reality. While the movie, Saving Private Ryan is a fictional account of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, this book provides an insight into the actual brutality of war. Most importantly, it gives the reader a character study of an excellent role model for a soldier in James Earl Rudder.

Here's a chick who knows that the best defense is a good offense, revenge is a dish best served cold, and...well, she knows all of the cliches, but the point is, she also has some pretty good ideas.

Performance artist Anita Liberty poors her soul and her anger on every page, which makes the biography a little shocking. (I myself was a little disappointed.) I think every female should have a copy of this book as an outlet and a source of healing. Laughing at other people's experiences lightens the load of your own, especially when shared as Anita has. To everyone who has given this book a bad review or dubbed Liberty a \\"feminist,\\" Get a life. It's just a joke.

It won't cure the common cold or raise your IQ, but it could make you feel better as you find your feet again...All of us have had crummy relationships; all of us probably want to hire our ex- to clean our houses with toothbrushes. \\"Ms. Liberty\\" wrote the book about it.

When a woman ends a relationship, she is \\"independent\\". Ms. Liberty feels the need to ignore this fact.Furthermore, if a man wrote a book like this, it would be considered a hate crime. When a woman does it, it's considered \\"clever, social commentary\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another bitter man-hating feminist in denial","review":"Ms. Liberty misses a crucial fact: Women need to grow up and stop thinking that men who are abusive and unfaithful are \\"sexy, bad boy challenges\\".

I personally recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of alternative music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in my own little world...","review":"I don't know anyone else who knows this band. The first time I've heard of them was when I bought \\"Dyslexicon\\" really cheap in a dusty second hand shop... and I loved it so much I just wanted more Dandelion. So I went back to the same shop and found \\"I think I'm Going To Be Sick\\"... It managed to make me forget all about \\"Dyslexicon\\" and how much I cherrished it.The two albums (which, sadly appear to be the only ones) are very different in ways of production. It is an interesting contrast... \\"Dyslexicon\\" has a massive, almost saturated sound with only four members (the singer on guitar) while this album sound a lot cheaper and features the band as a five piece (the singer not on guitar). If you like albums like \\"Bleach\\" by Nirvana or any of the other Grunge and Sub Pop bands then give these two albums a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Republish This Book!!!","review":"Republish this reknowned Melville Davisson Book.West Virginia University Press and others should take note.Thanks!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment!","review":"First of all the music of this album doesn't do justice to Wes's amazing vocals. Music and production quality is very bad. It's very clear that Wes got the wrong producers for this record. Wes's own music style is different. It should be treated differently (Like Michel Sanchez did in Welenga). Here his vocal is mixed up with some bubble-gum pop music which lacks class in its own way. This album is meant to be doomed and yes it did. Producers Gary Miller & Brian Rawling might be having a good track record with other artistes like Kylie, Enrique Iglesias, Paula Abdul to name a few. But they failed to add value to Wes's voice. People who love what Wes did with Deep Forest, may not like this album. But for regular passive pop music lovers can try this as for them this will be like 'a new ingredient in their regular pudding'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a strong singer.","review":"There's a reason some people usually are and should remain background vocalists. Patti Scialfa's voice is paper-thin and she has pitch problems. The songs, all of which she is credited with either writing or co-writing, are fairly good. In fact, they sound like Bruce Springsteen songs. Coincedence? I doubt it. If she wasn't married to Bruce Springsteen, I don't think this album would have ever been made. As Patti sings in the song, \\"Lucky Girl\\": \\"Oh, I guess I'm a lucky girl. I've been lucky since I found you\\". You can say that again, Patti."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's just the Little Lady","review":"I'm a great fan of Bruce's work, so when I saw this album in the shops, I immediately bought it. The woman knows how to write a good song. But she can't entertain me for an album's lenght.. And then, she's lucky to have a musical man like Springsteen, who will work for free. That's her luck, because of his name, there will be some people who buy this. The best tracks are the ones where Springsteen himself plays the guitar and that is simply too little. i don't think she will ever be allowed to make a second album. We can only hope for Springsteen. So that people don't buy bad albums because he's worked on them. If you would like to hear some really good singers, try Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, on the Western Wall, they do songs both by Springsteen as well as Miss Scialfa. Guess which one is the better ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"not only is love blind, it's deaf as well","review":"My 13 year old son bought me a copy of Rumbledoll in a used CD store, as he knows I'm a big e-street fan. He put it in the car cd player, listened for a while, removed it, wiped it off, and reinserted it. Then, he stared at the photographs that accompanied the cd and said, \\"not only is love blind, it's deaf as well.\\" Scialfa has a thin, high-pitched, whiny voice that is difficult to listen to, she sounds like someone stepped on her tail. The lyrics are juvenile and self serving. No redeeming qualities at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The luckiest person since Ringo Starr","review":"Patti Scialfa has to be the luckiest person on this planet since Ringo Starr. She is such a limited talent! The only good career move she made was opening her legs to Bruce Springsteen. She is as vital a part of the E Street Band as a brick. She had no right standing on the same stage (in the front, I might add) on the last tour. The fact that she \\"wore\\" a guitar on the same stage as Nils Lofgren is even more of a disgrace. Be able to sing the high part on \\"Trapped\\" and \\"Out on the Street\\" doesn't make her a member of one of the greatest bands in rock and roll history. I'm glad Bruce found his soul mate; just keep her off the stage because she doesn't belong with the mighty E Street Band. And anyone who thinks Ringo Starr deserves to be considered an equal in the Beatles is equally lost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Always in the CD Player","review":"I love Patti's voice. I love Patti's songs. This album is more than just an offering from \\"Mrs. Bruce Springsteen\\": it's the work of a gifted singer/songwriter. I can't get enough of this CD, and I've had it for--what?--nine years now. \\"Love's Glory\\" and \\"Rumble Doll\\" are among my favorite songs from the album.Patti sang a snippet of \\"Rumble Doll\\" when she was introduced on the last E Street tour. Awesome, awesome, awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patti Scialfa-the best of the best","review":"I first became aware of this album thru the links that Amazon provides when searching for some music titles. I was intrigued by some of the comments some folks had to say about this CD. I had been listening to the \\"Live in New York City \\" by Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band and was especially fascinated with the song \\" Mansion On The Hill \\"- in which both Patti and her husband Bruce sing. So after obtaining a used copy of the \\" Rumble Doll \\" CD locally, I have not been able to stop listening to it. In my opinion, it is a masterpiece-and probably one of the seminal CD's of the 1990's-and I know something about music-as I was in the record business for over 10 years. To anyone out their that likes female rock/pop music with fantastic lyrics, hooks, beat, rhythm, & guitar riffs-I do NOT see how this album can be topped. I think it is almost surreal-that this married couple of Bruce Springsteen & Patti Scialfa could be so talented & so GOOD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great surprise.......","review":"I bought this shorty after it came out back in 93' and I have to say this was one of my favorite cd's of the year, but it just didn't get whey near the respect it should have. This is one GREAT SOUNDING CD and sure having Bruce as a husband and influence can't possibly hurt. She deliveries a great Ronnie Spector style vocal that brings a smile to your face and the production is flawless in my opinion. I just wish she would get back into the studio and floor everyone with another one. She is big time talent and a great songwriter. ALL these songs have something to say especially \\"talk to me like the rain\\", \\"Spanish dancer\\", \\"Valerie\\", \\"Rumble Doll\\", their all great tracks and should have been played on the radio with Bonnie Raitts and Sheryl Crows music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going back to it","review":"Although I bought this album when it was first released, I still find that when I am skipping through my collection, I often play this CD. It still sounds as fresh as it did when I first bought it, and its great for driving too. Considering the success of Shania Twain, I am surprised that this, far superior album did not receive critical acclaim as I believe it deserves"},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight through your head without leaving a trace","review":"Patti Scialfa has a similar voice to Beth Orton and Stacey Earle. I can see that some people like this girlish approach but I prefer a deep and strong voice over a tender and fragile one, any day. The material on this album \\"Rumble doll\\" isn't that good, but I must say that I really love the captivating song \\"Baby don't\\", and I think \\"Charm light\\" is rather good. The rest of the songs don't stick out at all, and they have a tendency to melt, or blend, together. I wouldn't say that the songs are particularly bad or so, but the main problem is that they don't excite you in any way - they don't even upset you. The best time to put on this album is while you have friends over for dinner, and need something soft in the background, something that don't interrupt with your conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Pro Tools can't help","review":"No amount of mastering and effects can overcome the fact that this woman can't sing. Furthermore these songs try hard to be street smart but miss the sincereity mark.

This is one of those albums that tells a story, and is just so fantastic! Patti is a fantastic poet and songwriter, singer and rocker. The word \\"gem\\" is terribly over-used, but this is, in fact, a real gem. There is, by the way, a wonderful video of the tune 'Lucky Girl' online that is wonderful. Like Laura Nyro, Patti's work is beyond the level of the popular psyche, and so was under appreciated. I love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"it grew on me","review":"I bought the tape when it first came out in 1993. I wanted to see just how good she was without Bruce. (I am a diehard Bruce fan.) At first, I was unsure what to think. But the more I played it and listened to it, and really heard the lyrics, it grew on me. I wore the tape out. I purchased the CD right here through Amazon and I play it all the time while I'm surfing the Internet. It really is a great CD. I hope she does another one. I agree with the other person who said it was one of their top 10 CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Just Keeps Getting to You - Its Addictive","review":"Have had this CD for about 8 months. I've burned 3 copies - 1 for the car, 1 for the pickup, and 1 to keep in the CD player. The original is put away. Never before have I done this with a tape or CD. Its amazing to me that I could listen to anything at least once a day and never tire of it. Other than Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, or Willie Nelson, I don't care to hear the same thing more than about once a month. She doesn't sound like anyone other than Patti Scialfa - in a class all by herself. Ms Scialfa possesses extraordinary talent. She owes it to herself and the world to do more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patti Rules","review":"I love Patti. This is the epitome of Doll albums!

Since Patti is in the E Street Band (starting with Live:75-85) several of the \\"complete-ists\\" bought it and found it's GOOD. A bit of be-bop, a bit of folk, thoughtful lyrics - god she can write - & a lot of harmony. \\"Rumble Doll\\", \\"Imagination\\", and \\"Come Tomorrow\\" have sparked some thinking I needed to do; \\"Love's Glory\\" and \\"As Long As I\\" are two of my favorite love songs.

Harry Connick Jr. gives a very fine performance in the lead role. The supporting cast is also good, Swoosie Kurtz in particular. There are two main flaws. First, the movie suffers from the usual weaknesses of medical stories: artificial setup dialogue, a too-bad-to-be-true villain to provide conflict, and too many tear-jerking moments. Second, it verges on being propaganda for drug companies. The general view taken by the writer is that drugs and Science offer the only path to healing; one cancer patient who dabbles with alternative therapies is presented in a decidedly negative light. Still, it's a great story, certainly a cut above the usual Lifetime fare, and worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dumbest movie ever!","review":"So contrived and poorly written and editted this has to be a joke!!

I cried and cried, for about a half hour after the movie was over, because for the first time I realized how lucky and blessed I am to live in a time when this medication is available.

Now THAT is a show I would love to see.And to those Sony hate mongers......please, please vent your anger elsewhere.

So sad that SONY has sunk so low that they will risk their reputation by sneaking junk into a CD that can wreck havoc on peoples computers. Dont they know that bad PR is bad for profits? As for the CD itself it rates ten stars. Am one of those listeners who needs to listen to a CD alot before I like it.

Great job by Neil and Rick Rubin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"niel diamond direct and simple","review":"It sounds like Rick Rubin put microphones in front of Neil and let Him do what he does well, record pleasing and thoughtful songs. I like the backing of the Heartbreakers, among others; kept to a minimum, but with great result. There is a melancholy spirit that weaves through this record, which showcases the drama in Niel's life, and obviously our own. What makes this record so appealing is that it is so simply recorded and it tells our own tale, we all have a lot in common with Neil. Nobody gets in Neil's way; He just states things the way they are, and his backing band lightly orchestrates him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"I waited with great anticipation for this cd to be released, and now that I have it, I can truthfully say that it's the best music I've heard in a long time.

I still, after listening to this CD eight times, cannot pick a favorite song, it changes each time, and I love this CD more and more each time I hear it.

This CD will secretly install copy-protection software on your PC that is a back door to hackers, worms and viruses of all types. Several class action lawsuits are already forming over this.

If you attempt to listen to it on a computer (f.ex. if you want to move the tracks onto your MP3 player), it will install the Sony malaware without your knowledge. It cannot (As of yet) be uninstalled except by brute force and many hours of work by windows professionals (which will cost Joe Consumer lots of $), and while it is on your system will represent a severe security issue, cause lack of stability on your system and may cause you to lose personal data.It also sends info from your computer back to sony.This program makes fundamental changes to your computer's core, and will void any warranty. Be warned!Neil, please make this CD available to the public without this nefarious piece of crapware.And preferably move to another record label so we won't have to support Sony anymore. :-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a Great Collection, but. . .","review":"I will not buy this, or any other copy protected optical media.

Don't miss the chance to enjoy this awesome music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with Sony?","review":"Sony's questionable actions in placing rootkits on CDs has been widely discussed, but another problem with Sony on this CD is that they released two different versions of it on the same day. One version simply has the \\"12 Songs\\" alluded to in the title, while another version (with the same title) has two additional tracks, one of which is a remix featuring Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Why not just put all 14 tracks on all of the CDs pressed? Sony's just making stupid decisions, in my estimation.Anyway, the hype leading up to the release of \\"12 Songs\\" claimed that Neil was getting back to his roots, and I even heard the album compared to \\"Kentucky Woman.\\" Well, all said and done, that comparison is completely without merit, and the album is nowhere near as good as Neil's classics. This album is probably fine for serious fans of Neil Diamond, but for casual fans (such as myself), it's nothing to write home about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell? Yeah","review":"Well Neil Diamond is in good voice here and at least is still writing. Whether he should be or not is another matter. This CD is destined to be a huge seller especially in countries with excellent facilities for the aged. Oh Mary at 5 minutes 13 is 3 minutes too long. Captain of a Shipwreck outdoes McCartney for whimsically banal lyrics. Save Me a Saturday Night is made for those who have long forgotten what Saturday nights used to be for. In Delerious Love Diamond finally finds second gear, but sadly the scenery is much too familiar for the ride to be interesting. The rest drones into a mellow grumbly mish mash that had my Mary saying put on something I can sing to. Thank God for copy protection - at least they have to give you a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"What no minus stars? Spyware!","review":"I am totally outraged. I promise I will never buy anything made by Sony again. It's the least I can do. I wish there were more. I am telling everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic!","review":"This is awesome! Reminds me of the Neil of old. Just his voice and the music, none of the glitz and big orchestras of some of his other music (which is not bad, just different). This is really fantastic! Don't not buy it because of the software issues...just play it in your car & sing along as you drive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT Music DO NOT BUY CD!!!!!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD -- DOWNLOAD THE MUSIC!I bought the CD before the release and after reading the great reviews. What a mistake! I'm one of those people who BUY CDs to put on my iPod, download songs via iTunes, and teach courses on copyright and multimedia so I know the rules and follow them. What Sony did for copy protection is EVIL - EVIL - EVIL. Go to iTunes and get the songs because you install the CD, your computer is wide open to attack AND it won't work on an iPod!Neil -- I think your music is great but Sony did you a great disservice! Tell them to quit fooling around with your CDs before you lose every fan that listens to your music on a PC, or loads it on a iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is great; the CD encryption is criminal","review":"Allow me to drop a CD into my PC and PLAY IT!!! Is that so difficult?Sony -- people hate you, and this is why. I bought this because I love Neil Diamond...not because I wanted to rip you off. Way to turn the whole equation around -- without provocation. Not too many people could do that, but you were completely successful. Thanks for f-ing up a great listening experience. Is there a calendar in your office? Mine says 2005....apparently I'm off by about 20years.Sorry for Neil, Rick Rubin, and many other talented people whose names are associated with your piece of crap company.

Therefore, you cannot play the songs on your iPod. Good music; but the spyware and copy-protection is OBSCENE. Converting files to MP3 to play on portable devices is \\"fair use\\", and is not a copyright violation. One star is too many; I wish I could rate NO STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair to compare itunes with the disc as a source.","review":"Saying people have a choice of buying it from itunes isnt a valid comparison, since itunes provide a lossy compressed files that are inferior to the CD release. The idea of using there own player software when playing on a PC is also inferior as some of us use some of there more advanced players with DSP to help correct for there less then stellar speaker systems.With there propriatory software I cannot put DSP of my choice in the playback chain, removing my ability to listen how I want.An audio CD should be an audio CD, not some bastard child of some music companys vein efforts to alienate a majority of there customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd ordered this, but cancelled ...","review":"...the order after the full horror of Sony's nefarious copy-protect software became apparent.

Not anywhere on this album.","review":"Been a Neil Fan for many a year and a few concerts too. If you like the Neil Diamond 'big' sound, you're gonna be severely disappointed by this pile of garbage. The 'velvet' voice has changed to a croak. Worst piece of music I've ever purchased!!I've never wanted to return any music I've bought before, until I heard this bomb. Sorry Neil. Listen to some of the tracks before you buy this collection. It's definitely different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, an utter disappointment","review":"As a \\"hard-core\\" Neil fan, I was really disappointed with this release. There was none of his typical energy - I would not be impressed with ONE of these songs performed on stage without MOST of the show being old gems like Sweet Caroline, Forever in Blue Jeans, Shilo, Cherry, etc... Go figure - the whole album sounds like the Late Johnny Cash's last release (Which took on a whole new low with his cover of Personal Jesus. Rick Rubin evidently is stuck in a rut and tried the same style on the wrong artist. I guess I can find a use for the CD when I really need to get to sleep, since I am feeling tired just listening to it for the third time tonight - just trying to make sense of it. There is none of the throaty and raucous Neil that we all love. I wanted to love it as much as I love the Neil Diamond of old. Personally, I am glad I am listening to a copy that I did not buy - Rubin really flopped on this one. FFS, Delirious Love sounds like a 70s-80s TV theme... go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony has gone too far","review":"I was so looking forward to the release of this album, but as a matter of principle, I will NOT purchase it.

Neil Good.","review":"To give Neil's new effort low marks based upon Sony's poor (although intentional I'm sure)choice of software, is notonly weak, but counter-productive to the whole rating process.Rate the music - Not the technology ( or Lack Thereof).Having been breast fed Neil's tunes from the womb, I'm sureto be biased. Notwithstanding, I bought the disk today and have to say that I'm feelin' the Neil I haven't felt in a while.Listening to the tunes today reminded me of the old blue 8-trackof Hot August Night - Both tapes actually. Well done Neil. A brave move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs, Lousy Copy Protection","review":"I love Neil Diamond, and the songs on this record deserve 5 stars, but Sony deserves zero stars. Beware of this CD. It contains copy protection in the form of a spyware like program that is installed deep into your computer. Getting rid of this program is an arduous task, even if you are an expert computer user.Second, if you want to place this CD onto your iPod, you can't. The copy protection prevents you from importing the songs into iTunes.Shame on Sony for being so underhanded and greedy that they punish honest fans and customers. I should be able to listen to the music I buy on whatever device I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil at his BEST in YEARS--perhaps EVER!","review":"Others have detailed the merits of this album, so I'll only reiterate that the songs are lyrically and melodically excellent and produced brilliantly. Moreover, Neil's voice sounds incredibly good--frankly, I wasn't sure he was still capable of this level of vocal control and intensity. This album simply could not be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD puts your computer at risk.","review":"This CD is infected with a copy protection Rootkit that can cause your computer to be unstable and can expose it to viruses and other unwanted things.

Unlike most CDs released today, there's not one mediocre song on it (my two favorites are \\"Oh Mary\\" and \\"Delirious Love\\"). But you don't have to take my word for how good \\"12 Songs\\" is. You can preview it at myspace.com and check it out for yourself. And $10.99 is a great price for 12 really good original songs. The computer virus that was shipped on the CD is probably why it was discounted; but you'll be okay if you play the disc on a regular CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD","review":"This was a great CD and it was just as advertised.

He does still have a great and very unique voice, but this CD lacks in originality and diversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undiscovered talent","review":"While Ryan may have risen to fame with his time on the tv reality show RockStar, his songs on this album are fantastic.

However if I'm looking to listen to something mellow I would probably put this into the old CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indi with a touch of Ryan","review":"A+++ Must Have!Ryan Star is a singer/song writer.In my opinion, what sets him apart from so many other artists is how intense he is when he delivers his songs. He completely loses himself on each one of his songs, every time he plays them.Ryan presented his music acoustically. It is basically, Ryan and a Piano. Reportedly the album was recorded by himself in his living room, so, it all has a very indie feel to it, and many people slapped a label on him at that point as a \\"Male Tori Amos\\"But is it an amazing journey!My favorite song is \\"So Ordinary,\\" I find it freeing! Beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"new fan","review":"I'm a brand new fan of Ryan Star. I had never even heard of Ryan until a few days before seeing him open for David Cook. His performance blew me away! This album shows what an amazing voice Ryan has. Some of the songs are a little depressing at times but I find that I want to listen to this CD over and over again. Really looking forward to the release of his next album, \\"11:59\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good.","review":"In fact, so good, that if there had only been 10-12 songs on the album, it would have been 5 stars.Sorry, Ryan, the album was way to long, and some songs almost lost their identity to the 3 count piano tags. But despite that, it's still an amazing album. Damn near brilliant.ADDITION:I reneg. This album should have 5 stars, but i can't figure out how to change the rating. Go buy the Stage album, too. Different taste, same flavor. MMM-mmm Good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"The ball is nice and is pretty comfortable to play with, but not very durable.

I vote for \\"Stanley's Groove\\" as the funkiet on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a reason that all review are 5 stars","review":"As you probably already noticed, every other person has given this DVD/CD a perfect review. Thank God that this is the first DVD/CD combo released by a comedien, because hopefully it will encourage more people to do so. This was the funniest CD I've ever heard, and the greatest DVD I've ever seen. You may not have noticed, but out of everyone that was at the roast of Denis Leary, Dane Cook was the only one that was actually there and did a roasting that did not get made fun of by ANYONE else. Even when the host announced him to come on, he couldn't make fun of him, he just talked about how much talent he has. This guy is amazing, and he will one day rank up there is my favorite comedien right next to George Carlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough","review":"I love Dane Cook, and this is a must.

No waiting with Dane Cook. From the start to end, you'll laugh. Your face will hurt from laughing. No bullspit, if you are not laughing you're smiling because the guy is so animated you just sit there thinking he just aint right in the head and that's always funny when people aint right in the head.You will likely have to back the DVD up to catch what you missed while you & your friends were laughing so hard.You should really buy this DVD. I mean, like, go click over right now and buy this DVD and get it shipped overnight to your house and invite your friends over tomorrow night.Oh, and you might pee in your pants a little from laughing so hard. But don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated.","review":"I don't understand the hype surrounding this guy, honestly. All my friends rave about how funny he is, yet I find his material boring, unfunny, and full of annoying/stupid sound effects. I also can't take how he carries jokes out WAY too long. My wife finds this crap hilarious yet she can't explain why. Maybe Dane is like that guy in highschool that all the girls thought was so funny and yet all the guys hated his guts?With so many talented, original and funny comedy CD's (mitch hedberg, david cross, mike birbiglia, todd barry, patton oswalt, etc.) I can't imagine why you'd waste your money on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Sucks. He can't possibly have any fans over 30.","review":"Check out George Carlin little kids. That's a real comedian.

Dane Cook is such a physical comedian. His movements are a lot of what makes him funny--so I thought. Listening to his comedy is just as great! The cd and dvd have a lot of duplicated jokes (not a bad thing by any means), so you do have some visuals. The jokes on the dvd seem to be slightly edited. He is definately raw on the cd, which is the best. Anyone who listens to/watches this cd/dvd will be hooked. Your cheeks will literally hurt from laughing so hard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"It couldnt be any better. Ever. You might think it could be funnier, but you'd be wrong.

He talks about things that most of us know about, because we've been there and/or done that, so it's a \\"funny 'cause it's true\\" type of comedy. This CD/DVD will make you laugh until you cry, it's AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy, thy name is Dane!","review":"Dane Cook is simply the funniest comedian touring today, and this DVD proves it!

This DVD is hilarious, simply hilarious!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On, sweet god of comedy....","review":"I preordered this little jewel so that when it came out I could have it, and hold it and squeeze it. And that's what I did. I haven't stopped listening to this CD since I got it and the DVD is something I've been waiting for, for a long time. Anytime I want, I can listen to or watch some of the best stand up comedy I've ever heard. I also watched the Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary on which Dane Cook was a roaster-he was a genius as usual but I hate editing!!!! Why can't they play the whole thing??!!

DANE COOK you rule bro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best comedian ever!!!","review":"This is one of the best cds in the whole world.

I cannot get enough of it! Anytime someone hasn't seen it of my friends, thats the first thing we do when they come over. On my car ride from St.Louis to FL. I probably listened to the CD 5 times in the car and laughed my {bottom} off everytime. I have the DVD practically memorized but it still cracks me up everytime!

He's got some great lines, but as a whole I thought the DVD sucked.

Also, about 1/2 the material on the set is available free on the Dane Cook website."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny","review":"I am sure I'll get about 3 out of 40 people (or less) agreeing with me but I needed to get it off my chest. I have not seen or heard this DVD/CD, but i watched Dane Cook's Comedy Central special and I can't believe people were actually laughing. It is SO bad, the jokes are ridiculously lame but the audience still laugh like mad. This might just make me lose faith in the reviews in amazon and those people that gave Dane Cook low ratings were absolutely spot on. If you are 12 or below and you find Dane Cook funny, that is understandable, but I can't understand how so many adults laugh hysterically at his stupid antics on stage. Sad but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of $$","review":"I was excited to get Dane Cook's new CD because I have enjoyed his work so much. This was horrible.

The CD is excellent with joke after joke.. there is not a moment that lacks comedy.. it starts great and ends even better with a hidden track that brought me to tears of laughter. The DVD is wonderful.

Tears were streaming down my face. I bought this CD/DVD recently, and it has been in my car CD player ever since. I play it for everyone I know, and each time I listen to it and laugh like I'm hearing it for the first time. Dane is hilarious. He doesn't rely on the political or racial humor, just every day stuff. Car accidents, fast food (the BK lounge), old board games, public restrooms, shark attacks, bees, etc. There is something for everyone here. If you are a fan of comedy, or just plain like to laugh, get this CD! Get it now! You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooo freakin funny!","review":"Don't be a fool, buy this.

Its clean. Not as dark as D.I.C. and not as mainstream as Rock City. No more shots at Em and the Aftermath, and no more saying that everyone sounds like Big & Pac while using their beats. Carlos \\"6 July\\" and Royce really mix together well. Occasionally there is a (D+) hook/chorus on a song or two but overall the good outweighs the bad. Good Work Royce & R.I.P. Blade Icewood"},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Rap, Or Hip Hop?","review":"Honestly, after hearing 'Death Is Certain', this album doesn't even come close to how good that album was. There was more commercial, or should i say \\"bubble gum\\" rap in this album than any other he has made. It seems as if over the years, Royce has commercialized his music in a way, as to make it revolve around money, drugs, and bi*ches more than anything else. This is just my opinion. I only found a few songs on this album worth listening to...Royce should get his act together and go back to making real Hip Hop!!Edit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky Dance Music","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen, from the East Bay, Vallejo California we present Con Funk Shun. One of the better funk dance music bands in the early 80's, with a good combination of funk and dance. Not as funky as George Clinton and Parliment, and not as danceable as disco, but nevertheless a great combination without being too funky. You can kick back and listen to it, or get out and boogie.\\"Got to Get Enough\\" was one of the bigger singles off this album and one of my favorites.

The ballad Straight From the Heart is awesome! I was young when that song came out. It made me want to experience what love is. Felton Pilate's tenor voice sounds so beautiful!

However, after the first use and many trial there after, the bag continue to clog. I had to stop mowing to un-clog this bag over and over again.

The quality of the DVD is excellent, so we can clearly see the characters we loved (and some we didn't), as we watch Mark and Steve Sloan and company unravel mysteries all over again. It is as good, if not better, than we saw on TV. It is easy to select the specific episode you wish to view and the only difference from the original showings on TV is that you don't have those pesky commercials. I was anxiously awaiting the release of this program on DVD and sincerely hope that additional seasons are offered to the public soon. The only reason I did not rate this product a 5 is that one season isn't quite enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"Definatley one of my best purchases so far on Amazon.

Ah, how we southpaws must live in a right-centric world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for crusty bread","review":"This knife is lousy for cutting round and dome topped bread. The blade has a hard time cutting the crusty outside and the cutting guide does not work worth a hoot on curved loafs; the slicing guide cuts slices about 1/2 inch thick, like store white bread, to thin for crusty homemade bread. The knife seems to tear rather than slice good quality artisan bread. The wood blade holder is cracked where the rivet holds the blade, and it looks like it will fail quickly. Shipping was fast, but there was no tracking data provided, even after an E-mail request. Maybe this knife works on square loaf breads, but definitely don't buy it for artisan type breads. There is one positive however, it is a decent bagle cutter, if they're not too thick. I guess I'm just going to have to splurge on a good bread knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Chatterbox Now","review":"Ladies and gentlemen, buy this album NOW. It is filled with BLISS.

His music was sometimes brilliant and innovative. Often it was tepid and missing the mark. This disc certainly falls into the latter category. Cowell obviously struggled with the symphonic form. The two symphonies on offer here are lackluster and offer nothing worth remembering. A failed attempt at tonality with little or no organic development. Production is good as can be expected seeing that only 7 of the 63 minutes on the disc were recorded in stereo. For this era of Cowell's output, the discs on Koch do far better justice. For a truly ambitious and unique Cowell disc, search out the disc on Col Legno titled \\"American Piano Concertos\\". I had higher hopes for this disc, but knowing that I'd never listen to it again, I gave my copy to a friend. Maybe he'll find something in it that I missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Polk Audio!","review":"Polk has been my brand for years now. I honestly feel they make the best bang for the buck speakers in the industry. These are no different. I paired them with a Surround Bar 50 to be the true back surrounds while the Surround Bar 50 simulates the side surrounds in a 7.1 setup. They match the Surround Bar 50 perfectly, and the sound is very good. I'm also glad to see Polk is still making their speaker enclosures sturdy and stylish, with quality materials and components."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book Claire P2/R2","review":"This book is about an orphan named Tree who gets adopted for a year so he can help a small family called the Gundersons on their farm.

For one, the production is so much better than on previous releases.So if you are new to this band, definately get this album first, or the latest one, Battering Ram.The album opens up with Titans of our Time. This is a total neck mover!! If you arn't headbanging to this one, you ain't into proper metal!!There are a few mid tempo songs as well on the album as well as fast ones. There are not many keyboards on this album, its quite a basic no nonsense metal album really. There are many vocal harmonies on the album which makes the choruses melodic and catchy.If you are into Power Metal at all, check this out, its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Piet without Kai sounds even better!","review":"Who would have guessed that Kai Hansen was actually holding Piet Sielk back? That's certainly the way it seems as Condition Red definitely sounds much better than Iron Savior's previous releases. For those of you not aware, Iron Savior is Piet Sielk's epic sci-fi rock opera project which in the past seemed to be getting most of its attention from the presence of Kai Hansen (ex-Helloween, Gamma Ray), however, Kai has since abandoned this project to devote all his time to Gamma Ray. Well let me just say that after listening to Gamma Ray's latest album, Piet just blew you out of the water Kai! Condition Red is better than Gamma Ray's extremely weak and derivative No World Order in just about every way. Piet's vocals in particular are much better than Kai's and have a Dioesque quality to them as opposed to Kai's attempts to sound like he's a poor man's Rob Halford. Honestly if you love a good Power metal album, this is a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here... and still censored!","review":"Wildboyz is a fun show and I enjoy watching it on television.

At this point the show was still fresh and Steve-O and Chris Pontius were really trying to make it work rather than just phoning it in like they did in seasons 3+4. The show is actually somewhat educational believe it or not.

This show is not over the top like Jackass and Viva la Bam, but it is crazy, because you don't really know what's going to happen when you jump in the water with a Great White Shark. The animals don't act or play to the camera which is what makes it somewhat educating. You learn that even some of the nicest animals can still hurt you, and that some of the most vicious animals are not always so dangerous. I'm not saying to watch this because you will learn something, I just say watch it because it's funny and you don't know how the animals will react to what's happening; therefore teaching you at the same time what you shouldn't do around certain animals, even though you probably will never come into contact with most of the animals on the show.

Really, really bad.","review":"After some thought, I was able to narrow down the problems with this album to two. Firstly, it's supposed to represent the viewpoints of (primarily) Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. But it doesn't do so. It uses images of \\"rednecks\\" and \\"southern boys\\" which belong to the late 20th century. It's in no way an accurate \\"period\\" piece. But... after all, that might be asking too much from a country CD, right? Well... unfortunately, the lyrics are also really, really dumb. They're obvious, badly rhymed, and stupid (one song features the mispronunciation of \\"cavalry\\" as \\"calvary\\"). The one cool track, Bring Up The Twelve Pounders, is only a few seconds long.

She ought to make something a lot like the Saddle Club adventures--just with them being older and the books more advanced. And more about HORSES!

Overproduced, overly wordy, prettyboy country. Wayne has an okay voice, but he doesn't seem fully in control of his product, and has an unfortunate penchant for needlessly elaborate, stagily pseudo-intellectual material, like \\"True Friends,\\" a song about two childhood friends who meet in jail -- one's a prison guard, and the others a convict -- and \\"Papers Angels,\\" a shamelessly sentimentalized issue song about abducted children. Oh, and then there's also \\"I Love You This Much,\\" a weeper about some guy trying to get close to his distant dad, complete with swelling string sections and gushing vocals. Yawn, again. Memo to Nashville: can we just agree to keep the predictable, made-for-Dr. Phil, sensitive-guy, psychobabble songs down to a minimum, at least from here on? Maybe add a little twang from time to time as well? Thanks. (Axton)"},{"rating":"2","title":"90's Era Country","review":"I think that Jimmy Wayne has that 90's Era Country Voice.

The tone is confused and the spots of melodrama undermine both the sinister aspects and the parts that would be funny.

All was quiet, the lights were out and next thing I hear stomping, clapping and a lap-steel guitar. I was awake! Robert's energy is high and contagious! I am excited for Unclassified, as it received higher ratings and also checking out his other appearances on \\"Power of Soul, a Tribute to Jimi Hendrix\\" and hearing his \\"Live at the Wetlands\\".If you enjoy good 'ole fashioned 70's funk, soul mixed with Southern Rock, give it a whirl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I was trying something new and this album was recommended.

I am not sure what the point of the book is.It is a shame because the Azusa street revivals a talked about so mush and instead we get such a bleak boring banter about 'stuff'. I really wanted a book that was informative, inspiring and encouraging. But this book was so BORING that I did not read it to the end. I feel so bad to have wasted good hard earned money on it! Its collecting dust on my book shelf.I would not recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and compelling reading. A book on prayer.","review":"Written in old style English, this book is a straight forward account of the Revival, taking away any of the glamour romantically associated with Azusa Street. This is not a book for those with no prior knowledge of that great Revival, rather it fills in gaps, challenges on prayer and really centres on the moving of the Holy Spirit on several key people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item received not as advertised","review":"Item received was not as advertised.

In addition the book received was printed in 1982 rather than 2000 as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"When I saw author Herman Gollob interviewed on PBS' Newshour, I was so impressed, I impulse ordered the book. TILT! Frankly, the born again Jewish stuff was a real off-the-wall turnoff and most of the book is about his attempt to prove that KING LEAR is a Talmudic piece grounded in Judacia. He consistently returns to preach and preaching he does. I felt he abused our language to demonstrate his vast knowledge of words. He has a memoir that is vital and exciting and occasionally shone through. He should dump the Torah and write his own story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change as well as Shakespeare","review":"This is a powerful read, obviously about Shakespeare, as mentioned in above reviews, but as significantly, about a man's courage and willingness to change. I marvel that an age when many of his peers are fussing about their retirements homes and sore knees, Golob took on some very powerful changes -- religious, spiritual, and of course intellectual. The book shows us that it is never too late to change, to try new things, to embrace them with fervor and passion. I so admire Golob for this book, and (I am not a big Shakespeare) was genuinely shocked to find it so moving and relevant.Instead of succumbing to the first death -- when the mind closes and one begins whining about change -- Golob bravely reinvents and rediscovers himself. A really fine accomplishment, and a perfect gift for anyone veering close to mid-life and beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another gay film weakened by silly queens","review":"Well, what can one say? This mildly interesting film was so uneven. The good parts included the charming love affair - the two young men were genuinely attractive and nice people. There were some clever moments, such as the scene on the kerb between the lads and the older guy. Funny and well done. The usual caravansary of silly, loud queens - de rigueur in most gay themed films - came and went. The film worked best went they went. Their silly overacting and endless squeaks as tedious as usual. The dreadful non stop pop-crap music track was a definite downer and had litle to do with the drama. The fast forward button got over some of the dull bits. I almost gave up on the film untill the relationship got underway. Things improved from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to stupidity","review":"I'd switched on a free TV in the middle of the movie and was pleasefully amused with same gender affairs teen somehow-stupid comedy taking in a laughable world of adultscene quandaries, far away from the murdering, killing, shooting and simply rape of usually screened movies.This comedy is highly recommended for trying to have a rest from surrounding wherever on a globe where these topics are not taboo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very miss leading","review":"In the item description it states (Includes 12 pcs protector films, wiper card, and cleaning cloth) Well there are not 12 protector films, there is only one set (meaning one for the top screen and one for the bottom screen) It was not worth the money or how long it took to ship this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Goldsmith's score there was Reisenstein's for THE MUMMY","review":"Excellent Soundtrack composed by Franz Reinsestein, conducted by John Hollingsworth music director of HAMMER STUDIO (England), remasterized from the original recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Northing interesting here","review":"I bought these for my ferret thinking it would be a treat for her.

Both eat up different ferret chew-toy treats in mere moments, and they also seek out to try and gnaw on textures similar to these Marshall SuperChews, so I thought this item sounded perfect! I thought the texture would make the chews last longer than the others I've tried...well, I got my wish I suppose. Neither ferret will touch them, any of them. I tried everything it said on the packaging to encourage the ferrets to try them, nothing. I even tried my own tricks to get the ferrets to give them a try and even after getting them to briefly nibble they were still completely uninterested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for teaching someone the basics of Authorware","review":"I teach three Authorware Development classes for employees of my company. I use Authorware 4 Authorized for the Indroduction and Intermediate courses. The exercises are easy to follow and have real-world applications. I am also drawn to this book because it provides students with a copy of Authorware (50 icon version) to practice with at home. It is a great way for students to get familiar with Authorware before spending the money for the full version. If you are a beginner in self-study or are teaching a course in Authorware, you really should consider this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start","review":"I've been using Authorware since early 98. This book started it all for me. Granted it is a book for beginners. You won't find anything in it for scripting, tracking users performance, etc. If you know nothing about Authorware, this is a great book to get your feet wet. If you have to start from somewhere and don't want to spend money for a course, this is the place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginner Book","review":"This is a near perfect book on learning the fundamentals of Authorware. It builds knowledge from the ground up, and demystifyes this powerful authoring package. You learn why you are doing what you are doing, while you go through the tutorial. I was only disappointed in two things, but even these are trivial to the novice: 1) light treatment of functions and variables, it would be great to have a training book on writing authorware code. 2) Lack of fully built models and examples of real-life projects. The pieces included on the CD are small, and I found some of the graphics unprofessional.

My favorite song if hers to date is \\"Fantasy\\", especially the ODB Mix.Although, I do not like Boy Bands like 98 Degress, I was impressed when I sampled this CD single. I do like the 2nd track on this single (Celabatory Mix) because it has a dance club feel to it.If your a club person as I am you should enjoy the 2nd track especially. Personally, I don't care for the video or MTV for that matter. Nonetheless, I added this single to my other Mariah Single CD \\"Fantasy\\" from 1995.It may seem like I am slamming Mariah, but it's her new image that I dislike.

Her singing is accurate and tasteful, but not fiery (as it is on a pirate Straniera from Catania where she cuts loose to spactacular effect). Her big double arias in the first and final act are beautifully but introspectively sung -- she solidly delivers the goods. Unfortunately, the tenor, whose role is vital in this opera, is not up to the role. His dry voice, with plenty of vibrato, fails to supply the seductive caress the role (and all other Bellini roles) calls for. Solid conducting. This is a live recording from Trieste, but the audience is amazingly quiet and the few stage noises actually contribute to the dramatic effectiveness of the recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Little System","review":"I am pleased with the sound and the features of this little stereo.

You will be consumed by the urgency of the novel and may walk away with a few grey hairs, but in a strange way will experience a since of relief by Burn's tragic ending. Hats Off to Eric. OTRA, OTRA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Psychological Drama Like No Other","review":"BURN at times was a difficult read for me. The characters were very intense and complex, and at times I could really empathize with their pain. It is not like any book I've read before. Once each character was introduced and the novel began merging their relationships, then I became hooked. The book was well-written and kept me involved. Once I got to know the main characters, I could not stop reading it. I had to get to the end and find out what happened to them. I can see how a therapist wrote it. Many of the characters had major problems or addictions that came out strongly to the reader. In addition,as a Tucsonan, I found BURN's Tucson setting very interesting and fun to read. I would recommend this book to the reader interested in a psychological drama with a Tucson touch that keeps you guessing until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie ever","review":"What a mess! There was way too much that was not explained, for starters. The kid (Jesse) needs some acting lessons. Some special effects were OK, others were terrible - the outer space scenes were a joke, and when the bank blew up I swear that the guys on the balcony were in mid-air *before* the explosion *started*. Sheesh. The virtual game machines were ludicrous as well, and it was some coincidence that Jesse could just hop in and operate a seemingly complex control panel like an expert. Overall it was very difficult to follow, especially how the main characters memory appeard to be selective depending on what time they were in. The story had potential but the poor execution made it one of the worst movies I've ever seen, if the THE worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"After reading the plot synopsis on IMDB/Amazon and listening to the narration in the beginning of the movie, I can safely say that I have no idea what was going on in the movie.

The only saving grace this movie has is Duncan Regehr, who is far too graceful an actor to be wasted like this. Unfortunately, he is not on-screen nearly enough. For Regehr fanatics, a better choice is any of the \\"Zorro\\" videos or \\"Monster Squad\\", where he plays an unbelievably evil Dracula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feelin' The Blues","review":"Mad Dogs and Englishmen is truly a recording that is brimming with passion. Although most of the songs are covers, the performance from track to track is just oh so moving. The bluesy styles are quite varied ranging from the horn infested Honkey Tonk Women to the slow blues Bird On A Wire to the haunting ballad Superstar which features a fine lead vocal by Rita Coolidge. Also the acoustic duet between Cocker and Leon Russel on Dylan's A Girl From The North Vountry is qutie touching.The instrumental touches are quite fabulous. Leon Russel and Chris Stainton add many spirited keyboard touches. The backround vocals are oh so special too. One cannot forget the great horn playing by Bobbie Keys sand Jim Price. The fact that the Rolling Stones would use these guys on Sticky Fingers and Exile On Main Street speaks volumes.Anyway, Mad Dogs and Englishmen is a true gem from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Dogs and Englishmen","review":"This is my first experience with Amazon.com. and I couldn't be happier.The product arrived safely, much earlier than anticipated, and I love the CD.

With vocals that sometimes sound like Jagger, sometimes like Elvis Costello, this guy is a super songsmith with a distinct sound.

His combination of urban grit, hopeful romanticism, and catchy lyrics should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great introduction","review":"Hard to argue with the choice of songs on this single disc compilation. Of course it's incomplete; Garland Jeffreys had so many excellent songs recorded by the time they released this disc that there were bound to be many songs excluded that are favorites of his fans. But if you are new to Garland's music and want to know why he is so beloved by so many music fans, this CD would be a very good start.

It is the most profound study on human decadence and malice I have ever read. The horrible part of it, is that all happened, it was all true.

My congratulations to the author and its publishers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder of why Mario Vargas Llosa enjoys such acclaim.","review":"This work is Vargas Llosa at his best! The novel is a frightening view of the moral degradation and sycophancy that the Trujillo dictatorship engendered, and an equally painful critique of human nature. Why are people so willing to accomodate such blatant evil? And why are amoral opportunists so readily overlooked and so frequently rewarded? Since the novel is based on history, these are not abstract philosophical questions. To its credit, the novel makes the reader ponder these issues, even while the reader may wish to bathe in Lysol after finishing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of thes best work os Mario Vargas Llosa","review":"Excelente este ultimo libro de Vargas Llosa, en el nos relata como fue la vida del dictador dominicano Trujillo, la novela nos introduce en la fastuosa vida de este personaje."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-ray of a dictatorship","review":"An X-ray into a dictatorship that all of Latin America is talking about.What can be said about \\"La Fiesta del Chivo\\"? For starters, it is my favorite novel. One of the biggest complements I heard was by a Dominican friend who said he could not believe the author was not from the Dominican Republic. The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa captures the Dominican culture, humour, expressions, and history in an incredible way.Vargas Llosa takes us back in time to the last days of the Trujillo regime and slowly opens our eyes to the horrors of the Era. I strongly recommend this book to anyone; especially those interested in Latin America, human rights, and the struggle for democracy. Vargas Llosa put it best when he said, \\"literature is fire\\".One final note, Dr. Balaguer has to be one of the most interesting \\"fictional\\" characters since Mario Puzo's Godfather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent piece of work","review":"My father bought this book for me and I have cherished it everyday since. My father and I are both avid readers of Dominican history and this book is the best I've ever read.

Of course, he enjoyed US support for his his \\"anti-communist\\" stance, all the while, brutally torturing and killing those who questioned his regime.

Avant comes off like a weak R.Kelly clone in many of the songs, and in all honesty Avant is a much stronger singer than Kells.

His voice is so sweet and soothing. His bedroom eyes seduce you and his music takes care of the rest. His maturity is evident on songs like \\"You Aint Right\\" and \\"Suicide\\". \\"Making Good Love\\", the debut single is sexy, but risky. Still Avant takes it to another level with \\"Don't Say No, Just Say Yes\\" a soulful ballad that leaves us screaming \\"YES\\"!!! \\"What Do You Want\\" is definitely club worthy. Avant's apologetic \\"Sorry\\" definitely makes us want to forgive him. Avant's second time around is sprinkled with experience, but he is staying true to his bump-n-grind roots. He still gives us the beautiful ballads where his talent is blatantly evident as well as potential.

Most guys can be the not-so-cute type of guys, but if they can sing, they will get some play. Avant is truly in that definition.Steve Huff clearly doesn't fit with Avant, because from listening to most of the slow songs on the album, he don't need to be working with him. The only song that I can prop Avant for is SUICIDE. Steve Huff did do great on that with him.Avant needs to find his niche, he will never find it with Steve Huff.Don't waste your money.

It was so much garbage...the only good song ( in my opinion) was the one he dropped for the single and I don't even know the name of it. He can sing but that's about all.

The earphones conect to the microphone module using 3.5 mm plug and the microphone module connects using a 2.5 mm plug and the phone uses the LG proprietary USB connector. I firt bought a 3.5 mm USB adapter which let me connect the earbuds to the phone and seemed to work, but to use it as a hands free phone I had to also by a 2.5 mm plug adapter. My last LG phone had a 2.5 mm headphone adapter built in and that was what I was expecting when I bought the phone.

The features were good and it would do what it is intended for however I don't use use them. The headset hurts my ears. They are metal without any cushion and after a short time of use they made my ears sore. They aren't very secure either.

I went to RadioShak first to buy an adapter for $5- didn't work- LG is proprietary. The sound quality on the included ear buds isn't too bad for the price, but I don't like using buds and wanted to use my regular headset. Because this headset is two pieces, I could separate just the adapter portion and it works perfectly with any headset- plus with the inline volume control you can adjust the volume of your music/conversation on the EnV without having to unlock the phone. Very nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very uncomfortable","review":"it works awesome but i just cant get around how uncomfortable they are they are big and they hurt your ear after a while i bought them and if i had to pick between this one and another 4 star head set i would pick these because they are reliable and you can plug any other normal jack in to the adapter and it works fine because the mic is in the adapter they deserve a 4 star but i would give them a 5 if they came with better ear phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"LG Handsfree Stereo Headset","review":"I needed a new headset when I upgraded phones to the LG Rumor Touch. My old phone had a 2.5mm jack and the new Rumor touch has a 3.5mm jack. I could have gotten an adapter but that was basically the same price as many new headsets. I chose this product because the description specifically said \\"For use on either 2.5mm or 3.5mm headset jacks\\". Based on that product description, I concluded that an adapter came with the product...I was wrong. Now I have a new headset with the same 2.5mm plug that I already had with my old unit.

Very easy to hear the person on the other line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Middle School","review":"This book is wonderful for teaching persuasive writing in middle school. While another reviewer mentioned the brevity of each entry, I find the shortness most appealing. It offers just enough information to stimulate student thought without being overwhelming. Because it offers pro and con points for each topic, students are assisted in acknowledging counter-arguments in their essays. I use it as part of a weekly homework packet in which students write an essay using the prompt of the week. This is one of my most prized teaching tools. Under-prepared students gain access to critical topics and advanced students have an opportunity to excel.Topics that brought great controversy wereIn disasters like the Titanic, should women and children be saved first?Should animals be used for testing?Do police belong in schools?Do teens belong in adult prisons?Should music be rated?Should the US be the police of the world?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book To Start With","review":"I teach an oral expression class to upper elementary students and this book was really usfull in helping me to get them use to debating!

However, now that I have looked at an excerpt of the book I find myself dissapointed. This book is a joke. The section I looked at was about using products on animals. However it provided ONE PAGE of information and it was basic ideas that were pretty obvious without the books help. Like the fact that some animals die? We all knew that. So it really had no help whatsoever. Do not buy this book unless you are interested in reading fifty topics with minimal information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute cake pan!","review":"I like this heavy Nordic ware. The first cakes came out picture perfect, without sticking. I only used cooking spray the first time. The second time, they stuck a little more and one cake tore in half. There are too many and too deep of crevices (which is what makes the detail so great) to butter and flour the pan. But I tried just buttering it the third time and it was a little better. However, not all six cakes released perfectly after the first time. They make wonderful gifts, as people are amazed at the little Viking detail. Maybe not so great for fruit type cakes with chunks in the batter. Smooth batters only - raisins okay. I give it a four."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Star","review":"Klaus Badelts' score for \\"The Time Machine\\" is a wonder. One of the best orchestral soundtracks to just listen too in many a year.

I look forward to Mr. Badelt's future projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music review","review":"I bought this soundtrack CD because of having watched a lot of reviews saying that this's an excellent CD and the composer was the one of the co-composers in Gladiator.I listened to the CD right after I've brought it home. Well, honestly, I couldn't find a piece of the music in which I felt like listening to Zimmer's work and neither did I find a memorable music. I didn't buy it earlier because this CD had been priced even more expensive than buying thru' amazon+delivery costs. But after I've listened to it.... I was so disappointed.I remember one said the piano solo in the beginning was so noble the I would definitely love it. I also remember one said the track 'MoXXX attack' was making one wanted to hit his head to the wall....... but I'm sorry.

Well, guess what song is NOT in the CD? Yes, the trailer song.I still haven't figured it out if it's because of some copyright issue, an error, or plain stupidity, but the fact is that the song that most people like when watching the movie, is precisely the one that is not included.To be fair, the rest of the songs are quite good, and that's why I didn't give the CD one star. But since those songs were not the reason why I purchased it, I still feel it is at the very best deceiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Machine OST","review":"Well put together soundtrack, like it more than I liked the movie.

There are hints of Hans Zimmer's style in the score, so if you're a fan of any of his earlier work, you will like this score. Overall, this is a very enjoyable album complete with gentle love themes, pulsating choirs and rhythms and even a little bit of horror movie music. I'm looking forward to hearing more music from Klaus..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I've always wanted.","review":"\\"The Time Machine\\" is one of my favorite movies.

There are truly great moments in this requiem, but there do remainmovements I find a little pompous. All in all it is really worth adding to your collection, just like his C Minor requiem. The symphony is very charming as well.The interpretation is about as good as it gets, sober and with the pathos. Markevitch has a great control over the orchestra and choir.Actually for a recording that dates from the sixties it's not that bad, and the basses are clearly present. It's the trebles that are missing and so it makes me want to continue looking for another requiem. Still the voices are reasonably distinct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its too much for an individual student","review":"It kind of too much for me coz Im just a high school student.

As a presentation of what was known at that time, it cannot be beaten. The only problem with it is that a lot more has been discovered, so a modern treatment of the subject is better for the beginner who wants to be properly informed. For this I suggest the books by Copi or even Kleene. But if you don't care about modernity, or have an interest in the way things used to be done, I strongly recommend this book.

My favorite song on this album, however, is \\"Lazer Metrayeta\\" - a playful, bouncy, staccato elaboration of a wistful accordion riff (with a melody reminiscent of Sheila E's \\"Glamorous Life\\" chorus) from Plankton Man.

When I was recommending this book (I've stopped doing that) about half the people who got it ran into these code bugs.

This is one such book. It will tell you what a stored procedure is, how to code it, what some of the syntax is - the basics - without really going into the details. In other words, you won't learn anything from this book that you couldn't learn on your own in an afternoon with the Books Online and Query Analyzer.

I feel like I really wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"There is really nothing in this book that you can't get from other sources, most especially the Books Online.

Boy, was I wrong. I guess size isn't everything :-)The TSQL included w/the book isn't very advanced, despite the title. It's about the same level as the Books ONline -- not advanced at all. I haven't yet found a trick I didn't already know about, and I don't consider myself a TSQL expert.A far better book is Henderson's Guru's Guide book. It's an expert-level book written by an expert for those who want to become experts themselves.This one is just another sad tribute to dead trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little like reading the BOL, only not as well written","review":"Reading this book is like reading the BOL (many sections resemble the BOL far too closely), only it's not as well written as the BOL :-) I wish I could come up with something positive to say about the book, but there really isn't anything. It offers nothing more than what you might expect to find in the BOL, except that it's written really poorly. These guys should definitely keep their day jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pathetic excuse for an advanced book","review":"Whatever caused these guys to think they had an advanced book here? This is strictly a beginner's book, and a poor one at that. As some of the other reviews have pointed out, the prose is fairly horrible and definitely indicates a problem with English as a language. More importantly, though, is the fact that there's little here that isn't also in the BOL (Books Online) that come with SQL Server. I was also put off by how weak the SQL 2000 coverage is. There are a good number of new features/functions/etc. in SQL 2000's Transact-SQL that aren't in this book. If you're going to regurgitate the vendor's online docs, the least you could do is do a complete job of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Having read a few other T-SQL books, I can honestly say this is the worst one of the bunch. It's poorly written and the techniques it shows are not advanced in the least. You get the impression that these guys do not actually work in the \\"trenches\\" they mention so often. This is in the top ten of the worst computer books I've ever had the misfortune to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Henderson's book instead","review":"There is just one problem with \\"Advanced Transact-SQL for SQL Server 2000\\": it is not \\"advanced\\" in the slightest. Not atleast compared to Kenneth W. Henderson's \\"The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL\\".I've been coding in the language for about 3 years now and didn't find a thing in it that I didn't already know. Henderson's book, OTOH, opened whole new worlds to me. Don't buy this book. Buy Henderson's book instead -- really, you'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not advanced enough for me","review":"What does the word \\"advanced\\" actually mean? I thought it meant coverage above and beyond the vendor docs. I mean, that's why you buy a book like this, right - to get what you can't get from the vendor, right? Instead of advanced Transact-SQL, we get to suffer through page after page of nonsense like Itzik's code indention style vs. Tom's indention style. Who cares? The one used in the book doesn't match either of them!We get errors galore, too. Why so many? Well, when you spend all your time talking about writing newsgroup messages and other inappropriate material for a book, you neglect the really important stuff. That's what has happened here.

There are numerous errors and typos in the book. I wrote the authors about these but have yet to receive a reply. Several of the example queries simply don't work. I also didn't think the book was written very well. Overly long sentences and $50 words seem to be a favorite of the authors. For example, I came across one doozie that was four and a half lines long. That's way too long for a single sentence. The book looks as though it hasn't yet been edited. Wouldn't waste my money if I were you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the Books Online","review":"Most of this book is little more than a rehash of the Books Online.

It's not advanced in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't bought this book","review":"I guess I have a different definition of the word \\"advanced\\" than the author of this book. He apparently thinks it means \\"about the same as the BOL.\\" I think it means \\"beyond the BOL, WAY beyond.\\" I think an advanced book should feature things I haven't seen elsewhere and that teach me techniques beginner books don't. But that's not the case. IMHO, this is strictly a beginner's book, and not a very good one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned mine yesterday","review":"Worst hodgepodge of a book I ever read.

If you want to learn transact-sql, get a different book - this one ain't gonna get you there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not advanced at all","review":"The problem, it seems to me, is that Henderson's The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL has raised the bar on what exactly constitutes an advanced T-SQL book. Books like this would do well to take notice. The book has some good info at times, but it's not more advanced than, say, the docs that come with SQL Server.If the book were titled Transact-SQL for Beginners, maybe it would more fit the bill, I don't know. For my money, this book really wasn't worth the trouble. I'd say, maybe, 10% of it is useful to a T-SQL coder with any real experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a rehash of the Books Online","review":"The book is heavily influenced by the Books Online. You almost come away from it feeling that the BOL should get a co-author credit. It's far from Advanced if Advanced is defined by that which goes beyond the BOL. I can't think of any part of the book that stands out as really beyond the BOL. There's the nigh useless deviation into complex math in T-SQL (why not try some graphics routines while you're at it <g>), but there's nothing that says, \\"Hey, look at me - I'll tell you something you could never learn from the BOL.\\" The book was really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many holes","review":"This book has far too many holes. There's too much stuff left out. We spend all day talking about Itzik's coding style vs. Tom's, but we don't ever talk about statistical functions, star-schema joins, performance tuning, or the myriad other Transact-SQL related topics. Intead, this is a poorly done one-off of magazine articles that weren't that good in the first place..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"I keep getting books that aren't worth the paper they're printed on.

It's a real disappointment. All the (useful) info in this one can be found with a couple clicks of the mouse in the BOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a COMPLETE waste of time","review":"I don't agree with the other review on here that says this book is a complete waste of time. There are a few bright spots here and there. If you're very new to SQL Server, you may find, say, 5% of the book to be useful and to pass on info that you won't find in the Books Online.However, I do agree that the narrative is pretty uneven at times. You can definitely tell that more than one person wrote this book (e.g., when you see completely different code formatting on the SAME page :-).I didn't get much out of the book myself, hence the two-star review. Then again, I'm an advanced SQL Server developer (MCDBA) who's been working with the product for about two years now. The book was definitely beneath me, but if you're just starting with SQL Server you might learn a few things from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omits crucial info","review":"Would like to have seen coverage of all the new features in SS 2000. Instead, the coverage is hit and miss. There are also mistakes in many of the examples. I was expecting deep coverage of advanced Transact SQL, but this book doesn't deliver. If you're a complete beginner, it might offer something useful for you, but otherwise, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book, just not very advanced","review":"It's not that this book is very bad, it's just that it doesn't live up to its title. Frankly, I think the real problem here is that Henderson's Guru's Guide book has redefined the word \\"advanced.\\" His book is _advanced_ - really advanced. So much so that, if you're a complete beginner, you may struggle with it. From that standpoint, this book pales in comparison and is not really advanced.

Unfortunately, there's nothing really to be excited about with this one. There are far too many errors and other gaffs to make this book worth any real excitement.

The writing is terrible, as several others have pointed out, and there's really nothing advanced about the examples.

The model displays poor posture in almost every photo, with a curved back (Tai Chi demands a straight back) and lack of precision in positioning of hands and feet. As a martial artist with moderate experience interested in learning Tai Chi, the sloppiness in form was very disappointing. Contrast this book with the expert and distinct posture and position of, say, Master Liang's book, and the technical errors are even more glaring.As it demands great self-control and awareness, Tai Chi is virtually impossible to learn well without a teacher, and this book will not help you in any case. To really learn good technique, find a solid teacher, and get a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad technique but informative","review":"The photos in the book are very clear but that's a bad thing... The book presents bad technique and form. As a tae kwon do, wing chun, and with a months experience in tai chi, even I know that it has bad form. But, the book gives you a lot of information and teaches a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ninth Buddha is mystically entwining and captivating.","review":"The Ninth Buddha is the absolute best mystery novel that I have ever read.

According to an online biography, he was a successful western and B-movie actor, went on to produce and direct some of his own films, including 'The Steel Claw,' and was Dinah Shore's original long-time husband.This action-adventure has a passable B-movie plot about a disabled marine on a one-man mission to rescue an officer in the early days of the Japanese invasion of the Phillipines, complete with several love interests and decent supporting character development. While the low-budget production values are hard to overlook, the biggest problem is the poor quality of the transfer to DVD. It looks as bad as many home movies.If you like this actor, marine corps or WWII stories, or just like to watch a character who never says die, then you could indulge in this bargain-priced DVD. Just don't expect a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"chopin/sverdlov","review":"This is a terribly disapointing recording. The young performer lacks maturity, sincerity, and energy. In fact, the performances are (seemingly unintentionally) pompous and narcissistic. The sixth prize winner at Queen Elizabeth clearly has technical gifts, but there is very little here worth listening to. It is surprising he won any prize at all, considering the self-congratulatory personality coming through. There is no overall direction, but lots of trivial rubati going on which ruin the beauty of the compositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"lori j","review":"The best smelling candle ever!

They have catchy tunes, however the rythym could be a bit faster. The lyrics are all about growing up being gay, getting picked on, the apect of being a homosexual, sticking up for homosexuals. ...

If you like gothic, cross-dressing, homosexuals, this cd is for you, just have respect not to influence the young sibblings with the CD if you own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Bummer","review":"I've enjoyed a number of Mr. Hogan's books in the past but I actually put this one down after 460 pages with only 65 pages to go. It seems to have every one-dimensional charactor and plot cliche you would expect to see in a bad SciFi book. All the scientists are good guys and all the politicians and media are bad guys (and of course they're conspiring together to hide the \\"truth\\"). Although there was some interesting science it couldn't overcome a depressing and predictable plot. By the time the hero (a scientist, of course) realizes that he's been in love with his assistant all along you just wish they would both die and put us all out if our misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the story?","review":"I've painfully tried to find my way through this book, it certainly looked good on the shelf. After 100 pages I couldn't figure out what the story was about. I had an idea it was about new theories of planetary and solar system development, but there were so many other \\"facts\\" and theories being thrown about, I got confused.There are lots of half baked and half developed theories. Most of the story is developed in cryptic, espionage-esque dialog. The science is marginal, and there is a tremendous focus on the politics of science and the reluctance to accept different views.There could have been something good here.I rate this as a decent idea with terrible execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"SciFi for the New Ager","review":"Hogan has done serious science fiction in the past. His science was good and his characters even better. Thus, its a disappointment to read \\"Cradel of Saturn.\\" It could have been written by one of my Pyramid hugging, Astrologer friends.The characters are out of central casting, and have no depth. The theme is typical New Agey. Ie. Traditional scientists are naughty and unimaginative, but those willing to think imaginatively are right. The plot is predictable, and the ending clumsy and unbelieveable.Hogan has ignored so many basic scientific laws that it would be a waste of time to recount them. This is not that important a book.Every author has a bad book in him. This is Hogan's. I read it to the finish, but would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Science Fiction","review":"I couldn't put the book down until it was finished. As stated by Mr. Wyman, Science Fiction is FICTION! Get a grip! If you don't have an imagination and open mind you shouldn't be reading any of this! Science Fiction isn't intended to set forth a thesis, it's here to entertain and James Hogan did exactly that!James - great writing as always! Thanks and keep it coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the reviews I had high hopes. It's hard to find good scifi authors. Found the book tedious. The characters are thin and the extraneous details are just that, extraneous. I would rate it as almost OK. Read Heinlein, Asimov, Stephenson, Gibson, or any of the many other genuinely good scifi authors, and give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, predictable, unbelievable","review":"I'm a huge Hogan fan but found this title to be a huge disappointment. Maybe I'm burned out on Hogan but I could almost predict what was going to happen next in the story. Free thinking scientist is the hero, evil goverment/corporate scientist is the villian. Totally wild ideas are introduced, the Earth orbiting Saturn during the dinosaur age and thus reducing the Earth's gravity? A proto planet just barely scraping Earth in orbit? I know James is in contact with many scientist buddies which makes his books believable but I think he needs someone to tutor him on orbital mechanics, the ideas here are a joke. Oh well maybe I'll go back and read some of his classics again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle of Saturn is stillborn","review":"Science Fiction is, by the very title, supposed to have at least a bit of real science to it, and James Hogan usually lives up to that custom rather well. In this book, however, he disinters the hoariest of pseudoscience, that of Immanuel Velikovsy, who in a series of truly awful best-sellers several decades ago sent planets ricocheting around the solar system rather like billiard balls, thereby accounting for all sorts of ancient history. As a practicing geologist, I found \\"Cradle of Saturn\\" to violate everything we know to be true about earth history, and to be preachy and righteous about it to boot. I found I could not enjoy the story when the background was so profoundly antiscience and factually incorrect - suspension of disbelief was quite impossible. That said, if you can ignore or even ignore this outer fringe worldview, the story itself was gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"Lens do not adjust so that they can also be used as sun glasses.

Yes there is some basic, stress basic, information about how to draft, and the elementary concept of the kitchen work triangle, but no new ideas here. It is disappointing that the NKBA would put their name on such a book.

Of particular importance is Aunger's stress that cultural particulars (like ideas, beliefs, knowledge etc.) are brain states. At last we find the brain taken seriously. It is to be hoped that the standard of meme literature will continue to increase in sophistication as it has markedly done in Aunger's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aunger gets ahead of himself","review":"This is rigorous and well researched, but it gets ahead of itself. To say that memes (or meme components) correspond to some sort of pattern in human brains is saying more than we know now about the correspondence between brain states and our thoughts and experiences. If we don't know this for one brain, then certainly we don't know how these analogous states can be replicated across brains. Ambitious work, but too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The difference between reality and metaphor","review":"In this meandering attempt to create a generalized theory of the meme the author piles his speculations and theories high.

The main problem with it, in my opinion, is that it does not really tell you \\"how to\\", it just tells you what you should do. And the things that you are supposed to do are not few! I was looking for some short-cuts, but that was apparently not the idea of the author. The language style is very advertising-like, with most sentences being short imperatives almost like commercial, pseudo-philosophical slogans.What I liked best about the book was the section on stress-free entertainment. Ms Walter suggests to cook the day before the guests arrive, and provides recipies as examples. Those look tempting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've always loved Danger Mouse","review":"I discovered Danger Mouse when I was a teenager and I've always loved the quirky tongue in cheek humor.

There are a lot of quotable lines in these episodes much like Monty Python. Not for American kids, maybe not even for British kids, but definitely fun to watch for the silliness, spoofiness and over the head remarks.

There are many cartoons from your youth that can still be enjoyed when you are an adult, but this is not one of them. The animation is poor, even for its day, and the plots are really not all that amusing. It is certainly not what I would call horrible, or even bad, but maybe mediocre at best. If you are looking for a funny and enjoyable cartoon, even for adults, from the 70s/80s era, I would recommend the Pink Panther and Inspector Clousseau cartoons...they are still great to watch after all of these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to like this show","review":"And I still might, except they took the totality of each episode and just ran them one after the other. I don't need or want the introduction song and beginning and ending credits for EVERY 5 minute episode! It made the whole thing unbearable after 3 episodes. It's still funny English satire comedy, but neither myself or my niece and nephew wanted to continue watching when it felt like we were spinning our wheels and barely getting anywhere. Being used to full length Disney and Pixar features might have ruined us, but this series would be much better if it ran the credits and then the entire multi-episode story arc, and then credits.

This is one of 2 of Stings best because above all he doesnt forget his sense of humor throughout. The album is so listenable and includes some of his best ballads. Well be Together is here in its original form, it was 'smoothed out' for his greatest hits collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Solo Effort","review":"Fresh off a burning tour with some of the best young jazzers money could buy (see video \\"Bring on the Night\\") Sting updates and integrates those elements into his brilliantly wordsmithed songs. What started as a brilliant case study on \\"Dream of the Blue Turtles\\" here becomes a Modus Operandi, and a perfect backdrop for his lyrical references to Shakespeare, politics and myth. There are plenty of hits here as others have described, the songs stand the test of time. The real charm of this album is the chamber jazz gentileness integrated seamlessy into a pop sensibility. And this band rocked too...find a live recording of \\"Little Wing\\" from this time and you'll see what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting at his best.......","review":"This album has something for everybody. The quality of the musicians and the music itself meant it could never fail. Personally, my favourite is Sister Moon followed by a fantastic cover version of Little Wing. On Little Wing,the guitar solo and Brandford Marsalis's alto sax solo made me stop whatever I was doing and just listen. Unbelievable......... Being a Police fan for years I thought Sting did an excellent job of seperating his past from the present on this album. Very polished, not as skittish as \\"Blue turtles\\" The guys a legend....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting at his best","review":"This is by far the best solo album of Sting. From the very first time I heard it I was 100% sure that it would be impossible for him to make a better album. Another reason why I particularly like this album is because I used to listend to it when I was in Kenya.The variety of the music stles in this album is amazing and whatever style Sting experiments with he excels. In the plus of the album is that it has the lyrics.16 years later all the songs still sound great and especially the song Fragile is as timely as ever.Buy this cd, sit back, and enjoy great music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting explores new horizons.","review":"NOTHING LIKE THE SUN is quite an eclectic listening experience. It's simultaneously catchy yet not as immediately accessible as his earlier DREAM OF THE BLUE TURTLES. This album defies easy characterization. It has all of the earlier Sting elements of pop and jazz, but with *something* else that can't really be put into words thrown in for good measure.\\"The Lazarus Heart\\" is a wonderful song, one of Sting's best in a star-studded catalogue. It's a longing, mourning song. \\"Be Still My Beating Heart\\" is beautiful in simplicity and message-another great song. \\"We'll Be Together\\" was the big hit off this album, and even now it still bursts with energy and finese. \\"The Secret Garden\\" is also a great tune. Perhaps the nicest surprise here is the inclusion of the JIMI HENDRIX song \\"Little Wing\\". As much as I love Jimi's version, I have to say that Sting's is just *gorgeous* and he really gives the song its due. A good album that continued Sting's hit parade."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only want one Sting CD, make it this one.","review":"I am a major Sting fan, so it's hard to try and label any single one CD as my favorite. But I gotta say that if you were to force me, this would be the one.Not only does this have \\"Englishmen in New York\\" and \\"Fragile\\", which Sting generally plays at his concerts, but there are some other gems that without this CD, you'll miss. \\"Be Still My Beating Heart\\" is a slow, beautiful love song for the cautious, \\"Rock Steady\\" is a rather witty commentary on Noah's Ark, and then there is the haunting \\"They Dance Alone\\", a song about Chile's 'disappeared'. Additionally, the CD's booklet contains all the song lyrics, as well as commentaries about all the tracks.There's a little something for everyone here -- lovers, (both of life and music), songs that make you laugh, cry, and simply smile. A great collection of music, an essential recording no one should miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Sting's first three solo albums remained fresh progressions in his career, and this ambitious and lengthy one is no exception. There are some outstanding songs here, including \\"The Lazarus Heart,\\" \\"Straight to My Heart,\\" and \\"Englishman in New York.\\" At his best, Sting blends experimental styles and tempoes all in the same song, and makes it seem easy. However, given the scale of the project, this album is overall a mixed bag. Songs like \\"Rock Steady\\" and \\"We'll Be Together\\" are amusing, but they aren't really up to the level of some of the rest of them. \\"The Secret Marriage\\" is kind of a vague song, but I do like this mellowish version of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing.\\" All in all, this album is well worth owning. Sting has always been very good, and here we find him at a stage where he was still expanding his vision instead of merely consolidating it, as he did in most of the nineties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old and new","review":"Following the radical departure of \\"Dream of the Blue Turtles,\\" Sting is free to experiment further with different, sometimes mellow styles. The results are mixed in this long, eclectic album. His political song, \\"They Dance Alone,\\" holds up well despite its datedness of specific subject matter. (The sleeve notes give thanks to Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler for playing on it, but where the deuce are they? I sure can't hear them anywhere!) \\"We'll Be Together\\" is a disappointing late eighties echo drum machine dance thing. Overall it's enjoyable, and you can pick your own favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting at his Best","review":"For the majority of people who believe Sting was better with The Police, _Nothing Like The Sun_ pretty much proves this theory wrong. Surrounding himself with excellent musicians such as Manu Katche, Kenny Kirkland, Branford Marsalis, Andy Summers, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler and many others, this is Sting's strongest set of songs. The album also contains some of Sting's best lyrics and best vocal performances. The album feels like Sting at his most free - he's definitely making music for himself here as opposed to his recent work that often seemes to cater to the mainstream. _Nothing Like The Sun_ also has a little bit of everything; songs like \\"The Lazarus Heart\\", \\"We'll be Together\\", and \\"Little Wing\\" simply rock and \\"The Secret Marriage\\", \\"Fragile\\", and \\"Sister Moon\\" are soothingly beautiful. The production is top-notch and this rather long album has absolutely no filler. Pick this one up if you prefer the serious side of Sting."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME GREAT SONGS..... but others disappoint this Sting fan.","review":"What can I say? I'm a Sting fan. Highlights are 'Englishman in New York', 'Fragile', and 'Be Still My Beating Heart'. There are a few songs on this cd that don't seem to measure up to Sting's capabilities. The production quality is not as good as other Sting recordings either. For those reasons this one doesn't get a 5 star rating from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's nothing like Sting!","review":"Oh,my god! This is the BEST album I've ever heard! Really great work,Sting! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I started at the other end of Sirenia's discography, getting hooked on their newest work first and working my way back. I had read some prior reviews complaining that the newer work, which I really enjoyed, didn't compare to this album. After listening to this album several times, I now understand why. While the newer albums are really good, this album is a masterpiece. A layering of growling, female vocals, guitar riffs, keyboards and violin solos.It's mesmerizing and some of the songs are almost hypnotic. Absolutely brilliant is all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a great CD from begining to end!","review":"My two favorites on this CD are \\"ON THE WANE\\" and SISTER NIGHTFALL\\" the whole CD is nicely arranged with a slight mainstream metal sound;that is until Morten's metal growls, which contast with Fabienne beautiful voice.I like her much more than their new singer.This might be the best or at least one of the best of this style of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the Veil = At Sixes and Sevens","review":"I have a bit of a soft spot for this album. Does it deserve a 5? Maybe in reality its a 4.5. But Ever since Widow's Weeds ive been a near raving fan of anything created by this mastermind. If you like older Tristania, you'll love this. Thats about all I can say about it. Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Morten Veland does it again","review":"Ex-Tristania frontman Morten Veland does it again with this new band. It's almost exactly in the style of Tristania's Beyond the Veil, except the industrial influences are pretty much gone and the female vocals are not as crucial as in Tristania (or quite as unique). I would give this album 4.5, but I had to pick 4 or 5, and it definitely deserves 5. I would subtract the .5 because at times the guitar riffs don't seem as catchy or innovative as on BTV, but the overall emotion and mixture of sounds definitely works. Fans of pre-World of Glass Tristana will surely NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"good? huh?","review":"I am confused by all of the positive reviews. I like tamales but am way too lazy to make them, so I tried these from a can. Maybe I like spicy food too much because I found these rather bland and didn't enjoy the sauce.

I bought 3 cans of this at the local market because it looked good on the can and they were on sale.

And to think I have two more cans of this crap sitting in my cupboard. If anyone wants 'em, you can have 'em.I suppose they could make a good menu item in any prison for the guy in solitary confinement and they want to torture him, or send a case to some starving kid in Ethiopia who will appreciate it.Would I recommend this product?

Add fresh veggies as a side.","review":"When I was a child my mother would very infrequently buy a can or two to serve as a special treat because the whole family enjoyed them. I have an emotional association with the product, and still love them. These are great when added to no-bean chili, served over rice or potatoes, or as a side dish served with other more nutritional fresh foods. I let them simmer in a covered pan until the masa coating is soft before removing the paper wrappers. The sauce can create more servings when added to other ingredients and I am experimenting with more recipes that include the tamales.

Upon the first smell of them out of the can, it was a bit of a dog food odor. The taste? Sort of mushy, meaty baby food consistency. Bland and not very good at all.

My youngest great grandchild is 4 and every morning he wants a scrambled egg and a tamale, every morning like clockwork. They are easy to send with him to the baby-sitters house and there are enough in the can for others if necessary. Good flavor, good protein; serve with a small salad and there you have it. I could not find it in the store so ordered a case and I am very happy I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knowing what to expect","review":"When you purchase canned tomatoes, you do not expect to find a plump, juicy intact tomato like you would purchase in the produce aisle. So, expecting these tamales to equate to fresh or home-made tamales is just not realistic. The texture of these tamales is soft, perhaps \\"mushy\\", and more add a hint of tamale flavor rather than being what you may be thinking in terms of a traditional tamale.If you are like me and crave a tamale from time to time, these may provide a bit of instant gratification. But, I think it is better to be realistic in your expectations, than to be disappointed because of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reduce Risk by... putting your money in the bank?","review":"This book is mainly for those who are extremely afraid of risking money in individual stocks or smaller kids (<12) The only stocks he likes are index funds.

His ultra-concern about risk gets very annoying and repetitive after you've read 50 pages.This is a great book for small kids, who aren't ready to take on the more risky stock market and individual stocks- it shows you the other options.

It is air tight out of the box but I don't think is worth ten bucks to twelve dollars more than the other Hohner MS (Modular System) models. I would probably buy a Pro Harp if I wanted another plastic comb Hohner MS.

For example... one day Joseph is telling the brothers that they must go get Benjamin to prove they are not spies. The very next day the reading skips ahead to the \\"stolen cup\\" being found Benjamin's sack. This leaving out parts of the story happens over and over.

Roger Waters did a great job on this concert. Every artist performing did a wonderful job on their part, except for Van Morrison. I don't think Comfortable Numb was a good song for him to perform. Rick DiFonzo did a great job recreating David Gilmour's solos, and Snowy White is always great. All musicians were on the top of their game in this concert. Roger even brought an orchestra, choir, and the Soviet Union's marching band to recreate this rock opera. It is so over the top, that it's unbelievable. Waters really outdid himself in this concert.

Overall, it is a very well written text, up to date, and quite detailed.There is one weird quality about the book, however: the authors have not directly referenced statements in the book, as you would expect to find in any good advanced textbook in a scholarly field. They have instead written a bibliography at the very end, consisting of \\"Recommended Reading\\" and \\"References\\" for each chapter. I am unsure what criteria they used to differentiate the two.Other than this minor point however, it's a first rate buy.

While the Nevilles' distinctive New Orleans voodoo funk, such as on Yellow Moon, is slightly diluted here, there is still much to enjoy.It is a solid and entertaining effort from start to finish and will disappoint few. Family Groove is probably more instantly accessible than their other albums, and it would make a great introduction for those unfamiliar with the kings of the Big Easy.Take Me To Heart and I Can See It In Your Eyes are stand-out ballads, while the title track and Fly Like An Eagle are well executed cover versions.

Unfortunately, you get a few obvious songs I'm not so crazy about, like \\"Love Hangover\\" (which sounds rather stilted). There are even a few what-the-HECK? numbers, like \\"Flashback\\" (a lame song from the 80's) and \\"The Best Disco in Town\\" (which hopefully doesn't play this song). The remix of \\"I Feel Love\\" isn't bad but the original would've sounded more in place.

On the other hand, there was some new stuff, and the \\"liner notes\\" for each story were often interesting. You could probably put together a very good literature class around the stories in this volume.On the gripping hand...riffing on classic sci-fi is a bit pretentious.Anyway...as with most compilations of early sci-fi, this is a good selection of famous short stories. If you're looking for a book to get someone started on science fiction (or trying to give some culture to someone who buys John Ringo for the covers) then you couldn't go far wrong with \\"World Turned Upside-Down\\".

This bed-in-a-bag delivers both. The sheets are very soft for the thread count and the microfiber on the shams, bedskirt, and comforter is like an ultra suede with a courdoroy feel to it. Very nice and durable. The comforter is oversized so it totally covers the mattress on all sides (unlike many I've had that barely come to the bedskirt).Overall, GREAT product with a FANTASTIC price tag. (Much looking on-line and in many, many stores.

Kate's book is the first one that has inspired me to take time to read. And I've done so -- carefully, cover to cover, and over and over. Her insight has helped me focus, evaluate and understand, and now I have hope -- no, I have a genuine *expectation* that I will have greater control and satisfaction in my life. And such a fun read, too! I need to return my treasured, dog-eared volume to the library, but I'm going to keep it and pay the overdue fines until the copy I'm buying from Amazon arrives, because this simple, well-written and thoroughly entertaining book has been my inspiration.

I love her appealing, chatty style of writing and eye-catching titles (it must come from her years of working at magazines), and all those inspiring quotes and tips from successful gutsy women. This book is filled with more ways to get what you want -in fact, I think you can use a little imagination and try to use her suggestions to make anything more creative. The main point of this book is similar to her first one, \\"Why Good Girls Don't Get Ahead and Gutsy Girls Do!\\", which is why one might think that they are the same but I assure you, it's worth it! Three cheers for Kate White!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not a waste of time","review":"I liked this book. I got so many tips for free because I found the book in my library! I love the author.

How could Christiane Amampur (cnn), Fran Drescher (the nanny), Hillary Clinton, Barbara Walters, Bobbi Brown (make-Up), or Kate Shade (fashion) reach the tops in their fields? You will find the answer in this book. Moreover, the author's personal life story is even more interesting. Chapter 7 is my favorite: \\"Keep your elbows on the table\\". In this chapter she gives 10 very unothodox suggestions that will surprise you. If you have a dream or a desire, read this book and you'll come a step closer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and Fluffy!","review":"If you are under 25, this book may have some valuable bits of information on \\"getting what you want\\" re career and personal life. But if you're like me, and have had a little life and work experience you may find it too simple and fluffy. This book reads like any issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, post Helen Gurley Brown. I think the recommendations are silly and not that insightful. After reading books like \\"The Road Less Travelled\\" (M. Scott Peck) and \\"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\\" (Susan Jeffers)I felt that this book was a bit of a waste of my time. I kept waiting to learn something more than what my mother told me.

(To the credit of Texans, they seem not to hold it against her too much; in fact, there is something characteristically and enjoyably Texan about her 'let it all hang out' style.) She is dearly fond of her homeland and in fact of most people, which is how she can be critical without carping.Recommended either as a book on humour, a book on Texas attitudes, or a book on near-current affairs--take your pick.

Reading this woman's columns in the paper alone is sickening enough. Imagine a full book of her hateful words against people who are not really evil and awful, like she implies.If you took out any words that were sarcastic, she would be rendered unable to communicate.

The hardest part of making paella for the first time was trying to figure out how much water and rice this pan could hold, along with all the other stuff. Just so you know...with 5 quarts of water (i.e. 20 cups), 10 cups of rice, and your other paella fixin's, this pan is totally full.

Now I believe in The Age of Aquarius and understand what it is to be about, at least in part. Everyone should read this fine, fine work. Zecharia Sitchin's The Lost Book of Enki puts Homer's The Odyssey to shame. Really. Although I love and respect The Odyssey, it really is not nearly as monumental an epic in its scope as is The Lost Book of Enki. Wow!

His bold theories and suppositions about ancient mankind and his origins are fascinating and thought-provoking. \\"Lost Book of Enki\\" is none of that.Sitchin has, for some reason, felt it necessary to take his assumptions and build an epic poem out of them. For hard-core fans of his works this might be acceptable, even entertaining, but I fail to see how it furthers his position in the academic community. I was dismayed to see it in print. I would have liked to have seen more evidence from ancient manuscripts, more interpolation from hoary documents, more interpretation of legend and challenge to academia. Instead, I got a psuedo-intellectual attempt at saga.I sincerely hope Sitchin returns to his more effective presentation techniques in his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extrremely Muddled Thinking","review":"The first book in this series sounded so plausible.

The tablets in length themselves must have measured 1 league or more each! Where are these tablets their translation to back up? No references are given of their location thereof. This much reminding of the socalled lost tablets of the Mormon Bible. The story too complete, too perfect, mine eye seeing beautiful poetry and myth only.

If you want to understand the historical evidence and the author's theories, I suggest you read his other less-misleading books.As fiction, it is terrible. Like I said, its written in the form of a religious text.I suggest you just read some good books by researchers in the field, and also the Bible or other ancient myths and texts and come to your own conclusions.

All three balls stopped squeeking after a few seconds of simple compressions by my Aussie. Basically, you end up with a tennis ball with a little slit in it so air can be squeezed out, making it easier for dogs to compress the ball. I can make that with an old ball and a knife for free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some DOA, Some Last a Little While,","review":"These would be great dog toys if they lasted.

At a cost of $2.00+ to mail it back to them, the replacement SURE isn't going to be free, in fact it is going to cost me MORE to replace it from Kong than it would cost to just BUY a new oneBottom line, avoid this shoddy Chinese made product like the plagueJohn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Squeaker Tennis Balls","review":"May be fine for a small dog but only last one or two bites from a Husky.

The company address is in Colorado, it says designed and tested in the USA but it is made in China. Every dog I've had has died of cancer and we know multiple products have had dangerous ingrediants or materials coming from China. These have caused death and illness. Do not buy these. Cadimium in childrens jewelry, melamine in pet food, lead in paint & childrens toys and books, some unknown chemical in Heparin (blood thinner) it almost killed my daughter.

I'm happy I can provide them with a safe toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sqeaker attack !","review":"The people who said their didn't sqeak must have old balls or something. I purchase mine from petsmart and they work great. My pit Bailey loves these so much she carrys it around like her purse almost. She takes them everywhere for random squeak attacks on my 2 Akitas.

From the moment I bought this my papillon is almost never seen without this in her mouth. Yes it squeaks, but she loves to push out the squeaker, but loves that she can squish it. She pulls the fuzz of and finally she gets it taken away when it has holes in it. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is becuase I would like the option to buy more than just 3. She loves them and would love to give her a bucket for xmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sqeaker DOA, too small for small dogs","review":"When these arrived, one squeaker was non-functional and another died after 1 minute of play. But we're done playing with them because ultimately these are too small for my 17 pound mini schnauzer. She can get them all the way in her mouth which makes me worry that they're a choking hazard. They'd be fine for toy breeds, so I guess I the extra-small label means only for extra small dogs. I'd recommend the Kong tennis ball stick instead[...]that one is still squeaking and no concern for choking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Strong Enough","review":"My small Pom mutt is my baby boy, and he loves these tiny squeak tennis balls. I like to whip him into a frenzy with the squeaker and then send him chasing after it down the hall. Problem is he may love it too much, and the tennis ball-like coating is not built to last even a small dog's gnawings. Abe, who may be 8 pounds soaking wet, chews off the exterior fiber of the ball gradually, and will occasionally ingest it if unsupervised. Haven't had any serious problems as a result, but obviously it's not good for him, and I imagine it does cause some degree of gastrointestinal discomfort on its way through and, ahem, out of, the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"KONG Air Dog Squeakair Tennis Balls Dog Toy, Medium, Yellow, 3/pack","review":"My dog (60 lb.

She could care less about any other toy in the world, but you bring out one of these little guys & we'll hear squeaking for days. Her goal in life is to make that squeaky instrument her slave so she spends hours, days, weeks!, tearing the ball up to get to it. Then when she finds it she'll come find us like 'Look, Mommy! Look, Daddy! I's a good girl now!'Then she doesn't give one ounce of time to the shell of the ball. So, it's round two with the next one.These are great toys for small dogs & if Kong released a 20-pack, they'd be ordered real quick in my house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical smell","review":"These balls have a horrible chemical smell.

We are still looking for a durable ball that is small enough for a little dog to carry comfortably in their mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"They love it... for about 5 seconds until they kill the squeak","review":"These squeak balls were the perfect size and shape for my squeak toy loving Pekingese. I was so excited to give them these balls, but needless to say, they lasted for about 10 minutes until my boys punctured them and killed the squeak and then didn't want to play with them anymore. If they can make a more durable ball like this that my dogs can keep for more than a day, I would be happy to try it again. I am rating this a 2 and not a 1 because for the 10 minutes that they had the balls and they were squeaking, my boys were in heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kong Squeaker Tennis Balls","review":"If your dog is a chewer, especially of squeaker toys I would not recommend this toy.

No amount of coaxing could get them to play with them. They did not work for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, Very Disappointing AND Possibly Dangerous","review":"Somewhere I got it in my head that KONG was the manufacturer of good dog products. Boy was I mistaken or mislead. And unfortunately I wasted a bunch of money on squeaky balls. The first thing to go was the squeaker. Well okay, I thought, that's only part of the fun, so I wasn't upset. But then my poodle chewed the cover off the ball and ripped it apart in no time flat.What the heck?This is supposed to be a CHEW-toy. If an 8 month old poodle pup can't chew it for longer than a week, then its a pretty junky product. (He mostly chases balls and does his chewing on Bully Sticks.)Now to the dangerous part. It was so easy for my pup, who is a large miniature, to destroy the ball that I can't recommend them at-all. In fact, we are now waiting to see what happens and if a visit to the vet is in our future, because bits and pieces are missing and we're hoping that Pippin didn't swallow them.Not worth the money or the worry.Pam T~"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT made in USA","review":"I try to make sure that anything going into my dog's mouth is not made in China.

I don't know too many guys that would jump through the hoops that Ariel puts Cole through. Even more, why would you require someone to jump through those hoops? Protecting your heart is one thing, being obsessively neurotic about it something else.

Yes, we get the point that she scares of men with her natural attitude. And the hero, OMG! could he be any more of an idiot? The coconut scene sealed the deal for me. Meanwhile his co-producer, Gwen, does a complete 180 on the heroine-she's acting like a gal pal on the phone and suddenly she's on the island acting like a b***h.

If you never plan on having wet hands or exposing it to any moisture it could last you longer but I wouldn't bet money on it.After two months of daily usage this lock froze on my locker at the gym and had to be removed by staff with bolt cutters. Not really a big deal as much as an annoyance.I assumed it was a fluke and bought another one from a local retailer. It has only been a month and the \\"action\\" is already becoming very sticky on the combination wheels and I can tell the exact same failure is looming around the corner.A little moisture and possibly pomade residue exposure is all it takes to cause this lock to fail within a short timeframe, which I find to be fairly ridiculous.

Who would forsake the chance to hear the greatest novelist of our time riff on virtually everthing that matters in this world--namely, sex, death and Los Angeles? The filmmakers' nod to camp (dig the author lit Lugosi style, leaning languidly on a dangling dummy in an emptied LA mannequin factory) elicits morbid chuckles. Also, extras including Ellroy's conversations with Bruce Wagner at the Pacific Dining Car and the LAPD's touching presentation of the Jack Webb award are worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"I dislike systems with proprietary cables but sometimes you have to deal with it.

He just makes it up as he goes along. The so-called galactic alignment is an event that requires 18 years to pass. The true galactic alignment occurred sometime in 2003. No disaster then. He prophesies events that will occur, and even as he puts them forth there is no basis for the conclusions he would have you reach. Things he claims will happen on this galactic alignment have never happened in the past galactic alignments (over 100 since homo erectus). Science is completely ignored.

Why do people have such a desire to return to the Dark Ages, when everyone believed that you could turn lead into gold, and that the sun revolved around the Earth? Saying that the \\"galactic alignment\\" is going to affect the Earth is like saying that dropping a pebble in a pond is going to cause a tsunami on the other side of the planet. The galaxy is too huge, the distances too great, for there to be any affect whatsoever. Try adding up some numbers.

I have not seen this program since I was a child, and while it does not quite live up to uncritical childhood memories, it is ,in my estimation, still one of the best tv series I have ever seen. It was this program that helped lead me to take a philosophy degree, as well as to study the martial arts.From a more technical point of view, the quaility of the film stock seemed surpisingly good. I did notice in one scene where two tight face shots ( in the Tides) seemed a little cropped ( this is where perhaps the widescreen format may have been a hinderance), but on the whole I am grateful that I do not have to join the Warner video of the month club, and that I get to see the series that served as a stimulus for some rather valued aspects of my life.Now, if I could reflect of the flashbacks within the series, and practice hung gar more diligently, perhaps I cold get more out of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kung Fu - The Complete First Season DVD","review":"I was really looking forward to watching these classic shows but when I saw they cropped the picture, I returned my set for a refund.

This is a very special and unique series. It was so far ahead of its time that after 30 years there is still nothing on TV or cable to match it. Each episode is not only fun and involving, but also has meaning. The acting (including the guest appearances by people like a young Jodie Foster) is top notch. The special features (including in-depth talks with a now older David Carradine) are very high quality, and add to the understanding/enjoyment of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung Fu the legend continues","review":"I ordered the Kung Fu series a couple years ago.

Whilst most seventies TV and movies were all about violence and revenge this show shone like a beacon of hope, forgiveness and restraint. It certainly was ahead of it's time in those aspects.It influenced me so much I even went to Aikido classes for a few years with my friends, (I know it was Kung Fu but there was none in my area.)A TV show with a worthy message is more rare then hen's teeth, I watched it avidly during it's original run and became addicted to it's hopeful message, if you haven't seen it give it a try, I think you will too.Now snatch the stones, walk the rice paper and go in peace grasshopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kung Phooey.....","review":"This series is a joke.

It's a throw back to the days when they painted white people's faces with black polish. Only this was the 70's where that kind of blatant discrimination was thought to be over.

I didnt care who played what and or why. I enjoy Carradine in this series. He plays a great part. If you ever watched this series, you should pick up on the fact that it had great teaching in it. The series gave lessons on life. He never gave way to anger, but worked with it. He was always helping others to help themselves. He taught healing, self control, martial arts for the sake of themselves, not to hurt people. I also love the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not filmed in widescreen - Not the original aspect ratio","review":"Any prospective purchasers of this DVD, please note that the orignal series was filmed and broadcast in a 4:3 screen ratio. To accomodate the 16:9 ratio of widescreen TVs, the image will be cropped, losing image (about 25%) from the top and/or bottom of the screen. If the series were presented in its correct 4:3 ratio, there would be black or gray bars at the right and left of the widescreen TVs ... Warner is probably trying to avoid complaints from viewers who don't realize that this is the only way to correctly present the original image as filmed and broadcast. Warner's would better serve fans of the series by presenting it as originally filmed and broadcast and educating its customers that this is the correct presentation.Prospective buyers of this DVD need to realize that they will be seeing about 25% less image than was originally filmed and broadcast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slighty cropped Picture, but not really a problem","review":"I now have the DVD boxset, and have done a direct comparison with an old recording on VHS, and yes the DVD is cropped slightly at the top, and bottom when compared with the VHS recording.However it really does not matter as the picture quality in the 30 minutes I have watched so far more than makes up for it. Having read the concerns about it being presented in widescreen I was not sure if I should go ahead and purchase it.

I read one of the reviews which criticized the show for categorizing all whites as evil. I have to say that after watching it I find that true. It is almost comical how the white characters are portrayed as ignorant, barbaric racist. People of color and Asians are almost always portrayed as smart, sensitive, and loving victims of some evil, perpetrated by those evil whites. I guess they went out of their way to reverse discrimination. It seems over the top but consider the times.I think most people wish the lead went to Bruce Lee who was supposed to get it. Little did they know who would become the superstar.Enjoy it for what it is, a fun piece of nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kung Fu (the complete first season)","review":"I bought this set from LAvideo. save your money and do not buy from this vendor.

The sixties version of DRAGNET is one of my favorite shows, but when it was released on DVD, they sent it to Mexico to be produced, and many of the sets had to be returned, resulting in low sales and the unlikelyhood of any more glorious seasons.

Virtually no noise, no connection problems when cable is moved around. I've had my current on for 3 years now, and it's worked flawlessly, and has survived having very heavy amps sat on top of it with no problem. Overall, a great buy, and I don't see any reason to spend any more than this on a cable, as it's just supposed to be transparent, which it does admirably well."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor poor quality","review":"This cable is of very poor quality.

After a couple of months I noticed that there were a lot of buzzing noises coming from his room. Initially I thought it was something to do with the active pickup system on the bass, or the socket -- but we were able to trace it to the cable. I've had a lot of cables over the years and very few of them failed in this way (i.e., short/poor connection). I will buy a better one next time.p.s.

I'm extremely interested in learning about the practical design issues involved in creating more sustainable cities. I was disappointed by how little the author focused on practical engineering issues and concrete examples. Instead, I found fuzzy philosophy and strained analogies to the Big Bang and evolution. I'm a tree hugging, environmentalism kool-aid drinking hippy, but give me a break. The author wants to use cosmology as a rationale for his design philosophy? I recommend passing on this one and reading Natural Capitalism or Plan B 4.0; those two books present concrete ideas and solutions rather than rambling around without actually saying anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Individualistic","review":"This is the kind of book that makes me angry.The collectivist agenda underwriting it is painfully clear.

Overall bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Good For A Gas Stove","review":"I owned this saute pan until I finally had enough and gave it away. This pot works great on a gas stove but not on an stove with electric burners. It left cold spots and when I pushed the food aside to add another ingredient the food would cool down.I am a middle aged cook and luckily don't have wrist problems but I the handle does feels like I am holding a hot dog.

The reason why I say this is on another online shopping service I buy from has the same item and it is 4\\" in depth. I have the matching oval pasta pot and really love it but I am not happy with this purchase. It is a nice pan but when you are making a big dish you need a big pan to hold it. Shame on Anolon for cutting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward","review":"This product looked like it would be a good fit for my new stove's oval burner but when it was placed on the stove, I realized it would be very awkward. Placing it on the oval burner did not allow the pot to be turned. The handle stuck out way too far in front & it was heavy to lift with only the long handle. Perhaps on a regular burner this pot would be fine, but I have other pots for regular burners. The only thing I really liked was the lid! Wish they could offer that option with the 8quart Oval Pasta pot, which I did purchase and love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have this pan and my mom always admires it, so I bought it for her for Christmas. It is a great size and shape, you can use it to cook anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite pan!","review":"I bought this pan years ago after seeing Rachael Ray use it on her 30 Minute Meals show. She designed the oval shape for Analon and then added the same pot to her new line of cookware (+ orange handles and an additonal $10). If you are looking for a great pan that is easy to clean and takes up less space on your stovetop than a traditional round pan, this is the one for you. Its perfect for sauces with the high sides helping to hold more plus the helper handle is a plus when pouring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward...","review":"...is the only way to describe this. The shape is unpleasant and doesn't conduct heat properly. The handle is too mushy (like the hot dog mentioned in another review) and makes for dangerous transport of hot things.

Please buy some real cookware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"My mom being a rabid Rachael fan, has bought most of her merchandise. Including her pans. I was cooking in her kitchen and had the displeasure of using this pan. The feel and shape is off and for the price I was not impressed with the quality.

I'm tired of hearing these characters think \\"but on the other hand,\\" or, \\"still,\\". These books are going nowhere fast.

It will not surprise readers that all kinds of visitors get hosted to perfection at the Lodge run by this acute observer and unobtrusive partner of northeast Peru. Or that to visit is to enlarge one's own family with his, which cares for you from airport touchdown to reluctant return take-off. Regardless, Beaver's book motivates travel plans by helping remind us to pursue adventure rather than continue delaying it. Particularly among people deeply in tune with nature, one's depth of experience is replenishing and edifying, enabling clearer focus again on what is important to everyone all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational journey to the Amazon","review":"This is a wonderful account of an unspoiled place.

However, after a few short years, our wait was over and it was finally available here. And the wait was worth it!This album gives you a great taste of Bryan's live show circa 1988. I love every song on the album and the sound quality is near perfect and better than most live recordings that I've heard. There are some live albums where it is obvious that some post-production sweetening has been done. It doesn't sound like it here.If I had my choice, I would have hoped to have heard a couple of different selections instead of the cover songs \\"Walking After Midnight\\" and \\"I Fought The Law\\". Bryan does some cool versions of these songs, but I would have been more excited to hear live versions of \\"Fits Ya Good\\" and \\"I'm Ready\\".Despite this, LIVE!LIVE!LIVE! is a great album and is required listening for any BRYAN ADAMS fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless Phone Rechargable Battery","review":"Use in our Panasonic cordless phones.

The greasy feel lasts longer than most 'natural' type products (like natural grape-seed oil or jojoba oil) and when the greasy feel is gone, so is the moisturizing effect of the product.

The size is surprising small: about the size of a regular 2-D flashlight minus the head.It also has 2 small, but nice features. The top has a small loop handle made of wire that can be used to hang or attach it to things; if you have small fingers, it will fit 2 fingers through. It also has small feet that you can slide out for greater stability.My only concern is the battery life: the package does not list it, but the manufacturer's website claims 80 hours.

We bring it with us on evening stroller walks because it's great for us to be able to see where we're going and for cars to spot us. We plan to carry it while trick-or-treating this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little light","review":"This is a very light treatment of Server 2003 clustering. It is poorly organized (there's not even an entry in the index for \\"Quorum\\"!), and spends too much time on NT and Win2K (though the title says 2003). It is heavier on the design/planning side and very, very light on monitoring, management, and trouble-shooting. It often gives advice without providing reasons. There are several key points delivered in a grammar so poor as to make me wonder what he is trying to say. All-in-all, I learned nothing that wasn't obvious in Microsoft's own documentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bood information for 2003 NLB","review":"This book was pretty helpful to get a Windows Server 2003 (and a 2000) cluster off the ground. This book covered everything you needed to know from Hardware to Software. To do major design work to include App Center 2000 or any other service based solution, you would have to augment this book with other material, but to just get a NLB or regular cluster up off the ground that functions and be able to troubleshoot it, this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is one of the better \\"focused\\" books out there today. It takes high availablity to a new level by not only walking you step by step through how to configure a Windows 2000/2003 cluster and load balanced solution, but also through all the details that most forget - like making your switches highly available, setting up a disaster recovery plan, and more real world scenarios than you can think of. This was a good read because it didnt read like a typical reference manual, but more from the authors mind which kept it interesting. I recommend this as a -how to get your business highly availble- guide, not just a -clustering- guide. Good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and Accurate. No BS. Something for everyone.","review":"I have been impressed by Mr. Shimonski's work in the past and this book does not disappoint. It could be considered complete information for the first-timer. Still it includes gems from Robert's professional successes that justify the purchase for anyone considering implementing or cost-justifying a high-availability solution. Mr. Shimonski is not afraid to name his favorite products, web-sites, and tactics, a practice more IT authors should consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clusters made easy","review":"I am not one to spend hours reading through 900 page books to learn something, so this book was just perfect for me. If you want to get 2000 or 2003 set up in a redundant fashion, this is your book. Augmented with Technet I was able to get everything done. This book only covers the fundamantals of clustering on both platforms so if you want to go into more depth in specific areas, then you should use this book with other resources, but if you simply need to cluster or load balance Windows 2000 and 2003, then this is all you need. Since the book is listed on Microsoft's site as a resource, I picked it up and I am glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-accurate technical content, extremely poor writing.","review":"This is without a doubt, the most poorly-written technical reference I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I agree with the other reviewer who picked out the numerous Windows 2003 Server errors - this book was rushed to press, and should have waited for the final release instead of being based on RC2.I cannot believe a professional editor gave this book their stamp of approval. I have to take breaks every dozen or so pages, not because the concepts are too difficult, but because the author's akward sentences make my head ache.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only book on the subject. I would stick to using whitepapers and web resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some glaring windows 2003 errors","review":"I had high hopes for this book however there are some glaring errors that make me wonder if the author truely tested the 2003 cluster environment. For instance in setting up MSDTC he tells us to use comclust.exe which is the 2000 way. This does not work on windows 2003. Also the book doesn't address the fact that sql 2000 will not install on 2003 as a virtual server without errors, and that a client alias work around is necessary, along with sql SP3a. All of this was a fact even on the beta and rc2 version of windows 2003 he used for the testing. If find it hard to believe the author has ever done a real sql 2000 cluster on windows 2003 outside of a testlab and without named instances(which are fundamental to production sql cluster, especially active/active)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"These are by far the best martial art training DVDs I've ever seen. Very matter-of-fact, to the point, no wasted time. Very clear demonstrations from different angles, easy to understand descriptions of techniques, and all at a good pace. Most DVDs I've seen are full of \\"filler\\" material to make the DVD last longer than the 5 minutes of useful information that the instructor has to offer (harsh to say, but very true in most DVDs that I've seen). I'll be watching these many times, they are packed with tons of useful information and are an amazing value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!!!!!!","review":"Received this video for Christmas. Watched it several times. As a former federal law enforcement officer I received much training in combative techniques from the government, not to mention years of training on my own. David Kahn's Mastering Krav Maga series is a great addition to the knowledge and techniques I had already developed. Krav Maga has assembled a cross section of the most effective combative techniques, with some variation, and combined them with a very aggressive fighting style. David does a great job explaining and demonstrating these techniques and he adroitly explains the simple and natural progression of the system. Thank you David, Looking forward to your next DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - Fantastic!","review":"This instructional videos series lives up to it's promise - Everything from basic building blocks for more effective punches, elbows and kicks, details and subtelties regarding footwork and movement and not telgraphing a punch, to advanced self defense techniques, punching and striking combinations....it has it all! I have boxed and done martial arts training over the years and I am truly impressed as to how much I have gotten out of these DVD's so far. David's teching style is very srtaightforward, easy to understand and totally effective. I congratulate you on an excellent product. Your deep knowledge and passion around Krav Maga comes through in volumes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Krav Maga at its best","review":"I've been doing martial arts for most of my life, and I've studied numerous styles (TKD, BJJ/Wrestling, Kali, Muay Thai, JKD, and a little Silat). The past year I've been reviewing several of the leading Krav Maga systems, and the IKMA material that is presented in this volume is the best I've seen. The DVDs are a very comprehensive introduction to the unarmed techniques and tactics that make KM such an effective system. I was pleased to see that it didn't include some of the fancier kicking techniques that some of the other systems include in their curriculum. I don't believe fancy kicks (i.e., spinning or jumping) have any place in a self defense setting. The majority of the techniques seemed to focus less on individual athleticism to pull off, and more on training / aggression.I look forward to training with the author in person sometime in the near future, and I hope this DVD is the first in a long series (which hopefully includes weapons and drill scenarios)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Krav MaGA TotallY Censored!!!","review":"I'm learning some good moves but they are keeping the best techniques secret and they even admit it on disc one. Power to the PEOPLE is real national security. I want to know how to take on multiple armed assailants and real Krav Maga does that. This will help a little and is a good fitness program but they are hiding the real power of true authentic Krav Maga."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD set Rocks","review":"I love this set, it goes through all the basics to advanced moves. I also brought the books David has written to work hand in hand with the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD.","review":"I would like to find a studio that teaches Krav Maga, but there isn't one that is close to where I live. This DVD set is the next best thing. I trusted the posted reviews, and they are spot on.
