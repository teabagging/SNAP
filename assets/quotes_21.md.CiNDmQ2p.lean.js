I could not wait to use my new Turbo Cooker. I purchased it to hopefully be able to cook frozen chicken and corn on the cob in 20 minutes, and make meals overall a great deal faster (like they did on tv). Well I tried my Turbo Cooker and if you like \\"Jerky chicken\\" and cold corn (my husband swears he bit into a piece of ice), then this is the item for you. It is HORRIBLE and does NOT do what it promises to do. I ended up taking it back to the retail store, yet they were not wanting to take it back, they did and refunded my money. I wish someone would have reviewed it before I purchased itand saved me the time and trouble.If I could rate this with \\"0\\" stars I would. DO NOT BUY!!! Very Dissatified!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought the Turbo Cooker when it first came out on AS SEEN ON TV. I can put a frozen roast in and it only takes an hour to cook.I use it for everything. I have purchased them for gifts and have gotten rave reviews from the receipients.

I can defrost meat in it. It takes less time to cook any dish in it and when I am frying it does not mess up my stove since I keep the cover on. I use it all the time as a fry pay also because it is so deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"TURBO EXPRESS !","review":"Just bought ours brand new in the box at Goodwill for 7 dollars. Thought we'd give it a go as the concept is sound, having used a Wok for chinese cooking.The operative word is WOW. We threw in 3 fat chicken breasts and poured over a box of rice-a-roni. The rice a roni's box indicated it would take 30 minutes to make. Poured in two cups of water cooked for 10 minutes and added one more cup of water and cooked for another 5. We flipped the breasts once. We stuck some brocolli on the top rack and put the burner on HIGH. We totally winged it. We kept the burner on HIGH a little too long and the rice began to burn on the bottom, but we caught it quick so no harm done. If one knows the burner temps and when to go from HIGH to MEDIUM or LOW......you will have awesome, tender chicken with great flavor.Our first meal tasted great, fed 5 people, and instead of using 3 burners for a half hour, we used one for 15 minutes.You do the math!Awesome.Mitch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved It Until Lid Gauge Broke","review":"I loved this product for steaming food using little or no oil. Great for Veggies, warming up left-overs, and cooking on top of the stove. However after a year the gauge/valve on the top of the lid just crumbled off. I called the number on the Turbo cooker website. They assured me that they would send a new lid. This was in 2003. I never got it. When I called they said that it had to be back ordered. I will never buy another one. I often wonder if a lot of the new products offered via infomercials are just scams. The customer service always stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLD ON TURBO COOKER","review":"I just received my turbo cooker last week and really enjoy it. It dose cook the food fast (I had to add 2-4 minutes more on my stove but it was still fast) and you can make cupcakes on top of the stove (They were fat free and pretty good!) I wish I had more cards but I have adapted some favorite dishes and it wasn't that hard to figure out. I do caution he non stick surface. I was lifting the steamer rack out and it sliped and scratched the side of the pan. I think that it scrached a little to easily, so be careful. It cleans-up very easily even if you let something cook too long. Over all a good product that does what it says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turbo Cooker not so great","review":"I previously had a Culinare Quick Cooker, which is another quick cooker that looked almost identical to the turbo cooker. It was my favorite cooking gadget and I used it multiple times a week. After a couple of years, I simply used it up, the non-stick surface gave out. When I looked for the Culinare, it was only available in foreign markets and I didn't have experience or confidence buying overseas directly. I knew two almost identical cookers came out at the same time so I tried the Turbo Cooker. The non-stick surface seemed to weaken on the first one or two uses. The food doesn't taste nearly as good as with the Culinare. I've used it maybe six times and rarely reach for it anymore when cooking. I think a wok would be a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service, cheap product","review":"If you buy this thing, be careful of the lid. The plastic knob on top broke after only 3 months -- and it is useless without it. I have tried in vain to contact the company, they will not return phone calls or emails. The number is not toll free, and you must wait forever to get through...if you have enough time.They say you'll save time in cooking, but they'll waste your time as you try to get customer service!Their website makes no claims about quality, which I should have checked before buying this. I haven't had it long enough for it to start rusting (see comments below). I like the idea, I only wish the product was sturdier, and the company responsive to customers who have already purchased. I'm sure my calls would be toll free and answered QUICKLY if I were calling to buy their product.The old adage holds true: caveat emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Time Saver","review":"I have had a Turbo Cooker for over a year now and I am completely satisfied with the results. I really like the ability to toss dried pasta into a pan with other ingredients and have a complete meal in 12 minutes. It is however, a product that you will have to 'tinker' with to get good results. I have found that on my stove, using high heat for half the cooking time and medium high for the remaining time prevents burning of the food. The recipe cards are great and I purchased the additional set and these too, are very helpful. I would suggest that you use wooden or plastic utensils with the pan as most nonstick pans scratch when metal is applied to them.Overall, if you are pressed for time or you want to cook something ahead of time, the Turbo Cooker will be a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This cooker should be great if the valve on the cooker lid was not of such a bad quality.I cooked great with it, but it lasts me only 1 month.When I try to contact the manufacture for parts, after several e-mails to their \\"customerservice\\" I never got any feedback."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"GOSH!

We've had one for several years and it's my wifes favorite pan. Like all the teflon-coated stuff, though, after years of use and an occasional \\"oops\\" (meaning badly burned food), it was time to send her pan to the trash bin. This meant an immediate assignment for me to replace it. Fortunately, Amazon had them in stock!

It has moved four years into the future so it's almost as if they are starting again. You will love all the characters and the special features is an added extra worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"I was very excited to see them take One Tree Hill into the future, especially becuase the characters was now close to my age. I was extremely dissapointed becuase the storylines were the same as seasons 1-4. The writers only focused on Lucas & Peyton's screwed up relationship and not enough on the other 3 Main characters. They also focused to much on the new and secondary characters. It was either a Hit of Miss and it was definitely a miss. But at least they left a great cliff hanger with Lucas, Brooke, Peyton, and Lindsey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Day Days Op Ed","review":"I watched the entire season within a week.

When I first heard that they were fast forwarding 4 years, I thought that it was a risk and something that no other show has done before. It worked!!! With so many shows featuring the college years, it was nice to see these characters grow older, and experience life when it really begins. Although most weren't any wiser, it was nice to see what they had done with their lives, and where they are still yet wanting to go.

Plus the legs never seemed like a comfortable fit and the tape is like scotch tape. Nice idea but still it's not a good diaper. I have been struggling to finish the case I bought and I even gave one of the four packs away. I found using cloth easier then cleaning up after these and more comfortable on my babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid these diapers","review":"These diapers are awful. The material is stiff and bulky and the size range is ridiculous. They are for 6-14 lbs, When my baby was 6lbs these diapers were bigger than his entire body. They finally fit now that he is 4 months. The tape on these diapers also get stuck on the baby's skin. And finally they don't deal well with leaks. If you are looking for a more environmentally friendly diaper check out the seventh generation diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"These are the worst diapers that I have used. I was initially attracted by the all cotton/paper fiber core but soon realized that this made the diaper more like a piece of cardboard. It is difficult to get the diaper to fit snuggly around the waist because it is so stiff. The result is lots of leaks both urine and poop (the cotton doesn't absorb any of this and it ends up shooting out the front, back, and down the legs). When I was successful at getting a snug fit, the Scotch tape like fasteners would pop off. So frustrating!!! I grew tired of entire outfit changes with each dirty diaper. Save your money! Try something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, they do leak . . .","review":"I was so glad to find disposable diapers that were both chlorine and gel-free but was sadly disappointed. I didn't find the diapers too bulky or anything, and I loved them for the first couple of days, but then I got pooped all over . . . and then it happened again . . . and again . . . and I'm not talking about a little stuff coming out of the side -- I mean poop literally dripping out of the diaper and all over the floor/my lap/his clothes. Maybe for an older baby with more solid poop they would be fine, but these diapers just couldn't contain my baby's breastmilk poop. It's due to a poor design (the inner elastic is too loose and doesn't \\"catch\\" anything), and if they could fix it, these would be my diapers of choice -- but until then, I can't recommend these at all.Kudos to the company for trying to make a better disposable, though; it's a good idea and I hope they can find a way to make a better product soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these! They are awful.","review":"These diapers are a pain for two main reasons; The tabs do not stay stuck, if they stick in the first place. And you can not tell when they are wet. I have had to take the diaper off more that once to check, and the thrown it away when I couldn't get it to stick again. They are not completely biodegradable either. It's not worth the inconvenience. They get two stars from me because they are natural fiber inside and because they are chlorine free, as all diapers should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Diaper!!","review":"This is the greatest diaper, next to cloth. I noticed a lot of reviewers say that the diaper leaks. Unless your child is a really heavy wetter I can't really see that being a problem. As with any diaper, if you change when they go, or close to, this diaper will be great. The only time we have had a problem with leaking we moved up to the next size and it wasn't a problem anymore. But I am assuming that would be a problem with any diaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaky diapers","review":"I like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper, so I bought Tushies. When my baby was newborn, they seemed to work ok, maybe because she didn't put out that much. She is now three months old. I practice attachment parenting so I know exactly when she has a bowel movement. The past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly. She was sitting on my lap, she had a bowel movement, five seconds later I got up to change her, the feces was all over my pants. This has happened several times. The concept of the diaper is great, but the diaper needs some work around the legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out for leaks","review":"I like the softness of Tushies and the fact that they don't use gel. BUT the downside is that these diapers can't hold as much liquid and you are likely to have leaks up the back and out the sides if you don't change baby enough. We had numerous problems when in public when our baby was wearing these. We have half a pack left and can only use them at home during the day when baby is going to be changed hourly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!","review":"The tabs to close the diapers are a hard plastic that can cut you and your baby. Don't want to take a chance so unfortunately I won't be using them anymore. This can easily be improved if the manufacturer wanted to. Also, I change my babies diapers at least every 2-3 hours and I had three diaper leaks in 2 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got them free... still not worth it!","review":"After 9 years in healthcare, I consider myself a professional at diapering. I was given a package from a friend who heads a donation center where I delivered. She knew we'd had extreme financial dificulties & that our son was in the NICU (ka-ching!). He was too small for them for a while, though he was 7# 13oz at birth. They're fine enough for urine. He pees A LOT and they do handle that. Unfortunately they also become rock hard when they do! Plus they are useless against poop. After doing a second bath on him today and striping the seat he was in, I've decided to toss these. I won't even give them to anyone else! The ONLY reason why I put them on him again today is because I wanted to give him a break from the cloth diapers. Nevermind. It'd be less mess to leave him naked in the middle of the wood floor..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tushies = guaranteed poop explosion.","review":"I bought a pack of Tushies before my baby was born and have been utterly disappointed with them. Poop shoots up the back of the diaper and out of both legs at least once a day. I have to change the baby's clothes each time he poops in Tushies. Right now I'm trying to use up the package, but may end up throwing the rest out because they don't work for us. Yesterday morning my baby pooped while I was nursing him. It got all over him, his clothes, me, and our Boppy pillow. Not the best trade off for an environmentally friendly diaper.The diapers say they are for babies 6-14 pounds. My baby now weighs over 9 pounds and the leg openings still gap. We are having much better luck with gDiapers and Seventh Generation. I love Tushies wipes, but the diapers stink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leak!","review":"The size ones leak everywhere, every time. My son was 10 lbs. at birth and they fit him well but they still leaked everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Less Toxic The Better","review":"These diapers are soft and fit decently. Sticky tabs work well even if they need to be refastened. The leg elastic does a good job without being to tight and holds up to most poops. We've had a few blow-outs where it came up and over the top of the diaper. I am not sure if that is attributed to diaper construction or the baby waste amount and positioning. I suppose that is to be expected once in a while with breastfed babies. Whether that is the case or not, it is a small price to pay for having a gel free disposable diaper. It holds a good amount of #1 and I am so happy to know that I am not putting toxic gel beads near or on my baby's skin. Last I heard, Tushies is the only brand that manufactures this type of diaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but not for us","review":"These diapers sound great. But the tabs are so sticky that they stick to my son's skin if I do not watch where they are at when cleaning a dirty diaper. Plus, when they are wet, they are quick to leak out and feel wetter than other diapers. We are just trying to use ours up and will not buy again. Much prefer Earth's Best or Seventh Generation diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but Stupid Design","review":"This is the only gel-free diaper which is closest to cloth diapers because of absorbency from cotton.

The pot rack's bars are shiny copper, but the hooks to hang the pots from are shiny brass finish. The grid on which to store your pot lids is matte black. The total effect on my eyes of mixing the three finishes, is painfully clashing. The shiny brass hooks would be very visible because they hang down from the shiny copper bar to support the pots.

The nice thing about their two books is that they cover the important material for applied statisticians and they illustrate the techniques with SAS programming. This is especially helpful for those of us working in the pharmaceutical industry where SAS is essentially mandated.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that they still recommend the leave-one-out method for error estimation in discriminant analysis when the work of Efron and others in the mid 1980s indicated that bootstrap methods of bias adjustment are generally superior to leave-one-out.

I found this book a great read without even being present in San Francisco. Rand really puts in some great nuggets of information. The book is categorically divided by district and has a routed map along with it. My only gripe is the very little amount of pictures. I go on trips to San Francisco but I do not reside in the city.

Good points: It creates a really good insight into the history of the place, the way the streets were created by the changing environment, and municipal demands as SF., grew. The writer is careful to note historical significances, both human and material, interweaving them into the dialogue.Bad points: The book would be improved most considerably by the inclusion of relevant pictures related to the text. Time after time, the author references some point that would be best served by a illustration. In colour would provide even more interest, but this would be optional.Overall, I still rate that book, but it's not perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changes how I think about and life my faith","review":"The truths Watchman Nee brings out of scripture are changing how I think about my everyday walking around faith. He highlights the importance of faith as a key commodity in the operation of God's economy. He encourages us to see, believe and embrace the reality of heavenly truths in the midst of our earth bound life. Nee reveals again and again the vital truth that faith is what God asks from us, It leads us to obedience, joy, blessings, salvation... even in the face of trials, difficulties and deceptive appearances. I have been taught to ask, \\"is this truth true to the Word of God?\\" For me it is Nee's faithfulness to God's Word that solidifies his exhortations to great faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"Watchman Nee is a writer of the ages touching God's word, I highly recommend to by it is worth the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy in Nashville","review":"Another letter to the publisher from a reader in Nashville: \\"I think your book is just a complete double-eagle for understanding the true nature of the golf experience.

Wondering to myself, how could I use this to have fun with my family if we lived in a space with, of all things, space.This book not only shows how to make catapults of various types. It goes into the history of how the catapult was made or as it transformed throughout history. There are short vignettes about various historical subjects surrounding seizes throughout time and what types of catapults were used, what they looked like and how to build something like it using easy to but materials.This is a fun book for the hobbyist who likes to tinker with things and how has a flair for fun projects (or projectiles for that matter.)

It even gives directions for making rope. In addition to showing how to make siege engines, it covers their history, the reasons they were developed, how they were used and what caused a decline in their popularity. I can see a student using this book to make a model for a history class, or an SCA group adapting the information for a full-sized weapon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth the money.","review":"I was really dissappointed with this book. Several of the projects are ridiculous, and he didn't do enough research. A few quick searches of the internet reveal that he gets a lot of historical facts wrong.His first two projects, have nothing to do with anything related to actual catapults. The first is two sticks tied together, and the second is the equivalent of a waterbaloon slingshot. He calls it the \\"Viking Catapult\\". Of the ten projects in this book, three of them are modeled on actual historical types of catapults. Two are sub projects, that just show you how to build parts of the catapults, and the other five are things a child could design on thier own. As the one of the other reviewers pointed out, the last project is a plastic spoon catapult game. Small children do this on their own.Do your self a favor, and download some free plans off the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing catapults, interesting history, but no metric units","review":"This book contains easy-to-follow instructions on how to build different catapults. Unfortunately there is no data regarding approx. distance and height for the suggested projectiles, why you must try for yourself. All units are english/american, which means you must translate this to metric units if you are more used to that.A lot of historic background around catapults in general and around each model is given, which makes the book very interesting to read, even if you do not plan to build any of the models.I can recommend this book to both historically interrested people and those who are more fond of making amusing toys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like them","review":"I just bought these and I really like them.

I have missed the beginning of so many music videos because by the time I find the remote and get both buttons pushed, it's too late. The machine lacks a \\"record\\" button on the console. No remote --- no record. That is just plain stupid. I read the CR reviews and bought both of the top rated VCR's. The Sony is indeed second-choice to this one. But I am not happy with the SLP recording quality for regular broadcast, especially for still and slow motion. (It is better than the Sony) However the SLP is pretty good with digital cable movies and live broadcasts. The remote takes some getting used to, and the rewind to zero feature does not work unless you first display the counter on the screen.

It would keep doing this until we turned the VCR off.When you inserted a tape recorded on one of our other VCRs it would adjust the tracking until the picture was a diagonal smear.

My daughter points and says \\"ball, ball!\\" throughout the book.The story is wonderful on so many levels. Everything rhymes, which really holds a child's interest, expecially because it's easy to read aloud with enthusiasm in rhyme. There's a numbering scheme (one spider, two beetles, three fireflies, etc.) to teach counting to kids. There's also a nice moral to the story, as in most of the \\"Little Miss Spider\\" and \\"Miss Spider\\" books. As the adult reading to a child, I never tire of the rhyme and the heartwarming story.

For decades, children have been taught not to get into a car with strangers. To be careful of known and potential dangers. But along comes David Kirk, telling children that staying away from a known danger is just prejudice. It hurts the feelings of the one who presents the danger. How horrid!Miss Spider wants to throw a party. The bugs won't come, because spiders eat bugs. They don't refuse because Miss Spider is ugly or strange, but because she is dangerous. The story ends with them \\"realizing\\" that because she's nice, they don't have to worry about the danger.Recognizing danger and having irrational bias are two different things.

It suffers from what many history books suffer - too many names and facts. This is a novel - the story of three people: Elizabeth, Devreux and Grania.The portrait of Elizabeth rings true, but not that of Grania. She speaks like a tough from Dublin, not a gentlewoman of the west of Ireland. Likely that characterisation arises from the fact that she is called a pirate in English records, She and her family were Gaelic-speaking. The author seems unaware of how different she was perceived in the Gaelic world - then and now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging story exposes hidden history","review":"I love historical fiction, and I love pirates - especially when they are women. This book is a fabulous blend of the two! A glimpse into Elizabeth I's fear and dread of aging, losing her sexuality, and her power, toward the end of her glorious reign, as well as an honest look at the social conditions of the day regarding \\"a woman's place\\" through the eyse of two very powerful women, (and several power-hungry men). Grace O'Malley's life story, and struggle for her country, is amazing and should have been explored in a novel (or hey, even plain old history!) more often.

I met the author at one of SARK's gatherings last summer and was very interested in reading what she had to say.

Similar colors, similar self-depricating thoughts and self doubt, similar media and technique (no, SAME technique and media)While I could appreciate a page or two, a whole book of this \\"I hate myself, and I need to be loved\\" BS was a bit much.I probably would have churned out a similar, steaming pile at the age of 21, but at 42, I'm looking for more variety, more design elements, more work and less blah-blah about how much she worries about having freckles, (gee, would I offer to trade cancer for freckles?

First off: The art is gorgeous. Really. Her collages are very personal and her effort pays off hansomly. On the other hand, the content of the book itself is pretty much a big downer. There's no resolution to any of her dillemas, just a big complaint about how she feels she has no control about her esteem-lacking life. I'm sure that if I knew her I would be feeling much different. But there isn't the payoff that comes with seeing the other side of her personality. I do hope she keeps writing (she does have promise and her art is great), but her next piece has more \\"arc\\" to it from the internally repressed to the externally liberated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Confusing...","review":"I am usually a big fan of this type of book.

This book is the epitome of creative, it literally spills creativity and reflection from the first page to the last. It is colourful, astonishingly thoughtful and indescribly beautiful. I can see why Sark and Sabrina have befriended each other, it is easy to see that their souls undoubtably dance to the same tune. They are both beautiful and this shines in their glorious books.

He has learned from the best, hes overly passionate about animation, it is all a lifestyle for him, and he does nothing more gracefully other than teaching it to others. This book is one of the reasons animation has had a leap in quality towards the better.Definitly a musthave if you are seeking to learn the basics of animation regardless of the medium you are using, wheather classical, stopmotion or 3D animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Animators Bible!","review":"If any beginner animator wants to know how to start 2D animation then this book is a must! Richard doesn't use fancy big words to describe what to do in animation, no, he keeps the sentence short, sweet, and simple. There are many pictures with at least a short sentence to guide you through the movement of animation with keys and breakdowns! He also covers the importance of weight, arcs and many more! In his introduction he gives you a story of his personal experience as an animator with people that have taught him the values of animation which shows that you're getting advice from a person who went through many years of learning! Plus he has worked on really smooth animations like \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" and \\"Thief and the Cobbler\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Going back to basics","review":"Alot of people these days get caught up with computer animation without really understanding the basic concepts of movement and animation. This book goes through and describes how it all used to be done on paper, and includes lots of example diagrams and drawings. A great reference book for people wanting to learn how to animate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I've only read through about 50 pages of this book so far, but... omigod what an awesome book! Definitely should be on the shelf of anyone serious about character animation, whether you are doing 3D digital animation or traditional hand-drawn animation. Williams goes into incredible detail on motion, 'tweening, timing, and also has some great anecdotes from working with some of the legendary animators from Disney and Warner Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely essential","review":"I took Williams' masterclass many years ago, and this book is an excellent distillation of everything he taught in that class, and then some. While I think he almost spends TOO much time on walk cycles and not quite enough on accents and weight, this book covers all the bases quite well. It bridges the gap between Preston Blair's book, which is primarily step-by-step, and _The Illusion of Life_, which is primarily theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"Hands down one of the best animation books out there. It's a visual guide, history, and how to manual all rolled into one. I can't think of many books that deal with classical animation that feel as complete and authoritative as this book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is one of the best books on frame-by-frame 2D non-vector animation. The only problem is, Richard Williams overdoes it by a large margin. He is a man possessed with talent, and he demands perfection of himself. That is a hard way to do things, no? In every other respect, this book is excellent. By the way, the culmination of Richard Williams' style of work is the movie The Cobbler and the Thief, available online on [...]. The exact title to search for is this: The Thief and the Cobbler (2007 Recobbled Cut) [v2.0]"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good","review":"This book covers more or less every aspect of classical drawn animation, and almost all the techniques are directly transferrable to 3d animation aswell, plenty of examples of walkcycles, runcycles, takes, accents etc.More than everything this book makes you realize that animation is 'simple' but hard work :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic!","review":"An absolutely great, in-depth book for both theory and practice. Insight gathered from old-time greats in addition to superbly detailed diagrammic exercises.

I mean REALLY learn animation.Tons of illustration, fun and intuitive reading, it's a must have for everyone who loves animation. I just love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a college textbook...","review":"I bought this book as it was a required text for my Animation 101 course. While it's interesting because it was written (and drawn) by the creator of Roger Rabbit, it's quit boring if you are not enthusiastic about animation. It focuses on drawing techniques to help cel animation, but does not touch on any computer animation which is why I gave it 2 out of 5 stars.If you are a serious artist interested in cartoons, live drawings, and animations, this book is a great reference tool. (Especially for creating walking sequences.) For those of you like me who prefer creating things on the computer, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECEIVED IT","review":"I don't know what's the problem between AMAZON and this book.I order it over THREE MOUNTHS, and never received it.

A story about Oxford right after the time of the Inklings! Why hadn't I heard of this book before? After I began reading the book, I realized why.The story is told to you, instead of letting you experience it. The characters and the plot were a bit predictable, even Mary Sue and Gary Stew-ish. After reading 1/3 way through, hoping the story would begin to flow, I gave up and just read the last three chapters. This book could have been half the size and perhaps been a better read.The good part was learning about the Inkling, C.S. Lewis and Tolkien especially. Those parts were great, making me think that perhaps this book should have been a creative non-fiction account of the author's personal discovery and research of the Inklings. I won't be reading the rest of this series, unless someone convinces me that the writing has improved.One star for a good premise, one star for research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super good!","review":"My boyfriend got me these for Valentines.

I used the ear thermometer on her and got readings of about 99.8-100.0. This thermomoeter? Still 96.2. I haven't ever gotten a reading besides 96.2 for either of us, so I think that must be the only thing it is programmed to say. Don't waste your money on this one.

To be honest, I wanted to see how the war was going, not read endless discussions of the diplomacy involved.I have to say though, that I did enjoy the relationship between Alec and Seregil, and the devotion that Alec showed, even when Seregil was having problems coping. I also enjoyed the other relationship that was developed over the course of the novel.I hope the next book with Seregil and Alec ties up some of the loose ends that the book leaves open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I couldn't put the book done.

I really liked the way the Aurenfaie lived and their complex sense of honour, and Seregil and Alec are as always lovable and witty! and I liked the way one gets to know Thero better, one other character that I liked was Nyal, I liked the way one wasn't sure of his intentions or where his loyalties were. For new readers I wouldn't recommend reading this one first since it has ties in the two previous ones and besides no one should miss the other two. Now my final wish is that the next book will come soon!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is wonderful","review":"I have loved each of the nightrunner books and this one is definately worth reading.

But, I can say that I already know that this book will be spectacular! When I read the privious two books in this series i was in awe. I could not put the books down until I went from cover to cover. I have been begrudgingly reading one book or another from time to time since i finiched Stalking Darkness trying to bide my time till Traitors Moon would come out.

Too contrived for my taste, and unlike the first 2 books, there was some real slow going. This series should have stopped at 2 books--there really wasn't more to tell, and Sergeril's homeland just isn't enough to fill a book. Still, check out the first 2 books and read some really good fantasy with a nice take on the orphan boy plot device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typos Every 50-75 Locations","review":"In the kindle edition, unlike the trade paperback that I read a decade ago, the high frequency of typographical errors in Traitor's Moon became distracting very quickly. Often it required me to reread passages a few times before I understood what the author intended. This electronic edition needs to rechecked by the publisher.It's still a good story, worthy of my 4-star rating. But prospective readers should understand what they'll get with this kindle book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I loved it, this series is one of my new favorites.

Alec is my favorite character but this book has made me think twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I expected more from the series. The first two installments where incredible, but this last one leaves much to be desired. I could care less about how much Alec and Seregil love each other; yes it is good character development, but Lynn Flewelling takes it to far. Where is the action, the suspense, and the character development. Alec's big secret past is anything but a surprise, the whole novel reads like a bad Nancy Drew novel. I was very disappointed, the only redeeming aspects where the characters, and even they are weak in this installment.

What more could you ask for?I bought this because it sounded neat but now I must say that I'm a believer. The software works great and the company supports the product very well. They send me a free monthly newsletter with cooking tips and recipes that I can download right into my software.

My version is as current as the new ones, because they keep updating the software and allowing downloads. True there are somethings that could make it better, but thats the same with any product.

Sure he was sent away by his employers, but hey, he got a fully paid college education out of it. And the people at the house, the other servants that helped raise him?

For the recycling however it just doesn't work. when we add small boxes (ceral boxes etc), stuff plastic jugs or anything hard and pull the bag out of the kitchen recycling basket to place it in the garage there's a rip every time. I can't even imagine what would happen to these if we placed them directly on the street (which is what we have to do for recycling pick up).

By that time the full bags are already in the can and it's not a big deal, but geez . . . the only nice thing I have to say is about the recycled content. Considering that other bag brands contain more recycled content and/or are biodegradable and are stronger, that's not such bright spot after all.Most of the bags are still in the box, but I can't stand to use these for the kitchen garbage anymore.

While amusing factoids and insights occasionally appear in it (though hardly provocative), much of the book reads as well as an undergraduate term paper for an introductory history course. There is a lack of cohesiveness and flow throughout the chapters, which sometimes lose focus. Considering the credentials and past successes of the author, I have to believe that an earlier draft of the book was mistakenly given to the printers. While a succinct piece on Alexander is welcome, this book sadly fails to provide an insightful and satisfying snapshot of the conqueror.In my opinion, if readers are interested in an engrossing psychological examination of the historical Alexander, they would be better served by Michael Woods' documentary and/or companion book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, It's Just Terrible","review":"Please don't read this if you have a love of history or hope to attain one!

My two purposes were 1) teach him about Alexander the Great and 2) show him how scholarly history books, as opposed to history text books, are written.This book has served as a good example of a bad example.To be charitable, I see that the copyright belongs to the Estate of Norman Cantor and was published after his death. I will assume that his illness led to the low quality of this book. Otherwise, I must assume he was a piss-poor professor.For the sakes of New York University, Tel Aviv University, and the Rhodes and Fulbright organizations, besides Mr. Cantor's reputation, the Estate should never have published this book in its present form.I am very disinclined to read any other works of Mr. Cantor's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy, dull biography","review":"Is it possible to make the life one of the most compelling men who ever lived into an incredibly boring biography?

I was one of those people who always bought his records without ever reading reviews and was sure that even if it was a sub par album I'd find one gem on it but there was not one song that was even remotely memorable on this one. I was so depressed ! In a word it was just BAD and even worse than the next stinker I got by him - Landing on Water. These 2 records were largely the reason I stopped buying music around then.

That is, I can't believe she served so much time. They should have been able to get her out sooner. Anyway, I love to watch the old TV series, but it's refreshing to see Lucy in a different role.

She's uplifting and motivational. It's difficult to persevere over one or two hurdles, but Dr. McCauley-Bell had more than her share. She certainly deserves the successes she's been able to achieve. Her story is well written. It was wonderful to see her growth as a Christian from a young person to a mature adult. It was also especially noteworthy to realize the depths of her soul, which she needed to lay bare for the world in order to achieve her goal of sharing with and encouraging others. She's fearless. In a day and age when role-models are typically not worthy of the title, Dr. McCauley-Bell is a breath of fresh air.

But to true He-Man fans like myself, this movie is nothing less than a milestone. The special effects were ahead of their time, and the action sequences (especially the final confrontation between He-Man and Skeletor) were exceptional. The acting left little to be desired -- particularly Frank Langella's portrayal of the sinister Skeletor. And though the movie would have fared better to include more classic cartoon-originated characters (Where the heck were Trapjaw, Tri-clops, Ram-man, and the others?) and fewer \\"newbies\\" (Where the heck did Karg, Saurod, and Blade come from?), it still had a decent plot.

BUT... Frank Langella has given a performance which makes Skeletor, in my opinion, one of the best movie villians ever (right up there with Jack Nicholson's Joker, Darth Vader, and General Kaal from Willow). He made lines which from a run-of-the-mill actor could have been cheesy really resonate (\\"Then let this be our final battle!\\"). Plus, the skull make-up was pulled off very nicely. Oh, did anyone else notice that the Sorceress's line toward the end -- about evil men looking back over the mistakes of their lives and calling it destiny -- was just a really good line for this type of movie? Anyway..."},{"rating":"2","title":"is good","review":"This movie does quite well interpretting he-man into a live-action form using 1986 technology. If this movie came out today, i am sure that it would have elements such as orko and battle-cat... fine performances by all... I know why skeletor wants castle greyskull so much: he just wants it. I mean, if someone else was living in a castle with a large sculpture of your head on it, wouldn't you be mad enough to storm the castle and take it? That's another great thing about this movie: skeletor is winning right up until the end... he becomes the master of the universe even... fine film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"Calling this film bad is like saying the Empire State Building is tall. Bad acting, poor writing, horribly staged action scenes. The only saving grace from keeping this off of \\"Battlefield Earth\\" status is some \\"good\\" acting from Langella which is only considered good when compared with the rest of the cast. It also features a nice score from Bill Conti, but oh what a waste.

Hollywood could not have picked better characters to play these parts. Dolph Lundgren as He-Man, and Frank Langella as Skeletor were the perfect choices. If the whole movie had stayed on Eternia, this movie might have been a keeper. Unfortunately, the whole cast decided to come to Earth, and that was the biggest mistake of the movie! Earthlings just don't mix with other guys from other worlds, and it certainly shows in the mix. I think this should be a lesson to Hollywood- if you are going to make a movie about cartoon characters, watch what makes the cartoon work in the first place, then make the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cartoon turned into a great movie!!!!","review":"Putting a name like Masters of the Universe as a title makes you a winner already, and then further more to put Dolph Lundgren in it as Heman, well you have yourself a winner.

The Cartoon show that is. This remake for the big screen did a lot of things to change the story. Not a single one of which I agree with. For one thing in this movie you will see a lot of ray guns. Something you never would see in the cartoon. He-Man is not Star Wars. Although they tried to make Masters of the Universe the movie more like Star Wars then the actual cartoon. Seeing He-Man with his ray gun was rather dissapointing. I found this film to be ok. OK acting. OK story. OK effects. Although I do like how they did the Skeletor mask. Meg Foster is very attractive as Evil-Lyn and Dolph Lundgren looks just like a real life He-Man would look. This film stars a young Courtney Cox from TV's \\"Friends\\" as the young girl the Masters must save. Another letdown was the omition of that awesome wizard from the cartoon that didn't have a face.

Father time has sweetened your memory of this wretched film, I assure you.

Dolph says doing this movie essentially tanked his carrer, I can't really say for certain if it did, but I think it was more of the dead-pan performances that he sometimes gave during the movie that made his part so bad.

It isn't exactly weighty material but Fonda has incredible charm, as well as beauty, and Rod Taylor matches that charm on the male side. Cliff Robertson, Jo Morrow, and Robert Culp add nice performances. It won't make you think much, but it's a fun movie about nice people in funny situations.

So for the 2 star review before, it is just plain silly. However, this is a great book if you like to sit back and dream ideas for your backyard. It has some ideas that may be out of reach financially for some, but it also has some budget tight ideas as well. And you can create a combo of both if you'd like!

I was introduced to this book after telling someone about \\"Botany of Desire\\" and they felt that \\"A Natural History of the Senses\\" would be something I would enjoy. It is not a history of history or the senses, or nature. It took three tries for me to get past the first PAGE and agony to get through the entire book. Utter Torture. Utter Pap.

After quite a few false starts, I've made it close to halfway through the book, and won't be going any further. This book seems to be well received, but it'd definitely not for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sensual Dessert","review":"Diane Ackerman paints a magical, exquisite path of words as you explore the five senses & beyond through the talent of her pen. Along the way you will learn some pretty amazing facts about body, mind, self, and the amazing world around us all. This is a truly mesmerizing journey that you won't want to put down until it's over. The only complaint I have is that it is written twenty years ago (1990) so this will date the information just a little. Plus, it does contain some un-PC words like \\"Orientals\\" to describe Asians & a total disregard for veganism/ vegetarianism with misinformation about protein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry and Science","review":"When I first read Diane Ackerman's book it opened my eyes, just as these other reviews testify. It does seem to be a book people either love or hate (I have some friends who thought it was sentimental babbling) but that doesn't change how extravagantly Ackerman uses language itself to convey the lush world of the senses. I teach a creative writing course at SFSU and I use the book to promote both that poetic description and the possibilities for experience and awareness the book evokes. An excellent example of the ways poetry can be used to explain science and experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Journey From First Page To Last","review":"This is the most beautiful book I have ever read. It opened my eyes to the world and how its viewed by all of our senses. I will never just brew myself a cup of coffee ever again. Instead, I will feel the grinds in my hand, savor the rich aroma, hear the pop and hum of the coffee maker and then taste the rich, earthy coffee.Yes, this is a journey for the senses but also an expansion of the mind. Ackerman expands the mind with some of the most interesting facts about nature, science, and history. Not boring humdrum facts you could care less about but meaningful tidbits of knowledge you'll want to impress your friends with.This is not just a book; it's an experience; for your senses, your mind, and your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane Ackerman, a poet who makes science poetic!","review":"A Natural History of the Senses, is the kind of book you can open at any place and find yourself enthralled by the use of words.

So many questions that I never even thought to ask are answered in this beautiful tour through our senses.Ms. Ackerman breaks down our entire ability to perceive into seven bite sized pieces. In the end, you'll know yourself better than when you started.The first graph in her chapter on vision is worth the price of the book. She builds a \\"sense\\" of drama before the climax of declaring you a predator. The present tense explanation of how we really use our senses is convincingly proven with irrefutable rhetorical questions that prove the universality of how and why we react to stimuli the way we do.Read this book and the you'll see why your child doesn't eat her brussels sprouts. It's too bad wine is an alcoholic beverage. If it weren't, the best wine critics would be second graders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is full of interesting information about the five senses. I gave it only 4 out of 5 stars though because I thought the chapters on hearing and vision got a little off the topic at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful digressions","review":"A collection of delightful and digressive essays about smelling, tasting, touching, hearing and seeing. It's meant for entertainment rather than solid instruction. (Read my \\"Psychiatry of Stroke\\" to get the anatomy and physiology). Ackerman covers some of the science but there are no illustrations, tables or references (except for a list of books for further reading at the end) and it leans to the humanities rather than technology. My copy has a 1990 publication date and I don't know if it's been revised. There's nothing about the discoveries concerning the sense of smell that brought Linda Buck and Richard Axel the 2004 Nobel Prize.The prose style is something you might love or hate, with many complex sentences and unusual words and much display of erudition. Some of the insights were brilliant and original but I would agree with the reviewer who found some of them to be platitudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful Tidbits Hidden in Self-Indulgent Slough","review":"This book is heavily overwritten and wrought with unnecessary language.It's like sloughing through a marsh of melted Valentine's Day candy with an undercurrent of bread dough--a whole lot of sticky fluff and very little of scholarly or intellectual interest. There are kernels of useful (sometimes insightful) information hidden in the muck, like the insides of those same melted candies, but the self-indulgent writing style isn't worth plowing through. It's a shame she felt the need to prove some kind of neo-Victorian chops."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Natural History of the Bored Stiff Reader","review":"Although Ackerman's zest for the senses was more than obvious throughout the text, the book suffered from an insufferable amount of anecdotes (some of which had no connection at all whatsoever to the titles). Shame, that the reader had to wait to get all the way to the last chapter on Synesthesia to begin enjoying what started out as quite an exciting read. While I did enjoy the odd fact, I can't help but wonder who let her carry on adding the same tiresome biographical snippets which bogged the whole book down to the bottom of my trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be misled...","review":"This book is anything but a Natural History of the senses. Ackerman takes a few scientific facts about the senses and fluffs them up with rambling prose about her own experiences.The more science-oriented passages were superficial and extremely brief, and I found the prose to be monotonous and dry. Other reviewers' description of her prose as \\"cloying\\" is very appropriate. Her use of imagery and metaphors is at times creative, yet overwhelming, and she offers very little substance to balance it.I can only begin to imagine the thrills of hearing about the luscious and sensual natural history of her garden. Too bad I won't be getting around to reading that one...I give the book two stars instead of one for the interesting factoids she inserts here and there, irrelevant though they may be to the surrounding text.

I'm from Long Island, a native speaker of the LI accent, and I've seen Grey Gardens probably around 500 times. I know what they're saying and it is not what is printed in the subtitles much of the time. Perhaps whoever did the subtitles is not a LI native. It's not really a complaint, but if you really want to know what they're saying you just have to listen closely and let your ear guide you, because if you take your info from the subtitles, it sometimes alters the actual meaning of what they're saying.

They constantly rip and are very hard to use when you need them to separate quickly. In addition, the moisture content is not equally distributed throughout the whole package probably due to the poor quality of fiber material. Near the top of the package the wipes don't seem very moist, but at the end they are soaking wet and rip into pieces easier. The texture of the wipe is also quite rough compared to other wipes I've used. I find myself using more wipes to get the job done than other wipes I've used.

Tushies, that's where! I searched all over for a wipe without propylene glycol and found Tushies. The fact that they are made in the US and not tested on animals are just perks.Tushies are soft, they do the cleanup they're supposed to with ease and comfort and have the perfect amount of wetness. Plus, the cute teddy bear, beach ball, star, ducky, and alphabet decoration makes them fun to look at!The ONLY thing that I might like improved would be the perforation between wipes.

The Tushies wipes shredded when I tried to pull one out of the pack, and they are not designed to pop out of the package like every other brand of wipes does! This makes them impossible to use as a refill in a wipe box. Imagine me managing my squirming baby with one hand, trying to scrape up the edge of the next wipe through the small hole in the top of the package with a fingernail of the other hand, only to have a tiny patch of the wipe rip off when I pull on it.

They are perforated and connected.. and they are really hard to separate! We all know changing diapers involves one hand holding feet and arms out of the way, so the other hand gets the wipes..

I sharpened a couple kitchen knives and cut raw chicken like I was cutting butter. This system is well worth the money the only problem I have had is I needed to replace the hone guide it's made of aluminum and where it makes contact with the blade is pretty thin and I broke it but the replacement was less then 10 bucks maybe just order an extra when buying the kit. All in all this is well worth the money and I will be buying a kit for my brother for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fast workout","review":"This is perfect if you want a good, fast paced workout. The first section is squats, lunges, and kicks; then floorwork for your legs; then a thorough ab section. I like it because it gives your muscles a good burn but you're not doing endless reps. I would do a more thorough leg workout in addition to this but it does a good job. Make sure to add heavier weights to make it harder. The ab section is tough."},{"rating":"1","title":"black and white book not advanced","review":"I read the good review from here and brought this book, only found this is more like a training material without any good quality picture to show how to do things.

This book hits and misses in trying to collect the basics for surgical knowledge and more.You'll find many missing points which you can fill from the internet or from magazines or other resources.Most of the chapters are excellent and are probably all what you might need for your college study like those on trauma, diseases of the thyroid and parathyroid, metabolic response to injury etc.. but there are some which are disasterous like the chapter on breast conditions, but probably the subject itself is complex and controversial anyway.The text overall is very well written and the structure and design of each chapter is very logical, some figures are not so great though, plus the book needs an update. you might consider supplementing it with Surgical clinics of north amarica for some of the chapters you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The number one book to read on Arnold","review":"This is a compact, intelligent account of Arnold's work and life. It is not just a narrative; it argues for the pervasive power of Arnold's spiritual search throughout his work, from the poetry, to the cultural criticism, to the neglected religious criticism. If you want to know more about Arnold, this is the book to read: less dense than the Trilling biography, more intellectual than the Hamilton and Honan biographies, and better than any student introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"electronic playing card shuffler","review":"I bought this item a few weeks ago for a gentleman who has problems with his hands.

If one is open minded about the heavens, and hereafter, this is the book for you. I actually saw myself in many of the aspects of the readings. It has no negativity, and allows you to believe that there is only good to come to those who have faith. I have purchased all of Echo Bodine's books, but this is my favorite. I recommend you read all of her books - it gives you hope if you are willing to consider all that she discusses just \\"may\\" be true.

I suggest anyone who has a question about their spiritual life, and looks anywhere but their own heart, buy a fortune cookie -- much more reasonable, and as accurate as Echo Bodine. I asked her for some medical information, and she was dead wrong, as proven later in time. When I told her about it, and requested a refund. Her only response was, \\"I don't know why I was given the wrong information. And I don't have $200 just laying around\\".

This book should never have been published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gathering by a shrewd, inventive, always empathic Master.","review":"Word for word, there's more going on in one of Grace Paley's small masterpieces than in any hefty bestseller on-shelf today. With a single phrase, she can sum up the fullest life, skewer the truth at the heart of things, or send a story off in a direction that surprises in the most satisfying ways. This is an artist who creates characters who live, who delight, who enrich us for knowing them, however briefly. In my favorite story, \\"A Conversation with My Father,\\" Paley provides a summation of her aesthetic: \\"Everyone, real or invented,\\" the story tells us, \\"deserves the open destiny of life.\\" In this collection, you will find a fearless, insightful, & inventively-entertaining explorer as your guide to such \\"open destinies.\\" It's all here: romance, satire, experimental art, drama that's almost epic, humane warmth. This is literature at its freshest, not because it's new, but because it is timeless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Living in the neighborhood","review":"The characters in these stories are consistent throughout the book. Reading the stories was like getting acquainted with a community of people. I lost interest in some stories, while others contained gems of wisdom and phrases that stopped me in my tracks.In a story called, \\"A Conversation With My Father\\" Paley writes:\\"\\"I would like you to write a simple story just once more,\\" he says, \\"the kind Maupassant wrote, or Chekhov, the kind you used to write. Just recognizable people and then write down what happened to them next.\\"I say, \\"Yes, why not? That's possible.\\" I want to please him, though I don't remember writing that way. I would like to try to tell such a story, if he means the kind that begins:'There was a woman...\\" followed by plot, the absolute line between two points which I've always despised. not for literary reasons, but because it takes all hope away. Everyone, real or invented, deserves the open destiny of life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Prose as deep as poetry","review":"I'm in a discussion group centered on Paley's stories, which I've always wanted to read, and was delighted to buy a copy of it so efficiently online.

Handel clearly illustrates his analysis by using quotes from the works of the major theorists. The most rewarding parts of the book to me were the sections on the importance of politics to the military commander, moral forces in war as found in Clausewitz, and chapter 9: \\"The Supreme Act of Judgement: Understanding the Nature of War and the Trinitarian Analysis.\\" This is an essential companion and well worth one's time to read in order to achieve a deeper understanding of Clausewitz beyond a few pithy quotes misapplied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Graphic Novel.","review":"It is best that I could buy in terms of graphic novels are concerned.The story is very good and the art is to live up to such an excellent story.Totally recommend it for collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royalties included","review":"The new edition doesn't have the lyrics (The Cure, Joy Division) that this one does.First editions are worth it when things have been edited out."},{"rating":"2","title":"chilling","review":"I saw the movie when I was 14 years old in '95 and have loved it ever since. I was always a fan of Brandon Lee, and the fact that he died while making he movie made me love it even more. I had no idea it was an adaption of a comic so when I finally read the comic book it became my favorite movie of all time. The story is chilling and memorable, and you can feel every bit of Eric's pain. O'barr makes sure of it. The book was much grittier than the movie, but still captured the gothic darkness of the book. I think this is where the other crow movies messed up at is forgetting that this was originally a comic book. I don't at all think that the crow mythos is geared only to rockers and goth heads. I think it's for anyone who loves trajedy, undying love, revenge, and graphic violence all rolled into a gripping story. Thank you James O'barr for sharing your pain, and bringing the story of the crow to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully ,tragic, haunting and I'll never forget it !","review":"I'm speechless I watched the movie then pretty much got myself a copy the next day it was that good.

Nothing will ever come close to The Crow. The story and the art will touch every emotion in your soul if you take the time to read it. It is even better than the film. It is a beautiful haunting love story that is very poetic. It is well worth the price and it is well worth your time. The only piece of art that can ever compare to this is the Brandon Lee film.You will love this book if you like The Crow but you may be let down if you want it to be exactly like the film. It is different from the film in many ways but the core themes of the story are the same. You will kick yourself if you don't give it a shot because it is VERY hard to find. I had to wait three years before I could find a copy. Do yourself a favor and buy this book if you like graphic novels. You will be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST GRAPHIC NOVEL EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"\\"The Crow\\" is a lot different from the movie that made Brandon Lee a legend. The title refers to the main character, Eric, when after he died he saw a crow that told him to \\"not look,\\" which becomes his persona when he comes back. However, Eric/the Crow is the most realistic comic character to us all who were torn away from/or rejected by those we love. The art is very remonescent of the late Will Eisner, the \\"god\\" of comics. \\"The Crow\\" is definately a comic book classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific and thats all i have to say","review":"i haven't read this one yet but i have read all 3 of the other novels and i'm reading broken lives and shattered dreams and for james o'barr to create such an extraordinary character is amazing and for anyone who has been inspired by him congradulations on discovering you talent thanks to his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I just read this book after remembering not liking parts of the original movie I saw, hoping the actual work the movie had been based on was better. It wasn't, it was worse. The author kept referencing various other points of literature and music, including direct Joy Division quotations in the titles and dialogue (nothing wrong Joy Division of course, but utilizing pre-existing titles and threads, as well as a good bit of the layout and artwork, from somebody else's aesthetic concept is just plain lazy); as well as other various poets, writers, and even an entire Cure song. Very cardboard cutout stock, characters, zero development, and no, the lead character was not very developed either. An adolescent boring read, though mercifully quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great graphic novel","review":"I'm so glad they re-released this graphic novel.

It's battered and creased because I carried it around in my backpack for so long, reading it again and again. I came to Amazon to get a new copy because my old one is so worn-out. I don't know of anyone who has read The Crow without it seriously affecting them. It's out of print now for some reason I cannot understand, but if you can find a used copy, then by all means do so.

This was the best book that I've read this year. Jacquelyn Mitchard is a wonderful writer, very gifted in creating a world with her words. As you read, you feel that you inhabit that world and get to know the characters that live in that world. Sure, some of the characters are more fully developed than others, but so what? I see that some other reviewers thought that this book does not come up to the quality of Deep End of the Ocean & I agree, but don't let that keep you from reading this story, it's still better than 75% of what's out there! I checked to see how much I paid for this Kindle book: $3.20 and I see it's available for $2.99 right now. I sure got my money's worth and then some!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't Pay Full Price","review":"This book took me forever to read! I would read it at night before I went to bed and a few pages in I'd put it to go to sleep. It took a while for the book to pick-up and once it did pick-up it slowed down pretty quickly! I recommend getting at a bargain price or from your local library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lowdown on the Breakdown","review":"Once again Jacquelyn Mitchard has captured and translated into words the essence of family relationships. This time, Ms. Mitchard takes her readers through the \\"breakdown\\" of a seemingly all together family. As the heroine, and she is a heroine, confronts spousal rejection and family dysfunctionality as well as learns to battle her worst fears, she discovers who she is and what she is capable of. She is sometimes ashamed and often angry but she is always determined. This powerful tale will encourage the discouraged and help us all to understand that life may not have fairy tale endings but it may offer surprising good endings after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful writing","review":"This book was so well written. The story line had me enthralled from page 1. I found myself thinking about the characters during the day and could not wait to get home to read more. I didnt want it to end. I will definitely read more from this author. I love her writing style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting and Beautiful","review":"Jacquelyn Mitchard's novel THE BREAKDOWN LANE is about one woman dealing with a life that is unravelling around her. Mitchard deeply explores the psyche of the emotionally wounded, but she writes about it with such honesty and beauty that you do not feel that you are being forced, heavy-handedly, towards the box of tissues. Instead you are willingly allowing your heart to be opened up and explored, ultimately offering hope and comfort. I think this is a fantastic book and the strength that lies within her main character, Julieanne, is inspiring. She has the grace of a dancer and the strength of a lion. She is the woman I want to be at this moment in my life and for all the difficult moments following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Weekend Read","review":"This turned out to be one heck of a deal. I got it for less than four bucks off of Amazon and it was worth every penny and more! The plot was pretty juicy, with a lot of melodrama, perfect for that week when you want to eat a lot of pizza and chocolate-ladies you know what I'm talking about. What's more is the characters are very real, you will easily find yourself relating and asking, \\"could that ever be me?\\" Needless to say, it's fiction and Mitchard provides what I like- the fairy tale happy ending. Well as close to fairy tale as this story will allow. Because of this, the book's believability(is that even a word?) rate drops a bit, but hey, it's fiction! A good solid read, perfect for the beach, a rainy weekend, or...that time of the month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters","review":"It's so refreshing to find a book with characters you actually care about. Mitchard uses two points of view to tell this engrossing story, and I really enjoyed the two different perspectives.

To give an example, people with MS do not give themselves injections once a month. And the injectable medications are not \\"cancer meds.\\" If you want to get accurate information, look at the National MS Society or another of the excellent groups online or at your library or bookstore. Of course I realize that this is a novel, and not a reference book, but I am disappointed that Ms. Mitchard did not do better research for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chose to perform","review":"This will be a very brief review, but basically we have chosen this book to perform for or theatre studies cat.

There is weak imagery combined by poor, ineffective dialogue, yet there are nice character settings. There is a nice story line combining fire and passion in Leonardo's case with love for the bride, yet it is let down by the poor use of language.

Also in the roof where they had stapled it together, the wood had split.It was packaged very poorly and had either bounced around quite a bit and been damaged that way or was damaged by the stapler.Very disappointing purchase.Especially since it was to be a Christmas gift for my mom and it was late getting here and we were going to her house that night for Christmas, I had no choice but to take it anyway and tell her that I would try and get it replaced.SAD, but true....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed construction","review":"Very disappointed.

This book was recommended to me, but I would have difficulty recommending to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Its not a reference book so don't expect it to have everything on the subject. A good book though, you can read this book through and through. I judge such books on whether I get something useful out of reading them. No book and no writer is perfect, the technology being discussed in not perfect either, so try not to keep your hopes up.Not everything in TAPI works!But this books walks you through the TAPI programming taking a very easy to follow approach, you feel like you are ambling around amongst the concepts being discussed. I found the TSP discussed later in the book especially useful.Reading it would be worth its while. An appreciable effort by the authors.I'll add that I'm writing this review a long time after I bought the book as it was only recently that I read it. If some of the info in the book is obsolete, you cant really hold the author responsible for that.

Later I found out it was just setting up a place where a lot of the stuff happens. It's about a guy named Jeff and he chooses ceramics so he won't have to take a history class. He hates Ellen, but to him she is known as the fat girl. She stares and admires him. Soon his hatred for Ellen turns into fascination. He soon wants to be friends with Ellen and help her make other friends. It's full of surprises so it keeps you interested most of the time. There were some slow and kind of going nowhere parts to it, but there weren't to many. I choose to read this book because of the title mostly, it sounded very interesting and it was. So if you like stories about different kinds of people and how they react to society this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Reach Full Potential","review":"It had all the factors for a great story: The drama, a prohibited love and a new perspective...a guy's perspective. I guess it was nice to view things in a guy's P.O.V (point of view)but it didn't change the fact that the actual development of the story didn't reach its full potential. I was disappointed when i finished it, not because it completely sucked but because more could have been done to it. Many of the characters annoyed me, like Wanda, Norma and Jeff's mom, but its all part of the story.The level of Jeff and Ellen's romance was G rated, which collided with the gravity of the drama Jeff's family was going through. I mean, Sachs even included suicide, a touchy subject, but Jeff and Ellen's physical progress didn't advance much which made it seem like they were fifteen years old, not seventeen. It had a good story plot but not a good storytellng."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Concept, Well Executed","review":"Interesting film. Oddly enough, I stumbled across this film at a local library! I read the premise and had to see how this was executed.It's filmed very amateur style, but not poorly. The fact that it's black and white I think adds to it. There are some really nice looking shots, as well as some truly creepy ones. The acting is well...hard to say. It really comes off as if everyone is just being themselves, but not in a way that looks bad. It almost feels like a home movie instead of a real film. I think in this way, it makes the events that unfold have that much more of an impact on you.I only have 2 complaints: 1. It moves a bit slow at parts. 2. The killing scenes aren't very well filmed, especially the 2nd. All in all, it's an interesting concept and I feel it's worth checking out. The fact that there are 2 actual handicapped people in the film is neat. Make sure to check out the interviews as well, very good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original for sure","review":"The material in this film about a disabled serial killer is very well handled. The direction was excellent for a lower budget film and the acting was spot on - I am glad to have this film in my collection. The story will def. upset those that are easily offended, but this is a genre gem and an original film to be sure. The severe disability the main actor suffers in real life and on the screen brings an emotional kick in the pants with it as the story unfolds and be sure to check out the DVD interveiws of the cast involved!!!

But I loved this book! This book shows you, in a wonderful way how it must be,to be a vampire. You get a fantastic insight into the vampire mind. Intrigue and suspense are the keywords in this book. After reading this book you will understand why a Ventrue is an ideal prince, how Toreador operate and why the Sabbat is a viable alternative to the camarilla. If you are looking for physical action and bonecrushing, go watch an action-movie! If you are a hunter fan you can ignore this book, this book is solely about vamires. There is not a hunter in sight. This is a great book, and Carl Bowen is a great writer with prospects."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hunters at all but loads of boring vampires","review":"When I bought this book, I hoped to get a further insight into the world of the hunters, and - as a bonus - some interesting vampirecharacters, too.

Even Vampirefans will be surely bored to death by some childish Vampire powergames on such a low level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer, the advertising blurbs and labelling are very misleading. I normally find White Wolf books a bit slow paced. This book had almost no action in it until the last 50 pages. The rest was a long demonstration of the political and social attributes of the Michigan (except Detroit) vampire clans. They tend to behave and act like gangsters rather than creatures of the supernatural. Just not my piece of cake. Since I live in the area the book focuses on I found the setting badly misses the flavor of southern Michigan. I know it's an 'alternate' world but the author has failed to create an environment with any element of interest. This is a firm 'do not buy.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"hey, wait a minute...","review":"I bought this book hoping for a good hunter story. If this is what you are expecting, don't buy this book. I'm a big White Wolf fan, but I found this book just boring. Other than providing a little background information on the White Wolf world, this book is pointless.

I use it with my children to illustrate why mathematics is important. What problems were people trying to solve? How solutions were arrived at in steps over time rather than as deus ex machina. This is much more effective than presenting mathematics as most schools, out of context as a series of recipes.

The \\"night sky\\" is made of cheap cardboard that you have to poke hole in to make the constellations. Then you must tape it all together with double sided tape.

Bothered that I spent 15 of my hard earned dollars on something that was nowhere near erotic, more neurotic. Still trying to figure out when and how a paraplegic became the center of a love triangle and how and when I was supposed to be turned on.Looking at the subtitle or description \\"short short fiction on lesbian desire\\" should have warned me but alas I focused on lesbian desire. Suicide is not desirable...holding a dead woman's hand is not desirable. In short this book is not about lesbian desire and more in line with lesbian heartache and disgust.In the end that's what I felt when I placed it in on my shelf never to be seen or read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give the first 1/3 four stars if I could...","review":"\\"The Skin I'm In\\" is fabulous, but I don't think this lives up to it at all. The first third of Bang! is an excellent evocation of a family and a neighborhood in decline.After that, the book itself declines into unbelievable, author-directed silliness. Even if everything that happens to Mann after his father abandons him in the country is taken at face value, I find it impossible to believe that for a whole month no family member and no person in authority thought to look for the boy at the stable where he loved to go daily. A stable that became convienently empty just in time for him to move into it.And to call the child Mann when the whole book is about rites of passage into manhood is just ludicrous. The final scenes of supposed redemption between Mann and his father are some of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes I have even read in fiction of any type.The many messages of the novel are worthy, but the novel itself is quite flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donald Goines Flashback","review":"I read a book by Donald Goines about a raped woman and the whole time I was reading it, I was thinking \\"Why in the world would someone write a book like this?\\" As much as I love all of Flake's other books, that's the exact same thing I was thinking about this book. The book started off very interesting about how one brother deals with another brother's death, and it reminded me of a cousin which gave me good and bad memories. But then the book launched off into this twisted relationship between the living brother and his father. This book deeply disturbed me during the camping \\"results\\" and after that it just became so off-the-wall. I started questioning my donations to homeless people and who really needs it.

It is divided into two parts; part one covers drilling methods and part two covers drilling equipment. While a definitive work on drilling history, it is not without fault. It was not edited well (if at all) for it is has many grammatical errors and inconsistencies. Moreover, it seems to rely more on anecdotes and heresay rather than solid historical research. It is, however, well illustrated, even if some of the drawings and photos are reproduced poorly.

Well written and informative. A must for those who do sail, and another great read for us lubbers who only dream of how it used to be. No mistake - sailing was a rough life and the glory is enhanced and overblown sometimes by what we've lost to steam and diesel. But if one enjoys reading of the old ships, this is a good book - better than some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulan follow-up","review":"Cute movie, but kind of cheesey (animation not on the same level as the original movie). Granddaughter loves it, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"This movie was just no good. Mushu is being totally sneaky & trying to wreck Mulan's marriage, the acting/voiceovers are terrible & I'm not even sure that all of them are from the first movie, and the theme is really very adult...the differing roles in society of men and women. That aside, it's just boring. If you were expecting the humor, drama, and excitement of the first one, forget it. Skip this one & watch the first one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"As exciting as a manilla envelope","review":"Wow, this is really bad. I didn't expect much from a sequel, but our youngest daughter just loved the first Mulan, so we decided to give it a try. This movie lacks all of the elements that made you love the first one. There is no great music, no hilarious lines, no drama, no suspense, and no story. There really is no plot, the characters are just predictable and annoying. The script lacks any imagination and there is nothing to remember the the entire torturous 90 minutes or so. My six year old says she likes it though, so it wasn't a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"a blank CD","review":"A blank CD in a Mulan case -- child's Christmas gift ruined.

Mulan did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dull Insipid Low-budget film","review":"Mulan II tries to cash in on the hype and excellence of the first film- but instead falls flat on its face. The story of the three princesses conveniently falling for the three-stooge-eseque guards was insipid. The fairy-tale ending for Mulan and the general was unbelievable. Telling small children that its okay to get married when you don't have the least thing in common and hardly know the other person is a recipe for divorce. Sorry Disney. =-(The animation was okay. The music numbers... Terrible. 1 star. Thank God it was a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mulan II Disappointing garbage!","review":"This is an insult to anyone who buys the dvd expecting a Disney feast!

It's shallow and silly. This was a huge disappointment because I loved the first one, but this was definately not theater material - the theater would have been vandalized. If you're still curious, I'd say rent before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised","review":"I don't think Disney has actually done a decent sequel except for the third Aladdin and Return to Neverland so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Mulan II. Sure it's not up to parr with the original but when direct to video sequels are concerned I don't think it's expected to be. The story of Mulan II focuses on whatever happened to the three soldiers. Mulan and Shang have to save China (yet again :) ) by taking the Emperor's three daughters to their future husbands. Along the way the princesses, predictably, fall in love with the three soldiers. Most of the voices are done by the same people which I found very nice. There are some quite touching scenes in the movie although I would have to agree with other reviewers in saying the songs weren't that memorable. Overall I thought Disney did well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly cheesy","review":"This is the cheesiest sequel that I've ever seen. It was so cheesy that I was literally falling off my chair laughing. Every line is either so far out there that it makes no sense or feels completely out of place, and the characters are not developed well at all. It was a good laughing movie, but it isn't because it is funny. The movie is so ludacris that one can't help but laugh. Completely ridiculous. If you're in the mood to laugh at something stupid, I would highly recommend this film. It made my night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it","review":"i have a 9 year old and a 7 year old.

It had a bad plot, and was obnoxily sung by the three sisters over and over that they wanted to be like other girls. The songs were random (had nothing to do with the plot) and the bonus features were lame stuff like how Mulan was founded. All of the people in this movie are lacking character, Mushu has become nothing more than an anoying lizard. Mulan's voice has changed, and Shang is like a light switch (somtimes he is in love with Mulan, somtimes he isn't) Disney could have done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"I love how the message flows, but at some parts, it seemed like as if the movie is skipping some parts in some situation.

I got as far as Mushu turning Shang into a bumbling idiot and started writing this. Just after you know, that whole, \\"My duty is to my heart!\\" line from Mulan.I want this movie to be over so bad. It is a terrible movie. A wagon just crashed off a cliff and noone died. I had my fingers crossed that they all died and the credits would start rolling. Disney, what on earth were you thinking? This is awful. This is one of the worst things I've seen in a long time, and I sat through John Carter all the way.Thank god I rented this thing so I don't have to deal with it in my library of movies.Oh my god, Mulan just said \\"What is it with men and asking directions?!\\" to her fiance.

Very pleased with the condition of the DVD, and my daughter love the second chapter of Mulan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing sequel","review":"I loved the first Mulan, as did my daughter. Which made it particularly heart breaking that the second Mulan lacked beleivable characterization, decent animation, and a coherent ending.The characters and settings were not as expressive or richly drawn as in the original. The characters lost a great deal of the depth that we saw in the first movie. And the songs did not live up to the Disney name.On the plus side, my 2.5 year old daughter liked it fine, but it lacks the crossover appeal to adults that makes for good kids movies. I was quite happy I didn't buy this, and would only suggest renting this if you have a child that isn't looking for depth of animation or characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible....","review":"This sequel to 'Mulan' was poorly done. The songs became random and didn't really help the plot. The whole follow your heart stuff was not what Mulan did in the first movie, maybe just a little bit, but it didn't exactly help her.Mushu became selfish and they completely ruined him. I suggest that if you liked Mushu in the first movie you stay away from this one.Everything in this movie was completely predictable and expected. It had little suspense, if any. This sequel wasn't very funny and as mentioned in the beginning, the songs were horrible.I wish Disney could make sequels that don't ruin the first movies, oh well, I guess they're running out of ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"Mulan seemed to be changing her whole personality. It seemed kind of girlish and dull that she have to act this way on the sequel. At least, she should be spunky. I can't really describe. The movie was good though. I wish it would go longer so it would complete the missing parts of the message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel","review":"This movie was a terrible knockoff from the first. There was absolutely NO continuity. This movie was apparently about money, becuase it wasn't about values.Why are Disney movies that include women always about marriage? Can women not just be women or heroines without finding a \\"man\\", or the \\"right man\\". Why does following your heart always have to include romance? This movie could have been far more interesting without this. And, besides that, the animation was below par. Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally miss-represented","review":"This is a UK version, which is unreadable by US DVD players.

YES, I'm sure little kids will enjoy it. But for all you original 'Mulan' fans, this will be a big let down. The plot is (as metioned by earlier reviewers) absolutely predictable. And Disney seems to be suffering from an acute case of SSSS or, \\"Sugary-Sweet Sequel Syndrome\\". It only briefly offers any drama--the rest of the time we are all given cute and sappy love moments (how do the princesses and gaurds fall THAT head-over-heels in love in just THREE DAYS??), Mushu's 'clever' yet bumbling schemes, and the ever over-used \\"Be True To Your Heart\\" line.

Do not expect any interesting plot twists, surprise endings or character development. Every story is simply a predictable sequence of simple action events. If you enjoy watching any complexity or originality in comics stories, don't get this. Animation is subpar, visuals are very grainy and the audio quality is so-so. The opening and main theme are very bland and unmemorable. This appears to be one of the last hand-drawn cartoon of superheroes ever produced. It is nowhere as good as Batman the animated series which was also hand-drawn. it's a real stinker. I'm glad I paid only four bucks for this and really it's not worth the money I spent.

You may want to accompany this book in the long run with some other that tells you more about designing pulse techniques and/or is more visiual in this aspect. Students will find the book as a whole quite difficult to read, but it is very worthwhile to invest your time into the introductory chapters and then jump into the area of application that you have to become familiar with.

When you view the American musical theater through a lesbian lens you come up with some decidedly different views of Maria in the Sound of Music. Professor Wolf concentrates her study on four actresses of the 50's and early 60's: Mary Martin as Nellie in 'South Pacific,' Ethel Merman as Momma Rose in 'Gypsy,' Julie Andrews in 'My Fair Lady' and Guenevere in 'Camelot,' and Barbra Streisand as Fanny Brice in 'Funny Girl.' Obviously she finds lesbian tendancies in these performances, and her analysis is most interesting to follow.The musical theatre scene is constantly changing. I would be most interested in her analysis of more current plays such as Les Miz, Phantom of the Opera, and Wicked -- where the two female leads are friends, but in which I do not see lesbian tendancies or messages. Can't two women just be friends?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who fact-checked this book?","review":"Lots of errors; little real insight; repetitive; written like a college paper.

I got the riser block in and the top half aligned and needed two more steadying hands which the LOML provided. Like another reviewer, I repainted the block gray so it matches.The bolt head and the nut are an odd size. I used a large adjustable wrench on the head end and a 15/16 wrench on the nut. That was definitely the largest challenge.I lowered the upper wheel as low as it would go to install the new blade (6TPI +/-).

Since he hasn't been around younger children or in a structured setting until now (he's recently entered playschool,) it has been challenging to keep him interested as he learns quickly and gets bored just as fast. This production is so challenging, interesting, educational, as well as cheerful and upbeat that his eyes never left the screen. Actually, his face had the look of excitement on it the whole time. He has learned so much and enjoys the movie so much that the only problem will be his wanting another one. So hurry up out there.

I had to muscle the whole thing together, and it still doesnt look right! The only good thing about it was that the company was very willing to send out new parts to help fix the problems.

I've only tried a few, but they were each very good. My 2 year old son is allergic to eggs, milk and peanuts so this seemed like the perfect cookbook for us. The only problem is that he's at a very picky age right now, so most of these recipes he won't have anything to do with at this time. Some desserts and cookies are all I've made so far that he'll eat. I think as the years go by we'll get a lot more use out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook; one suggestion regarding egg substitutions","review":"I bought this cookbook for my son who has a severe milk allergy. It's a great cookbook. The recipes are straightforward and easy to make. It IS a relief to own a cookbook in which every recipe is something your child can eat. Many of the recipes, particularly in the breads, cakes, and cookies sections of the book, use a specific mixture of ingredients as a substitute for eggs. Like many children, my son has a single allery (to milk) not a triple one. I think it would have been helpful to include the number of eggs That Ms. Coss was substituting for in her recipes (e. g., \\"this is a substitution for 3 eggs\\") so that people who do not have an egg allergy could add in the real thing. My son already lives with a very restrictive diet. No sense making things more restrictive than they already have to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes are tasteless or don't work","review":"Was very dissapointed with this book. Recipes are mostly for adults, not my 5 yr. old ds with allergies. I have tried many recipes and they either are not tasty or just plain don't work.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing again...","review":"I just had to write a review after getting this book. The only reason I would give it 1 star cause it looks like it has some pretty good recipes in it. This book just like all the others I have read to cook my my allergic child, states the obvious. For example it will say use dairy free chocolate chips, dairy free margarine. The only substitute it changes is the eggs. I was disappointed because I already know these things and could cook just fine. I was hoping by the other reviews that this book really did give me other options. I was wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My son (a 1 year old) was diagnosed with food allergies (Egg, Nut, Milk, Fish, ShellFish, Tree-Nut). This cookbook was then only one that I could find that addressed the harder of the three to avoid (milk, nut, and egg). With the help of this cookbook I can now prepare for my son most of his favorite foods!

The recipes are realistic and easy to follow.

The recipes are so tasty that even the non-allergic in our household love them (and don't even realize I'm cooking \\"special foods\\"). Most of them are really simple to put together (I'm no master chef) and many of them use the same ingredients so once you've gone through the book and bought the ingredients you see appearing most often, you're set. My daugter is also allergic to soy. However, I just substitute corn oil where the book calls for vegetable oil and rice milk where it calls for soy milk and the recipes taste great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook","review":"If you or someone in your family has a milk allergy, an egg allergy or a nut allergy or any combination, and you want to make safe and tasty food, this is your book.I had severe food allergies (corn, wheat, rice, beef, many food additives) for years and the only way to get safe food was to cook everything myself.This kind of cookbook is an invaluable aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cookbook","review":"One of my new favorite cookbooks.

I think most us can figure out how to make meatloaf without eggs or milk. If you know how to subsitute rice milk and egg replacer, then this is the same as any regular meat and potatoes cookbook. If you are looking for interesting recipes and a high quality cookbook from someone who really knows her way around the kitchen, try \\"The Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook\\" by Cybele Pascal.

The chocolate had melted to the cellophane and the cookie did not taste good at all. They won't be eating it. It's an expensive way to just give a message. I would have been better off sending a giant Mrs. Field's cookie or a box of Godiva chocolates. I was very disappointed.

This group hasn't gone wrong since the beginning from the Platform (2000) and Expansion Team (2001) which I highly suggest buying along with Neighborhood Watch (2004). Ev and Rakka are the two greastest M.C.'s and the the World Famous Babu the Dilated Junkie as the D.J. make a perfect fit of a hip-hop trio. Get this album!

Production is not as good as thier previous albums, maybe if Kanye did more tracks it would have been better. The only track that I like on this album besides \\"This Way\\" is \\"Poisinous\\" which has good verses and a ill beat. \\"Reach Us\\" has ill verses and an aight beat.

As you read this book, paragraph by paragraph, there is absolutely no flow or coherence to the points the author is trying to make. Each paragraph is a mini-rant in and of itself; like a random stream of consciousness that has no connection to the paragraph before it, or the paragraph after it. I was frustrated reading through this book, but since I dropped 12 bucks on it, I figured there woudl be some A-HA moment, a treasured insight, that would redeem this mess of a book.

This compilation of advices seems to be lifted from his presentations.

Wow! Was I ever wrong. I've had one leg adjustment stop break twice and now I have 2 others that are broken. The camera store that I purchased it from did not want to deal with the issue initially but ended up replacing the part. The legs are flimsy and the quality is one step above junk. If you have a quality camera then spend the extra money to get something decent. In my mind the Manfrotto name has been tainted by my experience. I even paid more that what I'm seeing it for now. You stand a better chance of getting better quality from Fisher Price than this product.

Although Robb has written a book that is both history and travel, politics and opinion, he is a more than able enough author to keep the reader turning the pages. The prevailing question of the book is, 'What is Brazil?' and Robb entertains us by cherry picking historical anecdotes, then relating them to the political scene of the last 20 years. It's definitely rich picking. The presidency of Fernando Collor, which forms a healthy chunk of the book, is an utterly absorbing scandal, depicting a total abuse of the system. Yet it is in Brazil's history where Robb is at his best, his detailed description of slave societies that formed outside of the 'state', the manner in which they were dealt with, sounds strong comparisons with the problems that both gave Lula his presidency and ensure that his hold on power will be hard to keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely omitted a lot","review":"The subtitle of this book is \\"A Book of Omissions\\" and there is definitely something missing. There're heaping tablespoons of information on Brazil's political history and how that emerged from her unique colonial history. The problem is twofold--the writer intertwines some irrelevant and mostly boring episodes in his life into it (just skip all that if you actually pick up this book...trust me) and I found the Chronology at the back made far more sense than the body of this work.Maybe it just needed a better writer or editor. I can't put a finger on it.It's sad really as this subject is a goldmine.So two stars for the fascinating history of Brazilian politics and no stars for the writing which did not blow me away at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Superficial","review":"This book is very strange. It is neither an academic essay nor a good analisys of Brazilian history and costumes.It is a combination of everything that ends up being very dissapointing.For a brief book on Brazilian history, I reccomend \\"Brazil: Five Centuries of Change\\" by Thomas Skidmore. It is an excellent first step on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Over the Place","review":"It started out promising - the perils of present day Rio- but then it turns into a very messy history book. It's full of interesting facts and it inspires a great reading list, but it was a real chore to finish. A rambling romp through Brazil's sexy and horrible history."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting read","review":"An interesting enough book, with great descriptions of the cuisine and the people. A bit too leftist for my tastes, but as long as you take the politics with a hefty pinch of salt or better still ignore it entirely, it's quite harmless.The most irritating thing, however, is the overuse of italics. About half way through the book, that's going to really start getting on your nerves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time!!","review":"Skeptical about the Kindle's ability to handle Dinneen, I downloaded a sample file.

I would check it out before buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT SEAT !!","review":"I got this seat for my 2 1/2 year old. It's a really great seat. Light weight easy to take in and out. I LOVE the foam headress that offers a headrest to my son when he falls asleep in the car. The cup holders are deep enough to hold small toys, and keep sippy cups upright so there is no spilled drinks. This seat also folds up great when not in use. I fit this seat in a suitcase when I flew across country! Very durable and the dark fabric makes it less easy to see dirt! Great Seat!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this seat!!!","review":"We love this seat for our 3 1/2 year old son. Didn't know what we were missing when we didn't have it. We have a convertible car seat that is infant/toddler/booster and rated up to 80lbs. We thought we would keep our son (now 35 lbs) in it until he reached the weight limit, but then needed something for our daughter who was just coming out of her infant car seat. We decided to give her his seat and buy this booster. It is so easy to install because it there are no buckles, just the seatbelt in your vehicle. It seems to have a lot of cushion in it and he seems to be comfortable in it which is very important if we take long trips. He hasn't complained once about it and we have had it since March. We plan on purchasing another one when our daughter reaches the age and weight requirements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat - assembly a little challenging","review":"We love the flexability of this seat as it can convert to a backless booster which is great for travel. It is a little bit challenging to assemble as the directions aren't very clear but still very doable -- the assembly process is the only reason I wouldn't give the seat 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a BOOSTER SEAT, not a car seat!","review":"A reminder for all of the parents out there...especially \\"Steph\\" who recently wrote a review about this seat...You are to place your child in a booster seat ONLY if the child is AT LEAST 4 years of age AND at least 40 pounds. The reason that a BOOSTER SEAT uses the car's seat belt is that the child is developmentally able to stay in a safety seat which uses the car's safety belt.Please check out the American Academy of Pediatrics or SAFE KIDS or National Traffic Safety Board's web sites for full info on picking an APPROPRIATE CAR SEAT for your child.I do like this booster seat for it's ease of installation and comfort of my child while in the seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even remotely permanent","review":"I decided to ignore the rest of these reviews saying the color doesn't last long and bought the product anyway.

I am intrigued how much RARE talent Leroy Hutson possess. This composer, writer and musician is extremely under rated.He presents the complete package of true uncommercialized soul, everything from the music, his vocals and lyrics in every cut blend without any abrasion. You can feel it all comes from his heart and soul. This is true timelessness for many years to come.His songs encompasses jazz (Cool out) with a type of modern dowopp with words that describe everyday relationships in all levels of togetherness.It's difficult to choose a favorite, but it would have to be \\"Can't stay away\\" (I'm a sucker for \\"healing songs.\\") This does not diminish in any way the high caliper of the rest of the cuts.This is a must for any soul lover's collection without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"I love this album...

Abraham Lincoln supported a move to draft Confederate prisoners of war languishing (and often starving) in Northern prisons, with the stipulation that they would not have to go South and fight fellow Confederates. The \\"Galvanized Yankees\\" (so named because it was thought that their loyalty to the North was only a thin \\"ganvanized\\" layer) -- 6,000 of them, took the oath of loyalty to the Union and headed West to guard stagecoaches and mail routes. Numerous fights with Plains Indians, bitter cold, at lonely outposts were but a few of the hazards the Galvanized Yankees faced. My gg grandfather survived all this and returned home in 1866. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning more about these brave men who chose service to the Union rather than almost certain death in Northern prisons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and unusual subject","review":"The Galvanized Yankees is an interesting book about US Civil War Confederate soldiers who were offered a chance to take an oath of loyalty to the Union if they would enlist in the army and serve on the western frontier. About six thousand eventually did so, serving between 1864 and 1866. Brown's narrative history mostly follows them by recalling the history of a unit or units grouped together, with a couple of chapters about individuals. Recommended for those most interested in military or American history, although the book does tend to get repetitious at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defeatist Attitude to Life","review":"The story line reminded me of Thomas Hardy's classical work \\"Jude the Obscure\\" about a man's defeatist & self-destructive attitude to life. Chase is the Jude in this case. His sidekick is the English professor Pink Lady or Serena Ransom. An excellent family name as she holds Chase ransom to her demands. My interest was not sustained throughout the book and I felt like giving up as I knew how the story would pan out. There were no surprises or shocks along the way that would give this book the wow factor.I found the plot too draggy. Too much emphasis on the oddball characters that soon lost its fizz after you got the hang of it. The plot was thin without any twists and turns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Theresa's best effort","review":"OK, we get it already, Ms. Monseur: Paris is a tormented, tough, sometimes gentle woman who can't decide which part of her anatomy to think with. This book had all the elements of a wonderful thriller; full of creepy but sympathetic characters and a sound plot. Save one thing; by the last third of the book. I got bogged down. In endless, mind-numbing detail. Every sentence stacatto. Fragmented segments. It was like she ran out of energy. Needed to fill space. I'll paraphrase: \\"She opened her makeup drawer. Withdrew the shiny cylinder of lipstick. Pulled off the silver top. Swiped her bottom lip once. Swiped her top lip once. Smacked them together.\\" Not a direct quote, but the kind of detail that really bogged me down. Really is a pity. She wrote two excellent books. Now she seems to think she can \\"phone them in.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"An overall disappointment. The writing and plot dragged in spots. Monsour writes in fragmented sentences that get kind of annoying after 4 or 5 in a row. The plot was simple (if not a little odd) and there were no surprises, twists, or suspenseful moments to keep the reader guessing. Also, I found one of the characters unbelievable. Serene Ransom is straight-up crazy (which you gather very early in the story), yet she has managed to maintain a high-level position at a university. She has absolutely no redeeming qualities and I find it impossible to believe that she could have functioned at all in her given position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse of its kind","review":"I've used several optical mice over the years, and this one beats them all.

I read what others posted about it, and bought myself one too.But this is not as good as one would think. First off, their are some reach flaws in it. The 2 buttons to the far left,on the side are not too easy to reach your fingers to.The next thing I hated about it was that their is this bump on the right site of it, I dont have a clue as to what its for,but I annoning as anything.I could not stand so much, that I filed it down. 3ed off, the bottom mouse pad touch areas are not well done. So if you have a heavy hand, like myself, it tends to catch on the mouse pad.Other than that, the mouse looks nice, I'll give it that.

If you play lots of FPS, then you'll see some significant increase in your performance, and more importantly, your score. It's excellent for those precision killing, smooth reaction, and lag-free movements. The curvy shape, not only makes this mouse more attractive, but fits to the contours of your hand which gives you comfort for those long hours of gaming. Five additional programmable buttons allow quick access for surfing the net, or switching between weapons. It is a must have if you still own those obsolete ball-mouse. Otherwise if you play games, then this is a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mouse","review":"This mouse is awesome.

My arms will not get as sore now that I have the ability to keep my knives sharp. This sharpener is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice! Pre-Maiden Bruce Dickenson","review":"Never heard of Samson but I know quality rock when I hear it.. I don't even know what era it hails from though I'd guess 70s or 80s. It reminisces Deep Purple and Iron Maiden. Hold on. Just checked Wikipedia. The singer on this album IS Bruce Dickenson. No wonder I thought of Maiden. OK, well, enough said. This is a good album and most of the cuts here date from the early 80s apparently right before Dickenson joined Maiden. The musicianship is top notch espcially if you like 70s hard rock, even as opposed to 80s metal, though this album certainly qualifies as metal and even much of the music alone (never mind the Dickenson vocals) preminisces a later Maiden sound (like from Powerage era even). Well worth picking up while its available."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Title Says It All","review":"My mother just purchased this book for me a few days ago. I've already read all of it. I plan to re-read it. The stories, cartoons, poems, etc. are so moving. You will find yourself connecting to these anecdotes in a way that will increase your awareness of yourself as a future parent or a parent-once-more. This book should be a hit with expectant Moms (AND expectant Dads), no matter what their situation. This book offers a variety of points of view and discusses many situations. There were humorous stories about pregnancy and delivery, expectant fathers points of view, the emotions of expecting and facing adversity during pregnancy, the special bonds created when adopting a child, passing the torch from one generation to the next. Cartoons, and other humorous anecdotes are guaranteed to make you laugh. Some stories will make you cry. This book will move you. The emotions and bonds created during pregnancy and adoption will be deepened and you will find your soul stretching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I couldn't put it down. I found myself crying, laughing, learning, and just bonding with this book. Every night a while I layed there restless and unable to sleep I'd open the book and read. I was bummed when I finished the book because I didn't know of another book that could compare. I have grown weary reading my expecting books since I have read beyond the weeks of my pregnancy. I didn't want to read anymore about how big the baby is 4 months from now... but wanted to focus on what it's like to be pregnant, have a baby, have children, etc etc. I found just that. It's a very inspirational book."},{"rating":"1","title":"used condition was not as advertised","review":"I purchased this item for a friend as a congratulatory gift after she announced her first pregnancy. There were no *brand new* books being sold directly by Amazon, so I chose a \\"used\\" item listed as \\"mint/new\\" condition by the seller. Unfortunately, when I received the item I could definitely tell the book had been previously read, as the cover and spine areas were worn and wrinkled. As you can imagine, it was slightly embarrassing to give as a gift; unfortunately, due to time constraints I didn't have time to return or exchange it for something else.

The main title was puerile and has been done loads of times, had no original plot or decent structure. Just some screwed up in the head girl getting rid of her ex boyfriend with the help of her toffee nosed parents. In short, it was naff. The Buyers was too silly for words - come on, the kidnappers would not be able to get away with buying a house off the estate agents books without being noticed, and if the money was tinted the police would have had them before everything escalated. UNREALISTIC! The point is I knew exactly what would happen at the end of the tales before I was halfway through (and I only peeked at one!). Closeness was probably the best out of all of them, but even that wasn't enough to make the heart pound. If you want good, suspenseful horror, try Stephen King or Chriostopher Pike for younger readers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror? oh puleez","review":"This book is the worst horror book i have ever read.

They didn't even look to see if all the text of the title fit on the cover. There are several words cut off on the end. The print looks like a bad photocopying job.

I'm very unsatisfied in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done Historical drama","review":"History comes alive in this well done drama about a racial trial that the outcome of which appeared decided by the jury before the first witness took the stand. Nevertheless, it portrays the players in the legal system as real people who believe they are doing what is right. Persons who like good acting and fine drama will truly enjoy this movie. For full disclosure, I must point out that I was one of many who provided a small portion of the money needed to make this movie. However, it also must be pointed out that this movie won first place in the Hollywood film festival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, cathartic new voice.....","review":"Walter Falls is a compelling new novel by first time author Steven Gillis.

Instead of wasting $60 on this swing, take a look at the others first, i.e. the Link-A-Doos or Aquarium swings by Fisherprice before buying.I gave this item two stars since it does serve its purpose, it swings back and forth with ajustable speed levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I wish my son liked this swing, but it is a very rare occasion when he'll stay in it longer than five minutes.

The next 75 or so pages give details on writing tests. There are about 45 pages of the programmer's perspective. The rest of the book mainly deals with extending the system in ways that most people won't bother with. Finally there is a very brief word on non-Java tests that simply says to refer to the web sites.The book is easy to read.

Well, the worst part of this movie, aside from the lousy transfer, the lethargic pace, and dull action, is the way it completely wastes Klaus Kinski (as the imprisoned Marquis De Sade); he has no dialogue (well, maybe that dubbed voice-over is suppoed to be him) and isn't given a chance to wig out in trademark 'Kinski style.' Anyway, he provides the framework for a tale of two pure-hearted girls who get enmeshed in prostitution, are imprisoned, and eventually fall in with some creepy royals and an odd religious sect (headed by an overacting, overdubbed Jack Palance). \\"Deadly Sanctuary\\" is far less exciting than it sounds, and given the roots of De Sade's work, downright pedestrian. The film is more soft-core skin and lesbianism than hard-core violence.

Nope, sorry, same scenes. The quality is very nice, so you'll never see the hankerchief-sniffing branding scene looking so good.One thing I noticed in fast-forwarding through this awful thing (nice DVD advantage there), is that aside from the \\"M\\" scene there's really not much. The sixteen year-old Romina is stunningly cute, and you can clip the pictures of her hanging from a chain leaking poor quality Franco fake blood and doing a \\"Pretty Baby\\" couch turn, but the green and red lighting is actually not very erotic.Most other sexploitation flicks have a lot more graphic nastiness, but the branding scene is a must, there's no question about that.

I weigh 250lbs and the machine does not rock or feel unsteady at all. We really liked the Schwinn model but it cost almost twice as much. The item came damaged and Amazon was great to deal with and had our replacement in 2 weeks.

For the price, probably not a better value out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Customer Service...","review":"I purchased the EX22 a few weeks ago and am overall, very happy.

The elliptical was very easy to assemble, but due to a few minor defects, it rubbed on the plastic when going in reverse and the right pedal made a clicking sound. I called Horizon customer service and they helped diagnose the problem, ordered parts and sent someone out to install the new parts. The machine is now working fine and I am very happy with it. It has a somewhat compact design compared with other ellipticals I looked at which is perfect if space is a concern. The only thing I am not thrilled with is the loud chirping the electronic console makes when setting a program. It is very annoying.

All I can say is WOW...for 200.00 it was a steal!! The machine is great..smooth working and really stable. We have hardwood floors, so not sure how it would be on carpet..might rock some so you may need a carpet protector and maybe something firm to keep it stable. The only thing I don't like it that it doesn't offer the IFit program..but thats okay..for 200.00..I don't expect to get it..but since it really costs 599.00..it would have been nice to have that feature on it.

It's not quite as emotionally compelling as some of the later books in the series, most notably Jared's and especially Devin's books, but it is still an eminently readable book.Rafe, the former bad boy, comes back to Antietum, Maryland, as a reformed bad boy ready to make good.

Roberts weaves some history of the Battle of Antietam into a subtle, supernatural element central to the storyline, along with the conflict between another couple Rafe has known since childhood.All in all, I enjoyed the read, and now I have a great example of the art of writing romance novels under my belt.

I ordered two wheels, and one was DOA--it would not hold air at all. I had to get a replacement inner tube. Both had significant wobble--as much as 1/2 inch--which means that if your cart tolerances are tight it will rub on the sides.Update: by the second day, the other tire would not hold air. More money and time for a second inner tube, and the tires are extremely difficult to get off the rims. In addition, one wheel was missing the rim tape that protects the inner tube from the spoke heads, so even a good inner tube would have been damaged.Finally, the bearings are not that great, and the wheel strains with a load of 50-70 pounds. Then bearings disintegrated (races came apart and all balls fell out) on tenth use.Can I give negative stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Wheels","review":"I bought these for my dog buggy so I could mount extra wide tires. The rims are 1.375\\" (outside dimension) and were able to seat 3\\" wide tires, so they gave me what I needed. However these really are cheap and nasty wheels. The bearings grate and wobble, the spokes were all loose, some of the spoke nipples weren't even finger tight. One rim was slightly dented. The tires looked okay, quite smart actually-until I tried taking them off. They were almost impossible to remove. I broke two tire levers getting the first tire off, ended up cutting the second tire off! The wire bead on the tire was massive, thickest I've ever seen. Don't ever have a puncture with the original tires on! Still after tightening up the spokes and replacing the tires the wheels work okay(ish), (but I wouldn't want to use them on a bike)."},{"rating":"2","title":"cart wheels","review":"This product is of good quality, the tires stay inflated, hub sizeing was correct, overall good product.I would recommend this item for medium weight cart loads."},{"rating":"2","title":"good wheels","review":"Bought these as replacements on a garden cart. They came quickly and do the job just fine. Also needed to pump them up some more... which is a good thing as I am sure they were shipped in an unpressurized locker on the plane. one of the wheels was not true and I attempted to true the wheel by adjusting the spokes, like on a bicycle. This helped a little but could not get them 100%. However, as these are not designed or are they to be used on a high speed device, they function just as they were intended. I just see a little wobble in the one wheel, but like I stated it does not alter the function, otherwise I would have rated them a five."},{"rating":"2","title":"i luv nb ridaz","review":"nb ridaz is da best muzic i eva heard that pretty girl song should be the number one song in the world I LOVE U MB RIDAZ!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wackness....","review":"Yo, this is my own opinion, so here it goes...

I'm a fan of the hard anodized line anyway - ever since I bought one of the 2 1/2 quart shallow saucepans. Great heat conduction, nice weight, might as well be nonstick, and just about indestructable. I'm not one that enjoys molly-coddleing my cookware, and this stuff doesn't need it.

They indicated that the Calphalon Tri-Ply comes in an older noninduction compatible version and a newer conduction compatible version. They were very helpful and agreed to exchange the sets out.

It is becuse of things such as \\"Wrath of the dragon god\\" that D&D; is underastimated by many people. The plot was infantile, the charcters so boering that as a DM I would have killed their players just for the intension to play them.Another issiue was that the charcters had no in game logic- I remember a scene where the fighter (who is, of course, the leader) send the wizard to the front line of a large meele battle, to cover him while he solves a riddle.

Can he and a band of 4 other adventurers find a mystic orb which will save the realm?I like cheesy movies, but D&D; 2 was pretty much as bad as it gets. With the exception of the actor who played Nim (the Rogue), most of the acting was of the quality produced by first year drama majors reading lines from a script. The settings were drab (mostly browns and tan), and the spectacular D&D; universe reduced to a bunch of cheesy CGI special effects.My advice: save your money and rent. 1 star"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good sequel","review":"I saw the original theatrical film, and it was a big disappointment for me. However, Wrath of the Dragon God does not disappoint. Solid performances by the cast and a *much* better script make for a much better film. Its weakness is in some the special effects, but given the budget, they did well. It is a pity that this script was not the original theatrical release, and I hope to see more by the same scriptwriters.

Too bad it was supposed to be action-adventure. I would describe the plot, but it really isn't worth talking about. The action? Bad. Special effects? Laughably bad. D&D; enthusiasts will probably legitimately enjoy the film... but this review is for the rest of us.What is notable is the audio commentary. Apparently they couldn't get the writer, director, or any of the cast for that matter. They had to go and get game developers to comment on the movie... and even they couldn't take it seriously. The commentary really is parody as the game designers pretend that they are Orc-barbarians, halflings, and the like commenting on the adventurers in the film. Too funny. Rent it, laugh at it, then return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster very very low budget movie","review":"The costumes are cheap cosplay types, with fake leather, etc and its obvious they are using foam weapons and armors. Even the half orc and the lich have very minor roles in this movie. The \\"bandits\\" look much like fake townpeople with fake weapons added to them. Very choppy plot and very badly played villian.

This one is dour, straightlaced and ploddingly dull as the people quest to make us care about the plot. When I veiwed the film, it truly was like a trainwreck - horrifying that they could make a piece of drivel even WORSE than the first, but I had to finish watching it in the hopes it actually got tolerable at the end. The actors are wooden, dialog stilted, and combat scenes are so-so. Plus, they brought back Damodar - the .... .slowest.... talking... villain... ever! (Let alone the most annoying.)Save your money.

No. This isn't even a \\"good\\" movie. As always, the people who put these kinds of movies together don't know what they're doing, but they know they'll always have a niche market, so a good product with broad appeal isn't necessary to make money. Ergo, the movie gets made.If you're not a D&D; fan, you shouldn't even consider seeing this movie; your life will be devalued by the memory. If you *are* a D&D; fan, you'll likely find it entertaining, but it's still not that good even to you. As a D&D; fan, you want this to encompass the entire D&D; universe of monsters, character classes, traps, etc. Because it's a 90 minute movie on a limited budget, you won't get that. So, it's worth watching, but not much better than that.Bottom line: it's worth watching *only* because it's D&D.; If that doesn't appeal to you, this is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel","review":"This dull sequel to the Dungeons & Dragons movie (NOT the awesome Dragons of Autumn Twilight!!!) has little to offer other than a couple dragon scenes.

Worth seeing once or twice, but it's nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Stupid Movie","review":"I have been a D&D player for years now and yes I have to say that I can see that they actually pulled from D&D to make this movie. It is nearly impossible to watch, though. The lines are horrible, the acting is horrible, and the plot doesn't work. If they were going to keep with the original movie then keep with it or come up with something new. They used one character and tried to make it seem like it was 100 years later but it didn't work. There were possible subplots that could have gone somewhere but didn't. This movie was stupid and uninteresting from beginning to end. At least with the first one you could make fun of the stupidity, I still make fun of Snails.

Sure on the list of films like YOR: Hunter from the future, Krull and Kull the conqueror, it was a fine piece of.... cinema? Real toast to impractical weapons and lame special effects, Cheers! So if you really like watching train wrecks (oh and believe me I do) then pick this thing up for your next Bad movie night. Just remember to use gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop already.","review":"The second installment in this ongoing travesty has an even lower budget than the first. If you enjoy D&D (or were a fan in your youth) you will get more satisfaction from staring at the cover art for five minutes than any scene in the movie. Remember that kid in your D&D group who was always snort-laughing at his own lame jokes and spouting dorky ideas that made you cringe? Yeah. He wrote the script. Evidently some people have the idea that the more you love the game, the better you are at writing/directing a screenplay. This is not true. Another popular myth: if you truly love the game you will look past the flaws in any D&D movie. This is a campaign based game where each adventure has a beginning, middle, and end. It's tailor-made for the cinematic format!

Business is not school.3) When professionals respond negatively to an outsider's commentary, they are typically not doing so out of a sense of wounded virtue. People that work on The Street know all too well the realities of finance. Rather, they become angry when they see the author fool the many readers who do not have much business experience. It's not that the portrayal is too harsh or unfair, just that it is inaccurate and designed to elicit a predictable reaction from naive readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Hard!","review":"Big money (that is, more money than it takes to get into Harvard after attending a private high school, and the ability to afford to live in a \\"cottage\\" in a crime free area and pay off two cars before you reach age 30) is the root of all evil. Hypocritical rich bashing is in again - as the movie Titanic has shown - and this book might make the author and his publisher a lot of money. Ultimately his diatribes serve to annoy rather than enlighten, leaving you cold. This is a hackneyed story told by a puling man."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring premise and story make for an unengaging read.","review":"The author freely admits he's after money, period, which is why he joined Merrill Lynch, which should tell us something about his motivation for writing this book. Unfortunately for him, the boring stories and flat characterizations make this book dull. Have our attention spans gotten so short that \\"tell alls\\" books can only cover a year's worth of time? Lord save us from 20-somethings who think what they've experienced so far is so meaninful they must write a book, and save us from our keyword-oriented society (\\"Has to do with the market? Let's publish it!\\") that keeps this kind of stuff coming off of printing presses."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read and boring personal account","review":"This book is a recycle of old ideas and tired themes.

Superficially he sees his own faults leading to his downfall, but it appears that this was a person who simply lacked the ability to work with others. Faced with failure, he did the easy thing: blamed \\"the System\\" and others around him.Overall very disappointing (and painful) read and certainly NOT in the same vein as other quality books about the Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Liar's Poker","review":"Paul Stiles' whining gets on your nerves after a while. If \\"standard\\" Merrill training genuinely is no training...yet Merrill possesses one of the best trading arms in the world...the vast majority of the recruits must've been smart enough to pick things up as they went along, which seems to indicate a shortcoming in Stiles rather than the system. It's unfortunate but understandable that Stiles lacked the ability or intestinal fortitiude to excell in what is an extremely difficult (both mentally and emotionally) position. However, it is even more unfortunate that he blames society and those around him for his own greed-driven decisions, making this book a exemplary whine-fest. The only redeeming feature: some relatively interesting asides about the technical aspects of a trading desk. Read Liar's Poker (Lewis, non-fiction) or The Bombardiers (Bronson, fiction) for much better and more entertaining Wall Street bedtime stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiles still doesn't get it","review":"The only similarity between this book and Liar's Poker is that they are both about Wall Street. Rather than blame himself for seeking out and then accepting a job he knew he was ill-prepared for, in a city he knew nothing about, Stiles blames everyone and everything else. This, in essence, is why Stiles never made it. NYC and Wall Street are not the types of places for people who are always waiting for something to come to them - you have to go out and get it.Stiles book has some interesting passages, though it is very clear that he still does not understand why it didn't all work out. Despite the fact that he was \\"never trained\\", his passages about the Mexican Peso devaluation and the Orange County Scandal are good summaries. If you work on Wall Street, this book will be entertaining. If you are thinking of working on Wall Street and are as naive as Stiles about \\"the life\\", this book will be useful. Otherwise, take a pass and read Michael Lewis's Liar's Poker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Read","review":"I like to pride myself that I have never started a book and not finished it, but this one came very close to breaking the streak.What I envisioned was a moving expose of breaking into the Wall Street fraternity (a la Liar's Poker). Reality was excessant whining on how people weren't nice and were too greedy. Go figure...on Wall Street.The most irritating part of the whole book is that the author obtained his job through the same trickery which he bashes for 300+ pages in the book, but never acknowledges that the others were simply better at the ruse than him. Rather, he waxes prophetic on how his life has a higher meaning. It's just not even close to believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self serving, boring autobiography","review":"If you want to read about how to fail on Wall Street, this is the book for you. The feeling is that Stiles would like to provide a muckraking image of Wall Street greed, but his work comes over as the work of a complainer. Stiles is obviously, and by his own account, not suited for and does not have the aptitude for a career on Wall Street. The reader is dragged through this pain for 323 pages. It would have been more fun to read about someone who was successful, but left The Street due to some moral/soul searching reason. A Wall Street junkie may find parts of the book interesting. Buy this in paperback or used."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important read by an immensly gifted writer","review":"I expected a book on the inner workings of Wall Street's Bond Market. What I found was an investigation into the philosophy of the system that drives Wall Street, therefore much else on the planet. I hope this will not be Stiles' last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part encouraging, part nauseating.","review":"If you are reading this book to get an inside look at Wall Street, don't. It is much more a tale of one man's life than a description of life at Mother Merrill. Encouraging and invigorating at the outset, the book dulls if you are expecting a \\"Liar's Poker\\" style tale.

The book did not focus enough on this guys work environment and of what happened there and how he coped in the financial markets - and not just about him - but about others.

Imagine getting a job on the engineering team for a new silicon chip, or a suspension bridge, only to discover you had no engineering skill. Then, write a moralizing book about why they didn't offer you better training! There was no way I could finish reading this young man's precious (nay, clinical) account of how he landed a job for which he was manifestly incompetent, and handled it really badly. For starters, there are (and were when he was floundering) many good books on the subjects he was having trouble with, which he never bothered to read, even when they were handed to him. If this book has any message, it's that Merrill should have fired Stiles much earlier. The reason they didn't is that it's difficult to predict trading skill, and hence easier to just throw people in the water and see whether they can swim.

This book does not give any sensation of its time and place. The characters do not seem like real people. In fact, Barca, the main character, is more Conan/Superman than real man.

It really is like a comic book. If you want to read historical fiction on the level of S. Pressfield, or even S. Saylor, don't even bother with this one. If you want a book that reads like a sequel to a Conan the Barbarian book, then this is the one for you.I just couldn't get over how divorced from reality this book is. You can almost read Barca's spandex superhero outfit between the lines.Finally, I found it shocking that a bath scene with two men and a woman was described. Fine for adult literature, but it was pretty out of place here. I mean, I enjoyed the details, but it was really inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an absolutely silly book","review":"Mind you, silly books have a place in the world. Sometimes its nice to relax your mind and get lost in a totally improbable story. Sadly, this book isn't even enjoyably silly. The characters are banal and easily predictable. The battle scenes aren't that exciting and can easily be skimmed over. What really got on my nerves was the author's tendency to get overly descriptive over every little thing. Scott Oden needs to learn that it's okay to say the sky was blue and leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treachery galore","review":"Scott Oden has managed to capture what surely must be one of the most interesting depictions of ancient Egypt since Mika Waltari published his novel The Egyptian. Both deal with critical periods in Egyptian history and both are credits to their authors.Oden's Men of Bronze is more earthy than The Egyptian and certainly more graphic. The premise of internal decay within Egypt and external pressure from Persia is a common theme. I thought the primary character of Hasdrabal Barca, a commited and driven soldier dedicated to the Pharoah and his dynasty was captivating. Phanes, the Greek traitor was equally memorable but for different reasons. Even given the slow start, as pointed out by another reviewer, isn't enough to prevent me from highly recommending this book.Men of Bronze is a rapidly paced story that will leave you with memorable images in your head. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me a stomacheache","review":"This was a light and fluffy read with lots of nostalgia.

Some people want their names in print, regardless of how trivial the reason, and this is a good example of that. Maybe this would have been an okay magazine article but to try and stretch it into a whole book is tedious. You end up saying, who cares, and why did I bother?

She describes pouring in a large bag of M&Ms \\"as a base\\" then burying cellophane wrapped caramels and other treasures. I like the candy holidays of Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, Easter and Mother's Day.

Her wonderfully nuanced characters are missing the depth her readers expect; instead, she has left markers, as often as not, that seem to be quick notes for later revisions that never happened.The painter John Currin once said that he learned more from studying the second-rate painters than he did the masters. This book might be interesting for that reason; Godden's fine polish was never applied, and another writer might discern the armature underneath the surface.If you are reading purely for pleasure, this one won't bring the kind of joy that so very many of her works can bring.

When we clean the litter boxes we are therefore only throwing out the \\"waste\\" and a few of the crystals. We recently got a great deal on some natural clumping litter so we tried it out in one of our litter boxes. As expected, the cats love it but we cannot put what comes out of this box into the litter locker because it fills it up so fast.

It reminds me of the product that stores soiled baby diapers. In the same way, it seals away the odor from the clumps of litter and makes it possible to go for a week or more without moving the clumps of litter out to the garbage. The bags don't breathe at all, so once the lid closes, the smell is gone. When you want to take it to the garbage, you cut the bag leaving enough room to tie a knot.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"I bought this pot to replace a similar pot thatI loved and had used frequently until the handle broke off. I have been very dissapointed in this purchase. I don't even use the glass lid for the sputtering/splashing reasons cited by many other users. I use the lid from my old pot. In addition, the handles on the small basket are ridiculous, as they fall down into the food you are steaming instead of staying sensibly over at the top sides of the insert. The large basket is poorly designed to be raised too far above the liquid in the bottom of the pot, making the basket too short... All in all... a completely frustrating experience. I'm looking for another pot, probably not Calphalon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good but more bad points","review":"We love the look and feel of the pot and the price seemed great.

An annoying mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pasta/steamer set at a good price","review":"Would be great, except for two things.1) The past insert should go down further into the pot (although this is the norm with the majority of pasta cookers). The bad thing here is you have to use alot of extra water to cover the pasta. This does have a plus side though - it allows the pot to act as a double rack steamer, since you can put water in just below the pasta insert and use the steamer rack as well.2) The lid does not fit very well. It just sort of sits on the top lip and doesn't do a very good job of sealing out splatters from excess steam. Of course this problem would happen to any pot if the burner is set too high, after all steam has to escape!

Turns out this is made in China and not the US. Having seen this, I now realize that Calphalon has different quality/grade lines. The inferior quality in construction and design is readily apparent. For example, the steamer uses two wire handles instead of one which makes getting things in and out of the steamer more difficult.

Well, you can't cook more pasta in it than in my little one because the water will boil over. And because you need more water, it takes forever to come to a boil. The lid is a joke, it spits and dances on the pot, and the shallow insert is worthless - the handles keep flopping down no matter how much I tried to fix it. Since I didn't get it from Amazon (I know better now!), and used it a few times, I can't return it anymore. It went back into the box and in the basement to languish until the next charity sale.

However, there's some problems with the rest of the items in the multipot. For starters, the lid is horrible. It doesn't quite fit the pot itself and it has no dip in the design before the side. What this means is that when something is boiling it sputters and sprays water out the top all over your stove. Cooking chili? Plan to get tomato juice sprayed around your cook top. You'll need a new lid. Second, the insert for pasta doesn't reach the bottom of the pot, not even close, probably 2 to 3 inches separates the sieve from the pot bottom. This means you're boiling about 6-8 cups more water than you need to every time you want to make pasta. This two things are a big deal to me since I bought the pot to be useful and because it came with a lid.

This figure combination is appropriate for storytelling, playtime, or display (classroom or homeschool). [The Papp \\"Mercenary\\" figure will also seat on this horse fairly well.]The chain-mail appearance is very striking. The figure stands well by itself, and it gives the appearance of being in motion. The quality figure is detailed and well-painted--ready for imagination and adventure when paired with a rider.

The searching is terrible, but that's no surprise. The vector images aren't really vector, as they can only be downloaded as EPS files (for Mac). The quality of the images themselves are awful, and look like shady scan jobs. Definitely not for professional use, but barely good enough for fun use.

But Beethoven's Sym. 1 and 2 gave him that opportunity. These cross-over works from the world of Haydn can be successfully played as heroic precursors (by Klemperer, Karajan and Bernstein, for example), but Walter strives to make them sunny and carefree, and his approach works.In their way, these symphonies are the ideal introduction to Walter's notions about Beethoven, but they aren't perfect. The slow movements in both works tend to dawdle, without a hint of the dance. He smothers the joke leading into the finale of Sym. 1 and fails to make the finale of Sym. 2 be as fleet as it should. Even so, the Columbia Sym. sounds quite good throughout, and the recording is among the best that the engineers managed during Walter's late years in Los Angeles. To lovers of Walter's relaxed style, this CD would deserve five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tango Passion","review":"Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must hav for info junkies and the curious","review":"No other records book comes close.

Suddenly, the road is extended and reopened, and the family is surrounded by a mounting number of noisy speeding vehicles. The commentary is about man's destruction of natural beauty and quiet, I suppose. The radio reports of the freeway's opening are funny as the announcer absurdly extols the virtues of the new highway. The teenage daughter appears to do nothing but lay around and suntan all day while listening to heavy metal music. What the father does for a living is hard to say. The mother seems to be a bit bonkers and cannot bear the idea of ever leaving their rather squalid house, filled with dirty clutter. I half expected someone to get run over by a speeding car any minute. You won't come away with much from this little film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Begs the question.","review":"I always know I'm going to enjoy a dark moment if Isabelle Huppert is in a film; one of my favorite French actresses; many Americans may only have seen her in \\"I love Huckabees\\"...but I digress. \\"Home\\" wrestles with just that idea, what is a home? Is it a place, is it a feeling, is it the people you live with, and if all those things change, then what exactly is it? Home takes place in a french countryside, bordering a 10 year abandoned interstate that never opened. The family has adapted and extend its boundary line incorporating it into part of their kingdom; they play hockey on it, watch TV on it, barbecue on it, sun on it, and even have their satellite dish attached to its guard rail. But is this family prepared psychologically to maintain this idea of home, when progress drives through the front yard or, will they be imprisoned in a castle of their own choosing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"How not to remodel your home","review":"The easy-going lives of a family living right next to an unused motorway are thrown into turmoil when it unexpectedly opens. Their efforts to cope with the sudden noise, intrusion, and pollution become increasingly desperate as, during the heat of summer, they descend into madness. There are definite Ballardian overtones in Meier's touching movie. It's a captivating examination of how modern existence can tip even the most equanimous over the edge given the right circumstances. The performances are uniformly excellent and the script avoids melodrama, keeping its feet firmly on the ground even when the family falls apart. Captivating, thoughtful and ultimately redemptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Short Book but a Major Contribution","review":"This book is especially important to anyone interested in the history of World War II or just history in general.

Of course, his sections on his own father (possibly the greatest of them all) is an essential read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"As I read the book, there was not a good flow to the book.

Most important is that the book helped me figure out what *I* must do to keep my son safe and helped me feel comfortable doing these things. I had felt that I was being over-cautious but the book supported my thinking and helped me claify things even more. Ms. Coss also discusses many situations I would not have thought of on my own.The book is clear, detailed and covers a broad range of topics.

It's not well-written, and it's not particularly original. It is, however, useful in one way: Ramos' attitudes about Latino integration *might* fairly reflect the views of many in designated Hispanic leadership. And, somewhat disturbingly, his view is virtually identical to Sam Huntington's: namely, that Hispanics are resistant to learning English and assuming an American identity. True, Ramos *celebrates* this premise, but it would be roundly denounced if it came from a non-Hispanic.Unlike the Buchanan's of the world, I have no doubt in the power of the American experience to integrate people of all skin colors and national origins.

Based on the Rip Curl sizing chart and others' reports of Rip Curl running small, I expected it to fit a tad snug. However, I couldn't even get it over my shoulders, and had to call my husband in from the other room to untangle me. I ordered another Rip Curl rash guard also in size 12, and it fits a tad snug, but I'm able to get in and out of it without calling in the jaws of life. The main difference I noticed between the two is the fabric. The fabric on this rash guard has extremely little give to it: Think of a thick tablecloth or the fabric on a backpack.

Port Eternity is Arthurian in space, but is much better than that would normally imply. Wave without a Shore is philosophical, concept-driven SF which reminds me somewhat of LeGuin in a similar mode, though perhaps less self-righteous. I enjoyed it a great deal but readers who are put off by heavy philosophy may be bored. Voyager in Night is the weirdest of the bunch -- it reminds me of an SRL video. It's nominally an Alliance/Union story about a ship which gets kidnapped by an unknown alien; it's also about identity both personal and species.

There are multiple directions for one drawing and it is unclear, since it is not clearly shown, how one should exactly proceed. Using this book is similar to learning how to knit with only verbal instructions. Though the book is cheap, the beginner knitter is probably better off spending his/her ten dollars on another book with more, clearer drawings. Otherwise it is just as well to get knitting instructions free online since they are equally as obscure as this book. Likewise, there are too many baby projects here. While making tiny sweaters over and over again might be useful for someone with children or grandchildren, if you are looking to make something for yourself, this book is limited in terms of projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"No book is for a beginner - advanced beginner DEFINATLEY","review":"I have taught many people how to knit and everyone agrees, you cannot learn to knit by looking at diagrams(or from a book), it is just to confusing of a concept if you have no idea how knitting works.

Lynn Robinson clearly has a beautiful spirit, and her message and words are transcendently uplifting. The book itself is wonderfully designed and a pleasure to hold and to read. I don't even mind the occasional New Age-ism because I find it impossible to argue with her explanation of intuition as Divine, or with her admonition to follow the guidance of the still, small voice within. That path leads to fulfillment, joy and happiness, she says. And I can truthfully and enthusiastically report to you that I've followed her instructions -- and my own intuition -- and positive occurrences were indeed forthcoming.

The affirmations that are inter-spaced throughout the text are distracting and often have no bearing on the author's message. Poor layout and typeface selection are equally distracting.This is one of the worst self help books I have ever read. Save your money.

She saved his life and he repays her by getting very upset....at first. I feel that Trovald should treat his wife as an equal, not an inferrior. Mrs. Linde is a character who decives Nora. She is portrayed as her friend and she is, but I think she was wrong in telling Krogstad not to take the letter out of the mail box. It is none of her business if Trovald never finds out Nora forged her father's name. I give this play four stars. You should read this play if you like mysteries.

Ingrid was too embarrassed to tell the taxi driver, so she went inside with her soccer cleats and her bookbag. Ingrid makes friends with the old lady, Katie, and that is when her adventure begins. Murder, drama, action--the book has it all! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I bought this keychain thinking it would be a cute little gift for my boyfriend who is in love with Toy Story.

This book was the only book I really liked and could read again. It was about a boy named Andrew who had to go to his aunt's house for the summer. There was an old man living there who didn't like Andrew. Andrew finds out why when he gets to the attic and goes back in time to when the old man was a kid. He switched places with a kid whose name is Andrew and looks like Andrew. He only switched places because he didn't want him to die of diphtheria. One of the best parts of this book is when Andrew has to jump off the tressel into the river. But he didn't and his mean cousin fell in and started to drown. He jumped in and saved him. His cousin didn't even care that he got saved. A part of the book I disliked was when Andrew from the past wanted to switch places so he could be back in his own time, but he had to win a game of marbles and he lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating , adventurous, suspenseful book...","review":"An amazing and suspenseful ghost story that kept me turning the page throughout the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time For Andrew is the scariest book ever!","review":"Time For Andrew is about a boy who goes back in time when he is at his Aunt's house.The setting is both real and imaginary.Real because his Aunt's house is real.

The mood can be somewhat spooky and also serious due to most of the conflict Andrew will face during his visitation at his relative's house. It's a very interesting story; you will be wanting to read three chapters in one night--and that's because of the foreshadowing the author has produced. Only one negative about this book was that some parts of the novel were dramatically decreased in action (began to get boring); only one flaw like this isn't bad enough to put the book away and collect dust. You can't miss this book; and if you like ghost stories or suspence, this book is definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Book --- Everyone should read this","review":"\\"Time for Andrew\\" didn't sound interesting at first, but since I had enjoyed other mysteries by Mary Downing Hahn, I decided to give it a try.

This movie started out with a good concept, three couples with different problems. However the execution of the film was terrible. The mood throughout the film was gloomy, and none of the characters seemed to have any real emotion toward each other, even when they weren't on the rocks. And don't believe the words on the box which make this film sound like an oscar winner, I had to prop my eyelids open with toothpicks halfway through. To add to this, the four or five (I lost count) love triangles were to much to keep up with. And nobodys life has that much coincidence in it.

I agree with the previous reviewer who said that our community needs less how-to books and more essays of this nature, because all of the spells, rituals, and instructions in the world won't let someone truly know how it feels to live our faith.

Rather than aiding the individual in understanding the wonderful daily and practical applications of druidry (a goal the author establishes for herself in the intro), this book is an abstract, self-indulgent dissertation on personal mystical experiences which both confuses and irritates the sensitive reader. Part of this outcome may be due to the difficulty in finding adequate ways to express personal spiritual experience; however, the tone of the book is dour rather than joyful, and the fairy-filled, ghost-laden pages, are likely to turn-off anyone who is trying seriously to grow in their own practical spiritual experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful","review":"Restall Orr at her best, this book is spiritually enlightening and inspiring.

Of course the special success of black athletes has a lot to do with the negative realities of racist society. But it also has something to do with the strength of people who have faced adversity and not given up, or at least have the drive to try to secure for themselves a future. Society depends on such people, so is it really a bad thing that they become role models? The \\"Black Cause\\", insofar as it does or should exist, is not retarded each time a black athlete crosses the finish line. But it is retarded every time a teacher expects less from a black kid, or a rich black superstar suddenly becomes content with the status quo, or a writer makes money by replacing a false biological stereotype (and it is false, I've done the research Jon Entine failed to do) with an equally false social one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely adorable","review":"This unicorn couldn't be any cuter.

One inescapable conclusion is that the reader searching for some wisdom among America's CEO's or deans of Yale's business school is likely to be disappointed. Perhaps rising to the top is neither evidence of some greater intellectual power nor of an ability to articulate novel ideas nor even of any particular talent. Rising to the top is more a reflection of one's ability to acquire and wield power and thus it should neither surprise nor disappoint us that the \\"leaders\\" at the top, both in business and academics, aren't all that smart.

Each one is a classic of Bierce's bitterness and insight into such things as greedy politicians, not-so-holy holy men, legislators, doctors, judges, dogs sheep, lions and diplomats. Many read more like anecdotes, but in true fable style, he personifies animals as well as ideas, and even creates his own fantastic characters, such as the Pahdour of Patagascar and the Gookul of Madagonia. Bierce attacks each fable with much of his own sarcasm and satirical style. He even re-works some of Aesop's reknowned fables to suit his needs. Fans of Bierce's work will want to add these little gems to his or her collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fables for the Modern Man","review":"Aesops's Fables have been around for at least 2,500 years, and are as valid today as they were in ancient times. However, this collection of modern fables, the product of the sardonic wit of the incomparable Ambrose Bierce, undoubtedly will be good for at least 2,500 more. The perfect companion volume to Bierce's \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good job that can be rewritten for another edition","review":"This book is concise but clear. I think the typesetting in this book could be redone better to give it better readability.More diagrams & few more example would make it perfect.The authors explains many subtle points of C++. This book is good for academic settings if you already knows C & Data Structures. Overall, a good concise book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommendable Coward-collection!","review":"A wonderful collection of some of Noel Coward's brilliant production.Coward is unparalelled in english litterature with his short stories;and here we have two gems (\\"Cheap Excursion\\" and \\"The Kindness Of Mrs.Radcliffe\\" excellently presented by SIMON JONES.Together with MARGARET LEIGHTON we also hear NOEL COWARD himself act out some excerpts from his plays \\"Brief Encounter\\", \\"Blithe Spirit\\" and\\"Present Laughter\\" plus G.B.Shaw's \\"The Apple Cart\\"This 5 -cd-collection also presents some of Coward's collected verse.

This book will show children that material objects aren't as fun and loving as a good friend who cares about you. This book will change the way you think about how important your friends and family are.This book is about a rabbit who got a new rug. His rug was the most beutiful rug that he had seen before. So rabbit decided to call up all of his friends to come over to see his new rug. But when they got there he wouldn't let anyone step on it so they had to stand against the wall. Everyone got tired of standing so they all left. So then for days rabbit would just stay at home and clean his rug. Soon rabbit realized that a rug isn't a friend and found out that he wasn't having any fun at all. So he decided to have a party with all of his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood favorite","review":"I had this book as a child and wanted my daughter to enjoy it too.

You will both enjoy, now one of my kids favs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition of book greatly mis-described!!!!","review":"This book was described as \\"like new.\\" Instead the binding was broken and the pages were not even attached to the binding. The seller did not reply to my inquiry about getting another copy. A terrible experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly explains the basis of Eastern \\"Ways\\"","review":"This is a fundamentally important book for anyone seriously interested in any of the Eastern \\"Ways\\": sitting meditation, martial arts (external or internal), yoga, tea ceremony, flower arrangement, calligraphy etc. The clarity of the author's explanations is surprisingly crisp and practical.This book was written in 1956, originally in German, so the grammar is a bit old-fashioned, and \\"man\\" is used exclusively for \\"person\\", but on the up-side, a refreshing air of unbridled enthusiasm prevails throughout.I VERY highly recommend this gem of a book to serious spiritual seekers, martial artists, fine artists, all healers esp body workers, and those wishing to have deeper insight into Eastern philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-rounded, anatomical, traditionalistic","review":"This book satisfied my curiosity & hunch about the importance of the belly in daily life. It tells how transitional Japanese use the Hara to effect sturdiness & even an egoless way of life. This has much to do with drawing a sense of identity from the Hara instead of the head. It illustrates why this makes sense. But I would have liked the book a bit more if there was less enthusiasm selling me the importance (which I believe or I wouldn't be reading the book) and more instruction on how I may adopt the view in myself. Alas. Enjoy reading this from a German ally author! Huh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Pretentious.","review":"Several years ago, I had a conversation with a group of filmakers who angrily debated the merits of \\"The Color Purple\\". Chiefly, we all wondered \\"What did Alice Walker really think of the movie?\\"Well, she tells us here. In the most dull, pretentious and boring prose I've ever read. Self-serving and rambling journal entries. Tired cliches about what it means to be a black bisexual woman. Overreaching liberal claptrap that is better suited for a late-night college bull session than a serious piece of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Horrible.","review":"There is a reason this show died.

It's absolutely awful. You end up having to put the discs in cd cases. That's how bad it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of rubbish","review":"The 1st season of Heroes prior to the last the last episode was good the rest have been awful. Season 4 starts poorly and plumets down hill from there. The plot is muddled and the stories drag on into nothingness. Nothing makes sense and seems to have been penned by an absent minded 4 year old. The main villain was awful and his followers, a bunch of mindless non entities that seem to no opinions of there own. Most of the time you find yourself hoping the disk will skip ahead as the episodes are so dull, long winded and ultimately go nowhere. I would rather throw the money away then buy this box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shortlived","review":"This was a good show but thanks to the inconsistancy of the writers it lasted only four seasons. The final season, to me, started to bring back some of the excitement and overall feel of the first season, which is easily the best IMO. I could've done without the whole 'Sylar possessing Matt' garbage, because it was among the inconsistant writing and way too drawn out, but otherwise a pretty good ending. Besides, if you already have the other seasons, you might as well get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallin from glory","review":"It's obvious that the show runner never knew how to followup season one and you can tell as each season has gotten progressively bad. Skip this show and watch something better written. The dialogue and scenes all became beyond funny and that's why this once great show was cancelled. Viewers got tired of the Producers saying, oh, it will be good again. That never happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper at Target","review":"All of the seasons of Heroes are only $10 each at Target. That is the cheapest I have seen this series. This is a great show and it definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"good shows","review":"I liked watching the relationships between the Japanese persons, the two brothers, and the others. It's a show that needs to watched from the beginning of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unfortunate Last Season of the Great Heroes","review":"Heroes Season 4: Redemption had it's ups and downs. I think \\"Once Upon A Time In Texas\\" is one of the worst episodes of the entire show. It was a b****-slap to the rules the writers established throughout the show (if they indeed ever did establish any, which is debatable). Then there are some awesome stories and episodes, e.g. the story arc of Sylar being in Matt's mind was very well done (mostly). I do recommend this season to Heroes fans, new and old but the ending leaves you on an unfortunate quasi-cliffhanger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Once again heroes spends an entire season building up to nothing. This time we see Claire whine some more and experiment with her akward girlfriend. Sylar is once again confused and wandering. And Peter is completely useless and weak like a little kid to no suprise. The apparent villain in this series fizzles out in a pathetic battle. The entire season is a complete and unmitigated waste of time. The writers of this show never cease to amaze at how easily they can disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"For women, By women\\"","review":"Lots of talk, loads of searching everyone's motives. Tiresome. Make sure the fast forward is working on your DVD player. The charm of earlier Heroes episodes was the introduction of characters by their actions, which showed vulnerability, power, delight, you name it. Season 4 rarely shows these things, it just tells. A major disappointment and not a surprise that the series tanked and was cancelled after this. A real shame, but Tim Kring is to blame for trying to be deep but ironically providing a shallow version of visual art. Show it, dude, show it. The writers are listed as men, but this series is all about conversation, broken up by hugs and glances. Best description: \\"For women, by women.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbue Heroes","review":"I actually thought the series got better year after year.

To the writers I say way to reck the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It ended too soon","review":"Though many considered Heroes to be going down hill, in the last few moments of the final season, there seemed to be a beacon of hope and new energy for the show...and then it was cancelled.The price for the DVD set is far too high, here on Amazon. Target currently has this set for ten dollars in store. I just picked my copy up today. I didn't want to spend more than that on Season 3 or 4 given the ratings drop and how NBC crapped all over the Heroes series. I dislike supplying companies with my money when they do that to shows I love. Anyway...I recommend going to Target if you are desiring to complete your collection. As of August 30th, 2011 the price is $9.99 for each season, 1-4."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unfinished Ending For Our Group Of Heroes :-(","review":"I loved Seasons 1 and 2 of Heroes. Great writing and stoylines, excellent characters and especially awesome villains. But with Season 3 and now especially 4, things went south. The storylines were awful and the show lost it's heart. I wish they pulled a \\"LOST\\" and gave the show an ending (Even though LOST had me....well LOST, in it's final 2 seasons.)that would have been somewhat fulfilling. It's obvious that we will never get any ending to the show as production costs were so high. We could pray for a two night mini series, but don't hold your breath. The DVD set itself matches the great quality of the other three with lots of bonus features and deleted scenes that at least give you some desert after a so so meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"There is really no point in starting Heroes.NBC discontinued it this 4th season. We are left with several major story lines that just hang.The major story line, Sylar the mass-murdering psychopathic nearly omnipotent character, is destined to be killed by a coalition of heroes.This never happens. You are left with Sylar trying to regain his power after a near death experience.Unfortunately for anyone who cared NBC gave a big Eff-EwE to the people who actually did watch it to make room forshows that are watched less or on their way to being cancelled. I love their logic.So, if you're in it for the story, its not worth a watch..., just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Season & Cancellation Deserved.","review":"I enjoyed the series as a whole and very much recommend the first 3 seasons, BUT, season 4 is a pretty big let down. It never feels right, the actors don't seem as \\"into it\\", and the whole carnival thing just didn't work for me. Sylar's spontaneous \\"conversion\\" never feels right either. And of course no series is complete these days without some major character coming out of the closet. Hollywood really needs to stop being so over the top in that regard. Lots more nit picks but there are a couple funny moments. Too bad they are more rare than not. The bottom line is that the series was canceled, and season 4 is the reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"They should have continue the story","review":"We got this because it's a very interesting series; Never had problems viewing the chapters...takes a while to download, but it worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the seasons...","review":"I only purchased the product to complete my Heroes collection.

The first season was great, then it just went downhill from there... this one was incredibly boring. They obviously didn't know what to do with some characters so added some totally pointless stories in order to keep them in the show...

This is definitely NOT a 1 star book! The well-chosen quotations add needed wisdom to this financial strategy book. I'm not a very big supporter of Network Marketing or the Accelerated Money Strategies because they both punish the novice in terms of time, money and effort. The risk is understated in both of these cases and I wish these chapters were not included in Robert's book.

Tries to sell you into network marketing schemes in the middle of the book -- good argument, but no thanks. And the tax liens is interesting except for the lack of information about the down side, which he tries to sell as none.

Any time someone throws this many subjects for \\"investment\\" at you, you wonder just how much is going to be covered and just how much knowledge the author really has in each particular area. Allen is mainly known for real estate investing.

However, the examples did not factor in costs (taxes, fees, etc.). Mr Allen, in this book, does give the reader one big long infomercial. This book lacked specifics. He also admits in the book that alot of these expensive seminars these infopreneurs give simply re-hash info from their cheaper products (books, audiotapes, etc.).

The book was nothing more than a rah-rah, you too can make a fortune being an aggressive, harassing pain in the neck and walking into people's homes and saying \\"Hey, I own your house!\\" And, if I had no morals, no ethics, no scrupples and wanted money at all cost I'd follow along, especially the chapter where he talks about getting a good deal selling his grandmother. Actually, you could knock over a bank which is quicker. Yes, Robert Allen makes millions of dollars thanks to his pushy aggressive, annoying sales team who call constantly even after you've asked to be taken off of their list. They pester millions of people worldwide until they buy his products. Someday someone, perhaps the IRS, will catch up with Allen but until then he will make money at everyone's expense.

I now have a goal of creating two new streams of income this year and two more next year, and I am confident that I will succeed. . . This book is invaluable in providing guidance and stimulating the creative gland. It provides step-by-step instructions toward building some streams and invites the reader to imagine others . . Stephen R. Covey said in his recommendation that this book will shift the reader's paradigm. He was right. If you read \\"Multiple Streams of Income\\" and imagine the possibilities, you will never look at yourself, your job or your paycheck the same way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Cover Price","review":"The book starts out with great chapters on strategies for making money. As it wears on, the ways to add \\"a stream of income\\" become more and more abstract...and ridiculous if you ask me. Robert G. Allen is more interested in pluggin other books, progrmas, seminars, network marketing companies, etc than writing a sound personal finance book. He attepts to squeeze the reader for more and more money by asking you to visit his website where his buddies have \\"streams of income\\" waiting for you...at a cost. Overall, the book has some very good points and strategies but you have to sift throgh the crud to get to the good stuff. I have also learned that although you should not judge a book by its cover, any book with a sparkling cover should not be purchased. If you need a cover like that to get somone's attention you didn't write a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapter 22 - How to get rich panhandling","review":"Is about the only chapter you wont find in this slop. I dont know why he left that one out. He wrote a few pages about anything else he could think of. You would probably make more money begging on a street corner than with what this joker proposes. What a pathetic job this convict author has done.Please read through all the reviews and get a good picture about what is going on. Notice the same theme in all the cult-like glowing, positive reviews? Makes you wonder what kind of stake all these reviewers have in the success of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake news website","review":"Robert Allen have taken to using fake news websites to promote his products, particularly the Multiple Streams of Income package.In them they deceive customers with a fabricated story of a young single Mom who solves her financial woes with the Multiple Streams of Income kit.

He he he. Now folks he must be on to something he conned alot of people out of their hard earned money. Seriously though I see some of the positive reviews say,\\"Well you may not like it all, but at least he mentions some good investments like tax lien certificates and disounted mortgages.\\" I have yet to see anyone really give the low-down on these investments. Mainly that the buyer is saddled with any IRS liens that come attached to the property. I didnt see this book recommending that you check these investments out thoroughly beforehand, so does Allen really know what he's talking about? Thank goodness I only paid .75$ for this one at a Friends of the Library sale. Phew..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must","review":"Apparently some people don't realize who the famed Robert G. Allen is. The author of Nothing Down and Creating Wealth of 80's fame. The man is a financial genius. I don't think he is bragging by mentioning his success. The only people who would think that must be jealous or just ... because they'll never get anywhere. LOL! I've read other titles by him and this one is the best. This book will really light a fire under you and get you headed in the right direction. All of it makes perfect sense and I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone and definitely suggest everyone buy it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd pass...","review":"Good read, enjoyable, well written... but I read this book to gain what it claims to deliver. And deliver it did not.

Snake oil and hubris, I say!Do you really want to know HOW TO GET RICH?Try an invaluable book called \\"The Mind Accelerator\\"-- now this is straight and concentrated strategy for ultra success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like throwing your money away......","review":"Buying and reading this great book by Robert G. Allen and not following his proven advice i s literally like throwing your money away.It's all in here. Thanks to Robert Allen I got into mlm and am now financially free.

These folks SPAMMED me for months. I finally read their add, and wanted to learn a bit more about an organization that could get ME to read their SPAM. They know how to market, but nothing about it meets my moral minimums of the Golden Rule.This book, like this organization, smells like bacon, or pork maybe. Old pork, and VERY GREASY. I ordered the online version, and to my amazement, got 6 other PDFs with \\"valuable information\\" in them. The tipoffs should have been all the typos (not you Amazon, don't pull my review). ;-)Outdated information, basic common sense.

FF and yup I was right about everything. It's just strange to believe That a woman would hate another woman so much and she would go through all this trouble. I just didn't by the film because the motives behind it all were just too...well shallow. This might have been a good movie in the hands of better writers. The entire Kidney thing is just a sub plot you can figure out 30 minutes in. Sadly it's supposed to be a strong point of this movie because it revolves around this organ jacking business and it fails. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance this movie isn't. I gave this move 2 stars because I enjoyed watching the \\"bad kidney girl\\" suffer. Her character was pretty annoying and needy and those few scenes rewarded me with a reason to watch then than skip over it.Overall this movie is so so and it gets a so so rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooring","review":"I've been had is all I can say, after reading other reviews I really thought this would be an interesting, exciting movie. Instead, the story is lame, the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so NOT scary or at least gripping. I watched the whole thing as I thought maybe I am missing something, but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end. Sorry guys, but this is nowhere near, Audition, Tale of two Sisters or even Whispering Corridors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban Legends","review":"Urban Legends, while many times seem to be an American thing, often over lap in other cultures. Koma is basically the story about the infamous waking up in a bathful of ice finding an internal organ missing.Granted, your probably thinking been there, seen that, as I was before I watched it. However with enough twists and creepy dialogue through the movie, this psychological thriller turns from bland to thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Thankfully I only put one together before checking lights!!!

He and all of his friends and etc rode it for hours. They loved it and it performed flawlessly. I constucted it for him and it went together in a few hours without any hitches. I would highly recommend this for the first time rider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality not so good","review":"The design look and concept behind this scooter is great, but the quality of the electronics and fit/finish leaves a lot to be desired. We purchased two of the Peg Perego Vespa's and two Pocket-Mod Razor's for Christmas for our girls. The Razor's were $50 less, and are still working flawlessly. BOTH vespa's have broken twice each (electronic circuit board fails). Peg Perego sent us replacement circuit boards, which are difficult to remove and replace, and they operated once again for a short period of time, then same result.The Vespa is constructed completely out of molded plastic, that does not seem to hold up well. In addition, the electronics are obviously low quality. Look into Razor's for scooters. Quality metal construction with real rubber tires (not plastic like the Peg Vespa), and they seem to be much more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vespa","review":"This is a fun toy. My Daughter loves it. I am a little concerned about the durability, as I have found 2 pieces of plastic that I cannot identify fall out of it. So far, so good.Directions to assemble were also a little confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than a brochure","review":"This 'execubook' was a complete waste of money. I had skimmed the introduction for this book at the bookstore and thought I would be downloading an electronic copy that I could read on the plane. This 'book' is about a dozen pages in very large print - it has less information than a typical hotel brochure. I am incredibly disappointed and will not be downloading any e-books from Amazon.com in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I had hoped that Polson's The Veil's Edge would feature concepts and techniques for the advanced practitioner. Unfortunately, although the chapter topics are intriguing, there is little here of substance. The book reads more like a seventh-grader's book report. Polson intersperses personal anecdotes with quotes from pagan and occult authors, but the reader would be better served by accessing the primary sources in their entirety. Polson presents nothing substantially different from the dozens of other introductory books out there. Her advice is sound, in a very basic sort of way, but she offers little to those who have spent more than six months studying the Craft. This is not a bad book - just unsophisticated in style and content. It perhaps would be appropriate for a reader looking to move a baby-step beyond the \\"Teen Witch\\" series, but who is not yet ready for Starhawk, Curott, or Galenorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"When I first bought this book, I thought I was going to get some interesting perspectives on some of the lesser-travelled paths of the Witch. Instead, I found this book to barely graze the surface of its subject matter. The author appears to be dancing around the edges of her material in hopes of appealing to an audience hungry for more advanced fare, but far too many subjects are explored for this 224 page book to be effective at conveying its intended message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mount it high","review":"I have several D-Link 802.11b products in my house, and my network hums right along very nicely.

That is a big factor to me. And I am sure it is to others.I was able to get this product up and running in about 5 minutes. That is quicker than any other Networking product I can think of. If you want easy and wireless, this is the answer.Although it takes up a USB port, and doesn't allow you to use the USB connection for any other high demanding bandwidth device, it is an ease of use product and that is why I give it such a high score. Anyone can plug in a USB cable. Not everyone can install a PCI card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with XP","review":"I recently got a new Dell with XP installed.

The installation was fairly simple, requiring only a quick reboot (after setting IP addresses, etc). But! I have never been able to get more than 2Mbps out of this device, even 2 feet from the AP. I have a laptop with built-in wireless, and it easily gets 6mbps. Also, my Win98 computer is less than reliable while using the D-Link...

The height they list on the box is also misleading. My daughter qualified under the numbers but her feet could go past the safety cover they offer.It may be an extreme response but I hated this seat so much I'm not even going to try another.

The ride was uncomfortable for both me and my son. I returned the bike and got another model in hopes that the carrier would be a better fit on it. Guess what?

I ended up returning the bike and carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need the right kind of bike","review":"My wife bought this seat on recommendations from a friend's husband. The first bike I tried would not take it. It is somewhat crucial that your seat adjustment bolt is level with or higher than the top of your back wheel. Her's wasn't, so we couldn't use it. Then we bought another bike at a yard sale, and I put it on there. On this bike the child seat contacts the rear brakes, so they are no longer functional, and the grabby bar on the child seat is hanging over the bike seat a bit. It would be nice to back the seat away a little. My recommendation would be to go to a bike shop and ask their opinion OR feel comfortable fabricating parts for your seat.Also, the picture on the box shows better hardware than they gave me to assemble with. If I had that hardware it would work nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Child Bike Seat at an Affordable Price","review":"Good quality product at a great price.

I wore them all day out shopping on a very cold day with no problems and they kept my feet really warm! They are very well made. I love them. After my first pair, I liked them enough to buy a second pair in a different color. The expresso color is a little darker than the picture. All of the colors they come in are very elegant. They are true to size but I actually bought my second pair a size smaller than I normally wear because they did not have my size. They were really really snug, and I thought I made a mistake but I wore them a few days and they have stretched to also fit good and feel great!! Cool! They both felt snug at first, the smaller one of course the most but they become very comfortable after you wear them.... really!

The color is good, however it is EVERYWHERE now. It has been over three weeks since I colored my hair and if my hair touches anything, the dye transfers. It is really bad if my hair is wet, but even with my hair dry, there is a color transfer. My towels, pillows, sheets, clothing, parts of my shower lining, the shower curtain and many other things now have pink and purple splotches on them. The black hair dye transfers as dark purple. If I hug someone, my hair transfers a faded purple and pink stain that kind of looks like purple and pink dust. I cannot wear any of my good clothing because the collar will be ruined by the dye transfer. So, I spent all of that time coloring my hair, and now I have to wrap my hair in a scarf to avoid getting dye everywhere. Not to mention the expense and embarrassment of accidentally getting color on everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long-lasting, affordable, worth it!","review":"This was a very awsome product. It lasted WAY longer than Manic Panic, and Punky hair colour is cheap :)If you buy this product (pre-bleached or not), just a few tips, don't use conditioner or hot water, and leave in the color for at least an hour..It's very intense and it comes with plenty of color. You can even mix the colors, and get great results, unlike other kinds of brands. I one time mixed bright yellow and blue and it made green!Always go for J.Russell.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for My Skin Color","review":"Like all Punky Colours this was extremely vibrant and lasts weeks when hair is washed in cold water. However, the Turquoise does not look good on people with fair skin. It is definitely a color that looks better on darker skin tones. It also looks better against dark hair than blonde hair.For a more intense color bleach hair before applying. The color smells like bubble gum when applying and for the first couple washes. Always wash hair in cold water to keep color vibrant. Also, this color is more difficult to bleach out than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Grape Soda <3","review":"I LOVE this dye! First off, I had bought the SPLAT purple bleach and dye kit and gotten less than stellar results. I actually came out more pink than purple and rather spotty...so, I emergency ordered a bottle of this beauty to fix it up.Okay, so the good stuff: First thing you notice is the amazing smell. It smells like grape soda! Second, it is the perfect consistency. You can work it thru your hair no problem, and it doesn't drip at all.To get my color to come out, I started by using a basic soap to get all the product out, let it dye, and then applied the dye. I left it in for about 6 hours. After rinsing, I had hands down the best purple color I've ever gotten. On bleached hair, you get a deep, deep beautiful purple (kinda looks like grape soda actually...hmm) and it doesn't look overly shiny like some dyes do.I love this product, I will never bye another brand...I'm totally sold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Purple","review":"I love this color. Turned out a true purple, almost exactly the color on the label. I have light brown hair and the color turned out the same on my natural color as on the hair I bleached first. after applying I used a straightening iron on it (a Paul Mitchell tip I picked up)to heat set it and I didn't rinse/wash it until the next day. Perfect results. And of course it stains everything it touches, that's what a dye is supposed to do! I had no trouble at all cleaning it off the sink, counter and floor using just a little cleanser. I didn't have the bathtub staining problems some people reported, it all washed down the drain just fine but I would assume the cleanser work on the tub just as well. This is nice and thick, making it easy to apply exactly where you want it without it running down your face and neck. I will never buy another brand of color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Effect","review":"I have been dying my hair off and on for about 15 years and usually lean towards pink so I have tried many brands. My usual choice is Special Effects Cupcake Pink (a really good product) began to bore me and the quality felt inconsistent. I bought Punky Colour Flamingo Pink on a whim and am really satisfied. The price point is considerably lower so I didn't expect the color to be so rich and lasting, but it is. I bleached my hair first, and it did come out about a dark magenta, which fades into a lovely lighter pink. I also had some left over toner which I mixed with a small plop of this dye and came up with mellower version of the magenta, adding dimension to the flat color. It doesn't make my hair feel coated or grimy, like many others. I don't use color safe shampoo, but suspect if I did that this would be a really long lasting dye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used it over half my life","review":"Punky colors is a good dye.

This was not my first time with a semi-permanent color dye like this - I always use Punky Colour or Manic Panic - but was my first time using blue. After my first application, the hair turned out a turquoise color. (Flaw #1) So i dyed the hair again, both times letting the dye sit on the hair for well over 30 mins. The second application worked. However, I noticed the second flaw within a week. Despite gratuitous rinsing, the blue color had spread to the untreated blonde hairs around it! I've stopped wearing the blue extensions and still haven't been able to wash the blue tinge out of the blonde. Oh well.So, it takes multiple treatments to achieve the true blue color and I guess multiple rinsings to make sure it doesnt spread the color to the rest of your hair/clothes. Overall it does the job though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its ok","review":"This product is really good. Smells kinda fruity. I can't stand the smell of other hair dyes but this smells good, or at least smellable. You can leave this in for a long time.

I will add that I did go ahead and give it a chance, still the results were terrible.Ebony means black not dark blue. disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected a darker green...","review":"The color wasn't what I had expected.

After it washed out about 75% of the way, it stopped coming out, and my hair remained a gross light-brownish-purple in ugly patches on my head for several months. I can't say this was the company's fault because I had been warned many times that this could happen to people with light blonde hair, but other brands I've used have washed out fully within a few weeks (e.g. manic panic). However, the color did look vibrant and pretty when I first dyed it, and if you don't have light hair, you probably have nothing to worry about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Got this last year and let me just say, this is the best brand of hair color I've ever purchased the color bleeds but it last for 7 months and I just dyed my hair over this is a great buy and brand I recommend this to any one that loves crazy colors as I do.

No such luck. I left it for about 45 min and it rinsed to a disgusting, swampy, ugly turquoise. It looked like I had dyed it Alpine Green 4 months ago and just let it fade to this mess.I had my hair Lagoon Blue about 15 years ago and it was a perfect shade of sky blue, I don't know what went wrong.Waste of time. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BRAND OF BLUE DYE EVER!!!","review":"Wrote this for their Midnight Blue color, same applies to this color...I love Punky Colour!! I have black hair and the blue highlights look great against the black, especially in the sunlight.

I mix this color with their Midnight Blue and I get a really great deep electric blue color. Highly recommend Punky Colour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Before using this product I had never really colored my hair, but because the product was so easy to use I'll certainly be doing it much more often.

Once the dye came, I left it in for about 4 hours in my bleached copper blonde hair, expecting it to be a dark but vibrant purple. The results: Stained hands, back, legs, shower, sink, counter, and BLACK hair with a blue-ish purple-ish tint. I could have just bought \\"blue black\\" hair dye by garnier, that I used in 2010, and I would have gotten the same results WITHOUT bleaching. I wasn't exactly prepared for it to be this messy, as the only other \\"unnatural\\" semi-permanent hair dye I've used is Manic Panic's Cotton Candy Pink, which didn't stain anything at all, and was very vibrant and eventually faded to a pretty pastel pink. I'm sure this color works a lot better on platinum bleached hair, but it's incredibly messy/staining and disappointing nonetheless. I'm going to try bleaching my hair again, and try Special Effects pimpin' purple ^_^ I definitely recommend avoiding this dye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love this dye, but shipping...","review":"I've been a loyal user of this dye for a really long time now, I think I've ordered at least 6 of these in the past 6 months xD But this time around the shipping was incredibly slow (I STILL don't have it) and I really needed it today so I could redye my hair before a concert I'm going to tonight.

It smelled like grapes, made my hair soft and silky (even though I bleached the pieces I colored w/ this first, it felt better than the rest of my hair that I used regular dye on), and it has stayed in VERY well. Its been almost 2 months now and its still in! The only downsides were 1. It was darker than I had hoped and greener BUT i have red hair that turned true yellow when bleached so thats probly why! 2. For the first 3 weeks at least, any time I got even a tiny bit sweaty/wet/moist, I turned turquoise! However, it was super easy to apply and a great product overall and it arrived very quickly so THUMBS UP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhhhhhh","review":"I got this color to dye my human hair platinium blond extensions.

I left it it for 1hr as one reviewer recommended and it gave me a very dark gorgeous blue color, though it didn't come out turquoise for me (this was most likely since my hair wasn't bleached white). Also I dyed it about 3 1/2 weeks ago, since then it has lighted to a deep teal color but even as this color It's still vibrant and I get compliments on it!This is the first blue I've tired and I am happy with it, plus its one hair dye that actually smells good opposed to an array of suffocating chemicals.The only downfall is I still have blue runoff in the shower/tub. Obviously it's not much at this point but it's still there which can be frustrating. Also be very carefully, it will dye everything it touches blue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I think this hairdye is one of the best I've used so far. It lasts FOREVER, which is gonna be a problem once you want to dye your hair a different color because it's really hard to get it out of your hair (and sink for that matter!). This is why I've given it 4 stars as I like to change the color of my hair a lot. Yet, if you want an intense, vibrant and longlasting turquoise dye this is the product to use. It might be a bit more dark blue at first, but it fades beautifully to a true teal/blue greenish color after a couple of washes. I'm really excited to try out the other Punky colors as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING! Wont use anything else","review":"I absolutly love this stuff.

So I headed over to Ulta to see what I could find. I am a huge fan of Manic Panic as it is a natural, vegan, non-damaging product and I figured Jerome Russell's Punky Color was equivalent... Not so much. The bottom inch or two of my hair has been breaking off ever since. To be fair, the color is nice and the product smells great--It does stain the hands a lot more than MP, but lasts longer in the hair. I'm not sure what the difference is in the formula, but I will definitely be going back to Manic Panic because after using MP my hair actually feels softer and more conditioned than before using it.

Our daughters love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"total junk","review":"these are TOTAL junk. do not buy. it takes absolutely no pressure for the bottoms of the beds to pop right out. within 3 days of owning 2 of these bunk beds the side rails cracked on each side and the board that popped off started separating. its a shame too because the girls love them but its like they cant even hold the weight of an American girl doll. total junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality","review":"To be totally honest, if you can afford to buy something similar to this from American Girl, a local crafter, or if you can build it yourself, you'd be better off. The white finish was marred and scratched, as well as not being totally painted in spots along the slats on the end pieces. When I tried to put it together, the holes for the joints hadn't been drilled deep enough. I finally gave up, put the pieces back in the box, and will rely on Grandpa to drill the holes deep enough and put it together on Christmas Day. My five year-old niece will probably thinks it's fine, but I was disgusted with the quality. But then again, it was pretty inexpensive. In this case, I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for the money","review":"It was easy to assemble and is perfect for my daughter's 2 american girl dolls. She loved it and I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My second purchase of this product.","review":"I purchased one a year ago for a 7,4 and 2 year old. It has held up very well. Grampa had to replace one of the bottoms when the now 5 year old sat on it, but that would be expected. He was amazed about how easily he could take it back apart to make the necessary repairs. This purchase is for a 6 year old.I also purchased 2 of the sets with the wardrobe on the bottom and the bed on top. My son remarked about how well built this was."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Wood Doll Bunk Bed","review":"This is a Christmas gift for our 3 year old granddaughter so can't testify to how much she likes it yet - however it came timely, in good shape packed with good instructions. It seems to be the best quality of many I have looked at in person - that's why I bought it on line - it is not cheap, flimsy plastic. It seems sturdy and durable. The blanket and pillow are one piece just barely wide enough for the bed so it's really a faux pillow. But I'll make a couple blankets and pillows. It was a good decision I think over the other options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best SimCity series reference book I've ever read!!!!","review":"With the information, pictures, charts, and interviews in this book, I have learned so much about SImCity 200 that I probably would have broken the SC2k population record if my computer didn't have a bug that disabled this (no, it's not the old DOS version one). This is the best book I can suggest for SimCity 2000. It can take a no-experience \\"Gosh, what does that button do?\\"-level player through the basics and into the victory sector of the city-simulating game. This book is the leader for every leader!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring--The commentary does not explain what you are seeing.","review":"What a disappointment! I wanted to learn more about my state but just saw beautiful scenery. The minimal commentary was quotes that didn't pertain to learning about the areas of the state that I knew little about. The pacing was so slow that I fast forwarded through much of it. If you only want photos for an hour, this could work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something unique and worthwhile","review":"It's taken a long time for someone to come out with something that is as thought-provoking and challenging to the serious spiritual mind.

I just know that people are more willing to go to a 1 star review.I'm writing this to tell you that if the price is $140, WAIT. I bought the collection on Amazon for $83 after it was $140 a week before. The price for this collection fluctuates for reasons I cannot figure out.That aside, the entire collection is brilliant save for a few stupid Catwoman and Penguin episodes, but you weren't expecting greatness from those two anyway.Harley Quinn is the diamond of this series as she is born from this and thrives in this environment. She's cute, hilarious, and deadly at the same time, and her episodes (actually, any Joker episode besides Last Laugh and Christmas with the Joker) are must sees for any fan of DCAU.Fantastic collection, but please wait until the price is low (which it always comes back to) before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"It's a great series that I've loved since being a child. It's very interesting to watch the documentaries and the quality of the episodes is amazing. If you are a Batman fan, this is a must-have collection, in preference to the recent animated series \\"The Batman\\" which is poor. This series is much closer to the original comic and provides outstanding voice acting and breathtaking artwork and animation. Kevin Conroy will always be the true voice of Batman.

I enjoy it just as much now.It features decent plots which are so lacking in present-day kids cartoons. I also have a renewed appreciation for the animation. Quality of animation is also a missing element in many cartoons these days. But Batman the Animated series has been produced to be just like a Noir Comic, which I love! Beautifully drawn, and perfectly executed.This is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ancient Nature Native American Music","review":"I love so much music nr 5 and 6!

In many aspects the story is also darker than Way since it deals with the character's life and sad struggles. It is hard to compare the two since The Way of the Peaceful Warrior was such a profound and unique book. Personally I prefer 'Way' but Socrates is such an integral part of that story I was very happy to learn of his past in this book and found it to be a well written story of self discovery. Prepare to be inspired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peaceful Warrior is my favorite book - but this one sucks!","review":"I only read the first half, but it read like a story, and a mediocre one.

I knew it would be good, but I didn't know it would be this good. I read Way of the Peaceful Warrior when I was a freshman in college during some tough times. Just like they did with me, I passed that book to a friend who seemed to be ready for a change in his life. Millman is a master at explaining how we can change our daily lives in an entertaining yet not ridiculous manner. So many books that are considered \\"metaphysical\\" just lay out the answers in front of you and make you believe that these are the answers, Millman writes it in a manner where you have to decide what best works for you. The book is a further discovery in how a person deals with their most powerful demons and ends up coming out on top. The last few pages were the greatest eye opener into Millman's soul and his journey through life. Definitely the best one of all of the books he has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW element absent","review":"I loved Dan Millman \\"peaceful warrior \\" , but was unable to relate to the journey of Socrates.It lacked the beautiful storytelling and guidance in Mr. Millman initial creation.Wish him only the bestLots of loveGuy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your lucky!","review":"If you havent read this book yet, your lucky.

Just look at all of the high-rise public housing projects that used this book as a blueprint and how they have fared (hint: disastrously) to understand the success of the opinions within. He had absolutely no understanding about what makes cities work because he had very little understanding of humans. His mission was to exalt the machine...period. Plain and simple the guy was a kook, whose passionate prose was tragically interpreted as genius, much to the detriment of humanity. Save your time and money and stay away from this guy.

I wouldn't recommend buying these online and having them shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS!!!!","review":"First off--I want to make it clear that I think this is a 5 star product which I highly recommend. I gave a 1 star rating because I want to warn others not to purchase this item through amazon. I saw that others had received damaged shipments of leaking bottles but I ordered this product anyway hoping that the problem had been resolved. The shipment arrived in two boxes--one smaller box surrounded by packing materials placed in a larger box. Despite this excessive packaging, one of the bottles was split right down the middle. I didn't notice the problem initially, only today when I went to get a new bottle did I notice that the bottle had leaked all over my cabinet. Trust me, whatever you save purchasing in bulk through amazon is not worth the hassle of cleaning up a huge mess and then having to deal with amazon to try to get some sort of compensation for the defective merchandise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipment was fine, cost to ship was high","review":"I ordered this product despite the reviews that said the shipment arrived leaky and sticky. My shipment was fine. Each of the bottles had been taped around the top to prevent leaking during shipment.

So far I like the detergent. I have been combining it with white vinegar to remove chemicals. This way, it seems to have more foam, so I always double rinse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suggested!","review":"This is a great product with awful packaging.

It is sometimes hard to follow the big picture of a battle from how she writes, so these books are not for people looking to start learning about the war. But if you already know the basics of what happened in places like Mons, Ypres, Somme then her books are wonderful. All too often people think of WW1 and imaging only men sitting in muddy trenches and dying under mahcine guns and gas while Red Triplanes fly over head. McDonald goes in very close to the story having interviewed veterans while they were still with us and her books recount the adventures of men on guard duty, or in transit, in the dreaded 'glass house' or moving forward with the line.Reading her books you won't get the grand view of the battle field.

Unfortunately, I went against my own gut-feeling about purchasing this one so I went ahead and bought it and I feel like putting it on craigslist in the 'free stuff' section because Volume 4 is a disgrace to the BTAS cartoon franchise since there were significant changes in animation of the characters, voices and character development. Night Wing? The new Robin is really a kid when he starts crime fighting? Danny Elfman still got to compose his music and that was the only positive element of this cartoon.

We actually sent the disc back without letting the girls watch most of the episodes. After trying the first three episodes and hoping they would go back to the high-quality, child appropriate yet adult savy style we had enjoyed, they were simply mindless violence and disappointing dialogue.

For Batman Beyond, it works, but not for this. Many of the episodes have really lame plots such as 'Holiday Knights' and 'Legends of the Dark Knight,' but what really makes this volume bad is that Batman is more ruthless and much too dramatic for the series, and the Joker beats Harley Quinn much more and much worse than in the previous sets. In volumes 1-3, it was done in comedy, in volume 4, it's done in anger and is way more domestic violence than I'd like it to be. Another problem with this set is that it just jumps straight in with a new Robin in the first episode, with no explanation until the second, and the rest of the story later on.However, I must say that I love one of the new villians - the Creeper. He's hilarious! Overall, I wouldn't recommend this for any price above $20.00. It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New To Batman The Animated Series","review":"I just learned of Batman The Animated series in 2007 and rented the first two volumes through Netflix. They were so good I bought volumes three and four from Amazon. I was terribly disappointed in volume four, because the animation is no where near the quality of the first three volumes, so visually it is not as good. Gone are the shading, shadowing and face definition that made the first three volumes so pretty and compelling to look at. The new format of telling a story fastpaced in 15 minutes takes some getting use to, however would have been ok had the visuals not been compromised. The new Robin is a child and the idea of a child being able to be effective after seeing the young man Robin, took a leap of faith. The one good thing about this set is that the voices remained the same. Unfortunately, I could not get past the third show in this volume and cannot recommend this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"BTAS vol.4","review":"the day when the light shines,december 4th.i hpoe amazon.com will give christmas discounts on this dvd cause it would be cool"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy customer","review":"I bought these DVDs on a Saturday and received them on Monday.

I wonder if they will tackle \\"Batman Beyond\\" next? It would be really nice to see that collected as well.It would've been a nice bonus if they had included the episode of \\"Static Shock\\" where Batman & Robin made a guest appearance on this set as a bonus...I guess it would technically not make sense as it would be out of place, but it is in a way kind of the \\"lost episode\\" of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the four volumes","review":"While I'm not a huge fan of the more \\"cartoony\\" animation style of Vol 4, I thought the storylines in this set were overall the best. There was more of an emphasis on Batman battling supervillains, and less of him fighting organized crime types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For Die-Hard Batman Fans","review":"Otherwise, Seasons 1 - 3 are the ones for you if you want expert animation and great story-writing.

This only for the most die-hard Batman fans IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!!","review":"Absolutely brilliant Batman cartoon! If you love Batman then you're gonna love this.

With a little help from her demented friends, not to mention her own fascinating combination of lust and sociopathology.It's a movie and it's a comic. Either way, this \\"Issue Zero\\" chronicle of Harley Quinn is vastly entertaining with art that holds up to repeated viewings. And major props for the background material, including a loving glance at one pun that didn't quite make the final editorial cut.Harley is enough to make one long to be the Joker."},{"rating":"2","title":"a big bang for the buck","review":"Contrary to the reviewers who thought this was cheap animation, I didn't notice, maybe because it's not my field and I don't examine a work for its state of the art methodology or technology. I took it at face value and it met up with my standards. The sound was even okay. I'm pretty happy with the amount of entertainment wrapped up in this package."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Season of Batman:TAS","review":"I bought this DVD because I remember liking this new version beter than any episode of the last 3 seasons, and they don't air reruns on Boomerang. Let me tell ya, it's worth the money. The costumes of both the villians and the heroes look way better than they did in those older episodes. The episodes are way more actiony, and that's a good thing for an action lover, like myself. Plus, there's one crossover episode called \\"Girl's Night Out\\", where Super Girl and Batgirl team up to defeat Livewire, Poison Ivy & Harly Quin. Some of the best episodes are:-Sins of the Father-Double Talk-Never Fear-Joker's Millions-Old Wounds-Legends of the Dark Knight-Beware the Creeper-Judgement DaySpecial features include:-Commentary-Interactive Arkham Asylum-Languages & subtitlesOn the downside, there's too many episodes with Batgirl. That's the only downside I can think of. This product gets a 4/5. Kudos to WB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best BTAS!!","review":"I've read through many reviews where people state that the early Batman: The Animated Series episodes were the best, and that may be true where story is concerned, but if you're an animation and story fan (not just great story or great animation, one always seemingly sacrificed), this later set of episodes were the best. Personally I always felt the animation in the early BTAS episodes were weak and \\"iffy\\" at best, even if the stories themselves glued you to your seat. However, with these later episodes nothing is sacrificed, as both the story and animation function in great synergistic fashion!I feel that vol.4 will be the best seller of the 4 available. I'm currently being proven correct in that assumption it seems, as I have found this vol.4 at only a smattering of stores, as most are sold out.

I had my BF measured by air plethysmography in a BodPod (expensive research equipment) last summer, when I was heavier / exercised much less, and it was 34.5%, so a bit hard to believe that after shedding pounds and exercising more my BF increased and is nearly 40%.

The scale is consistent only if I put my feet in the exact same position and stand the exact same way every time. I even have to keep my arms in the same place every time to keep it from changing the reading. If I haphazardly step on and off, the reading can change by up to 5 pounds! What good is the tenth of a pound reading when it's five pounds off? Even with all that effort it is still only a consistent weight, not an accurate one. I have weighed myself all over town to compare and the Omron is always off. As far as the body fat monitor, I am 5'3\\" and weigh 128 pounds and it often tells me that I am 32% body fat, which would make me obese. I'd have to be a skin bag of blubber with no bones or organs to be 32% fat at my height and weight.

It's been a great tool for losing fat weight and keeping muscle.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the memory.

It's a nice scale, but the on/off switch broke less than a month out of the box. Here's how to repair it, if you've got a Radio Shack nearby and a soldering iron:1. Open the scale case by removing the 8 Phillips screws on the back.2. Take off the front cover, being careful not to rip out the wires going to the cover.3. Unsnap the outer switch cover from the on/off switch by pushing in the little tabs on the sides.4. Remove the internals of the busted on/off switch by pushing it out from the inside.5. Get a replacement switch from Radio Shack (part no. 275-646, \\"Red Button SPST Pushbutton Switch\\")6. Install the switch, then solder the yellow wires from the old switch onto the new switch.7. Snap the switch cover over the replacement part.8. Screw the case back together.It works now, but it's a stupid thing to have to do to a brand new scale.

I purchased the Omron HBF-400 scales in June, 2009 and by August, 2011, most of the display had stopped functioning, rendering the scale useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted less than 1.5 years","review":"I bought this scale in November of 2009. About a month ago when it started displaying partial numbers, and then nothing. I just changed the batteries and it's still not showing anything. I'm surprised that it's broken considering that I hadn't really used it much at all in the past 6 or 8 months.My experience matches several other reviewers who have had this scale for more than a year, so I wouldn't count on using it for much more than a year.It was pretty good while it lasted though. If you are ok with spending $40 on a scale that lasts less than 2 years, then go for it. No sarcasm intended. I'll probably get something simpler and cheaper, which will hopefully be less prone to breaking down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a while","review":"The scale worked well for about a year, and then became unreliable.Stepping on and off gave readings of more than 1.5 pounds difference.Tossed it and purchased another brand for far less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron","review":"I have been using this product for last one year, and I am very pleased with the performance. Very good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the scale part, but fat percentage way off.","review":"I purchased this scale to replace a simple scale that reflected a different weight every time I stood on it, sometimes with a difference of more than a pound in a matter of seconds.I did not have that problem with this scale. It is very consistent in weight.However, the fat percentages reported are definitely not accurate. It lists my fat percentage as over 30%, which qualifies me as obese. At 5'4\\" and 121 pounds, I am certainly not obese.As some other purchasers mentioned, it is the amount of loss that is important, versus the accuracy of the measurement. But I will have to measure my fat % with calipers or with the help of a professional to find out where I really am on the spectrum. So this part of the scale is really useless for me and I will be returning it. I might as well order a regular scale and calipers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not have Kgs","review":"Although it looks like a solid scale (it is made by Omron, so it should be), it does not have the option for Kgs. Amazon displays this item together with HBF 500 so a lot of comments are addressed towards HBF 500. Thus it was really confusing finding information about the weight units. Also, I think you had to keep pushing the button to turn it on/off, although it could be touch sensitive but i never tried it. I returned it back and bought an Escali scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scale - excellent value!","review":"After a lot of comparison shopping online and in stores, I decided to purchase this model - I am so happy that I did. It is solid, consistent, and very easy to set up. This digital scale provides accurate measurements on a very easy to read screen, and the numbers repeat so you have time to write them down if you're keeping track. This scale has the same features and is just as 'attractive' and solid as the much more expensive you won't regret this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scale","review":"This scale works well to tell you your weight pretty accurately, but the BIA it is inaccurate. It only measures the body fat in your lower body. This is because the current from the electrode goes up one leg and down the other (the path of least resistance). It does not travel though the whole body. I recommend the next model up (the one with the handles) for more accurate reading. BIA devices have a +/- 6% error, but the good thing is that they are consistently wrong, so you can still track your progress if you are trying to lose fat. So, if you are only interested in knowing how much body fat you are losing/gaining (mainly in your lower body), this scale will do just fine. As a woman, having most of my fat in my lower body, this scale is good. Another reason I like this scale is because it is very sturdy compared to the glass scales. The electrode wires are not in any easily damaged location like they are on glass scales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate scale....terrible body fat measurement!","review":"DO NOT buy this scale if you are trying to accurately measure your body fat percentage! I don't know how this scale has managed to recieve such good reviews, it's is horribly inaccurate at measuring anything other than weight. I am a 24 year old ex-college athlete and I exercise/lift weights 7 days a week, yet somehow, according to this scale, I have 27% body fat. I calculated using other methods (tape and calipers) and both reported 9-11%. I only give the scale two stars because it does accurately measure weight. Save your money, buy a less expensive scale and some calipers for a more accurate method of measuring body fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"This product has nice features, but the body fat percentage is not at all accurate. I have a Tanita Body Fat Moniter Scale at home, but wanted this one because it has more features. I have also recently had my body fat tested at the gym. This scale measured me 7 to 8% higher in body fat than both what the gym and the Tanita scale said. Since the gym said I was 14% and Tanita said 13% and this scale said I was 21%, I have to belive this scale is off. I returned it. It is no good to me, since it is not correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost lost my mind","review":"I was excited to receive this product because I workout 6 days a week and wanted to first, know what my body fat was, and second, begin to monitor the progress as I lost it. To my surprise, when I stepped on the scale it said that I had 20% body fat! I went into shock because I am only 180lbs and everyone considers me as a health nut who is in extreme shape. I immediately changed my diet and intake of calories which caused my girlfriend to think that I needed medical attention because I am not fat. Two days later I decided to go to a trainer at my gym and asked him to take my body fat measurements. It was 9%!!! I was relieved but upset at the fact that I paid money for a scale that not only was wrong, but was extremely wrong. I give this product two stars because the weight scale is accurate, but I would not recommend this particular scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Display went bad","review":"Worked great for about year and half.

My loving bride would not get one - okay, I am not saying she needs one so don't go there. The scale looks nice. The multi person function is great.

I am pleased with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"omron scale","review":"This scale is very accurate. My sister's boyfriend has one and she has weighed herself with his and mine and it comes out the same. We've done the ones at the gym and they seem to be off by 2 lbs.

It is also easy to change your settings as needed. The only thing I would change is the power button.

For example, using the Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, my Body Fat Percentage is 20%, but using this scale it reads 30%. Great scale and good for measuring progress in fat loss, but not so good for knowing your actual body fat percentage. I'd buy the hand held version by the same company instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This scale worked fine until the battery that it came with died (1 year). Then it would not reset with a new battery. The readout numbers were scrambled even after I let it sit without batteries overnight. I read them manual and got the numbers to read out properly only after causing it to have an error message. It works, but you can't read the middle number if it's an 8. We still use it, and it seems accurate when compared to the doctor's office, but like all electronic things...."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO accuracy of weight and not to mention about fat measurement","review":"I m really surprised that even the weight measurement is not accurate at all. For example my weight about 135lbs but was reported as 85 lbs. Not to think about the accuracy of fat measurement..Waste my effort and time to order and return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bang for the buck","review":"Omron does a good job with this fat monitor + scale. I was used to their fancy model at the gym that printed out the information ($900). This one was more in my price range and it can memorize up to 3 users. Very helpful for comparing pregnancies. Yes, it remembered my weight info from 2 years from and I compared it the second time around. Looks nice in the bathroom/ washroom also"},{"rating":"2","title":"A better scale","review":"Generally the product delivers on the features. My one gripe is that the manual isn't very intuitive, but navigation of the unit came after some trial and error.Overall it seems to be well made and after using it for about a month I can tell it gives reliable readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change User Hard To See","review":"I found it difficult to change to new user. With my wife and I using this unit we found it hard to change settings. The main difficulty is reading and understanding the setting buttons. You need to bring the unit close to you in order to view and change the buttons. Cannot not see while standing over it, and letters on buttons too small for my eyes. The display number is very large and readable however. Also, be sure you have paper and pencil in hand if you want to log in your numbers to compare with earlier readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it!","review":"I am a physically fit 5'7\\" 155lb Marine who bought this product mainly for my wife mainly on the manufacturer's description; I have to say I am VERY disappointed. The body fat and BMI measurement are totally wrong. Their error margins is about 6-10 error points (off). Simply, you will be miss informed. You are better off going to a fitness center for an accurate check of your weight, BMI, and body fat. My body fat and BMI according to this scale are 19 and 24 respectively. This is way off as the less accurate tape measure method is about 8% body fat; and my gym's computerized pinch method have me in the ball park of 5% body fat and a BMI of about 18.My advice to those looking to buy a sclae is that you look beyond this scale. It is not worth wasting your money on. The only thing it's good for is as a decoration or a place to rest unwanted rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with complicated operation","review":"Had the scale for several months; took too long to read the manual to get this thing to operate.

Yes it is a great scale but you don't have to pay this much money for a great scale.You are paying for a fat \\"Fat Monitor and Scale\\" and the fat monitor portion is faulty. If you come out of the shower and dry off you will get a different reading for fat percentage than if you are dry. You also get a different percentages during the day at the same wieght.The accuracy of this thing is no where near good enough. Not even to tell if you are losing fat. I ended up buying skin fold calipers that are good accuarcy for the price and a I use this scale as a scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"inconsistant results","review":"I weighed myself a total 20 times and compared my results with my inexpensive taylor. This scale was very inconsistant. They were both side by side on a level floor. I followed directions. The omron only gave me two indentical readings out of 20. The taylor gave me 14 readings that were indentical out of 20. The omron was consistantly inconsistant with every reading.It will not give you a fat percentage unless you input your age and hieght. I find that interesting. I have returned this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work; Doctors, Please Do Your Job!","review":"I think I may have been lured by the idea of something that claimed to measure both overall weight and BMI, as I tend to have a lot of muscle. Unfortunately, I may have had too much muscle to get an accurate reading. I didn't exactly consider myself \\"athletic\\" in body type, but I guess I was wrong if I ended up with only a weight measurement after following the instructions as clearly and accurately as i could. I think it might help if there were a more precise description than \\"athletic\\" for my body type, and to be honest I kind of wish that doctors would shed some light on this rather than judge women based on societal standards. Then maybe fewer women would feel the need to weaken themselves just to get the numbers they want.

The scale gets a little unnerving, so I am probably going to either send it back or donate it to someone else whose weight is a little more revealing.

I got weighed at a doc appt and my weight was nearly 4lbs less than what the Omron scale says. My roomate tried it and said she got a different measurement (by at least 3 pounds) each time she got on as well.

The only thing, if you want BMI or Fat percentage, you have to bend down and push two buttons -- which is fine, but they are very small and not real legible so you need to remember which one is you.

I've actually gotten measured at my university fitness club(by caliper) and also at my local ymca where they have the fancy machines that measure your body fat percentage; the difference between the fitness club and ymca is marginal, but the omron scale calculates my body fat % much higher(10%). I've tried taking the batteries out for a while so it can reset and still no luck. My wife uses the scale as well and she has the same issue I do. The weight and BMI measure fine as far as I can tell. I guess the silver lining about the Omron product is that for me the numbers were consistent so you could measure how you are doing compared to last week etc. I just wouldn't trust the actual body fat % number that pops up on the display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as intended","review":"I've had no problems with it. With that said, I don't like is pushing the buttons w/ my toes as it can be a bit tough, but that's probably due to a lack of coordination on my part more-so than the product design.

My scale will read my weight differently by up to 2 pounds, back to back readings (weigh, get off, reweigh). That happens about 50% of the time. The other 50% it stays relatively consistent.Further, I have actually weighed myself, completed 45 minutes of cardio (550 to 580 calories burned), reweighed myself immediately after and gained a pound - almost a half dozen times in 11 days of having the scale. That's phyiscally impossible. When you're trying to lose weight the inaccuracy of this scale is no help. I want to be able to measure the effectiveness of the activities pursued vs what I eat.It's like the scale has two different calibration settings (or zero settings) and randomly selects which one it uses when I turn on the scale.

It is not necessary to wait for all three readings since weight can be obtained by simply skipping one button push."},{"rating":"2","title":"electronic scale","review":"Easy to read, easy to program, seems to be accurate on weight, can't judge accuracy of other funtions, but they do work quickly. Much better than our other scales, and more fun to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"memory is less than hoped for","review":"This item came in a very reasonable amount of time and is fairly easy to use once reading through the manual. The memory function is less than what i had expected it to be, there are only certain intervals that it remembers. Such as the same day entry,7 days ago,14 days,30, 60, and 90, or an entry falling closest to one of the intervals above. Overall a great product i would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate Scale, Body Fat Calculator not even close!","review":"The Omron HBF-500 is a very accurate scale, but when it comes to reading body fat it's way off! It has about a 6% deviation from my calipers and the scale at the gym I use. Although, it is consistent, which I can use to see if there any changes, it's completely off.Overall this a fairly easy machine to use. But for me it's just an over priced scale. Not worth the money in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sufficient scale","review":"I've had my scale for a few weeks now, and it works like a charm. It displays weight, body fat %, skeletal muscle %, BMI, and metabolism (amount of calories your body needs in a day). It supports up to 4 users (you have to enter some personal information like age and gender for the body fat %, etc, to work). It supports anonymous users, but for weight measurements only.All in all, I'm quite happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I am very pleased with this product. Seems to be very accurate and is easy to use.The only complaint I could have about it is that if you dont pick up the hand scanner carefully after weighing yourself it will come up with ERR on the unit and then you have to turn it off and back on again and start the process over.Once you get used to it though it works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken from day one.","review":"From day 1 this product never worked properly. The batteries underneath the scale kept on losing connectivity to the coils so I constantly had to reset them in.

VERY ANNOYING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working in less than a year","review":"Bought this scale last year 2006 because of the excellent reviews. The scale no longer functions and remains at 00 and never changes until turned off.

As other reviewers have advertised, it is not accurate in this regard. It routinely gives errors of up to 10%. There is a big difference between 10& body fat and 20% body fat. The scale should not be sold as a body monitoring scale if it cannot be used for that function."},{"rating":"1","title":"body fat % WAY OFF !","review":"This is a good scale other than the body fat percentage IS way off. I work in a weight loss office and we have a machine that cost thousands of dollars and many hand held units that cost only fifty dollars a piece. Those units (all seven of them) have my body fat at 22%. This machine reads 32%. I also read 22% with the use of calibers. The odds of 8 different methods being incorrect and this machine being right are not good !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Athletes do Not Purchase","review":"Warning to atheletes: This body fat scale does not have the athlete setting. It therefore cannot make the correct assumptions about bone density, etc. to give you an accurate body fat measurement.

I bought this scale and it told me my body fat was a full 10% higher than it actually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate Scale but BLASPHEMOUS Body Fat Calculator","review":"The Omron HBF-500 is not worth your money. Get a good scale and a separate Omron HANDHELD body weight calculator. I admit, the body weight scale is extremely accurate but the body fat percentage calculator is not. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one star.So far, based on a seven-fold calipher test, the HANDHELD Omron device is really on target (plus or minus a tenth of a percentage). The integrated Tanya body weight and body fat scale reports a 4 percent deviation from the two aforementioned methods. The Omron HBF-500 reports an almost 6 percent deviation from the first two aforementioned method.I have had professional testing for my resting metabolism. For my body, the Omron HBF-500 under reported my resting metabolism by 600 calories.Overall, the only thing that is worth wild about this scale is the body weight scale. Nothing else. The extra gagets are not worth the money when the reports are inaccurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"great scale!","review":"It works great! The only problem I have with it is that it is not accurate with percent body fat....at all.

I really love this scale and would recommend it for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate for athletes","review":"I was under the impression I'd be getting a viable means of measuring body fat with this device. I'll be 50 years old at summer's end and have always worked out. When I got my first measurements, I was shocked. The unit indicated I had 25% body fat. Caliper measurements, as well as those calculators wherein you enter height, weight, and a few tape measurements, always indicated results ranging from 12 - 18% body fat. Vanity aside, it is obvious I work out as I have discernable muscularity, including 6-pack abs. Standing 6 feet, weighing 175, and looking like I do, I really wondered if Omron could be accurate. I contacted their support center and was informed that the unit is accurate for 2 out of 3 people and that it wasn't designed for athletes. I'm not sure I understand why that would be so, but that is what they told me. So, if you're already in decent shape, this may not be the product for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"This scale is easy read to read, simple to use. My only issue is that it has to be turned on before standing on it. The power button is simple enough, just press with your toe. I would prefer to just get on it without having to go through the extra step, no matter how minor. Other than that, it's a great scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Inconsistent","review":"This scale is very inconsistent.

And this scale delivered. I put the scale on different floor types to try it out and then got on and off 10 times in each place. Most of the time the scale read exactly the same thing. Only a few times did it read .2 lbs different (which is what the manufacturer claims its accuracy is). So I am very pleased with it. It also has an easy to set up and use way to track your weight, check your body fat, and show your BMI. I'm very happy with this scale. It does everything I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all-in-one scale","review":"This scale works great. The form factor is good and it quickly makes all measurements.

It looks pretty nice, and I like that it gives weight down to the tenths decimal (instead of just the closest whole number). Oddly enough the body fat monitor didn't work when I first got it, then it started working for a few months, then it stopped again. In the end: just don't expect the body fat % feature to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weight only - forget about body fat & BMI","review":"I have had this scale for 7 months. It seems to do a good job of showing my weight. However, it rarely gives anything other than error codes for body fat % and body mass index. I follow all the instructions for set up and use. The only time I get anything other than ERR2 or ERR4 for body fat % or BMI is if I use the scale immediately after stepping out of the shower. I've tried dampening my feet and all the other suggestions but nothing else works.When it does show a body fat %, the number is not even close to being accurate. I have calculated my body fat % using other methods and the Omron doubles the result.I could have gotten a digital scale for weight only for a lot less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"For a price not much more than a digital scale that just shows weight, this scale \\"does it all.\\" Other reviewers have described in great detail this scale's features.

If you want to track your measurements keep a small notebook handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for us","review":"The Omron HBF-400 scale was easy to set up for two of us, with a little focus and patience. Follow the instructions - they will get you through it. Even if all you want is weight (and no set up), trying to use it without understanding the order of the displayed info could be frustrating, true for any digital multi-function scale.

NOT COOL.I am currently slightly over 6'2\\" and work out on a daily basis.

You power it on, wait for it to start and then press the user button to choose which user you are. This scale gives the option to have up to 4 people keep track of their weight and body mass index.In order for the scale to work you must be barefoot (preferably naked given your clothes add weight). It seems to give an accurate reading, more accurate than the standard dial kind of scale, and is much easier to read.Just make sure you know your height prior to inputting your information as you need to have an accurate height input in order to get an accurate body mass index reading.Worth the money if you want to watch your weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There must be a lot of product quality issues for this scale to evoke such a love/hate response among reviewers. I also found the scale to be neither consistent or accurate. Each step on the scale comes up with a different weight measurement, none of them matching the scale at the doctors office. The fat measurements also bounced around and were at least 5 % higher than the number from the fitness trainer. I carefully followed the directions that came with the scale to produce the most accurate results- all except the disclaimer that the fat measurements may not be accurate for a post-menopausal woman. The assumptions programmed into the scale must be wrong for a lot of people! Fortunately the HoMedics version of the scale works for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality scale","review":"Bought this scale to replace one I've had for more than 3 years that started acting up. One thing I was not impressed with this Omron is the idea I have to push a button to start it. The old one I had, when I stood on it, it turned on automatically. The Omron, when I turn it on, it starts self calibrating, I guesss that's to make it more accurate, then again, that's why you have to push the button as I said earlier. But, overall, I am impressed with this unit and the build quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, works as advertised","review":"I bought the body fat monitor and scale to help me track my progress with 4-Hour Body.

Have you ever had a scale where you cannot manually readjust it for an accurate reading? You can't do it with this scale. Omron's suggestion for correcting high or low readings is to make sure the scale is on a hard surface. That's it.

I use it to record notes while driving for later use, and in meetings to review in detail those items that may not have been noted with the conventional pad and pen. The 90 minute time limit should be able to last through most meetings. The stand alone unit is small and fits into a pocket easily, and will detach and insert into the Visor readily, notations about content can be attached to \\"tracks\\" when in the Visor. I have tried using the Total Recall with only the built-in mic for recording music at a concert, and must say, it recorded the sounds, but this type of recording is better left to an MP3 type unit. I view my purchase of the Total Recall as a sound investment for my intended use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, needs finishing.","review":"While this is a great idea the execution is somewhat lacking. There are a lot of minor issues which pile up to really weaken the product. One, for example, is that the software fails to disable the \\"auto off\\" feature of the visor when appending an already existing recording. I lost about 5 important recordings before I figured this problem out.The standalone feature is more or less useless to me because it only records at high quality in this mode, limiting recording time to 15 mins. Also there is no way to delete tracks in standalone, so once the recorder is filled up you can do nothing with it until you can get it into your visor.One more thing to beware of is that if you use a serial hotsync cradle your synchronization time will be approx 15 to 20 minutes when the recorder is full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, engineered poorly.","review":"Good: plenty of memory for recordings, easy integration with Hot Sync, nice standalone size. Bad: easy to misrecord, notes are time stamped when plugged into Visor not when recorded, big battery drain, Palm software sluggish and cumbersome. Better use of your money to buy a different gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus Total Recall Recorder","review":"I have 3 Handspring Visors (Deluxe, Prism, Platinum), and I find it useful to be able to turn any one of them into a dictation machine. For the most part, I tape small notes to myself. This is very convenient when I'm shopping in a store or taking notes from doctors about my mother's condition. She's 86. I use the Targus Recorder in any situation where it is awkward to try to enter data on the Visor manually."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware: fine print on box - transfer to PC req Win 98 or 00","review":"On the side of the box:\\"Voice Desktop Application to transfer you recording to your PC.

After doing the normal uninstall/reinstall with no results, I wrote Targus. I also asked about the fine print noted above. They recommended I upgrade my Handspring OS, which I did, but to no avail. Customer Service was responsive, but ultimately unable to help me solve this problem. They eventually sent me a new \\"Total Recall\\". However, this time neither the stand alone power source nor the actual recorder worked. Unless you have Windows 98 or 2000, you might end up wasting a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool item but didn't work!","review":"This is a very cool item. It's fucntional and nicely designed. Sounds good but I couldn't get it to work with my Visor Deluxe. Customers service was fair via email. They got back to me within 24 hrs each time but in the end they couldn't help-but to get them to admit it I had to pointedly ask. They just had no idea why it didn't work for me. I reinstalled the supplied software and the Palm desktop multiple times with no luck.So, I wouldn't suggest anyone buy this item until they can get it to function properly-or you give it a try and make you can return it for a full refund. :( Very disappointed here."},{"rating":"2","title":"This harley blanket rocks!!","review":"I bought this blanket for my best friend as a Christmas present and she LOVES it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No esta conpleta no la compren","review":"La novela no esta entera comienza adelantada y Los capitulos ban cortados no se le entiende no la compren no gasten su dinero"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair buy, but too many cut out scenes.","review":"Rubi is by far my favorite novela, but I was disappointed to notice that way to many scenes had been edited out of this dvd. So much so, that at times it's difficult to keep up with what is happening. You will notice this especially if you compare an episode from the dvd with the ones featured on youtube. Of course the main scenes were not cut out, but it's always nice to see what happened prior to the big moments. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying this product, but be aware of the many edits.

It brings three dual layered discs. Six sides total. Over 7 hours. Many parts are edited from the soap opera but it is still quite watchable. It also has english subtitles. Some nice extras as well. My biggest gripe all the discs were loose moving freely inside and got scratched alot due to it. Also noticed the audio track raises up and lowers down at times. Might be due to the scratches on the disc. The discs should be secured better inside the box they came in. Now I have to get an exchange for them.

The show was great and the DVD dosen't come far behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubi, la descarada","review":"This is arguably one of the best telenovelas of 2004. The story follows Rubi, a poor, beautiful yet ambitious young woman who stops at nothing to get love and, most importantly, money. By schemes and lies, Rubi finally marries a wealthy man, Hector. Yet she cannot forget the one she truly loves, Alejandro. Rubi finally sees that material things are not as important as true love, goodness and kindness. Yet she denies her wrongdoing and, in the end, her evil ways drive her to disaster and misery.If you like telenovelas (Spanish soap operas) then you will love this one. The story line is refreshing and bittersweet.EDIT: One important piece of information pertaining to this DVD. It does cut the story line considerably, since the makers TELEVISA do this to all their telenovelas on DVD. Yet the story is still coherent."},{"rating":"2","title":"telenovela enthusiast","review":"I'm now pretty keen to watch and enjoy Rubi as a main character in a telenovela thanks to all those enticing reviews. It's going to be pretty interesting to watch a character causing so much wretchedness around. Since I also had doubts about the length of this \`telenovela', it was a reassurance to learn from the DVD's cover that this DVD comes with 3 double sided discs playing 700+ minutes instead of only 1 disc playing only 74 minutes, which it wouldn't make sense after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubi","review":"Rubi is severly cut in all duration of the movie.

I ordered this for the english subtitles and Im new to telenovelas and Rubi was the first one I had really tried to keep up with. When I received the DVD in the mail and started to watch it I noticed it was very chopped up from editing and some of the parts I really liked and wanted to know what was said was missing. Also I noticed some of the other good actors were not shown much.

This a good story but when they were editing they missed a lot of the what makes the main character do the things she does. I used to watch the series. When Rubi moved to Cancun there were a lot of real good outdoor shots they cut out. There wasn't enough good shots of surporting characters. I mean were at the beach! I would like the bonus material to be a lot more interesting. I think the production company rushed to get it out. Too bad if the ending was done right their could have been a sequel or two.

The book measures just 6.5\\" X 4\\". It has less than 43 pages of actual information if you include the glossary (which has a total of 13 words). On average, each page addresses 2 topics. The information is generally sound, but little explaination is given as to why one should do such and such. The subject of finances is for teenagers, but if your teenager is going to college, he won't be impressed by this book. But what really got me going was the [price] retail price! I would price it more like [cheaper price]. Having said all of the above I would like to still encourage readers to continue to buy and read books by Mr. Burkett.

He has merely lifted the explanatory text from the textbook and put it together as a hornbook. Furthermore, if you are looking for help on Secured Credit, there are other books that work much harder to make it understandable to the novice. \\"Understanding Article 9\\" is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for young kids","review":"This is an excellent book on teaching kids about prayer. It deals with questions kids ask about prayer such as how do you sit, where do you pray, and what words should you use. It uses simple words small kids understand but does a great job of explaining the answers. Pictures are cute and colorful. I highly recommend this book if you want to teach your kids about prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful book","review":"I love the Mary Frances' books and this one is just as delightful as the other two (one on sewing and one on cooking). The books start out as a story about a little girl whose needles and yarn come alive (a note: I don't see a shred of racism in the book like another reviewer suggested - the yarn is dark-colored and is called mammy, is that a bad thing? She is an adorable ball of yarn, and very helpful to Mary Frances, who adores her).The needles and yarn teach the young girl, Mary Frances, how to crochet first, then knit. Illustrated drawings and photographs are sprinkled throughout the book. The instructions and illustrations are so clear that I am able to use this book with my young eight-year-old daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist, and not so good on the knitting, either","review":"While the concept of this book is charming- the wool, needles and hooks come alive to teach little Mary Frances to knit and crochet- the reality is less charming. The knitting and crocheting instruction is basic and there are many other books out there that are more useful. The book, written in the early part of the last century, is flawed by racist content. Instructions for making a yarn baby and a \\"Mammy\\" doll are fairly offensive. I would hesitate to use it in any setting that involved children, unless you need a jumping off point for a discussion about racisim. If it's knitting for children you are after, than I suggest one of the many other fine books that have been written to meet this need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much mystery","review":"After reading Shield Of Justice I couldn't wait to read another book by Radclyffe, but this book is nothing more than a book of timid lesbian sex disguised as a mystery. I love lesbian erotica, lesbian love stories and just about anything lesbian as long as the book is honest about what kind of book it is. To call this book a mystery is stretching it. Give me Ellen Hart or J.M. Redmann or Gerri Hill anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a thriller","review":"I had hoped this would be a thriller where the main character just happens to be a lesbian, not being gay 24/7. Well, no such luck. Every woman in this book seems to be gay, which is really believable. Not. I'm all for having more lesbians as heroines but you can over-do it.I'm under the impression the crime, which happens to be set in the red-light-milieu, is only an excuse for a sex scene every other page. There is no atmosphere at all, the characters are bland and the crime story itself pretty boring, so in the end you really don't care who's the bad guy. A bit more of a backstory would have been nice.The couples are constantly in bed and over each other. Sorry, but I can't help the feeling I'm reading fanfiction. I really don't get why this series is so highly praised. If you want to read about sex scenes between women, this book is for you but if you're expecting a captivating thriller, avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated to have the series end","review":"I'm so glad the issues over the music was settled to we could get Designing Women on DVD!!

When I read this book, all through-out it I was wondering 'when is this going to be over?' I found this book dull, because nothing ever happened. I'm more into adveture books, but I thought I'd try a classic. This book is for anyone who likes slow books. I thought it would get more exciting towards the end, but it didn't. I feel the author explained things well, but the story bored me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clarification regarding this edition","review":"This edition (Viking, 1996, illustr. by Rozier-Gaudriault, series=The Whole Story) is *not* abridged. In fact, it is the unabridged version of the first volume of Spyri's two books about Heidi. The margins (ala DK books) have pictures and explanations about the period, including period pictures and photographs of Frankfort in the 1880s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Tale","review":"I received a beautiful, hardbound, colorfully illustrated copy of Heidi (Children's Classics) when I was just a girl. I had broken my hip in an accident with my horse and my great-aunt sent it to me to read while I recovered. Unfortunately, I never read it then. But I cherished the book and packed it with me every time I moved.Now, as a mother to three young girls, we chose Heidi as our bedtime read the last few months. We all enjoyed every word as I read this delightful and inspiring tale aloud to my girls. I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity and sweetness of Heidi and the goodness of the characters throughout the book. The idea that one little girl can touch so many hearts, is a lovely reminder of the goodness of children.I also liked the frequent mention and gratitude for a loving Heavenly Father and the blessings He gives. I'm glad that I finally took the time to read this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heidi- the reveiw","review":"This book was very interesting. It is about an orphan girl who is sent away to live with her Grandfather in the alms. She is very happy there making lots of friends. Then she is taken away by her mean aunt to be a playmate with a rich girl; who she later makes bossum friends with. But she returns after being incrediaby homesick. The ending is very happy and uplifting, also my favorite part. Everyone should read this book because it is a VERY VERY good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the whole story it ISN\\"T (for the whole story edition only)","review":"Beware. This is a great edition of Heidi, annotations in the margins and a very nice translation and easy to read and read out loud. BUT...this is ONLY HALF OF THE STORY. It is NOT the whole story, as ironic as that seems. Unknown to me, Heidi was published in two volumes and this edition only includes the first half of the entire story of Heidi - arriving on the Alp, going to Frankfort and returning home. and that's where it spits you out. I found this so ironic because it is the \\"whole story\\" edition. It made me laugh but not while I was sitting in Switzerland trying to read the story to my kid. Very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best edition","review":"I decided to read Heidi with my 9 year old, but thought the unabridged version might be too long and drawn out for her to sit through. Thought this one would be great, but I was wrong. It was extremely simple and actually had many spelling errors. This version is probably better for a 7 year old. It also omitted alot of important themes in the book. For example, this book completely overlooked Peter's jealousy of Clara. IT was a short and simple summary. Nothing compares to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still enjoying it as a young adult","review":"I first read Heidi a slightly watered down, but beautifully illustrated abridged children's edition I received as a Christmas gift when I was about 8. I've read it more than any other of the 10 books in that collection. I received an 1915 copy of the \\"original\\" text (unabridged English)a year or two later and devoured it just as readily. I re-read it frequently (I'm now 16) and find something different within it every time. The subtle humor, Heidi's endearing antics, the moving spiritual element (God is GOOD!) and the beautifully crafted relationships are simply amazing.I cringe at some books I read while babysitting--Watered down, overly silly and frankly stupid books. While I can't admit to having read nothing but classics, I think there is a huge need for my generation to love classic children's literature like Heidi."},{"rating":"2","title":"The excellent story review","review":"Heidi is a very good book.

None has worked, they all go bad within days. Very poor quality control, even worse customer service. In three years mine has never worked correctly. Now I have been waiting since January for my third amplifier replacement, and unfortunately all emails go unanswered, and their voicemail inbox is full.

I watch this film on average once every week or two and it is as stunning at the 20th viewing as at the first. The ensemble performances by the four actresses, the matchless cinematography by Sven Nykvist, and the emotions evoked by Bergman's script make for a peerless film experience. One viewing of Cries and Whispers will up the ante in your film repertoire. Cannot possibly recommend this enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman's World","review":"This is an expose of the feelings women have when they are by themselves or in a stifling relationship. All of these women are gentle creatures who have formed an alliance for themselves. Their husbands are unable to understand the agonies their wives go through. The man is aloof in this picture. Bergman has always understood women and shown them as the agonized yet nurturing angels of all of our dreams. One of the women goes mad when she can't feel and resorts to pain for sensation. Her husband sees her performing this act and merely shrugs and walks out the door. Such power in a film is very gripping to the viewer. The best I can say is that this film blows away the mind and gives it meat for thought. Bergman succeeds again."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious bergman crap","review":"One of those dreadful Bergman flicks that all the trendy pseudo-hip types have to rave about to their friends. Watching it was like having someone pull your toenails out with a pair of rusty pliers. \\"Oh, the guilt\\" definitely was the funniest line."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite Bergman","review":"Really didn't think this movie was as convincing and gut wrenching as most of Bergman's films. He does happen to be in my top list of directors, but this movie just didn't blow my mind. The chemistry of the actresses just wasn't there. It didn't achieve the amount of misery i expected because it simply is not bergman at his finest. I even could consider it a bit boring. I story line sounds wonderful, the movie itself...not quite there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Poorly acted. Weak plot. The movie description led me to believe there would be something to watch here. Expensive lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me want to scream","review":"This is one strange movie. Two sisters wait in a beautiful 19th-century mansion as the third sister is dying in the bed chamber. The dying sister is the artist of the family and is friendly with Anna, the maid, who \\"nurses\\" her when she is in distress. Sister #2 is having an affair with an indifferent doctor. Sister #3 is a frigid, unloving wretch who inexplicably puts broken glass into...ell, never mind. How any of this makes sense is beyond me.I picked this up to get \\"spouse points\\" with my wife, but ended up in the negative column. It'll take two viewings of \\"The Sound of Music\\" to begin to make up for what I lost watching this weird piece of cinema.But, if you're a Bergman fan, your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Achievement","review":"Cries and Whispers is an intense mediation on life, death, and how we squander our brief lives by succumbing to our inner demons. The Criterion edition is flawless, but if I remember correctly, some scenes seem to be missing or shortened. But no matter, this is a harrowing exploration of the depth of human pain, brilliantly created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"CRIES AND WHISPERS is one of my three favorite films of all time. I am a huge film fan, but this of all things is one of my favorites. It affects me in ways I can't even articulate. The power, the horror, the beauty, the strangeness of this film is unheard of. It exists in another dimension, I think. Anyway, I was ecstatic to hear that it was coming to DVD from Criterion. A commentary track might have been nice, but the hour-long interview with Bergman was a nice feature. I had never seen him other than in photos and it was interesting to actually see and hear him talk, although I would have liked to hear more details about his films. Anyway, the print of the film looks beautiful and it was great to see this wonderful film after several years. It's just as wonderful as the first time I saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much, much too expensive","review":"As D. Smith says, the 1.5l bottles of Evian normally retail for about $2.20 a bottle.

Keyes is back after 2 duds!","review":"I almost didn't want to read Keyes's new novel after I skimmed through Angels and Sushi for Beginners. But I highly enjoyed it and as with previous Keyes novels, could not put it down. The end chapters kind of dragged, however, so I skimmed through those, but all in all, I'd recommend this book for summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What story?","review":"This book is written in separate sections that address three different female characters. All the characters have a connection with the publishing world, whether it be as a writer or an agent. It would be a stretch to say that their stories are really connected much in any way.While reading this book, I got the distinct impression that Keyes sat down to write this without really having a plot in mind. The book teters on boring up until the end, when some things actually happen. Whatever story actually lies in this book is nearly so inexistant that I wondered what the point of anything was. I have liked some other of Keyes' books though; I would recommend Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho-hum until the last chapter or two","review":"Took me forever to read this. It just wasn't really a page turner for me, so I would set it down and not come back to it for weeks at a time.

I found it dragging and read the end just to see what happened. Having forgotten the general plot, I starting re-reading this when I ran out of books last week. I was really drawn in this time and got through to the end cheering everyone on.I will say that the character of Lily is a bit of a snore, and skipping some of her sections did not get me off track with the plot.I like that one of the characters does not end up with 'her man'. It gave the story a little more credibility. Though \\"they all lived happily ever after\\" is compelling, I think it leaves things a little edgier and real when this doesn't happen.Happy endings do abound though. This book isn't dark or depressing (with the exception of some of Lily's pieces)and you will find yourself chuckling regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Marian Keyes!","review":"I was anxiously awaiting this book, as it had been too many months since I finished the most recent Marian Keyes novel.

(Watermelon) But put this book on your list be read as well. It's charming and interesting.The characters are relatable. Although for me, a little less Gemma would have earned the novel 5th star!

It's really hilarious. But please, don't buy this book waiting for a serious, profound, wise plot - no, no, nothing like this... I liked reading it because I didn't take it seriously. Still, the most outrageous mistake of the book was to treat infidelity with \\"glamour\\", as if this kind of behaviour (cheating a wife/husband) is a right thing to do in life and even something luxurious and glamorous!!

This one--not so much. I found none of the characters particularly likeable; nor did they have any of the kindness and ironic view of life that her other characters did. When the negative things happen, it isn't so much of a surprise. What goes around, comes around indeed.

Lily Wright stole Gemma boyfriend Anton and now she has Gemma boyfriend and the writing career that Gemma always wanted. Jojo Harvey is an american living in London working as literary agent, who is having affair with married boss. But soon these three woman lives are going to meet and who knows who will be left standing.I was really looking forward to this book, but I really didn't like it.

Keyes used to be on this list, but I just can't get through her stuff anymore. Since ANGELS, I find it too long, too trite, and too unengaging -- everything that people accuse chyck lit of but that Keyes used to transcend. I think I'm done with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as usual","review":"She's done it again! Written a book that one minute has you laughing out loud and the next crying your eyes out.

I am definitely recommending this book to everyone I meet.Thank you Marian Keyes for writing, please don't ever stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"life mimicking art","review":"In Ireland, Gemma Hogan's Dad leaves his 35 year marriage to shack up with his secretary, & her Mam falls apart. Gemma harbors a lot of rage: at Mam for being so helpless, with her Dad for running away & with her bestfriend for stealing her man. & now Lily is a bestselling author.Lily Wright is haunted by stealing Anton from Gemma. Now she's in London, struggling with poverty & motherhood until she sits down one day & writes a good book.Jojo Harvey, ex-New York copper & now a London literary agent, takes Lily's book & runs with it...straight to the bank & the bestseller lists.Rebeccasreads recommends THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY as a cross between a comedy & a tear-jerker with often infuriating episodes as each woman stumbles over obstacles to happiness as they grasp the brass rings of fame, make & lose fortunes, love & lose relationships. Lots of ribald language, sex, booze & mishaps, with womanly drama & danger galore...& neatly done resolutions!A rollicking good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brill!","review":"I am a major fan of Marian Keyes. Lucy Sullivan was the best book ever and as a result I plagued people til they read it and they weren't sorry!!! The Other side of the Story is without a doubt up there with Luch Sullivan. I just couldn't put the book down. Ten out of ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Britishisms","review":"Well-written chick-lit full of those delightful British phrases that give the brain a boost. Authors of American popular fiction use the same adjectives, phrases and idioms to the extent that even an new book can be predictable. While the plot here is somewhat predictable, it's the writing that makes it fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I really liked it, a feel-good book that keeps you interested all the way. I found the first part about JOJO a little confusing at first, but it all came together nicely afterwards.Great book to read and own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but different from other books","review":"I like many of you have read most of Marian's books. (I feel the same as many of you about Under the Duvet too.) This latest book was pretty good - although did not make me laugh like the last ones. I was kind of looking for a quick read but instead this was more of a \\"mature\\" story. No laughs, but a good story nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"the other side of the story","review":"I have read some of Marian Keyes books before, so I expected this book to be good, but it is so much better than that! The book is long, but you cannot put it down, and at the end you wish it was 1,000 pages instead of its mere 650.Great character development, esp. w/ Lily. One of those characters that you hate right off the bat, until you read their side of the story. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when we get to the other side","review":"ZZZZZZZZZ...morning already? Yikes,this book was a snore. I have recently decided to give up finishing books, even by authors I love, when they put me to sleep rather than lull me there. Too many of today's \\"chick-lit\\" authors have run out of gas without a filling station in sight. Time to find some new, fresh voices out there in Bookland, I guess... I hope they ARE out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is fantastic!

Fabulous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am usually a fan of chick lit books, but this was was very boring. I had trouble picking it up again once I put it down, and the only reason I got through to the end was because I needed something to read on a couple of flights. Needless to say, the book didn't make it back home with me. The characters were much too predictable and full of cliches, the plot lines were boring. The story dragged on for way too long.The three women in this book had no dimension and the author failed to paint an interesting and captivating story for any of them. Don't waste your money on this one unless you're buying it used off of Amazon for a few cents. I have enjoyed some of the other books by Keyes, but this one fell very flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I didn't even finish this book. I don't like to leave a book, but for some reason, I was very bored and just couldn't get into this one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book","review":"I was excited to get the book and then my heart sank when I saw that it had short emails in the text and other gimmicky chick-lit stuff. As I began reading, I thought the characters were vain and self-absorbed. Some things were bizarre, like a character who keeps a wallet on the nightstand to talk to. And the running joke about advertising for Clinique was annoying and worn thin very, very quickly. However, toward the end of the book, the author had me thinking about life in general and when the book was over, I cried for about 20 minutes. Not because it was sad, but because it really made me think. And it reminded me what a good book is really all about. So if you think it's shallow when you're partway through, give it a chance. I think it will surprise you by its unexpected depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up!","review":"Imagine losing the love of your life to a trusted friend. Now imagine that \\"friend\\" becoming an overnight sensation in the literary world. Next, imagine while in the midst of your pity party, your dad just ups and leaves your mom for a younger woman and your mom refuses to get out of bed until he returns. These are just a few of the catastrophies that occur in Gemma's life.Meanwhile, Lily (the man-stealing fiend) is not having as great a time as Gemma imagines. For one thing...she's losing her hair. Yes, premature female balding--on the crown of her head. She's also made a very bad investment on a home and the man she snagged can't earn a decent living. But, the reader does get to hear Lily's side of the story.So where's the humor? There's thigh-slapping (wake up your sleeping hubby) bursts of laughter on practically every page. The Other Side Of The Story is a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPREME","review":"Kept you wanting more. Great reading something everyone will enjoy and relate to in some way."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated.","review":"I found the characters, despite being on different \\"sides\\" of the story, to be unlikeable. I struggled to empathize as all of the female characters had a tendancy to revel in their own depression and patheticness. We all have struggles, I didn't find these characters' lives particularly aweful or challegngin.I prefer a stronger, more self motivated and positive heroine. The ending was somewhat predictable and unsatisfying. I finished it purely out of obligation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and terribly boring","review":"I finished this book simply because I hate giving up on a book partway through. I acknowledge that my frustration is my own fault for not just letting go and putting the book down.\\"The Other Side of the Story\\" was painfully slow to start up. The first, oh, ten? chapters were so incredibly boring, full of cliche and faux-quirk that I thought I might throw the book out the window. As I plowed through, what the author intended as quirkiness for her characters (and never managed to pull off) became either flat-out boring, ridiculous, or borderline insane.I really enjoyed a few of Marian Keyes' other books, and I had hoped to like this one, but it was a massive waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very quirky","review":"Marian Keye's has a very chatty writing style. You feel as if she's having a casual conversation with you. This book, got my attention from the very first sentence,its all about the irony's of life, and the ups and downs of the world.Three ladies whose lives are intertwined, you can never pick who's your favourite, the man stealer who can't forgive herself. The fanciful Gemma who can't get over her ex, or busty Jojo that you can't help wishing you looked a little bit like.Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guarenteed laughter...","review":"...but despite the humor, The Other Side of the Story is a book that will make you think as you fall into the stories of three women, tied through books and love.Jojo, a brilliant, driven woman who despite her best intentions falls for a married man...her boss.Gemma, a party planner with a past...a lost love. Add to her own heartbreak, her father's left her mother and she's the one who has to pick up the pieces.Lily, Gemma's ex friend who stole Gemma's boyfriend by accident. She didn't set out to fall in love with him. But the heart doesn't always allow us a choice.Three women, three loves, three paths that intertwine and intersect makes for an insightful, funny brilliant story but a master storyteller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow writer","review":"I have been a fan of Marian Keyes since \\"Lucy Sullivan...\\" years ago. I wait for her books and get so excited when a new one drops. I LOVE The Other Side of the Story! Life is not one big happy circle of \\"boy meets girl, they fall in love, yada yada yada\\". I love that Keyes heroines are somewhat tortured and do plenty of human things (such as have affairs and cry for no good reason). I think this book hits the right spot, Keyes keeps us entertained, but not conned, because life really is like this. My only complaint is that she can't write 3 books at once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Patrizio","review":"I just recently purchased this DVD and it exceeded my expectations.

I think it would be ok if you have other or multiple lights like on a path along a wall. But if you're going to use it as your \\"porch light\\" it should be the back porch and it should be mounted rather low. Otherwise you may be disappointed. It's kind of small and non-impressive so using it as main entry light I would not recommend. Also, most bulbs will tend to be seen from the bottom. It's too short. And most of the light will be from the bottom. The photo shown WILL NOT happen. The bottom of the fixture will be lit brightly, while the top panes of glass will get little light. Overall, even though I give it a 3, I find it to be typical junk you find nowadays. I bought an arts and crafts style light at Lowe's for $65 and like it MUCH more.

Heidi teaches this child an important lesson about life and at the same time unravels a complex family secret.Spyri's works were simple and strong, and their goodness and sweetness shone through the pages. Tritten is not nearly as talented as a writer, and his sequels are a sad distortion of the characters. He cakes on religion and sentimentality and uses that as plot.

I'm not kidding, this is all there is to the book. No American who knew what was going on (by his admission) would talk to him, and the Afghanis who knew what was going on gave him their boilerplate PR spiel. You would learn more about the latest afghani war by watching the network news sound bites, and MUCH more by reading the reportage and think pieces that came out of Afghanistan from NYT, Washington Post, and LA Times (hey guys, what about an anthology of this stuff?).

Tim is a person who does not want to record what he has to say and who, although nearly everyone knows the imminent danger intuitively and disregards it, chooses to look himself in the mirror and recognizes the horror of both what he has done and not done. Yet we don't care when Katrina acknowledges his shallowness despite his hand upon her cheek. Since we don't care about Tim, how are we to care whether Peter ever found him?

First of all it's very difficult to pull back on the string that sets the dancer to fly. The hand held base is very flimsy and sounds like a childs rattle when you shake it. The toy is dangerous because if you release it towards someone it could hurt their eye or eyes. After about 10 launches the beetle grip came off the string and the string disappeared into the launcher; my daughter cried for an hour!

At first I had fun playing around and shooting it in the air, but then it would drop and either break something or hurt someone, so I was forced to play it outside, where it got very dirty (ick!) Also, the wings on my doll were foamy, and they wore down. They weren't removable, so this doll couldn't be used for playing with barbies or anything. She pretty much spins in the air and voila, that's it! That's all she does! When I was a kid, I got bored after a day it's been rotting in my toybox since. Oh, and know why the SkyDancers are the plain janes of the doll universe? Because they don't have long, beautiful hair to comb, and their faces are as plain as those of a Happy Meal Barbie.

Let me quote a recent article by the Director of Research at the National Endowment for the Arts lamenting the decline of reading, especially among boys: \\"Both boys and girls are unlikely to choose books based on an 'issues' approach, and children are not interested in reading about ways to reform society.\\" Why hasn't the Newbery committee figured this out?

I really enjoyed the book. With the style the author uses to narrate the story (first person and child-like rambling), its believable that a child is actually telling the story.However, I have to agree with the previous review. It's definitely not for children, but for young adults. (It would be an excellent book to read in a Middle/High school class and use as a tool for class discussion on prejudice, family, death, religion, etc.)And I really found nothing humorous about the book (one of the review said it was homorous), but rather compassionate and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I expect more from a book with this great award.

This book is not deserving of a Newbery medal. Beware of buying this book for your children and for the school library. A Newbery medal is not a mark of approval. This book is only chosen by a dozen member of the committee without critical background and literary sophistication. This book is not deserving to be in the ranks of classic Newbery books like \\"The Giver\\", \\"Tale of Despereaux\\", \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\", \\"A Wrinkle in Time,\\" and \\"A View from Saturday\\". Beware of kid's reviews and blind supporters of the author for they are the victims of veneration withour understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"I did like reading this book very much. The story was real. It was well written and I was hooked. I agree that it contains some topics that may be better for older kids- 5th grade and middle school.I was surprised, however, that it is a Newberry winner. I just didn't think it was an amazing, memorable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching story","review":"\\"Kira-Kira\\" is not like most other books; instead of a linear narrative with a clear plot, conflict, climax, and resoloution, this story reads in a more sprawling, nonlinear way. I had heard that it felt like a memoir, and this is definitely true; the first-person narrative only adds to the feeling. Yet still, as main character Katie recounts her life as a young Japanese American growing up in Georgia in the early '60s, the events along the way are at times very funny, often sad, and always captivating. The main theme is Katie's relationship with her sister Lynn, as the two girls alternately come together and drift apart, but \\"Kira-Kira\\" also touches on poverty, discrimination, and coming of age. It's a wonderful book, whether you're looking for a meaty read for younger kids or a breezy one for teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY- A BOOK THAT MUST READ","review":"Kira- Kira is a book that once I picked it up, I couldn't stop reading. Even if it is a bit depressing, it shows great character from the family and bravery through out the whole book.

I've read far more interesting books. Sure, it had a nice ending. It's important to note, though, the difference between the recommended ages (11-14) and the Accelerated Reader level of 4.7.

The author has great descriptions, and I felt like I could relate to the characters. Of course, there's the younger sister who wants things to stay the same, and the older one who just changes with time. This is one of those books that truly makes you cry. People call some books tearjerkers, when they aren't all that sad. But this book ... it made me cry and think. It gave me a different outlook on things. Life is short. This book will remind you of that. I recommend this one. It'll show you that there can be sad endings, but all in all, your world can still be kira-kira (shining)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enlightning book","review":"I am sometimes a little aprehensive about Newberry Award winning books because frequently they do not live up to the hype. However, I really enjoyed reading this book. It gave a lot of information as to what it was like to be a Japanese immigrant in the United States.

I teach in the middle school and believe this book will really appeal to my young female readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"That Newbery award is not Kira-Kira","review":"If you've ever read a real Newbery book, you can see that Kira-Kira is one of the hugest dissapointments ever. The plot is dull, long and can get very boring. i usually like Newbery books, but this was terrible. Kira Kira was surely a book that should have won the Newbady award. Of course, i really liked that rare relationship between Katie and Lynn, but I hated Lynn for going off with Amber and Gregg. Kira-Kira is anything but glittering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Newbery Caliber","review":"The story is well-written, but there is a large amount of prose that I don't think a lot of children will stick with. There are also some heavy themes of sickness, peer pressure, and prejudice. Also, parents and teachers, be careful before you choose this one for a read aloud or as a novel to teach. There are numerous, and known, curse words that will have your children and students looking at you like, \\"Why'd you choose this one for us to read?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Love it From the Start","review":"Kira-Kira will blow you away! This book is so great, you'll love this book and want to pass it on to friends and fam.

In the beginning of Kira-Kira - Katie & Lynn have so much fun together. Then their mother has a baby boy and names him Sammy. In the middle of the story, Lynn gets really sick, Katie & Sammy have to take care of her & sleep on the living room floor.I loved this book you will too.

I can understand why some people would like this book and I respect their opinions but I just can't enjoy this book. Maybe it was how I was reading it but I never was really sad about anything that happened. It was a well written book but, to me, there was nothing to keep me motivated to read or excite me.Maybe I'm just not getting the point but for one reason or another I just didn't find anything at all special in this book. I feel that \\"Wenny has Wings\\" by Jan Lee Carey is a much better book that also relates to the feeling potrayed in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Newbery failure","review":"Okay, I don't get it, how the Newbery Committee comes up with its winners. This book is long, dull, and grinding. I'm angry about this selection. The writing is nice, but writing doesn't make a story. I can say that I read two to three books that should've won EVERYTHING, unlike this one. Most of all, The Willoughby Spit Wonder, by Jonathon Fuqua, is funny, sad, uplifting, and an absolutely great work that should be in every bookstore. Come on, isn't the Newbery supposed to find works for young adults, not adults? They need to do their work and find books that excite us. Kira-Kira doesn't. So, go out and find your own masterpieces. I've found mine and highly recommend it.

I think people will find a story told from this viewpoint quite refreshing and even an eye opening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very kira-kira","review":"I've read many of the Newbery award books. I've loved them all-until Kira-Kira. It's the story of a poor Japanese family who move from Iowa to Georgia so their parents can work. The parents work all the time, and then, to make it worse, the narrator's sister, Lynn gets sick and dies. It's depressing and isn't helped by the fact that the narrator, Katie, is very uninteresting and flat. There are plenty more GOOD Newberys out there. Go get them instead. (Tale of Despereaux ROCKS!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Girls!","review":"I can see why this book won the Newbery Award. It's a great story about two sisters and their relationship. They are very close to each other. It's interesting, also, to see the discrimination against Japanese-Americans at the time of this story. I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kira-Kira is really great!","review":"At first, \\"Kira-Kira\\" didn't really seem like a good book. But when I began to read it, I couldn't put the book down! As good as it is, it is sad at the end. It is a really good book, and most likely someone else will find that it is a really good book!With everything going on in the book, the protagoniost, Katie, goes through ups and downs. Life is easy for her then it's unbareable. That's what I liked in the book, it seemed that it was someone's real life that Katie was living because she has good times and bad times.I would recommend this book for anyone 11 and up. I think it is four stars because of what happens in the end. It is a really great book, and I hope whoever reads it next will enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing, but good","review":"Kira-Kira deals with real issues that many people have. (such as being poor and being discriminated against) It is very sad, and the main character seems to be struggling with many things, such as saving for a house for her sick sister and passing in school. She is a very real character and feels like an actual person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Newbery But Not the Best of Them","review":"Right off the top I want to say that you can never really go wrong with a Newbery Award winner. I've read nearly all of them and I've never been disappointed, even as I head into the second half of my fourth decade. Any book that's good enough for your children should be good enough for you too.That being said, this is not one of my favorites among the Newbery's. Kadohata is excellent at convincingly telling this story from the point of view of a young child and this story of Japanese-Americans struggling to get by in the deep South with a very ill child is a good one; however, I felt very much like I knew where this story was going and I occasionally felt my emotions were being manipulated by the author. I wept the required tears but I didn't feel satisfied.Still, I'm fond of the occasional tear-jerker and, if you are too, then this book is a good place to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you need a chuckle ...","review":"What if?

In the engaging novel which is not constrained by the late '90s in which it is set, Mr. Monks shines a very bright light on exceedingly dark places on Wall Street, the mass media, the best government money can buy, and the real world of extreme wealth. Together, they reward Wall Street for victimizing Main Street. All of this from the pen of an Insider's Insider.

All I can say is that I wish I could write like this.Aside from the captivating story, the subtle one liners that reached deep intothe heart, the depth, beauty and tenderness with which the characters were presented, the subtle way in which the author's personal message to the business community is conveyed, there was, for me, the ever present, bitter sweet feeling that all of it is only a passing mirage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real story","review":"Here is an exciting novel of corporate intrique.

Of course, Reel and Route is fiction.

You won't be able to put it down until the character is safely?? at home--actually you won't be able to put it down until you discover what actually happened at home to bring about the horrendous crime. The detective in this series is funny but has less personality than other detectives I enjoy. However, the story--which is set in the world of fashion--makes up for any defects. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview for the uninitiated","review":"This is a nice compilation of BoDeans tunes from throughout their recording career, and includes at least one cut from every album. As will always be the case with long-time fans, I have particular favorites which were not included (\\"That's All,\\" \\"Good Work,\\" \\"The Other Side\\"), but I really can't quibble with the selections which are here. \\"She's A Runaway\\" was the first BoDeans song I ever heard and it's still one of the best; \\"Fadeaway\\" is a long-time favorite; \\"Say About Love\\" and \\"Feed The Fire\\" are both from their live album and rock out nicely. There are some strong mid-tempo ballads as well (\\"I'm In Trouble Again,\\" \\"Paradise\\") and the song my son and I love to sing along with in the car (as do BoDeans concert-goers) \\"Still The Night.\\" Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"It was OK, but it's missing some songs. I was shocked when I didn't see \\"Good Work\\" and \\"Dreams\\". Also, there are too many live tracks. I do like, however, how they have some rare photos and a bio, but the track listing is dissapointing. If you're new to the Bodeans, I'd buy Thick as Theives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slash & Burn","review":"I was a Bodeans fan from the first record, and I have to say that even I wouldn't buy this one. The stuff they did on their first three albums is vastly superior to the Joe Dirt offerings.The Bodeans truly rocked and popped on their first recordings, and then tried to go in a different direction - and in my opinion, lost their way.I was at every Bodeans show in the NYC area for quite a few years, and my co-workers were right there with me. But we just didn't feel it with the Joe Dirt album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book unreadable","review":"I read a few decent reviews of this book but I found the book unreadable and tossed it.

Each resume in the book is virtually the same, the formats are all the same, and all the helpful hints are rehashed from resume books that have been on the market for years, and which are less expensive. I'm sure it is a coincidence that the author is from Georgia, and all those excellent reviews are from Georgia. Save your money! Nothing new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive at all for the high cost!","review":"With the already over-populated resume book market, one wouldwonder why spend the money on this book? It certainly doesn't sayanything new or different.In fact, all of the resumes included for reference have the same \\"look and feel.\\" With the advent of desk top publishing, anyone can effectively produce a professional resume.

I had tried a couple of other types of pillows, but had not found anything else that really worked until I came across this one on Amazon. What a great idea! I ordered one for each of my oldest girls and we tried them out on a few short trips and they really worked great. We just recently came back from a very long road trip too and these things were wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice addition to long car rides.","review":"Bought this for my 3 y.o and he enjoys cuddling it. We take long car rides and wanted to give him a little more comfort when napping. The pillow is well made, colorful and priced right. It also has a zipper so you can remove some foam cushions to better fit your little one. Shipping is very fast.While the pillow helps to prop up your child's head while sleeping and thus reduces neck aches, I can't help but think it is a bit unnecessary. Unless you prop your child up on the pillow while they are sleeping it is a bit clumsy. My little one is a bit confused as how to use it, but that will undoubtedly change as he uses it more often. Overall, I think it is a good product and worth the money if you travel by car often."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more bobbing","review":"I love this pillow. I actually borrowed it from my 4-year old a few times on trips. Other travel pillows go around the back of the neck which doesn't solve the real problem - the head bobbing forward when my daughter is napping. This one does the trick. It also has removable foam to make the pillow shorter.

I was not familiar with many of these saints and had to drag out some resource books to look them up but they are many and varied and you can find one for almost every purpose. The explanations given with the cards are very brief but if you study them you will find many symbols to help with interpretation. These are perfect for anyone with a devotion to the saints. They are not, in my humble opinion, offensive if used in the right manner. I have many holy card collections but this is the first where so many are together by the same artist. You can use these as a tarot deck or not. I think the saints can only be happy that we are learning about them, no matter how one chooses to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful about this","review":"Hi!It is very odd (to put it nicely) to have a *Tarot* deck with Christian saints on it. Catholics and Christians generally are opposed to messing with the supernatural because it is so very dangerous.There's an old saying that if you are talking to an Angel, you may not know if it's an Angel of Heaven or Hell. If you think a saint from Heaven is helping you with divination....you should probably think again.This is also very offensive to Catholic and Orthodox Christians generally, if anyone cares about that. I do.If, like me, you thought these might be holy cards to go with the delightfulVoices of the Saints: A Year of Readings, keep looking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the rest.","review":"Maggie's Beau is different from the usual western romance I've ever read.

As in this is aimed at the single figure and slightly later crowd.It is supposed to be somewhat manga styled, and the 'professor' that is the villain of the piece looks like he is about 23, that sort of a thing. Also, a combination of artwork, and computer graphics, maybe so they can pump them out faster? It is done pretty well, and the background artwork is not so detailed, so maybe that is a labor time thing.

She is a terrible sister - teasing, mean, disrespectful. I realize that that's the point of her character (annoying sister), but for 6-9 year olds, I'm not sure they can read this and realize that no one should treat anyone the way Judy treats Stink. My kids like to read about people being kind to their siblings (Boxcar Children, Cam Jansen, Magic Tree House), and I think that children just learning to read chapter books might not be able to read with the critical eye that's needed when someone as mean as Judy comes on the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stink--A GREAT Book for Kids","review":"My 8 year old son asked me to read Stink with him and I was laughing out loud with him the whole time. This is a book that is an offshoot of the popular Judy Moody series by Megan McDonald. Stink is Judy's younger brother and is really discouraged that he is only 3 feet 8 inches tall and doesn't seem to be growing. His older sister Judy doesn't make him feel any better about it either with constant puns on the word \\"short.\\" A very funny scene about the salamander he takes home from school to watch over the weekend.

I am actually considering selling their products at some point but right now I enjoy using it myself.Bacout is amazing to clean your microwave. Try it, just spray it all over the inside, let it set for 5-10 min and then just gently wipe/rub it off and the food just comes right off, and it deodorizes it at the same time. And no yucky chemicals left in your microwave!!! Try it for your stove as well, and on the counter if you have stains on the counters.

When I asked for help in removing it from my carpet, I got very bad advice - as they said to use their All Purpose Cleaner to get it out. They don't even follow their own MSDS (safety) sheets, and the 'combination' of these two chemicals was wicked!

Edition and it reads and looks like it was written 20 years ago. Some care could have been taken to make a 1999 publication look like a 1999 publication.

Beyond that, the author's detailed memory for meals eaten aboard serves only to annoy. The addition of this and other, similiarly fluffy material makes one wonder if the intention is to meet a assigned page target. The fault may well lie with the editor, who should have chopped out the redundencies and enough fluff to permit more practical details, particularly regarding \\"down in the bilge\\", which tends to get short shrift.

Theres always been something so cool to me about Bonnet, who has fronted so many classic bands while resembling a pompadored disco king, but he has the pipes to make any album hes on blow away the competition. Most of the songs are good hard rock tunes backed up by cozy powell, mick moody and deep purples jon lord.

They are organized by package, not by class, yet the package is not shown in the heading -- only the class name is shown, and it's in the gutter rather than the outer edge.

I have reference books on other subjects for collectors. Compared to these other books, I have the following comments on RARE SMOKE. First, this is a reference book that DOES NOT HAVE AN INDEX. The photographs are of low quality. There are photos that are so blurred that one cannot see the detail that they were included to illustrate. The content is very limited. Many manufacturers and models are not included. And dating and pricing most of the limited number of pipes that are included is not possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Resource","review":"If you are interested in Pipe collecting you should procure a copy of Richard Carleton Hacker's Rare Smoke. It is a wealth of information about numerous collectable brands and varieties of pipes. In light of the fact that there are so few books on this subject I am grateful to Mr. Hacker for his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-obsessed or Self-obsessed?","review":"After reading three-fourths of the book (I couldn't get through any more) I found myself feeling as if Storms is more interested in himself than anything else. He forces himself on the reader. I began to feel hammered over the head with his very SUBJECTIVE perceptions of life and beauty. After a while he comes off sounding oddly defensive, self-centered, and even pedantic. I love the concept (that's why I picked up the book in the first place) and the Storms includes many wonderful quotations, especially those from C.S. Lewis, but I found the writing nauseating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great To The End","review":"If you can pay attention long enough, it'll leave you breathless, though the subtitles on the DVD seem to be a very literal translation of Japanese.

Great, great rock and soaring harmonies. Then this CD comes along. Harsh to the point of sibilence, the thin sound robs all the warmth and dimension from the sound. Rob Fisher's mastering is an abomination. This is classic rock and pop that deserves good - no, great - sound. This is truly one of the worst-sounding CD's I have ever heard.

This CD is evident of that fact. The songs are uplifting and masterfully arranged. Minister Whitfield's rich vocal range is on full display on the title track, \\"I'm Encouraged.\\" Track #2 is a reprise of the title track, and the listener really gets his money's worth because the reprise is just as artfully arranged as all the other songs, and it's long enough to be enjoyable. Most songs that are reprised are very short and the ad libbing is too obvious. Such is not the case here. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the making of this CD. Every song is done to perfection; the minister had very exacting standards. Excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlight in Watershed series","review":"Darkenheight is the second book of the Watershed Trilogy and it delivers just like Breach in the Watershed. In my opinion, Darkenheight is probably the best out of the three books as it didn't concentrate too much on Rudy and Raine's love affair and instead focused on the battles in Faerine and Dalethica. These were brilliantly written but I think that the low point for all of the Watershed books is the weakness of character. Rudy is a very weak character whose values are very low and Raine gets quite irritating very quickly. This story lacks more of the Drizzt type characters in Salvatore's books. But overall, a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR FANTASY FANS!","review":"IF YOU LIKE ROBERT JORDAN, RAYMOND FEIST, OR TERRYGOODKIND, YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS SERIES BYDOUGLAS NILES.

A \\"difficulty\\" rating is assigned to every piece of piano music, which I would take with a grain of salt - this is certainly subjective. There are lots of nice unexpected surprises listed - works that I didn't know existed, and information on their publishers. In terms of modern repertoire, there are some helpful suggestions, but I think that the field is simply too big (as well as constantly changing as new composers come along), so pianists should investigate their contemporary music choices through other channels."},{"rating":"1","title":"All-New Waste of Money","review":"This DVD is the bigest ripoff I have ever been duped into wasting my money on!

Not a bad video if you like being unmercilously teased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"Overall, I was pretty mixed...on the plus side, the women are extremely hot (better than most other Penthouse videos), and there are a lot of girl-girl scenes. On the negative side, for some reason, the directors decided not to show as much in the girl-girls scenes as they do in other recent releases. If they had used more close-ups and different angles, this would have definitely been 5 stars, like the Dear Diary and Harlots of Hell videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Shot","review":"Another disappointment, women are might fine, the editing leaves something to be desired - Where's the money shot?"},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless comedy","review":"This is one of the funniest movies ever!

It tries to teach absolutely everything about both written and spoken Finnish in too small a space. It also uses a non-standard approach to Finnish grammar which is confusing and unclear even to some native speakers I have asked ! For learners who are already at a reasonable standard, the dialogues are good examples of authentic spoken language, but I do not recommend this book for beginners at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners: keep away.","review":"Very frustrating to use. The book doesn't allow the reader to become comfortable with Finnish slowly and build a decent bedrock of vocabulary and grammar. Instead, even in the very beginning it mentions all sort of pedantic asides and exceptions to the rules, making the whole thing appear very daunting right from the start. Its layout is unclear and it doesn't have enough examples. You'll probably find yourself having to read the same sentence several times to absorb the rule the author is trying to lay down: a book on a difficult language that's written in poor English is the kiss of death for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"I own a couple other books on Finnish and so far this one seems to be the most practical. It's great to learn the proper way to speak, as well as the colloquialisms of the language -- this is the only book of mine which covers this aspect.

I just wanted to speak some finnish and I thought two tapes was good value. I should have bought teach-yourself instead. The tapes are more english than finnish and there is virtually no match between the tapes and and the book. The book might by fine for a University course or for someone who already knows the language but otherwise it's useless to someone about to travel to the country. I've learnt more finnish from the official goverment website which has one page on useful phrases. Good money down the drain and maybe I'll know better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of fluff","review":"So many words, explaining so very little. Very frustrating as you have to do some leg work to follow the examples, it's not a step by step book so it assumes current knowledge levels, which oddly enough, if you had, you wouldn't need this book.

I thought I'd listen to it all the time; put it on repeat while I studied, or cleaned my room.Wow, I was wrong. Love is hardly a strong enough word. Nearly every song on this album speaks to me, personally. I was a little concerned about some of the songs; the beginning of \\"Human Tornado\\", for example--I thought I would hate the song, or some of the instrumental beginnings, but each song settled into mood of its own. I've heard people condemn his lyrics for being somewhat trite (as in \\"Living Alive\\", for example), but there's such an honesty in the simplicity. Absolutely every time I hear \\"Out, Out, Damn Spot!\\" I start laughing (even at work...), and I have cried every single time I've heard \\"Visits to You\\".Fine, I'm typical and emotional.

My favorite song is Just Some Guy, because it's a simple straight forward ballad and I love how Anthony sounds singing it. I have fallen for his voice. it's elegant and beautiful without being over the top. he just opens that mouth and the most lovely sounds come forth.There isn't a song on this album that is terrible. All of them are good in their own way, and he definiely deserves to be called a songwriter in my opinion. His lyrics are simple, but expressive and moving all at the same time. Visits to you pulls at my Heartstrings, Just some Guy is a lovely ballad and Always is another fave.This CD is a must have for anyone who loves Anthony Rapp and for those who just like good music from great musicians. Anthony is indeed a rare talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best c.d.","review":"Anthony's c.d. is one of the best c.d.s I have ever heard. He has the most beautiful voice too.

They put you on hold for twenty minutes. They sent me a dress in a different color than I asked and then tried to blame it on me. The people there are very short with you. They won't give you more than 1 minute if you call them. They have absolutely no concern for you.

I must say, I greatly prefer it to movies such as Bringing Up Baby (much as I like Cary Grant and K. Hepburn), in which the so-called hero is too muddled to attempt to hold his ground against a female as featherheaded as himself.You know, I heard somewhere that Mad Miss Manton was the first \\"screwball comedy\\" to use regular actors/actresses instead of those that specialized in comic performance.

I tried messing with the spill-proof valve, and that had nothing to do with it. The water was pouring out from underneath the screwed on top. But it was only one of them.So the next day, I give her the one that wasn't leaking and there's still a problem...she has to suck way too hard to get anything out!

It can be applied to all aspects of leadership and inspires-in the words of the author-\\"leaders who happen to be women\\" to stand strong against the stigma of \\"stepping out of place\\" into positions of power and authority. And while the focus is on women's leadership, the fellas can get a few shots of leadership adrenaline from this work also. I have had the honor and pleasure of hearing Bishop Mackenzie speak.

It doesn't have to be that way. I was given a camera phone as a present, and until I found this book, it stayed in its box. I was that intimidated. (Let's just say my experience with user manuals hasn't been good.) The first thing that struck me about this book was the clean writing.

And she loves playing with the Thomas Train setup they have at [the local book store].Well, this toy did not generate one bit of enthusiasm. I'm putting it away for a while and maybe she'll get interested later or maybe I should have purchased this toy for her at a younger age and she's already outgrown it.

She loves carrying around a little construction man from the old version of the little people (he was mine when I was little) so I thought she would love this also. Her favorite thing to do is to put their head or feet in her mouth and crawl around. I would worry but since they are big enough I am not afriad she will choke on them. They are just the right size for her little hands. She is able to take the train apart and it often falls apart when she tries to rip the animals off of it. They don't come off really easy. But this doesn't stop her. She also loves the song it plays. It doesn't keep her attention for very long (about 5 minutes max) but that is about all she gives any toy. The best part for me is that she loves to roar with the lion in the song. Cute toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy grows with your child","review":"My son, who is now 18 months, got this toy when he was about 5 months old. He has always enjoyed the figures.

The book is a mostly fluffy, funny, addition to the series that doesn't greatly advance the plot. The series as a whole is a fun read with a strong and clever and emotional young female protagonist. The one weakness of the series is the pop culture references as they will very quickly date the series. Grade: B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty sad actually...","review":"If you ask me, this series should have ended after the 3rd book. I mean really, how long can Ms. Cabot go on about a girl who becomes a princess? Its not like it was the most original idea anyway.Not that I didn't like the books when they first came out, mind you. They weren't anything profound, but at least they were fun. What really turned me off about this book (besides the utter lack of real character development and Mia constantly whining like a spoiled brat) was Michael's pressuring Mia into sex. The overall theme of this book is quite clear: Its perfectly fine if you as a young woman don't want to have sex with your boyfriend right away, but you'd better have sex with him soon or he's gonna dump you and it will be all your fault. I am sure that Cabot did not mean to present this message, but she did.I hope that this series gets its spark back, although that may just be wishful thinking..."},{"rating":"1","title":"repulsive","review":"im only going to comment on one thing because it basically ruined the whole book for me. Michael pressuring Mia into sex and Mia whining about it throughout the whole book. Okay, Michael is 18 and Mia is 15. The age of consent in NY is 17. if these two have sex its called STATUTORY RAPE. it is a CRIME and Michael will go to JAIL. but meg cabot is writing about it like its perfectly normal and acceptable for a high school sophomore and a college guy to have sex. and by the way, this book is marketed to 8 year olds.NOT COOL. if i could give it a 0 i would.Btw i listened to this as an audiobook w/clea lewis as the narrator. just the cutesy way she whines about not wanting to 'do it' throughout the book makes it obvious that the author doesnt even take teenage sex seriously. she just keeps writing this garbage to titilate curious preteens and sell more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"dubious","review":"i found all of the previous books to be fun, and a bit of a naughty addiction. However, on getting to this one, i was nothing short of revolted. the moral of the story - sorry mia, you need to have sex with me eventually - is pretty much the Most inappropriate thing to be telling to teenage girls. it's not about pre-marital sex, but about choice, and feeling pressured. how long has sex education practically made girls chant 'no means No. no means No.' contrasted with this idea that well, michael is a boy, so of course he wants to have sex, and he needs to, and if she doesnt want to give out, then, well, she is just, like, dumped. and lame. really good work there, cabot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST EVER!","review":"how can anyone not like this book? some people may say \\"oh, its unrealstic\\" SO WHAT?

Mia is no longer someone that people can identify with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"I loved this book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because my favorite princess diaries book is the third one where michael tells mia that he loves her.Anyway, this book is really good. It is so funny.

It follows a day in the life of George Falconer (Colin Firth) an English professor, who is also a secretly gay man. He is overwhelmed by the death of his partner of 16 years and in a deep depression. There is no joy in life. Every day he wakes up to \\"now\\", which is a day without his partner. He is not in a position to grieve openly but grieves constantly inside.He quietly and carefully plans for his death at the end of the day. The story is subdued, but a study of a man's grief and glimmers of hope. The acting and direction are impressive, and the cinematography is absolutely high art.No matter what your background, Firth's performance makes a profound impression.It also has an outstanding supporting cast that includes Juliane Moore, Matthew Goode, and Nicholas Hoult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving and stays with you!","review":"A very moving and sensitive movie with superb acting by Colin Firth and Julianne Moore.

It is wonderfully cast and expertly directed - by first time director Tom Ford who is a self confessed Christopher Isherwood tragic. I really enjoyed the performances of all the cast - Colin Firth was an intriguing presence and 'Malibu' Nicholas Hoult was suitably seductive as the ingenu leading his professor to a gentler death. He didn't go to bed with the professor, but rather with the professor's .38 revolver. (So what would his reaction have been on waking the next morning to find his mentor expired? Percussive?)

Unfortunately, this review isn't based an original, Gucci horsebit handbag still in the box in my closet, but on his first film. In Ford's film, beauty takes center stage and depth is transparent. Ford seems all too accustomed to lifeless, pale, teenage models on and off the runway. Quite sadly, this film makes me ponder Ford's depth in all regards.

That's not meant to be a criticism but a compliment as the feel of the film is crucial to its enjoyment as a period piece. Colin Firth and Julianne Moore are excellent, Firth really is more than that: brilliant. The film has been criticized for its seemingly arbitrary ending.

He does not disappoint although his talents are wasted in this poor movie. Firth is a Professor of English coming to terms with the death of his partner of 18 years against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Most of the action takes place on a single day, when Firth makes a plan to end his suffering. So during this day he has a host of sequences where he meets a lot of characters who add nothing substantial to the film and a dinner date with his long time friend Julianne Moore with a horrible English accent. Tom Ford the director is apparently a famous person but I had never heard of him until I saw the film. This is a horribly written and directed film, I had trouble keeping my eyes open and watched it one hand of the fast forward button. Nothing about this boring and pretentious film made sense.

I think the editor needs a serious talking to -- all those scenes of naked bodies floating in water set to violin music may have seemed interesting at the time, but I was leaping for the fast-forward button on a regular basis. [WARNING, POTENTIAL MINOR SPOILER] At the beginning of the film the bereaved Mr. Firth is informed that one of his dogs was found dead at the scene along with his lover, but the issue of what happened to the second dog is a total loose end that never comes up again. Laugh if you will, but the character, who is obviously very affected by the love for and memory of his dogs, would have made an effort to find that missing dog who was the last link to his dead lover.

Some movies CAN pull that identity crisis off (think \\"Mummy\\" with Brendon Fraiser), but alas not \\"Mirror Mirror\\". There were some good special effects (when she goes through the mirror), the seven -- I'm gonna say it! -- DWARVES were great (on stilts while being bandits and each with a different wonderful personality), but all that can't make up for lameness this epic. I am so glad I only rented this movie and didn't waste my money to see it in the theater. I'd give it a rotten tomato if I could!Spend your time watching \\"Snow White And The Huntsman\\" (which I did the next night). You'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Snow White Adaptation I've Seen!","review":"I've seen three adaptations of Snow White, and this is the worst.

I have always enjoyed Julia Roberts films, and I love comedies. The whole time we were watching this one, though, I kept thinking, \\"It should be funnier. It's rather painful, like watching the kid at the blackboard who can't quite get the right answer, but has to keep standing there, and it makes me feel BAD for him.\\"The jokes weren't fresh, the development wasn't rich, and overall, I was disappointed.

When I found out that Tarseem Singh directed it I decided I had to give it a go. I was not disappointed. I had fun watching it. I liked most of the plot and loved the scenery, settings, and costumes. I also found the characters satisfying as twists on the sleeping beauty assemblage. For a summer pop corn mucher this is an excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....VERY disappointed..","review":"Simply put, I think this movie was a mess with a ridiculous convoluted plot....nothing like a Snow White story.

Julia Roberts must not have even read the script before agreeing to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as impressive as some might think.","review":"First of all, let me list the good qualities about this movie.The graphics are really cool on this movie, and the \\"mirror mirror\\" parts are really awesome to watch. Plus, some of the fighting sequences are entertaining.Now for the bad things.The writers of this film completely turned the story around, and the lessons about true TRUE love in the original are wiped out in this movie. Instead of being masculine, and courageous, the prince is feminine, and Snow White ends up fighting for herself. The dwarves are made out to be thieves, and Snow White joins them, and the spells and enchantments, which I normally like, are too wichcrafty for my taste. Overall, I would recommend to NOT buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST FILM I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME","review":"Really, this is the worst film I've seen in years. I had expected a quality film from Julia Roberts, but this film distorts, changes (for the worst) and ruins the classical Snow White story most of us are familiar with. It's too scary for children, and yet the film was probably made for audiences under 10 years old. Nathan Lane turns in an embarrassing performance, and Julia Roberts' performance is one-dimensional and SO boring. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Would not recommend this to anyone....

There were only 3 or 4 sets through this whole movie. They kept showing the same shot of the castle or the same shot of her coming out of the water. The ending singing and dance scene was so out of place and odd. It felt like you skipped into Slumdog Millonaire. For adults it was bad but my kids enjoyed it. There were some funny dwarf scenes. As an adult I am rating it 2 stars. My kids would probably give it 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it at all.","review":"The timming was way off and the story was not entersting.

Also, the plot wasn't new or fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia Roberts fan, but not a fan of this movie","review":"This was like watching Julia Roberts' romantic comedy persona filling in for Angelica Huston. The tone of the movie was equally as confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly lacking.","review":"While it was amusing to see Julia Roberts portray the Evil Queen, the film as a whole is greatly lacking. An interesting aspect is the twist on the portrayal of the Seven Dwarves. \\"Prince Charming\\" is a rather flimsy character. When Snow White manages to dance with him at the castle and tell him of her dilemma, he pledges to help her; however, he almost immediately decides she is insane and ought to be stopped. He is disdainful, arrogant, offensive, and ridiculous. This film could have been very strong; instead, it is glaringly lacking on so many levels. I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirror Mirror","review":"For me and my family this movie was so off target, we couldn't watch the entire flick. Great talent mouthing a horribly bland and tasteless script. This movie was neither humorous nor dramatic and lacked focus.

I cannot believe that I just wasted almost two hours of my life on such nonsense. The adaptation is silly and poorly written. The annoying weird dog-acting of the prince is not funny, well, maybe for kids it is... The Snow White is uninspiring and dull. The queen is bored and boring. The Prince, even though very hot I have to admit, seemed stupid and lost. The only character that was actually fun to watch was Nathan Lane's Brighton. The ending song seemed like creators' desperate, but failed, attempt to add spark to a dull image. This movie is nothing but a waste of Julia Robert's talent. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirror Mirror","review":"To begin with, I didn't mean to purchase this as a down load.

I like everything she does, and this movie did not dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirror Mirror","review":"This is a very sweet live action version of Snow White. Julia Roberts does an excellent bad character. Didn't think I would ever see her in this type role but she did it with great style and became someone you loved to hate. Only thing that was a distraction is the Snow White's eyebrows. Goodness, hasn't anyone ever showed this child how to correctly style her brows without them looking like Groucho Marx? Other than that, a really good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Take On A Great Classic.","review":"I enjoyed this movie. It was a lighthearted, fun romp through an old classic with an excellent cast. I couldn't see anyone else in the roles. Julia was pleasantly wicked, Lily sweet and determined, and Armie playing the prince and managing to be sweet, goofy, and manly, something that only a few actors over the years seem able to pull off. Brendan Fraser comes to mind. Stunning sets and costumes made it visually stunning. Put your feet up and enjoy. Not deep, but definitely pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"This was a good movie. It wasn't the tradtional story of snow white but I don't think it needed to be.

I really recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expected bad, but it's actually pretty good","review":"My wife wanted to see this movie. I thought the kids might enjoy it too, so we watched it as a family. Based on the previews, I really didn't think I'd like it, but it's actually pretty good. It's a little bit of a twist on Snow White, but you'll still know the basic story. Julia Roberts gets top billing, but Snow White is still the star. She just has a little more girl power this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT my cup of tea","review":"I was expecting to have fun watching this, but instead...

What a waste of film, time and talent. Julia Roberts was Julia Roberts as the evil stepmother, not one bit of acting involved. Armie Hammer was pretty to look at but drab as a dishrag. The girl who played Snow White, I didn't even bother to learn her name. I ALWAYS watch a movie through to the end but I couldn't find one thing redeeming about this and I really, really tried.

It is a good rendition of a old fairytale. The characters have a bit of a twist to the original ones, but since everyone knows the story, its nice to have a tweak to them.

My six-year-old listened to it avidly and thought it was funny. We read it as part of our homeschool unit on the Maya people. It did present some history, but I felt that the irreverant and flippant tone of most of the book was disrespectful and unnecessary (e.g. the character named \\"Kakapupuhed\\"). The author seems to have the perspective that history is boring and needs to be made more interesting so that children will find it appealing.

The scene where the latrine is rigged so the toilets salute (!) was too riske for 1958 but they got it pass censors somehow (a mystery).

The only short comings are: 1. No physical zoom (unlike the comparable Canon Digital Elph) 2. After pressing the button, the picture isn't taken immediately - meaning if you move the camera immediately after snapping the picture it will be blurry.

One was Tomas's (the main character) daydreaming. He constantly dreamed about catching a shark and it was interesting at first, but it soon got old. I also didn't like how the book got into such detail about the reef. It gave a lot of information, but distracted me from the plot of the book.

The lead character, Tomas, is played out as a normal Mexican child, yet the author makes it sound like he is an adult. It is set in Baja, Mexico, i'm sure this place is rural and doesnt have a lot of people, but I'm sure they have better things to do then stalk sharks and pretend there are boats on top of mountains. About 85% of this book is about Tomas talking about fishing. Okay, if you are contemplating being a fisherman, GET this book, I'm sure it can help you.

I'm not complaining because Barbra is such an exceptional singer. Actually, exceptional is an understatement. She still sounds like \\"liguid diamond\\" but now is allowing smokier sounds to color her voice.Like fine wine, Barbra is entering her stately years and with her artistry in-tact.I've bought 5 cd's of this album as xmas presents.

She says she doesn't listen to her recordings after they are made because she is so spent on listening to them repeatedly during the process of recording. Well, perhaps, it would be a good idea for her to take a sabbatical - a pause - and then listen to the completed work. Ms. Streisand has a reputation of being a perfectionist. I find it hard to imagine that she would be dispassionate about the lack of passion in this newest release should she listen carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Move Me","review":"Oh dear! I am the greatest Streisand fan, even flying to Sydney to see her live in 2000: but what was she thinking when she released this album.

Buy the new Bette Midler tribute to Rosemary Clooney instead. Now THAT is an inspired cd. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's your money","review":"I personally did not find this album very interesting. I do not see this album as forging new directions or even following old familiar ones. It's just simply, well, rather boring. While I do not deny she has a beautiful voice and it's hard to find such talent among today's offerings, I still find this album boring. Her voice isn't what it once was, and what it is now isn't growing old gracefully. And yes I said boring twice because that's how boring it is. Buy the album if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it at all. I considered giving her more stars just because she's Barbra, but then thought that is just more reason to give one star and show her how truly dissappointed in this album I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbra's Weakest Efford to date...","review":"Not sure, but Barbra's voice on this new CD is much whispery and low than any of her other albums.

I like one or the most two songs on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have loved Ms. Streisand's music for many years, but frankly, this album is boring. All the songs sound alike. By the time I got to the end of the CD, I had already decided to put it away. My advice? Unless you are a real die-hard fan, don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling You","review":"The stand out song of this album is \\"Calling You.\\" I never liked this song before and I was expecting to not like it here but Barbra added her personal magic to it and now I can't get enough of the song. The other song I am in love with is \\"You're Gonna Hear From Me.\\" This is classic Barbra with the powerful notes and attitude that has been missing her some of her previous albums. The production on this album is first class. Barbra has hit a home run. She deserves so much more praise than she will get from this album. She deserves to be nominated for several Grammys but no doubt all the nominations will go to no talent singers who will have their careers end while Barbra's is still going strong. She's timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbra is INCREDIBLE!! A musical treat!","review":"It's amazing how much hate, anger and rage the right wing wacko reviewer from Arlington, VA has. Try decaf!

Brilliant choice of material, first rate arrangements and sonic production plus a flawless performance. I have a master's degree in music and am a published composer. Barbra is one of the most gifted and talented singers on the planet. Keep up the great work Babs!

If you like Babs, you probably won't care or let yourself admit that this album is bland boring and lacluster.

It's a durge, miserable and without feeling. Musicals are supposed to be happy, this CD just made me sad. Even the last track \\"You're gonna hear from me\\" was without any life. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Voice on a Boring Album","review":"Nobody in the music business sounds as good as Barbra. At 61, she continues to delight her fans everywhere with her beautiful voice. However, I was very disappointed in this new release.THE MOVIE ALBUM is a collection of songs, some recongizable, some not, from movies. Surprisingly, Barbra does not use her own movies. \\"Smile\\" is wonderfully done, but as the album continues, it begins to sound all the same. \\"Moon River\\" is never a good choice for an album, in my opinion. This song is overly done, and not really worth Barbra's time. By about the fifth song on each listen, I had to put in something else or I would fall asleep.I'm a fan of Barbra's, and will continue to support her work. However, if she continues to release boring music, I will not be as inclined to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Barbra sounds incredible on this CD. Highlights for me were \\"Calling You,\\"\\"You're Gonna Hear From Me,\\" \\"Wild is the Wind,\\"and \\"Smile\\". This is definitely one of her best CDs. If it's true that there will be a second collection of movie tunes released in the future, I will rush out to buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbra, what were you thinking?","review":"THIS CD IS HORRIBLE!!!!!I consider myself to be one of Barbra's biggest fans for over 25 years. I was so excited to hear this cd but wow was I ever disappointed. Every song sounds the same and there is no passion in any of the songs. And whats up with the obsure songs she chose to sing? Absolutely dreadful. It's got to be one of her worst CD's ever. I can't even give this away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad Cd but no \\"Broadway\\"","review":"I love Barbra. There I said it so I can go on with this review. I enjoy listening to this Cd while I work except for the track \\"Calling You\\". It is absolutely horrible. I've tried several times to get through it but I always wind up hitting the forward button. I have to say I have never disliked a Streisand song enough to skip it UNTIL this song. It wins that dubious honor.\\"The Second Time Around \\" is a favorite as well as \\"You're Gonna Hear From Me\\".Barbra will always be worth the money for a CD to me so I hope she keeps recording. And I love her linear notes. Seems like she always gives us insight into choosing her songs--which is a nice bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful","review":"What can you say about this woman's talent? Got two for gifts and they were hits. You just cannot go wrong giving this as a gift to any of her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Passion?","review":"Barbra Streisand always gave me goosebumps -- but for the life of me, this CD leaves me totally cold. The only song that comes close to the old passion is \\"You're Going to Hear from Me\\" -- but it still did nothing for me. I am wondering if her marriage to Mr. Brolin has helped Ms. Streisand feel safer, so that the \\"hunger\\" I used to hear in her voice is no longer there? The choice of songs was only fair and many interpretations strayed a bit too far from the original tune taking too many liberties with it. I find this problem in many of her recordings and wish she would just stay more on-track. Great song writers don't need anyone's \\"help\\". Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste Of Talent","review":"I bought this album based on Barbra's compelling performance and lovely material on \\"The Broadway Album.\\" What a mistake. Why Barbra Streisand, who I believe should not retire from music because of the gift of her voice, would choose this uneven, tedious and vapid material to showcase her gift simply baffles me. This CD should have been entitled \\"The Obscure Moive Album.\\" She could have selected from a wealth of material and instead she settled for mediocrity. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little boring","review":"I've read a lot of the other reviews and I must say that I found the CD somewhat dissapointing. I still think she has the greatest voice in the world but this CD is over-produced. I would love to hear Streisand in a more intimate setting. Where not the arrangments are the most important and the number of violins but the songs themselfs and the delivery of emotions.So I would recommend you buy the Broadway Album or any other Streisand Album for that matter instead of the Movie Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I am a fan of Barbra Streisand. I could not believe how bad and overproduced this album sounds. Her voice is amplified and processed. The choices of songs were ok but the spirit in which they are rendered leave so very much to be desired. The general tempo is slow and plodding. The album is tedious and the bonus dvd is pathetic! I would expect any DVD produced would have dolby digital sound at the least! ALL close head shots of Barbra holding the headphones with her exquisitely manicured hands. YUCK! This is the worst CD I purchased in 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE PHONED IT IN.................","review":"She's reached the end of the line with this one. She's not emotionally involved with any of the songs, not at all. There is no fervor, no passion, no expression.................I AM SO DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow and boring","review":"I felt this album was too slow and dull. It's tedious to listen too in spite of her \\"good\\" voice. ... I'm a so so babs fan but really thought this album was weak. Weak arrangements especially on Wild is the Wind and How Do You Keep the Music Playing. I just thought her voice sounded the same on every song. The album lacks too much humanism for me to feel it deserves anymore than one star.e, although I know the record will sell very well, and her singing \\"live\\" on \\"Oprah\\" will help. Her rendition of \\"Smile\\" alone is worth the price of the CD. What will we do when she stops making music? I think people will appreciate her even more after her death. There is no one on earth like her. She turns songs into prayers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magic carpet ride...","review":"Does it have a beat? Nope. Does it have a hot music video? Nope. How about some cool electronic tricks with the vocals? Nope, it doesn't have that either. What it does have is one of the most gifted singers of the last 4 decades performing her most consistently beautiful, nuanced, and sublime recording in years. Put on the headphones, recline on the magic carpet of Streisand's voice, and take a journey heavenward."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO SAD!","review":"I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER GREAT STREISAND PERFORMANCE SINCE I HAVE BEEN A HUGE FAN THROUGHOUT HER CAREER. I GAVE THIS CD 2 STARS JUST FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE. I DISAGREE WITH MOST OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS REGARDING THEIR POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT HER VOICE. SONG SELECTIONS ASIDE, HER VOICE HAS DETERIORATED AND ONE NEED ONLY TO BREAK OUT AND LISTEN AGAIN TO ONE OF HER OLD ALBUMS. HER \\"THIRD ALBUM\\" IS MY FAV AND IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER PRODUCED BY ANYONE.PERHAPS THIS IS A CASE OF....IF YOU DON'T USE IT, YOU LOSE IT. I SINCERELY HOPE BARBRA MAKES A MUSICAL COMEBACK SOON. THIS IS NOT THE ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"B is for Bland","review":"I never thought I'd call Barbra boring, but this CD comes pretty close. Elevator Music. Poor choices (Emily? 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse?) Bland arrangements. Everything is Soooooo Slow and Serious. Where's the fun? The joy? The Passion? Its not here, that's for sure. On the first cut, Smile, I was encouraged, but after a few more cuts, everything started sounding the same. Its hard to keep awake. Even Sondheim comes up lacking. Of course, the Bergmans are well represented here too. (Yuck) On the last cut, You're Gonna Here From Me, I thought Barbra was finally going to cut loose and belt one, but even this song was disappointing. She doesnt create any fire till the very end. A major disapointment. I've played this CD twice and I doubt will listen to it again. Apparently others feel the same as its rapidly falling off the charts. I hope the 2nd installment is better, but I'm not sure at this point, I'll risk buying it. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks compassion","review":"I found the album to lack compassion and emotion. She with so little enthusiasm as if she really didn't want to show up at the recording studio that day. I think she's just given up but figured there are still enough loyal fans out there that will buy anything that she couldn't resist separating the fools from there money. Good one Babs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mature Diva","review":"The mature Streisand shows on this collection that she's still and always will be around. Her beautiful gift of voice, an understatement, shines and soars in it's touching quietness. As always, her almost magical interpretations of wonderful masterpieces take your breath away. Not only do you hear and feel, but you live through them. Favorites include her updated version of MOON RIVER, her playful mood in I'M IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE...and YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM ME takes you back to the days of FUNNY GIRL/FUNNY LADY! Bravo...again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD OF 2003","review":"Every major critic in the country - from Rollingstone, Billboard, to NY Times and Wall Street Journal - is RAVING about this album!

THIS IS THE ONE to get!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIKE BUTTAH!!!","review":"All is well in the world. Barbra has given us another stellar album of sensational singing and beautifully crafted songs from the movies of yesteryear. The Barbra detractors are out in full force all over the internet trying to attack her political views through their desecration of her new Grammy nominated album. Doesn't make the cut, guys.Barbra reigns supreme, once again as always, as THE vocalist one turns to in order to hear how a song and all of its various hues SHOULD be interpreted. She continues to amaze in her proficiency and power. No one can lay claim to the title nor rain on her parade...STILL after 40 years!!!Bravo Barbra....."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW","review":"This Cd is so slow, It has so little life, Barbra soundsgreat, but her voice can't rise above these sluggisharrangements, A little bounce next time please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a strong effort","review":"I agree with most of the reviews here that call this a very weak effort. I don't know what happened to this artist. I hope this album is not a reflection on future works we will see from her. It is a real shame that this album didn't have ANY of her qualities that I've so admired in the past. It's just not there in this case. I think most people who are honest, will agree that this album is pretty bland. Therefore, I think it only deserves one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Songs to fall asleep by","review":"Sorry Barbra, I think you made this CD after your overnight visit with Bill in the White House! Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I am falling asleep just listening to the clips of each song. They are not necessarily bad songs as some reviewers have said. The voice is familiar and soothing and I don't see the dramatic differences as I do in her current Live 2006 CD. Even in the Somewhere with Il Divo video her voice strains is not the same as it was.Hopefully this is the year of your final, final, final comeback. We have enough material over the last 40 years to keep us busy for the next 40 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm a Streisand fan from way back, but I don't like this CD at all. I listened to it once and may not ever listen to it again. All the songs seemed to blend together into a boring and bland listening experience. Yes, individual songs were lovely and she still sounds fabulous, but I don't understand why she selected some of these songs. Her Broadway album was SO much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature Streisand is Beautiful","review":"Streisand is 61 years-old. Very few great singers have sounded this wonderful at this age. THE MOVIE ALBUM is the greatest album from Streisand's Mature stage (from 1990 on) of her recording career. Barbra has evolved over the years into becoming a true contemporary song stylist--she combines all her vocal stylings to produce a low-key, jazzy, dramatic album of sophisticated movie songs. Barbra chose songs mostly from her taste-level, never succumbing to the predictable. Some may long for Streisand's belting days, but listen to THE MOVIE ALBUM and discover a mature, sophisticated style that is rare, but beautiful. Streisand may no longer be young but she's the last in the line of legendary singers like Sinatra....Ella.....Judy. Barbra's love of classic movies and supreme singing style make this a great album. Wish movies were like this still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"What a deal! This is a great cookie sheet with really neat cookie cutters.

I just don't think they measure up to the Star Warsmythos. Characterization is poor. All of the characterssound exactly alike. Without the phrases \\"said Luke\\" or \\"Hanshouted\\", I wouldn't have been able to tell one guy from theother. I found Han saying things that I just couldn'timagine Harrison Ford saying, and it was the same way withLuke, Leia, Lando, etc. Another thing that irked me was theway the characters kept finishing each other's sentences.After three books of this, one may become rather annoyed.Some of the original characters are uninteresting as well.While the plot was fast-paced and entertaining, the readerdoesn't get the full Star Wars experience. Zahn should havepaid more attention to characters and dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrawn, A Worthy Heir","review":"The Star Wars universe succeeds or fails with it's villian. Vader made the films. Maul redeemed an easily criticized Episode I. Zahn delivers to the fans a cerebral, cultured, and unique Heir to the imperial remnant with Thrawn.As I rolled through this book, I longed for this to be the cinematic heir to Return of the Jedi (as I read this the first time in high school, long before Ep I). The characters are intriging, the settings are fresh, and our old favorites are once again brough to us as if we just left the celebration on Endor.This was the first book I read from the expanded Star Wars universe. I have read every hard cover since and many of the paperbacks. And that is 100% due to how good a book (and a trilogy) Zahn has written.I'm not a Star Wars Novel mark (although I am a huge fan) There have been awful novels. This one though is awesome.Read it. And be prepared to anticipate the next book as much as you anticipated the movie back in the late 70's and early 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"best not by george lucas star wars book!","review":"this book is the best!

There was almost no action and there was nothing bad at the end which there must be to have a sequel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zahn nails the Star Wars universe.","review":"It is difficult to take existing characters and create new stories -- you always piss someone off (like the X-Files novels did for me). Mr. Zahn has an uncanny grasp of the Star Wars characters that took my breath away.This novel picks up 5 years after Return of the Jedi leaves off. Leia and Han are pregnant, Luke is teaching Leia about the force, and the New Republic is finding its legs after the defeat of the Emperor and Darth Vader. A cunning new Grand Admiral has taken over the reigns of the shattered Empire and is plotting against the New Republic. A military genius, he has a few tricks up his sleeve that might tip the balance in the continuing power struggle for the galaxy. Do not pass up this novel, and be sure to continue on to Dark Force Rising, the next novel in this trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve to be called a Star Wars story","review":"The good: some characters are well developed and treated that they come alive such as Han Solo and Lando.The bad: The story seems to go nowhere, first chapters are really boring. I think Zahn fails to set the apropriated tension since the beginning.The Ugly: How did Zahn dared to write a Star Wars story that doesn't features a dramatic ending with a light saber duel???!!! (sorry if I spoiled but I had to say this) This is not a complete story, it leaves you in the middle of something (nowhere in particular), it doesn't work as a unit like ep V which despite it is to be continued, it has a clear climax.I'm very disapointed by this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually...","review":"1) Zahn implied that most of the Empire's competent officers died at endor , which is unrealistc.2)the language is,nt sophisticated , it's unrealistic. (i.e charecterization is bad)3)winning a few planets and blockading a few others should'nt really hurt a GALACTIC republic *that* much.4) the Imperial fleet , as portrayed by Zahn , is pathetic. all I've seen was Thrawn's five Imperial Star Destroyer.5)by accounting , zahn means that the republic elimanated the other Grand Admirals. It would be nic if there was some clarification as to HOW.6)yes , everyone knows what cocking an eybrow means , but does that mean you can repeat it five times a page?7)no , Im afraid that Zahn isnt the best star wars author. as proof read (at your own precaution) Specter to the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I very, very rarely put a book down once I commit to it, but 200 pages into this thing and the story's going nowhere. Zahn took the characters we loved and turned them into one dimensional bores. No one in the book has any tension with any other characters, and none of them go anywhere. The whole book revolves around a \\"defeat the bad guy\\" plot. Don't get me wrong, I love books that offer nothing but entertainment, but I have to care about the characters to be entertained by their battles and struggles. \\"Luke flipped away from the blaster shots\\" just doesn't cut it with me. This book was boring, the characters were all turned into one dimensional bores, and 200 pages into the book I couldn't have cared less whether the characters I loved just died right then. If you love the movies, stay away from this low brow garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not that great.","review":"Zahn didn't put enough descriptions in the book. He never really describes the settings in the book, and while you are supposed to use your imagination while reading a book, describing the setting would have made the action scenes more interesting. I also had a problem with Luke giving Leia a lightsaber that he made for her. That is clearly not the Jedi way. She should make her own lightsaber when she is ready. Then, there is the boring dialogue. Everyone always says \\"Point\\" and \\"Agreed\\". Why?? Can't anyone say, \\"You have a point there\\" or \\"I agree with you\\"? I also have a problem with Ackbar on the New Republic Council. If he is an Admiral, why is he on a civilian council? I didn't like Zahn's choices of weird names, like \\"ysalamiri\\" or the planet \\"Bpfassh\\" (how do you pronounce those?), Lando's \\"Necr'ygor Omic wine\\" and \\"Fey'lya\\". Why so many apostrophes? All in all, the book just isn't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see the big deal about Tomothy Zahn!!!!","review":"Zahn is VERY unrealistic! The Grand Admiral is supposed to be so smart that he can figure anything out, even when there is not enough info to come to his conclusions! Many of the Grand Admirals conclusions are IMPOSSIBLE. They are more like guesses, but Zahn just writes it off to the Admiral being a genius. Zahn should take a few classes in Logic and Philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be 0 starts, except it is Star Wars, after all","review":"This was a BAD book. I love Star Wars, and wanted to hear more about the characters. But, I'm certainly not going to waste my time on any more books by Timothy Zahn. BORING, unbelievable story. I skipped through the entire last half, just looking for anything mildly interesting. I can't believe how many good reviews this book got.This was my first try at a non-Lucas SW book (I've been afraid they might be awful). I'll try one more author, but I'm not all that optimistic . By the way, did anyone remember that there was tons of humor in the Star Wars trilogy? Where did it go? I saw a couple possible attempts, but they were flat and forced. I don't think Mr. Zahn is someone I would enjoy knowning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zahn's a good author, but this is Sacrilege","review":"Let's get something straight: George Lucas authored Star Wars. All of it. He's the man who controls the Universe, and in my mind the man who will always control the Universe. Please don't take this the wrong way, Zahn is a good author, possibly a great author. If you want a good sci-fi book, read his Conqueror's series, not this or any other star wars book. As for why this book is not star wars... well in a word Thrawn. Come on, a brilliant general who can deduce a race's defense system by looking at one of their paintings? And he's got blue skin? This is not some cheezy Star Trek novel, it's Star Wars, damnit, and it should be treated as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is great! A wonderful place to start the Expanded Universe readings, although, some people might find it helpful to read the series' leading up to this one(the X-Wing series and the Courtship of Princess Leia) to fill in the gaps such as Leia being pregnant, etc. The one problem I had with this book was the ysalamiri. A creature able to push back the Force, just so Luke can be put in an impossible situation without his powers. Other than that it was great. I was on the edge of my seat, and couldn't put it down. A must-read for any Star Wars fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Star Wars Author To-Date","review":"Heir to the Empire, the Thrawn Trilogy, and the Hand of Thrawn Duology are the greatest books in the Star Wars Series because Timothy Zahn is the only author that can make the characters seeme truly real and bring the magic of the movie ino the bok, which is NOT what I can say for KJA.

Otherwise, this is an GREAT story when combined with Dark Force Rising and the Last Command."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome trilogy!","review":"Personally I thought this was the best Star Wars trilogy written after the films. I first read them at the library then bought them later on. ... Using men's souls to power up droid spaceships is pretty stupid, and turning around and saying that ysalamari is a dumb idea, you're just digging a bigger hole for yourself. Sure, I didn't think ysalamari was an EXTREMELY good idea, but it was necessary to the story, which is pretty good. If you ever read a Star Wars book, read this one. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This book was amazing. Zahn picked up the character's attitudes just where George Lucas left off. It was one of the best books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book written with the Force!","review":"Not many books can be considered wothy of the title Star Wars. Timothy Zahn captures the essence of the great trilogy. Most novels written about the Star Wars theme loses the spirit of the characters. Zahn holds the personalities of the characters throughout the series. Keeping how we saw them for our first time. I can't praise enough of Zahn's work on this trilogy of his own! Star Wars has been picked about with absurd changes, and ridiculous resurrections. Zahn keeps it simple, leaving the spirits of the characters in our minds, while throwing them into conflicts that add to them, not destroy who they are to us. May the force be with Timothy Zahn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressed","review":"I am not a big fan of reading books that are based on a movie, I prefer the other way around.

I read 'Heir to the Empire' but had to listen to the second two parts of this trilogy on audio cassette because I wanted to know what happened but I didn't want the pain of actually having to read the second two parts.The ysalamiri are ridiculous - a sort of kryptonite for the Jedi - as is C'Boath the dark Jedi Master. How come we hadn't heard of these before? They would have been pretty difficult to keep secret. And the way Thrawn can anticipate any bluff or double bluff and never be wrong makes him unbelievable as well. Mara Jade is a good character though.I suggest people read the X-Wing series first which is much better or even 'The Truce at Bakura' which is well written.Don't read this - listen to it on cassette if you want to know what happens - at least it's less painful that way. Read other books in the Star Wars saga first."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can sum this up in one word - boring","review":"This book was the first STAR WARS book I read and I can't help feeling a little disappointed.

However, this series is pale in comparison to episodes IV-VI.By the way-- HOW ON EARTH did the Japanese word 'Katana' [sword] end up \\"long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away\\"??!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Liked It,Verry Intersting","review":"Verry Interesting.It Contunies What George Lucus Started With The Trigoly I Have Dark Force Rising And The Last Command I Can't Wait To Finish Them.I Have Read The Truce At Bakura"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far, the best Star Wars sequel written","review":"Timothy Zahn's trilogy is by far, without a doubt, the best of all the Star Wars books -- and I've read a lot of them. He stays true to the movie character's personalities, and adds compelling new characters. This may have been said a thousand times, but Grand Admiral Thrawn is right up there with Darth Vader as the greatest Star Wars \\"bad guy\\". He is just fascinating, I almost wish he were real. The Noghri are a great addition, as is Talon Karrde. And the story is just thrilling. I cannot emphasize enough that this book really is the only sequel worthy of sitting next to the original trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the movies","review":"This book did all that the movies couldn't from the very start. Taking the imagination on a old favorite rollercoaster. All the original cast is in the book from our favorite wookie to r2d2. Yet their is also new favorites from a cunning admiral to the most mysterious woman in the galaxy. Zahn is a master at deveoping people, great plots and interesting situations. It is so good I had trouble putting it down more than one late night. His style has a never ending great description of new worlds and cultures. With in depth writing on their past and present standing. It's an incredible universe he throws out to us and it will take you on the next thrillig chapter(literally) in the star wars adventures. (I never give novels that are just for fun any higher rating than a four! So it was very well done.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series!!","review":"This is definitley the best star wars book I've ever read!

Timothy Zahn put good thought into this book. His blockbuster hit is certainly a very good one. I would highly recommend that you read this book and many others that Zahn wrote. I liked especially the Jorus C'boath guy. Luke wasn't the last of the Jedi after all. The plot is rather extrordinary itself. It consists from having to do with jedi, smugglers, the twins and many others. You should really read this book. If you are a real Star wars fan, you should want to read it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY SUPERB CONTINUATION OF THE STAR WARS SAGA!","review":"Timothy Zhan's Heir to the Empire is nothing short of a masterpiece! Grand Admiral Thrawn's presence becomes almost tangible for the enthusiastic reader. The novel is superbly crafted, so as to always keep the reader involved in the story. There are no boring filler sections, but instead a constantly evolving plot that one enjoys keeping up with. Zahn's clear presentation of the Star Wars characters makes it feel like one is totally esconched in a movie! Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The Last Command, and also Specter of the Past and Vision of the Future, all stand at the top of the pyramid of Star Wars books. Definitely read these books for an awesome trip to a galaxy far, far away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book!","review":"Definently could be episodes 7-9.

Lots of action too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent edition of one of the best works in the Star Wars franchise","review":"Heir to the Empire is a classic. It's no surprise that this book is considered by many fans to be Star Wars: Episode VII. The novel is essentially a sequel to Return of the Jedi, picking up 5 years after it left off. All the characters act just like they did in the films, and all your favorites are given a chance to shine. Unlike the prequels, the new characters introduced in this novel are interesting and alot of fun. In many ways this is what the prequel trilogy should have been, or at least the feel of it. If you are a fan of the original trilogy, I would highly recommend giving this a shot. It's an exciting read, and you might find yourself reminded why Star Wars was once one of the most quality franchises around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master Storyteller","review":"Zahn expands on the Star Wars universe in a marvelous way.

The original characters acted exactly as they should, and the new characters were awesome too without taking away from the older ones. Thrawn was cool, and so was Pallaeon, but the coolest new character of all was Mara Jade, who is officially my new favorite character. The best part of the whole book is the whole sequence when she and Luke are stuck in the forest and they have to depend on each other to survive. One thing that bothered me though, is that I simply can't picture kind, caring, sensitive Luke simply walking out on Leia like that, though I do simpathize with his feelings of self doubt. The reading level of this book is fairly high, but I had no trouble tackling it. Content wise, I'd say that just about anyone could probably read it, since nothing that bad happens in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book EVER!!!!!","review":"Heir to the Empire is a wonderful book that continues the great adventures of Luke Skywalker.

The only aspect of this story keeping it from a one-star review is Grand Admiral Thrawn, the main antagonist, with his fascinating approach to warfare, planning, and investigation.In the end, I'm puzzled as to why this book is considered a classic. It's something I would not recommend to anyone, fan of Star Wars or otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish i could make it a movie","review":"I first read this book in third grade and even thought alot of it dodnt sink in i was enticed by the overall story.

Much better than I'd expected, actually. I'm not a person who normally enjoys franchise books - AD&D;, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. But this was a real treat - it felt like a worthy successor to the original Star Wars trilogy.I wouldn't say run out, buy them, and camp out for a weekend.

I have not read the novel yet but did read all of the annotations and forward, afterward, and introductory comments and they all increased my longing to reread the story itself which I have not done for sometime. I hope that they commission a special edition for the other two books in the trilogy for their 20th!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing start to the thrawn trilogy","review":"Heir to the Empire is an amazing book by timothy zahn continuing the classic story that is STAR WARS. Zahn's writing captures the imagination of the reader and fills the mind with pulsating action and incredible dialoque that only a master sci fi writer can do. If you haven't begun to read the books that continue the STAR WARS saga, you need to begin now. This for me is the pinnacle series written for the sci fi nut!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This was, if I recall, the first book (not including the God awful Dark Empire) in like 8 years written on Star Wars. Very well written, it takes place 5 years after Return of the Jedi and an alien Grand Admiral has taken over the Empire. The book is very well written and has a strong feel of the movies without a sense of stealing from the movies. The only thing I found to be somewhat pitiful was this new Dark Jedi clone who was hiding on one of the Emperor's private planets guarding some huge secret. While this sets up for the huge climatic duel in the final book, I felt to be somewhat of poor authorship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Episode 7 - 9??","review":"Although I am new to Star Wars books I can say this trilogy is essential. As soon as you have read this review don't hesitate to purchase! The unofficial Episode 7 - 9 maybe? Although it differs from Lucas poetic rythm, it goes to prove Zahn can create Star Wars stories as well as its creator. The reason I only gave it four out of five is because Zahn needs a thesaurus badly. If he removed all the times he says \\"pursed lip, lip twitched, said conversationally, said thoughtfully, raised his blue black eyebrow, to realise he wasn't breathing...!\\" the books would be half the length! And did Thrawn go to the Batman school of conclusion making? Anywho minor gripes aside its very good.

The depth that is required and the antisipation is all there.The story ends all to quickly as you finish up the book and have 2 more books in the Thrawn Trilogy to look forward to reading and since they are already printed and reprinted many times over it is a great way to get back into Star Wars - minus dorky heros like Jar Jar Binks and read real villians like Thrawn that can be rooted for and despised at the same time and see if Luke has met his match.You will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET","review":"Just a epic book that allows the story to keep pushing foward.

I had visions of my head of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill in my head anytime one of them had a scene.

It is a great starting point for those getting into the EU and it ideally is what we would hope a possible episode 7 is. Where the Dark Empire series took a turn for the ridiculous, the Thrawn trilogy tends to go more towards subtlety. Granted there are definitely moments of, \\"Of all the spaceships in all the planets, the bad guy was right there?!?!\\" But this is not supposed to be some literary romp through space and time. This is supposed to be an entertaining adventure that gives us further insight into characters we love. No matter what Disney makes this will always be my part 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story.","review":"This is the first Star Wars book to tell a story after Return Of The Jedi. Letting you know, I have never read any of the author's other works. At least, none that weren't Star Wars. The story is that the galaxy has been at peace for five years, owing to the defeat of Darth Vader and The Emperor. Then an ex-Imperial general named Thrawn comes into the picture, with a plot involving a Jedi Master who has been missing since the beginning of the Clone Wars. His plot also has to do with creatures resistent to The Force and manipulation of Luke Skywalker. Yeah, it's crazy, but it's fun. If you are just starting to read Star Wars novels, this is a good one to begin with. As a note: this is the first part of a trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"it'll do until Episode 1","review":"It's okay.

Luke/Leia and Han getting out of every sticky situation they encounter and winning every battle. Grand Admiral Thrawn continue\`s to lose every bit of the way. Kardde and everyone else seem to \\"get over\\" on this guy and it\`s somewhat annoying that he can surmise exactly what\`s going on in the minds of the enemy which doesn\`t seem to amount to anything. Zahn to me is like Jack Higgens where you don\`t question you just read and turn the pages. Mara Jade is constantly whinning about how Luke destroyed her life and while Leia is pregnant with twins she gets blasted around at many an encounter also. The Dark Jedi (C\`Baoth)never mentions the name of the guy he defeated and the character is already rendered toothless and staid by the fact that he\`s a clone (.....0r is that \\"clown\\"?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike other i think this is boring","review":"This book is slow and drags on.

Regardless, I believe this trilogy, which essentially rekindled the Star Wars interest in 1991 which we all know has grown into a monolith juggernaut, is the ONLY good Star Wars literature of the revival period (1991-now). The characters are the best to come along: Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Joruus C'Baoth, Talon Kaard. After this trilogy, the SW novels spiraled downward as every loser who walks by the camera in every SW movie has been the star of three volumes of mediochre literature. If you are looking for new SW adventures, \\"Heir to the Empire\\" and the two sequels are the best way to go. Already vintage Star Wars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!

Nothing removes ice-cream that has been frozen hard, the way this scoop does. And it's built like a rock. Forget the twist-scooping action, just ram it into the ice-cream, twist and get a scoop.

First, our aluminum scoop would get these strange white dots on it from the dishwasher so we always had to handwash it. No problem here. It comes out of the dishwasher like new. Also, the edge of the scoop which first makes contact with the ice cream is much finer/sharper than my old one. Thus, it \\"cuts\\" the ice cream. It's so easy to use, even my 8 year old who is not particularily strong in her fingers can use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zyliss ice cream scoop","review":"This is a heavier ice cream scoop than I've used in the past, but feels very comfortable to hold. The scoop itself is more elongated than a traditional round scoop, which seems to encourage ice cream to curl up and drop out of the scoop fairly easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"scooper","review":"This is the best Ice Cream Scoop I've used.

Current one just like the first one is seriously corroded. Scoop surface appears to be chrome but not. If it is aluminum the anodizing breaks down. A different brand that was aluminum had the same problem. My guess is anodized aluminum not suitable.Generally Zyliss makes quality kitchen tools. This has serious flaw. Wrote them and they offered a new one free if I sent the old one in. Not worth the time and cost. The corrosion is serious over time. Maybe a teflon coating?Fourcents"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cadillac of Ice Cream Scoops","review":"Yes, this would be for the serious ice cream scooper. An ergonomic handle, in a choice of fab colors-among them orange and pink, a nice heft to it, and the ability to make perfect scoops that do not require a lot of effort to get the ice cream into your bowl. Very good quality and much more than I expected. This one is built to last! Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scoop","review":"I am very pleased with the scoop. It is sturdy, heavy and dishwasher safe. It does not cut through super-hard ice cream as well as it claims to, but it does a great job otherwise. We replaced a higher-end scoop (the kind with the chemicals in the handle that are supposed to soften hard ice cream) and we like this one even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and easy to use, but corrodes","review":"We've had this ice cream scoop for 4 years in the pink handle model. It's very easy to use and easily scoops ice creams. I was afraid of the coating deteriorating in the dishwasher, so we always handwash it and never leave it laying in the sink overnight in water. However, despite my efforts there are still spots of corrosion that appeared after a couple years of use. I don't think it affects the performance, but I'm slightly disappointed since these rated so highly and they seem so durable. I still would recommend it to others, but just know that handwashing won't prevent the eventual wear and tear of the scoop from happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent scoop","review":"This scoop works better than any other that I've tried.

That's very unusual for me, because I'm always on the lookout for a better scoop. Apparently, I've found the better scoop!It is very solid feeling and heavy. No worries about breaking this scoop. The handle is very easy to hold and provides good leverage.The scoop is very thick aluminum. That really helps when running it under hot water because the scoop will stay warm when it hits the frozen ice cream. Thin scoops are hardly worth heating, as they freeze almost instantly when they hit the ice cream.No gimmicks here -- it just works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - non stick coating chips off","review":"Before I bought this, I used to use a regular spoon. I would leave rock hard ice cream on the counter to soften. More often than not, I would forget about it, and would return to an inedible soupy mess. This scoop can go right through rock hard ice cream, without much effort. Don't want to know what the special chemical coating is, cause it sure works well. No rusty springs, no malfunctioning parts.POST SCRIPT 2011 - It is year three, and flakes of the special coating on the spoon part are coming off. It is scary. I am buying a different brand. Never again. I expected lifetime use.

Wound up with sorbet shreddings all over the counter. It refused to put the sorbet in a decent ball and was too wide to do the delicate work I needed. An ordinary soup spoon worked better for the purpose.Maybe it's okay dealing with five-gallon containers, but for the little stuff you'd be better off saving your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ice cream scoop I've ever owned!!!","review":"This is a sharp, hefty ice cream scoop that cuts through hard ice cream with ease.

If it does wear out, I'll buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best scoop we've used","review":"The shape of the scoop makes it possible to dig through frozen ice cream and the handle is comfortable and provides plenty of leverage. We've only hand washed ours and it looks as good as new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheds Metal","review":"Great weight and ergonomics. Digs well into hard frozen ice cream. The problem is the scoop began to degrade, pit and lose it's metal coating, revealing a darker metal under the coating. Zyliss replaced the scoop under warranty, w/o any problems. When I received the new scoop, I stopped putting it into the dishwasher, but now, about 9 months later, it is degrading even worse than the original. This is not just an aesthetic problem as it begs the question, what types of metal alloys or coatings are we possibly ingesting and what are the health impacts. Put simply, you shouldn't have to think so much about an ice cream scoop. This product should be recalled.<<<UPDATE>>>Zyliss replaced the replacement product w/o any hassle. I now leave scoop #3 it in the drawer where it seems to do fine. And no, there is no problem with my water or soap. This has not happened to anything else here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrosion on this scoop is a deal breaker.","review":"I bought this several years ago, and within a short amount of time corrosion started to set in on this scoop. It worked great up until that point. But the corrosion got so bad, I had to toss the unit when metal flakes were coming off into my icecream. Here is a photo I took of this scoop before tossing it out. [...] I can not recommend anyone purchase this until these issues are resolved by the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool, failed, now too late to return","review":"Like other reviewers - this is a really nice scoop but quickly pitted and corroded (within about two months, only hand washed).

I felt this was surely unsafe and wanted a plain metal scoop, one that was shaped like all the ones so sturdy and good at cutting into hard ice cream. It says dishwasher safe... however, after only three washes I could see the coating getting little white pits on the inside of the scoop that would not wash off by hand. Right away it became obvious this was coated too as the surface quickly got little bubbles at those spots which broke/peeled off. So sad to throw out another and keep searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"d","review":"I have had this scooper for about three years now. It was great for about the first 8-12 months, then the coating in the scoop starting to pit. I still use it, since I have not bought anything else. I like how it scoops and the ice cream does not stick too bad to it, but I don't like the pitting of the scoop.I gave it a two, since the finish in the scoop is junk and is coming off. If it was not pitting, I would have given it a 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I purchased two of these on the recommendation of my favorite food channel person. It works well. Unfortunately, just like any other scoop I purchased, it chips. I specifically did not place it in the dishwasher even though it was stated to be safe.

The rest of the characters are just as unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a quick read with interesting characters and situations. It was a little predictable, but overall it was well worth the purchase price.If you liked this book check out \\"Replay\\" by Ken Grimwood. \\"Replay\\" is one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite an eye opener","review":"If you're looking for a book about the more \\"traditional\\" aspects of the English countryside, with the vicar, the doctor, the local lord, the retired colonel and the elderly spinster who does welfare work in the village, this book is not for you. Try Elizabeth Goudge or even Agatha Christie. If you're looking for what seems to be an accurate description of rural low life in Thatcher's England, then you'll find this book interesting. It's a little wordy, but presented in an interesting way, and deeply feminist. It's the last aspect I found eye opening. It's not a fun book, being all rather gloomy, but well worth reading nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"durable and fun","review":"Got this for my 2.5 yr old and she loved it. The side fences are a little odd since there isn't anything on the sides, but if you have other sets to go with it I imagine it would be fun. This is a durable toy as it has been knocked off the shelf and dropped and pounced on and still looks & works great! I love the monkey sounds and the bird is my daughter's fave. The polar bear and lion sound the same, but hey any noise is good to a 2 yr old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to Little People community","review":"My 2 yr. old daughter loves Little People and especially if they make sounds like this one. She presses the sound pad even without the animals sitting on them. I think the grown-ups need to help show the association between the animal and the sound that belongs to it if the child doesn't understand. But overall it's a fun toy which has been added to our Little People \\"community\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"For laughs!","review":"This Little People Animal Sounds Zoo is great for laughs! My 2 year old literally fell over laughing with the first sight-and sound-which happened to be the monkey. Several reviewers commented on the fake animal sounds, but this IS a toy, and it is hilarious. I even smiled at the cute \\"rar\\" the lion made. Kids love it, and it makes me laugh watching them enjoy it and enjoying it with them. True, all toys are best with on/off switches. It would be nice if this had one. So far this is the funniest Little People set I've seen, and we have 6 different ones. Enjoy! As always, test it out first if in doubt or save the receipt and return it if you don't like it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Toy","review":"This was one of the toys my 23-month old received for Christmas this year. He seems to really enjoy it, it's his 3rd Little People playset. I believe the toy is educational when coupled with adult interaction. When he pushes one of the animal sounds buttons I let him know the name of the animal. He seems to understand & I know it won't be long before he begins to say the names himself. I would recommend this Little People playset."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unimaginative toy","review":"My two year old son received this as a birthday gift and he and his four year old brother played with it for about 30 minutes until the novelty of the animal sounds wore off and then they went off to play with other things, never to give the toy another glance. I think the reason for this is that there is very little the child can do with this toy. The child can put the animals in their pens and press the buttons to make the sounds but this toy does not encourage imagination or creativity. Because my children have access to many simple, open-ended toys like building blocks, train sets, and tinker toys, toys that are flashy but don't allow for many different ways of playing don't hold their interest for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Little People Toy","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old twins and they just love it! The construction is more durable than some of the other Little People sets and it was nice to have it already assembled. The sounds are great! Our favorite is the sweet tune of the little blue bird. The seal is very cute too. I purchased 2 of the extra animal add-on sets. With these, we can complete the fence around the entire zoo and have the extra animals that the add-on sets provide. This is an excellent toy for Little People fans and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter learned animal sounds!","review":"I just bought this for my 18 month old girl and she loves it! We set it all up on her little table and she sits down at least 2 or 3 times a day to play with it. The sounds it makes are great and she is now making all of them on cue! She especially loves the lion sound. I am a huge fan of the Little People toys (or anything Fisher Price) and this is another great one. We already have the farm, so she can play with the two together. I did purchase the extra animals for the zoo, but I don't think she gets as much from those since they don't make the sounds. All in all this is a great toy and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"zoo fun","review":"my daughter had fun playing with this toy. now my twin boys that are 1 year old love this. they have fun pushing the places that make noise. they will sit and play with this for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRRREAT toy!","review":"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift when she was 9 1/2 mos old. She loved it from the start and still loves it today at 14 1/2 mos old. She LOVES pushing the buttons to hear the sounds that lion, polar bear, elephant and a bird make. She loves making the \\"boing\\" and the monkey sounds, too! In fact, we used this set to introduce her to many different animal sounds. Since she was (and in many cases still is) unable to pronounce the name of the animals, we taught her to make the sound that the animal makes. For example, a lion and bear growl, and so does she. We made up a \\"chomping\\" sound for the camel and a \\"Ppppbbt\\" for an elephant. It sounds silly, crazy even, but it worked for us. When asked for a certain animal, she's able to make the sound, and pick out the animal all by herself. This toy is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"There is not much to do for my curious two year-old. He can make the monkey jump, open and close the pens, push the car around. The animal sounds are shrill and after pressing the buttons a few times my son lost interest. So, after five minutes of play, he never touched it again. He does love the animals, but the zoo is useless. The garage is so much more fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it but I would change a few things","review":"First of all, I have to say that my 19 mo daughter loves this toy. She plays with it frequently, and always tries to put all her animals in a single space.Now, I find myself playing with this toy too, and here's my honest feedback: I would like there to be additional extensions for the fence so you can make a large, fully-attached circle around the entire zoo. I would make the slide a bit wider so the seal could slide down easily. I would make the monkey removable in order hold and play with him.Otherwise, this toy is lots of fun and my daughter probably would not change a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This book is life changing. I first met Bob through his son, my schoolmate Chris, in Malaysia, and thought he was Just another friend's dad(don't take it personally Bob, you were all like that:). After more than ten years, I arranged to visit Bob, his wife Judy, and my old school mate Chris. I was advised by Chris to read the book as a precursor to meeting Bob, so as not to \\"shock\\" me when I met him again. HOW WRONG COULD CHRIS BE!!! Bob's vitality, energy, and will to live life to it's fullest, regardless of the obstacles, should be a lesson to all so called able-bodied-people.

So I bought Vespers to familiarize myself with Mr. Rovin. WOW! I tore through this book faster than the bats tearing through their victims. A great summer read that'll keep you turning pages in excitement (and may even make you brush your hands through your hair a couple of times). Sure it's sci-fi and deals with giant monsters. But it's a FUN READ! Do yourself a favor and get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As I get older I've come to resent anything that is a waste of time. This book falls in that category. It was poorly written, uninformed, unbelievable and generally dull. The high point of the book was in the first few pages when a 600-plus pound deer is found dead up in a tree. As a devoted white-tailed deer watcher I can only imagine what a magnificent specimen this was. Truly a North American record-sized animal. Unfortunately the author would have us believe that 600 pounds is the average size of a full-grown deer. It went downhill from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay read but somewhat predictable and lacking suspense.","review":"A combination of \\"The Relic\\", \\"Ben\\", \\"Godzilla\\", and \\"Ghostbusters\\" but lacking in true terror, suspense, or interest. The author has taken tried and true plot lines and replaced the protagonists with bats. There is some chemistry between the two main characters but, other than this, much of the action is predictable and the writing wooden and simplistic. Some good information about how bats live, mate, and feed was provided but if you are looking for a good horror or suspense story, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT TO KNOW HOW THIS GOT PUBLISHED","review":"I've read a book a week.

I even had one flying six inches or so one night over my pool. While I sat out reading this, I couldn't help buit find myself getting very bord. Not a good book. Story line is a little too much!

It hasn't been written by Anne Rice, or Stephen King, or anyone else but Wright himself. Sure, it has the angst-filled vampire, Elmo Land, but he's got great reason to feel angst--he's becoming human again, and is also literally falling apart. He's becoming human because he's become unnecessary--supplanted by the evil of a third world war. There's LOTS more to this novel than that. The characterizations are wonderful and the story itself crackles with humor and negative energy. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want a Weird Snore-fest?

Then another witch scenario came on in a few minutes. Finally scenes from the movie \\"Dracula\\" were inserted complete with dracula raising his head from biting someone's neck while the announcer went on about him drinking blood.
