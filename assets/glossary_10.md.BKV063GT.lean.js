I would recommend this book to any reader of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"ADAGIOS\\" -BOSTON POPS directed by Arthur Fiedler","review":"This album can best be described as part of the very best of the late Arthur Fiedler \\"Boston Pops\\". But then virtually everything they recorded before and during Fielder's decades long tenure and even after Fiedler was and still is the best. In my opinion the \\"crown jewel\\" of this great album is Fiedler's version of George Gershwin's, \\"Porgy & Bess\\" \\"Summertime\\". I believe BMG/Sony should compile the entire recordings which date back to the 40's and 50's \\"Porgy & Bess\\" musical by the \\"Pops\\" and re-ssue them in one or two CD's. \\"Porgy & Bess\\" was one of Fiedler's very best masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boston Pops, Arthur Fiedler conductor","review":"This without a doubt is the worst of the worst of all the Pops recordings.

I actually read the first review again and then compared to that at the back of the book and my assumption is that the first reviewer (A reader) is somehow connected to the benefit from this book.If you have read the book then you will understand my subsequent statement. After reading the book I feel exactly like a donkey carrying a load of speeches with no wise content. Too bad I have wasted my money. It is like listening to a hypomanic (mild) patient talking. I thought with more recent congress the author should get better but it is just the same. I lost my patience and threw the book on page 190.Hopefully others will be careful before ordering this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice table for the price.","review":"This turned out to be a nice little table for the phone in the upstairs hallway of our old house.

Even so it is a magnificent recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!","review":"This is the most amazing recording I've ever heard of Mendelssohn, and Beethoven's violin concertos. Joshua Bell plays with such incredible passion that it's almost magical. I love the cadenzas that he wrote for both of them even better than the original ones that went with the concertos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"All right, he's cute. But I can name 5 recordings of the Mendelssohn (beginning with Menuhin and ending with Hahn) and 5 recordings of the Beethoven (beginning with Hahn and ending with Menuhin) better than this one, so why buy it?It's all about marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mendelssohn; Violin Concerto, Op.64/ Beethoven; Violin Concerto, Op.","review":"I was fortunate to see and hear this beautiful music played by Joshua Bell. My favorite was Beethoven's Violin concerto which touched my heart, so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances","review":"These performances are amazing, but there are better. For Mendelssohn, my top choices are Heifetz and Milstein. For Beethoven, my top choices are Oistrakh and Menuhin. Nevertheless, his cadenzas do make this an interesting buy. After hearing the usual Mendelssohn cadenza, it is nice to hear something new. The Beethoven cadenza is written very well and I actually prefer it over the often performed Joachim cadenza. Buy this CD if you want great performances, but if you want excellent performances go with my suggested recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Violinist","review":"I don't know why people are attracted to Bell's playing. I think part of it is due to his public image as the young sexy violinist that all the girls like....Stay away from this recording! Honestly, the Mendelssohn is overly sentimental, and the Beethoven was not serious as all! I preferred the way Menuhin played it, with grace and style and elegance. Sorry, I hate it when people like Bell butcher up two most famous violin pieces. Get the Menuhin/Furtwangler recording. Even the audio is bad, Menuhin's interpretations are SUPREME!I'm done now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not great","review":"This is a fine recording of two of the greatest violin concertos in the standard repetoire. Although Bell's playing is usually excellent, it seems a little unsteady at times; not sloppy (not at all!) just not as tight as it could be. This might be okay if he brought something new to the interpretation of these pieces, but alas, he does not. The result is simply a better than average performance that doesn't really shine.If you're looking for a truly spectacular recording of the Beethoven concerto, pick up Hilary Hahn's absolutely flawless and sparkling rendition. You will not be disappointed.I still must recommend this Joshua Bell CD however if for no other reason than that he has contributed his own cadenzas to these standard works. I love to see young violinists make this effort as it can breathe new life into a tired piece. It makes a nice change of pace. However, if you're looking for your first versions of these concertos, you might try looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"How My Family Lives In America","review":"This is a great multi-cultural book!

I have a first class Cambridge degree in physics, have sailed and raced various boats (dinghies and sailboards) for 30 years and designed one fast dinghy. I thought I was one smart dude. Words begin to fail me. Wow! I wish I had known this lot 30 years ago. It turns out that I was pig ignorant. The book is the best I have ever seen on what the wind does. It's the best ever on how to handle it. It's extremely good on rigs and how to adjust them. It's not just the best ever, it's streets ahead. Don't expect to read it quickly. There is a vast amount to take in. If you really know your stuff you might get through it in a few weeks. Better to plan on a whole winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid reading for a sailing scientist","review":"It's a great book, although I don't think it's something for the average sailer. A vast knowledge of science will help you understanding this book much better. The book is devided into four parts, of which I especially found the first two parts, named wind and water, very usefull. Wind is not just the story about high and low pressures, it's also translated to the effects you see on the water and the action that needs to be taken for maximum benefit. The water part is a good explanation about wave paterns and how to sail it. Parts three and four, called The Boat and Handeling, I found less usefull. It's better to buy a book who's specific on your type of yacht than reading a general story about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADO templates don't work (Ch 15)","review":"This book is fairly decent, except that the template code for \\"Connecting to Databases with ADO\\" (Chapter 15) is riddled with errors. Most of this is probably due to problems with Access versions and configuration, but in any case, templates that don't work are frustrating and useless. There is absolutely no errata information for this book on the Wiley web site, and Wiley doesn't take inquiries, regardless of the notes in the front of the book.

Love it. Wish they made one for larger objects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light tent but still limited !","review":"This tent is very good, but you can't make the light easily from the background, I think this light tent must be developed for more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My recipe photos look right out of a magazine now!","review":"I bought this after hearing how useful it was for food photography. I maintain a recipe blog (dawnsrecipes.com), and the lighting conditions in my kitchen are less than ideal. You can see some examples of the photos I've taken with Photo Studio-in-a-Box at my site...that is, assuming Amazon doesn't remove the link.There were only 2 things I didn't like that led to the 4 star rating:First, the camera stand doesn't go low enough for some of the angles I need, and can't support larger cameras well. This isn't a big issue for me as I have a tripod I love already (Joby GP1-0BEN Gorillapod Flexible Tripod (Blue)).Second, the blue/gray reversible background doesn't really work for me. I had to spend another $20 to get the black/white background. There's also a purple/green background for anyone who might find that useful. Both the black/white and the purple/green backgrounds are available directly from American Recorder. Too bad Amazon doesn't carry them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"The idea of this is great. The light box part is fine (although I would prefer a white background to blue and grey) and the package is slick. It's true you get what you pay for though. The lamps start heating up quickly and smell horribly and cannot be turned off without almost burning your hand. There are extensive warning notes all over the instructions about fire...they must know it runs too hot. Also, the 'camera stand' is awkward and worthless. Just use a regular tripod if you need to get this for a cheap, temporary solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Investment","review":"I had been shopping for a light tent for some time and had even resorted to making a temporary one out of a hanging file folder frame. Worked so-so but wasn't something I wanted to travel to job sites with.Saw this at $66 and thought, \\"Why not give it a shot\\".Took it out on a product shoot just after I received it. Works like a champ, looks professional, and transports easily.The camera stand seemed a little lightweight for my Rebel DSLR until I removed the battery grip.Overcame the camera shake on long (2.5 second) exposures by using an IR remote shutter release.This was well worth the investment and I can strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous, beware","review":"The whole thing is flimsy and cheap, but the lights are dangerously so. One light refused to work, then somehow started working and smoking. It took 20 minutes to get the burnt plastic smoke smell out of the apartment. Definite fire hazard. Definite health hazard from the plastic fumes. Not worth $6, let alone $60.Also the tripod is useless for any but a tiny camera. I would recommend you get a decent tripod (even the $20 tripods are better), then take a trip to Ikea and buy a few halogen desk lamps. Or, spend the bucks and get something better.If you do buy this, for pity's sake DO NOT LEAVE THE LIGHTS UNATTENDED, you risk starting a fire.Time to test the returns policy...ADDENDUM: Adorama was great in dealing with the return. So while I still think the product is substandard and even dangerous, the vendor is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not powerful enough","review":"I make jewelry and wanted a home lighting system to take pictures of my pieces. The bulbs get very hot and smell but they don't seem to be powerful enough to shed enough light on objects inside the box. One of the bulbs started sparking the first time I used it. The camera stand isn't as stable as it looks, either. You really need a tripod to do this kind of work. I'm going to get better bulbs and use my own tripod but keep the light box and try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photo Studio-in-a-Box","review":"This is a nice compact unit which allows easy photographing of small items. It could be 5 stars with the addition of an instruction booklet which includes tips on getting better photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save a picture because there are no instructions","review":"The price was right. Everything was in good working order. I am an amateur, but I figured out how to set everything up. I was taking photos for an online auction and I had to experiment a bit to get usable photos. Some tips or instructions would have been appreciated. And it would be nice if the camera stand could be adjusted up and down."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"The phototent works great however replacement bulbs are very hard to find. Once the bulbs burn out good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I just got my new photo box today. I was so excited I opened it at work. Then I took a picture of my wendy's salad just to see how it looked. The quality of the pictures are excellent(macro mode). Light is evenly distributed.Caution about the lights:The lights get really hot really fast. Untouchable within 2min. after I turn them on. I suggest for the shear sanctity of safety, shut off the lights between object/scene changes.The package arrived intact, the box was beat up a little, nothing major. When I opened the item, I noticed the Camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom. This could've been a bad/weak stitch, or may have happened during shipping, but nothing major was wrong, only that. Besides, I can sew it!Overall, this is a great product, and is easy to setup and carry around. I'd definitely buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tennessee Gardener magazine","review":"living in Tennesee the articles and photos will directly relate to my gardening activities......I have received my first issue and am very glad I have ordered such a specific magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, long lived, heavy duty printer","review":"We have two of these at work.

User maintenance is easy. Software provides indicates of toner life and maintenance kit intervals. Our printers duplex and staple. Maintenance kits are relatively pricey, but last for about 100,000 pages. These printers don't seem to frequently jam.We have had some issues with using non-HP OEM toner cartridges, and have had to replace network cards somewhat frequently.Both are still going strong, but I have purchased a replacement HP printer with a faster print speed.Only missing feature on the 4200 that I would like to have is a copy collator.Note: Comments apply to 110v model."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece.","review":"Hauntingly filmed, this film is like a moving work of art. In typical Japanese style, even the shots of nature seem to be choreographed by the director to become an integral part of the story. The extra on this disc are also very welcome in that they show the team as they film the piece and make you realise how, under the skillful direction of a great director, the camera can turn the most ordinary surroundings into magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Onibaba (1964) - Kineto Shindo","review":"Onibaba is a film that is almost all atmosphere. From the great cinematography, to the drum beat soundtrack, to the unique and quite exotic performances of the lead actresses, there is never a single moment when you feel you've left this haunting place. The location, dominated by the tall grass that weaves in the wind, becomes a character in it's own right. The mix of both horror and folklore give the film a true form of originality. There are, however, a few plot holes that detract from the overall feel of the story, but Onibaba is a really good film that creates an incredible atmosphere allowing it to transcend the confines of it's genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh man, this is a scary movie!","review":"OK, it probably helped that I saw this film in a college dining hall when it first came out, and not comfortably ensconced on my couch with a PAUSE button. But you still won't catch me running through tall grass in the dark!As more than one reviewer has noted, the swamp grass is one of the main characters of this film. What an accomplishment!I would rank this with Throne of Blood as great Japanese film. The acting is superb. The story is gripping. The musical accompaniment is intense and cosmopolitan. Not a month has gone buy over the last 30 years that I haven't been scared of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALLOW ME TO BE FRANK...BUY MoC INSTEAD OF CRITERION.","review":"The features on Criterion disc is almost horrible. Not only the image quality is not good as expected, but also the special features are not superior to other editions. Just buy the EUREKA MoC editions #13. The EUREKA one included all features on Criterion disc, and besides, a bonus booklet and ALEX COX introduction. The image quality was more proper for a dual-layer disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"vacuous adoration -- the death trap of a bad movie","review":"There is much to say of my surprise at the shimmering reviews this pathetic second rate Japanese movie has received here on Amazon. It is this very incongruency that compelled me to interject a grain of lucidity into this vat of oily adulation. Let's be honest about it -- the movie is horrendous, has very little artistic value, unless you consider the very repetitive shots of the pampas rustling in the wind to be art, and a mundane plot. The only virtues possessed by this flick are its obscurity and er badness -- all requisites for a drinking game with a bunch of degenerated con-vivants. Onibaba is NOT in the same ballpark as Kurosawa by a very long shot. I much rather recommend Kwaidan as far as old Japanese horror goes. Hope you don't fall into the snares, but if you must, don't be fooled into the pretense of substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A STINKER!","review":"This is one of the worst movies i have ever watched. Poor acting and poor plot. Silly ending. It starts out rather exciting then it starts going downhill like a rocket. The movie is also pornographic. It turns into a porno about 50 minutes into it. If you must watch it, rent it. If you want a great and spooky japanese thriller, watch kwaidon. It is a 5 star production. Four seperate tales that are awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but 1 Missing","review":"A good Compilation but the greatest film song of all time is Missing, Over the Rainbow. Now I'm not complaining The Man that got away is included but please this is one of the greatest songs of the 20th let alone the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun to listen to","review":"This is an interesting collection of songs from movie soundtracks. I am not sure what criteria they used in deciding which tunes to include, as they seem to be all over the place - there are tunes by Al Jolson, Mae West, Bing Crosby, Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Streisand, Bob Dylan, Will Smith, and many others.Yeah, it's quite an eclectic mix of different styles and eras. It's a lot of fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Song","review":"It had the song on it i was looking for, so i was happy about that. it has a very wide range older ones to not so old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, great arrangement, GREAT!","review":"The music to \\"Crazy For You\\" is just plain fun, for lack of a better word.

For any music lover or lover of musicals, this songbook is a must-have for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente!!","review":"I have been a fan of Julieta Venegas for several years now. I believe this is her best album yet for several reasons: it isn't as moody as earlier albums yet not as carefree as \\"Si\\". This album has excellent and catchy tracks that are easy to enjoy. I believe the fact that some fans don't enjoy her latest albums is a testimony to how she has changed and evolved over the years, true fans will love anything she does! You have to find a reason as to why she has made more \\"pop\\" tracks than actual rock, it is her art and she can write the way that she needs to, to get her message across.\\"De que me sirve\\" is awesome and \\"Las canciones de amor\\" will hook you as soon as you pop this cd in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busca otras alternativas","review":"Disco totalmente comercial, el cual solo busca eso; vender discos.La Venegas de la epoca de cds como \\"AQUI\\" esta olvidada en el pasado.

The horns are great and the beat really does make you want to get up and dance. They blend pop, reggae, world, and jazz together and make it work. The steel drums give this band a unique sound and when you add in the female vocals you get a sizzling combo.They're all great tunes, but my favorites are Right Love, Wrong Time(which could be a hit with its infectious hook) and Boy Crazy...Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"This book is a collection of LOTS of nursery rhymes, riddles, and charms, some familiar and many now obscure. There is an introduction tying certain rhymes to events in English history, but it assumes the reader is already very familiar with English history and isn't the best introduction to the topic for the modern American reader.Overall, it was difficult to read because of the formatting. There were a lot of random numbers (maybe placeholders where pictures were in the original), but they mixed in with the occasional footnote, creating a confusing reading experience.If you are interested in old nursery rhymes, this would be a neat reference to have on-hand, but it doesn't make for a good cover-to-cover reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't find a better CD around. Get ready to feel good.","review":"This CD is simply amazing. I bought it expecting to get three great tracks. However, the entire CD is outstanding.

If there is one CD you have to have, this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something? THIS ALBUM STINKS!","review":"I must be out of some loop cause I bought this album and hated it! The music is totally repeatative and it evokes nothing new or special to electronic music. The rhythms are weak and boring. That's probably the reason why the album isn't a continous mix. I've tried listening to this album more than once thinking that it would grow on me... NO SUCH LUCK. This albums stinks. The only song on here, for which I bought this album for, that is half way decent is his cover of \\"The Way\\". I just can't understand why this guy is so popular in Europe?! Aren't those guys alot more savvy when it comes to dance music? I guess I was mistaken. TRUST ME, this album really sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I were you, I wouldn't buy it","review":"Everybody hates Gigi in Europe. This album is awful, filled with cheesy eurodance songs which are only played in the early evening sessions in the discos, the children sessions.

Just to sum up: it's really pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mix of techno dance music!","review":"I heard one of Gigi's songs on the radio and figured he'd probably be another one hit wonder, but I had a gift certificate and figured what the heck, I'll try it. I love it! It hasn't been out of my CD player since I got it! There is a great mix of different styles and beats. I like the first CD, Chansons for the Heart, better than the second, Beats for the Feet, but only because I like a few more words mixed in with the beats. I'd definitely recommend it if you like techno music. I'm ready to try another of his albums..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Eurodance Ever","review":"Euro dance is very underated and this album really gives the genre a shot in the arm.

Very catchy, very straight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bliss","review":"In Europe a few years ago I used to hear \\"I'll Fly With You\\" in clubs. I made a mental note to look for it back in the states, and totally forgot about it. For some reason this morning it popped into my mind, and I downloaded it. No wonder it stuck in my head. It has that Eruopop quality (assembled to bridge multiple cultures) and it's such a cheery, bright, optimistic, dancefloor track. It's been a lousy year but this song booming from my speakers makes me forget for a while. It starts with a sped-up female voice (sounds almost like Petula Clark).One wants to imagine that the hot-looking dj is also the owner of this handsome tenor singing voice, but it's probably just a hired studio voice. Nevertheless, listening to him strive to hit the top of his range is sublime. Everything good about the world is in this song. It can cure a mopey mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"On time & fabulous","review":"I ordered this the day before a road trip, and received it on time and in great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend it...","review":"I have not bought the cd but I know some of the songs of this cd and personally it would recommend it.

Long overdue!! Hogwood is of course an excellent interpreter/player, and these pieces are wonderful. The clavichord itself is a bit of an odd/unusual sounding instrument, even for one who truly appreciates period instrumentation. It's a bit of a cross between a harpsichord and an early fortepiano, sound-wise, and I'm not sure one would want to listen to more than one clavichord LP per day, but that said the instrument seems to bring out new and unusual nuances that I've never really appreciated in Mozart's keyboard pieces generally, even the piano sonatas on fortepiano. If you love Bach, Handle, Mozart and Hayden, and especially their solo keyboard works, this recording is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a copy","review":"I received a home-made copy of the R.

How good of an idea does this sound?Lets take a standard, crappy, 15 cent ball-point pen and shape the body like an astronaut because, sure, an astronaut is a comfortable shape to hold in your hand. Now, lets put fins on the feet of the astronaut. Why fins? Your guess is as good as mine. Now here's the gem: you can install astronaut into a spring loaded \\"Launch Pad\\" for display on your desk. When you push the red \\"Ignition Control\\" button on the pad the pen launches 24 inches off of your table and lands - ball-point end down - stabbing the most important document on your table. If you attempt to catch the Astronaut before it seek-and-destroys your paper work you get shanked by the pen's business end. Why anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enigmatic lagbaja","review":"It's really hard to classify Lagbaja's style. It's not really straight afrobeat but mixes in juju, jazz and other elements I can't even begin to mention. What is certain is that he's one of the most innovative musicians around today. From the moment you pop in the CD and listen to lagbaja's commentary on the absurdity of ethnic discrimination \\"Me and you no be enemy\\", you are in good hands.A minor grouse I have with the CD is that in my opinion it does not actually feature the best of Lagbaja. Surely, a compilation of Lagbaja's best work would include \\"Africalypso\\", the classic \\"Coolu temper\\" which has become a catch phrase in Nigeria, and \\"Baby Ta Ni Ko Fe wa\\". No matter, what is featured is still great. I don't think I have ever heard anything from Lagbaja I disliked.

I was hoping for something as tight, solid, and intense as Carlos's earlier works.The style of writing, the subject matter, and the voice of this book are different than those of the previous texts. This book is more lose, more narcissistic. And while it doesn't have the structure of the older books, I find it soullessly formulaic in its execution.I was willing to believe in the extraordinary characters like Don Genaro, Don Juan, Dona Solidad, and the rest. With this book, I find myself becoming bored and not willing to take that leap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but it's not Carlos...","review":"A decent read and contains some interesting tidbits. Clearly written by a scholar in linguistics, Carlos was an anthropologist. Has some well written linguistic insights. Has a rehash of Carlos's work but I have to say I find much of it unconvincing. Don Juan asked Carlos to thank 2 people who had helped him on his way. This thanks what not in any way spiritual but consisted of giving them material objects. The real Don Juan would have laughed himself senseless at such folly.So, I give this book 2 stars because it has some value but no more since it gives itself out to be something it is not. Carlos never wrote this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe Carlos wrote this book","review":"The style of this work leads me to think it is a collection of writings - perhaps some by Carlos - that were assembled by an editor to turn out another book (after Carlos had passed?).There is really nothing new here, though that can be said for some other volumes also, and I don't think it should be considered part of the Castaneda legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole purpose is to erase your ego.","review":"I became acquainted with the Active Side of Infinity during a workshop at UCLA in 1996 where excerpts from this book were read. I would say after reading this book that it isn't going to be understood very easily unless you are interested in the idea of erasing your personal history. At first it seems odd to read about every sort of personalistic nuance from Mr. Castaneda's life. Why would he do it? The most disturbing idea is that there is something within all of us that will one day fail totally, the question is are you intersted in heading off the inevitable and ridding yourself of the terrible truth of your ego or are you oblivious to such a quest. Mr. Castaneda failed. This is quite obvious. The question for his readers is do you find the tools in this book to aid you in the removal of the real problems we face. Where Mr. Castaneda failed perhaps the Nagual was successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have read this before","review":"This is the same old tired writing from Castenda that origanlly was very good in the sixties and sevnties.

Like the others, it was a gripping read from start to finish. Casteneda was truly a gifted writer. How else do you explain his ability to write so convincingly about ethereal matters? I am, however, left with one nagging question: Was it real? If so, then we as humans are really in the dark, living as we do in our world of concepts, constructs and perceptions.

Beautiful acting, and you feel deeply for every single character.The film occurs in the present as this charming elderly couple (in their 70s, we must assume) reunite and try to recast their previous love to conform to the truth they have just discovered: that the bond forged in their youth has only grown stronger with the passage of half a century.

At this point, many more months down the road, the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all, so I am looking for a (non-detachable) replacement.

This personal point of view can be a great bonus, but on the other hand has its drawbacks for those who are looking for a more accurate story about Japan.

That's one item for enjoyment, along with a new track, \\"Autumn Goodbye\\" which I find so GOOD! Though if you happen to have two club dance remixes of the title track on this CD, rest assured you can give them a pass - BOTH sound really DUMB to me, and it's because of that I think this only deserves a 4-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney tops the charts!","review":"Amazing song!

While it is a bit difficult to put 2 suet cakes in at a time, I have done so in the past. What I normally do, though, is start with one seed / suet cake and add a second cake when the birds have eaten enough of the first cake to enable both cakes to fit. Once this cycle is in place, I add a new cake when one of the cakes becomes too small and end up always having 2 cakes in the feeder.The latch can be tightened by adjusting (bending) the hook. Once the latch is properly adjusted, the feeder will remain closed until either you or a squirrel opens it.I especially like the roof, as it keeps the suet / seed cake from getting wet. Since the feeder is a 'cage' on 5 sides, it attracts birds that like to feed upright, sideways and upside down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suet pops out and does not fit right.","review":"The latch pops open and the hook is too large.The feeder falls to ground easily and the 2 suet cakes move back and forth ,because there is too much room, making it hard for the birds to eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I bought two of these kits for my sons, ages 3 and 7.

Character development was good, both for the main and supporting characters. Descriptions were vivid, allowing the reader to readily imagine the scenes depicted.One of the more interesting aspects of this book is the illustration of the point that different groups will write different histories of the same events, a fact sometimes forgotten by writers in this genre. This becomes a major issue as the story progresses, and once what actually happens is determined, action can be taken.Overall, not the best book I've read, but worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started off average- improved as it went on","review":"I was ready to give the book 3 stars for the first half, because although it wasn't bad, it was a bit hard to follow without chapter breaks for different POVs and a small sprinkling of grammatical errors (I got the Kindle version from Lisle's site, so the printed works may be different).

There are layers of story unfolding, and the layers are punctuated by the singing of Paul Robeson at intervals, giving a depth and weight to the already intense story. A few viewers may not like the parts where Daniel talks about the many forms of execution, but this is a small part of the film.

About one month after I received it, it fried. First to go was the wireless. The ports died shortly thereafter. The router was unusually hot so I think it has a design flaw. Unfortunate since, up to now, I have never had any issues with Linksys products. I attempted to exchange it for a new one from CTBooks26; however, they quoted a 21 day return policy. They refused to exchange the item and advised me to go through the Linksys warranty program.

It lacks support to connect to any remotely-secured wireless network. So if your network has a hidden SSID, uses WEP/WAP/TKIP/etc you won't be able to connect to it.Even still, broadcast signal was quite week.On a positive note, the device is tiny and comes with a durable case and nice Cat-5 cord. The retractable plug is a nice touch.And to be totally fair, I haven't tried the unit to connect to a wired network and then broadcast wirelessly. I might end up returning it before ever trying, though, because it did not meet my intial needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blocks Packets/Not Compatible with Other Linksys Routers","review":"We purchased this router for business use during travel. To access content inside the corporate firewall we use Nortel's VPN software - which works great with the D-link travel router. Unfortunately this Linksys router blocks the packets necessary for setting up the communicaiton (even after we manually opened the ports needed for communication). Calls to technical support resulted in suggestions to use DMZ and static IP on the connected PC's - both of which are unacceptable for shared secure access - and also not necessary with the D-link travel router or other Linksys routers. The code on this router is very dissapointing as was the support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Looks good on paper, but has severe issues:1. You cannot use it to access an encrypted network. Common, Linsys, would it hurt you to add WEP support for public network??2. Looses connection often.

Being a long time client of Linksys I have come to expect the kind of flawless setup and full feature set. The novelty in this unit is that it may also connect to the internet wirelessly (other than the usual broadband wired connection). I have had a few travel routers (DLink PocketRouter, 3Com Travel Router as well as Linksys Compact Router). I have been replacing them in the order above and now have moved to the WTR54GS as my travel and mobile unit. I believe that now I'll settle down for this unit for a while.A great travel package includes a PDA such as the iPAQ 5550 with LifeView LifeJAcket and ThinkOutside StowAway bluetooth keyboard and mouse, as well as the Linksys WTR54GS. With that one can use a hotel TV as monitor, keyboard and mouse and still enjoy a wireless connection in the room and neighbourhood. All works superbly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel Router","review":"This works extremely well in hotels with high-speed internet access. Very straightforward and simple to use. One caution, though: do change the default password, as anyone else in the hotel can access your router too (and change the password -- happened to me). Other than that, you can connect 2 computers and pay for only 1 connection, and use all your computer anywhere in the room. Linksys tech support is also one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed!","review":"This router works flawlessly for what I need. I have used it with a wired WAN connection and a wireless one (contrary to another review which claimed this feature did not work), although I did not try it on a secured (WEP/WPA) wireless access point.I used the wired LAN connection to connect to my VOIP box (which I then hooked up to a two-line wireless phone) and so was able to easily take both home-office phone numbers on the road.

While the piano concerto is also very beautifully played, there are many similarly satisying recordings of the concerto. There is nothing like the performance of these sonatas, at least not that I know of. The feature distinguishing it from all the rest is the inner truth: you listen to the music, and you can hearly believe everything it is telling you.You may think you know these sonatas very well, but when you hear Gilels playing them for the first time, they'll be completely new for you.I would purchase it even if only for the sake of these two sonatas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Gilels as expected","review":"I am a huge Gilels fan and this CD doesn't disappoint.The fantasia is the trademark Gilels slow tempo, but that just makes it so much more delicate.The K310 sonata is now one of my favourites sonatas. Brilliantly played. On par with his Beethoven sonatas maybe?The concerti are all very good.

She will fiddle with it for a couple of minutes and then move on to something else. I just don't think it really does enough or has enough to do on it to hold her attention.

My son loves it. In two days, he started saying some of the sounds that the letters make that he previously hasn't said. He hasn't started saying any of the words yet but he is paying alot of attention to them. He also likes the songs that this toy plays. One of the songs says touch your nose, touch your toes and my son follows along touching his nose and toes. He already knew how to do this but it's really cute to watch him play along. It assures me that he is paying attention and may encourage him to start saying the words since he is already starting to say the sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is so cute","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandson Liam. It is such a cute toy. Its a bus with a carry handle and 3 of the leapfrog characters in it which are removable. The letters of the alphabet are all around the middle of the bus. You push the letter to hear either a song or something that begins with that letter. The wheels roll so that your baby can \\"drive\\" his bus to. A really cute toy with easy learning involved--I'm really glad I bought this---as usual Leapfrog has exceptional toys and very durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning toy!","review":"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday. For a while he only really played with it because it was a bus, but at about 15 months, he really started playing with it and pushing all the little letter buttons. At about 22 months, he could tell me what more than half the letters were, and at 2 years (his birthday was this weekend) he knows them all. He also really likes dancing to the music it plays. It's one of his favorite toys, and it's educational. You can't beat it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too similar to all other Leap Frog Toys","review":"I would love this toy so much more, if it were at all different than the Learning Table or the Alphabet magnents.

You would think they could be a bit more creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just ok.","review":"Compare to many of leapfrog products( in this price range)this one is so basic. No lights, creative sounds or many options. It sounds out letters and plays the same alphabet song heard in other leapfrog items we own. The easy to remove characters on the bus are quickly misplaced by toddlers, so the songs that come from pressing these characters is often not heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep an eye on the paint","review":"Our one year old received this as a Christmas gift and seemed to really like it-especially the three frogs whom she gnawed on (as one a teething toddler can). About two weeks after Christmas we discovered that the paint was chipping & peeling off of the frogs. After taking the toy away, we emailed Leapfrog & after no reply we phoned. We've had a rather protracted experience during which not one person has asked if our daughter is fine (she is according the lead test) and where there seems to be a rather blase attitude about this issue. Be very alert with regard to the paint on this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun","review":"I bought this for my son on his first birthday. He loved taking the little frogs out and playing with them for the first few months we had it, but then as his hand-eye coordination improved, he really loved pushing the little letter buttons and listening to all of the sounds and songs. He just turned 3 and still oves his little school bus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, educational but HAZARDOUS!!!","review":"I got this toy for my son because I thought it has many educational features. After a week, the paint is chipped on one of the frogs. Grant it my son was probably chewing on the frog because he is teething. But that is what makers of kid toys should expect and prepare for. Since the paint on the frogs is not durable, I have to confiscate all the frogs and just allow my son to play with the bus. He still enjoys it but this is not the full potential for this toy. I am thinking of returning it because there is no toy educational enough that I should put my child's health in danger. Paint chips are just NOT acceptable in children's toys. Leapfrogs should know better and invest a little more in ensuring this toy is of health and safety standard. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissolving paint","review":"Okay, we've had this toy in our house for about 6 mo. now and my 18 mo loves it. Today I picked up the frog with the red jacket and noticed a patch of sticky smeared paint. It looks like my daughter probably chewed on it. I used a wet cloth to wipe the toy and WATER dissolved an entire patch of the red paint. In the past I have been quite happy with Leapfrog toys, but this is terrible quality. If you have this toy in your house, please check the paint on the frogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sampling of pop music!","review":"This is a great mixed bag of pop music from the 50's through the mid-70's.

Keep in mind too that if some of your favorite stars are missing, it is probably because they did not record for labels that today fall under the umbrella of Sony Music...essentially, these are all artists who recorded for Columbia or Epic.This entire series \\"A Soundtrack for a Century\\" is a great opportunity to obtain some of the best songs of the 20th century as well as some very obscure ones...seek out the entire series and buy those volumes that appeal to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"-HELLO-","review":"DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T GET THIS I MEAN THERE'S NOT 1 JIMI HENDRIX SONG ON HERE I MEAN I KNOW THIS IS POP COLLECTION BUT HEY 1951-1975 WHO ARE THE AMETURES THAT PUT THESE TOGETHER I AM THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO CARES ABOUT MUSIC..?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I am sooo happy with my copy of Bear By Himself!

The author does an excellent job of expressing and supporting his thoughtful ideas and observations in a way that is intelligent, well informed and often amusing. He is more thought provoking than instuctive. And so much of what he says is dead on the money. I love this book. My 17 year old daughter loves it.

That is not new and almost every book in the area of self-help will tell you that. But this book cover much more topics than such issue.

This timely book not only highlights Malaysia's race relations and the shortcomings of its economic policies, but also offers refreshingly commonsensical solutions. One wonders why Malaysian leaders have not thought of them.This book is obviously a response to the original \\"The Malay Dilemma,\\" written by Mahathir Mohammad in 1970. Mahathir is now Malaysia's present Prime Minister and this book takes a critical look at his social and economic policies.I particularly like the chapter that compares and contrasts Malaysia's race problems to that of America and that of the English/French conflict in Canada. Although the book focuses primarily on race relations in Malaysia, the author's perspectives and analyses could well apply to other multicultural nations.This book is a must read for those interested in race relations generally, and for students of Southeast Asian Studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Having no college background, but a great interest in the weather, I searched high and low for a comprehensive book that would be understandable and informative.

High and low pressure systems, fronts, weather systems, trade winds, jet streams, precipitation, clouds, visual effects, measuring devices and much more. I would really love to get the next book that carries on where this one left off, but to go much farther will probably require more knowledge of math and physics.

He then looks for how to account for what's missing. As honest as scientists generally are, it's really rare for one to build the value of his theory on it's ability to show you the meaning of what's not there. What's really special is that this very unassuming approach opens the door to accounting for natural system behaviors with causation developing from the inside, very casually evaporating, almost without mention, the deterministic assumption of modern science (which they assure us would be proved if only we knew everything). That assumption has long stood for a belief that we can and should control everything and been a barrier to perceiving that the main task on earth is learning how to cooperate with other living things.

I would be very suspect of any father who thought this was appropriate. It is, on the other hand, easily construed as a thinly veiled threat.

In that book Tracy has been through alot. I've been through all of what Tracy has been through,except for the sex. I hope her and Victor got together.

This novel kept me infatuated, and I began to examine some of my own experiences in life. I do not feel as if this is a misrepresentation of young African-American teenagers, because some of these experiences are definitely not limited to just us.

Seemingly oblivious to a rich legacy of literature on the travails (and the bliss) of motherhood, Woolf has re-invented the wheel.

I have never read anything so negative and depressing about pregnancy and birth. I was seven months when I read it, and it brought me to tears. I am happy to report that my experience in the hospital was NOTHING like hers, or the other women who contributed their stories. I was treated very well by a staff of trained, caring professionals. My husband has been nothing but supportive and caring since the baby's been born. All and all its been a postive experience, and I'm pretty sure it's that way for most women. Don't read this book if you are pregnant!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to begin a women;r journey into motherhood","review":"I thought the book was wonderful. I read it while pregnant and I moved from complete ignorance of childbirth in America to a very knowledgeable. I am so glad I read this book. There are few parts I disagree with or find questionable, but it is a very informative and important book for anyone who is expecting. definitely worth the read. I do agree that though she does address poor people's experience in being a mother and childbirth, it is mostly about middle to upper class. my hospital experience was very similar to how she describes, i did as much as I could to have a birth my way, but next time I would NEVER go to a hospital. Routines and routines. You may have a birth plan but they are used to doing things a certain way and will usually force you to conform instead of them.watch \\"Business of being born\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wake-Up Call","review":"Admittedly, Ms. Wolf is a tad \\"passionate\\" about her subject, and anyone can manipulate statistics to make their point. However, what she has to say about agenda-ridden hospital childbirth classes and the counterintuitive ways many doctors go about labor and childbirth makes this a worthwhile read.We seem far too cavalier about epidurals and C-sections when there are much better alternatives for most women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A totally different perspective","review":"In this book Naomi Wolf gives us her perspective on birth. This was the first pregnancy book I've read where I found myself nodding along in agreement. After reading the book, I switched my care from an OB/GYN (who had answered my questions with assurances that everything was done only if it was medically necessary) to a midwife, who had numbers to back up her information. Although I plan to go into childbirth better prepared than Naomi Wolf did, I found her book to be very eye-opening and as useful as others I'm reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Old Naomi Wolf","review":"Ms. Wolf needs to see a therapist about her issues. She clearly needs help. Writing such a contradictory, self-absorbed, elitist piece of garbage doesn't do anyone any favors, except maybe makes her bank account a little larger, which she obviously values more than her kids.Her self-loathing and country club poor-me attitude got so trite, irresponsible and preachy, I couldn't get past the second chapter. This book is a HUGE disservice to pregnant and nursing mothers across the country. Yes, American vigilante obstetrics is flawed beyond comparision. Really, why didn't she follow her own advice to not go back for more? Why didn't she follow what she's so preachy to others to do? What a hypocrite.If you really want to read this boring, snide drivel, check it out at the library. Save your money for a GOOD pregnancy and motherhood book, like the new \\"Ina May Gaskin's Guide To Natural Childbirth\\" by a mother and a midwife who actually knows something about birth in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me- -Again!","review":"Naomi Wolf is getting really, really tiresome. First, we got a treatise on how the world forces women to be consumed with their looks (written when she was a single young woman, consumed with her looks). Then, on becoming famous and influential, she tells us how important, how noble, it is to be powerful. But at least these books wrestled with ideas.Now she's had a baby, so, a book about having babies. There's barely the pretense that this book is anything more than a description of her privations as representative of Woman's privations, written in what felt to me a humorless and hasty way. It's the startling inablilty to really conceive of a world beyond herself that makes the book so disappointing. There's only so much that a book about Ms. Wolf's pregnancy hardships can inspire in a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane whining","review":"Don't even bother with this.

In this fresh, new view of motherhood, Ms. Wolf takes you along in an intimate journey through the stories of new mothers, the stories are not so pretty truths, but truths, that are indeed necessary in being informed, empowered new mothers. The many medical truths that are revealed in this book--are shocking and certainly distressing--and in true form, Ms. Wolf asks difficult questions about what really is going on in pregnancy and childbirth. Her answers--although disturbing, are certainly challenging and courageous in a world which traditionally avoids second guessing the authority of the medical establishment. You will definitely feel emotionally involved with this book--Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"important to read","review":"No matter what you chose on your road to motherhood, this book gives some great insight. I was very disappointed that Ms. Wolf did not learn from her own mistakes, and therefore ended up right back in the C-sec room. Hindsight is supposed to be 20-20 Naomi. However, there is much more to glean from this tale. The important info is in the sections on relationships with partners and PPD. How comforting to know that many women are not alone in their feelings after childbirth. I am reccommending this book to every woman I know in the hopes that change for birth-care is in the future for the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is long overdue","review":"I was lucky enough to take an independant child birth education class and had learnd a lot of what Naomi talks about in her book. My husband and I went into our birth with a wealth of knowledge and were able to have the birth I wanted. I listen to my friends who take the hospital endorsed classes and know they have no chance of having anything other than the birth the hospital wants. This book reveals all the truths the childbirth industry doesn't want you to know.The other aspect of the book that I really related to was the emotional side of being pregnant, and the transition into motherhood. It wasn't until I was a mother did I realize how unrespected and unsupported mothers are in the public eye. This book put into words how I was feeling, and made me feel normal, and angry and wanting to demand more."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE PREGNANT","review":"This was the worst book I read while I was pregnant. I actually didn't get throught the whole thing, because it brought me to tears, and my husband took it away from me. Take heart ladies-if you are pregnant things will not be nearly as bad as Wolf makes them out to be. My hospital experience was wonderful, not the nightmarish experience she talks about. In fact, none of the horrible things she described happened to me. Skip this book, read what to expect when you're expecting instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable - do NOT buy this book!","review":"Apparently no one told Ms. Wolf that in fact having children does interfere with one's ability to remain completely self-focused. The thing that makes this book so horrible is the author's obvious antipathy toward her kids and her assumption that every other mother on the planet secretly feels the same way. Moreover, with so many birthing options available, no expectant mother need end up feeling as though her birthing experience was less than she wanted it to be. And even if it is......in the scheme of things, who cares? What an awful book and what an awful woman Ms. Wolf must be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This book is so whiny and self-indulgent that I am amazed that Wolf is actually a mother of two kids. It paints an unnecessarily bleak picture of pregnancy and motherhood, which are nowhere near as bad as she makes it out to be. The doctors and nurses and La Leche League and everyone else she complains about in this book are not out to get you, everyone is just trying to do their job the best way they can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misconceptions","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone. I only gave it one star because I had to. I would give it 0! It was the WORST book that I have EVER read! This woman found joy in nothing. Her personal issues were all that were addressed.

I liked his character though I thought pretty much right off that he was the \\"too good to be true\\" guy and was going to end up being a cad. Christopher Plummer was excellent and has been in just about everything he is in lately. He is like a fine wine or an untapped treasure that is we are getting the pleasure of seeing in some fine work. But this movie was just your typical 'You've got mail' 'Sleepless in Seattle' stuff.

Both have had bitter divorces in the last year. Diane Lane plays Sarah, a laid back teacher who thinks she's had her one chance at a life with someone and John Cusack plays Jake, the tightly strung artist who's been deeply wounded by love. Their first meeting, like many others, does not go smoothly but somehow they end up on a second and third date. All Jake wants is honesty and all Sarah wants, well she isn't sure what she wants until the end of the film so she flip flops between a few men. Diane Lane as always is stunning to look at. She has quick wit. John Cusack is still charming but I didn't see as much of him as I would have liked. This film while it has some comedic moments is a drama about relationships after divorce. The antics of extended family and friends are thrown in to lighten the blow. An enjoyable film.

We go on to see the 50ish widow her father is dating lying about her age and ending up with a 15 year old (oh yes, he lied about his age, too) on her doorstep claiming they were soulmates. Well, they did have some interesting things in common. Add to that the crying neurotic guy, the 50ish guy who really wanted an 18 year old, etc. The movie itself lacked the timing or style to be anything but a 'dog' and the advert for the online dating service just sealed the deal for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - Hollywood at its worst....","review":"I usually try not to write negative reviews -- following my Mom's advice about not saying anything at all, blah, blah...But this movie is simply awful.

I blame the directors, the producers, the editors and the Hollywood movie \\"machine\\" that lacks the courage to do something that is not formulaic and trite (and supported by a snappy soundtrack).

They meet at the dog park because Sarah's sister, Carol put an ad on PerfectMatch.com for her. The ad says that you 'must love dogs' During the film, they fall in love.

Out of 100's of films I have watched over the years this one will stick out as THE worst. Problems I had: The characters are without any depth or realism.

It was torture I can't imagine the hollywood executives who typed this film up unless they were reading Cosmo and taking hits of peyote. The personalities and lifestyles that the characters inhabited had no roots in reality as I know it. The film didn't allow for any person to connect with a single thing in this film. I seriously thought I was watching aliens who just looked like human and were trying to imatate humans. If you found yourself connecting to the people in this film I want you to call me so I can bring you to the circus. Then we can get you many dates fo sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of John Cusack","review":"I like John Cusack movies, I like Diane Lane. I hated this movie. The writing is bad, the directing is bad. Cusack and Lane are good, but they cannot save this movie. Do yourself a favor if you want a love story with Cusack get Serendipity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it alot","review":"Nothing really new in the movie when it comes to romantic comedy - it's you average plot (no brain surgery here) I'm a big fan of Diane Lane, and she's great in Must Love Dogs. Cusack is great too - and makes a great love interest to Lane. Even though the plot is typical, it's hard to ignore the sweetness and its funny jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must love Dogs","review":"I love Diane Lane and John Cusask in any movie they do. It seemed real and the music was wonderfully timed. Top notch actors aside from the main two(Elizabeth Perkins, Christopher Plummer to name a few)and all done with humor, love & a bit of the unexpected. It was very real the feelings the characters went thru with age and the world around them. A wonderful movie that I highly recommend. Hope you give it a chance~"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love dogs but I hated this boring film","review":"Some girlfriends and I rented this movie for a girls night. Can you say disappointed ten times fast? This movie was boring, drab, boring, drab and repeat ten times. There was one funny part and that was when Diane Lane went on a blind date with her father (and really how funny is that?).If you love dogs, go down to the Humane society and play with them there and avoid this awful boring, not even worthy of a chick flick title, movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING...","review":"Incredibly slow moving; I almost turned it off mid way.

Throw in a silly aunt (duh), the sex-crazy sister, and gay friend and you have the total cliche movie, yay. They never explained why the main character was hopelessly trying to find a new boyfriend. Her family was mean to her as well, and meeting her father for a date, lame. Who was he trying to be, James Bond, with all the women? Ok, I'm rambling myself hahah....basically just a bland movie,,,,,,if you want to see the same movie, but better, rent Ten Attitudes, which chronicalizes a man's journey through ten dates, trying to find his special someone. ;)~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Single and Finding Success While Dating","review":"Apart from the actual plot of this movie, which has already been discussed by many reviewers, this flick touches on other issues. What happens when the butcher cannot fully realize that you are single, and need only one serving? What if your dating profile is misunderstood? What if you had stretched the truth, and then find out your match has not been entirely truthful either? What if the one matched up with you rejects you on the spot, saying that he had preferred somebody much younger, even though you fitted his original age-range? How do you, as a young woman, feel when the date you had been paired up with, by a dating service, turns out to be your own father? How do you date when you are afraid of disclosing yourself for fear of being hurt? Love nevertheless can develop. And so it goes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I liked this movie alot.It is one of the funniest movies I've watched in a long time.I am also a Diane Lane fan, I thing she did a superb job. The rest of the cast pulled all together. Worth the time to watch !"},{"rating":"1","title":"UMMM this is why I say stay away from the Personals!","review":"As far as chic flicks go I am a die hard fan! But this chic flick made us chic's look quite simple and down right lame. Alright we have a divorced middle age woman who is not looking but gets placed back on the dating scene, not a far stretch you may say. However put a couple of dogs in the middle along with horrible supporting roles in between and there you have it. This movie leaves you with no one to truly route for. Where this movie fails is the fact that the characters are boring and the storyline lacks depth. As far as date movie goes skip Must Love Dogs unless you must love torturing yourself through the pain of the ever predictable middle aged quest for love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz","review":"I got this movie at work [library], hoping it would be good. I had seen the trailer for it and had high hopes. Boy, was I disappointed. The first 2/3 of the movie moved along relatively slow. Then, Diane Lane's character goes from being a sweet girl to being a w***e and dating any and every man, including having a one night stand. Ten minutes of the movie involves Lane's and Cusack's characters speeding down streets and driving eratically in order to find a convenience store still open...they want condoms.I think whoever wrote this screenplay should be humiliated, to say the least. It was made out to be this really \\"great\\" romantic comedy. It wasn't romantic until the last 10 minutes or so. It wasn't even remotely funny. I admit, there were maybe 2 or 3 one-liners in there, but other than that...I had to force my eyes to stay open until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped for so much more....","review":"I received this as a gift. I love Diane Lane and John Cusack. But this one just failed. I really wanted to love it. I even watched it a couple times to see if it would grow on me. But it is just bad....sorry. I still love Cusak and Lane. This is not a reflection on them. The story was not strong. I can't even recommend it as a mediocre romantic comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Character had a dog!?!?!","review":"The moral of the story: You won't be happy unless you have a man.Diane Lane (Sarah) plays a divorced woman who has decided to start dating again. She comes from a large, nosey family and it's hard to keep track of them all. Was that the brother-in-law or the brother? Is that her sister, her friend, her sister-in-law or her father's girlfriend?To put it bluntly, Sarah's character is pathetic. She doesn't have any confidence, self-respect, or special attributes that make her special. It was cheesy how everyone in Sarah's life wanted her to find a mate ~ including the guy that worked the deli counter at the supermarket ~ and until she did she was treated like less of a person.This story wasn't romantic or funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call it--it's dead!!","review":"You know how you know the actors are really trying and the screenwriter are really trying?? The lines are almost funny and the actors almost appealing?? There are actors you like and you want them to be good?? I wanted to enjoy this movie because so many good people were trying so hard--but--I could not wring a moment of enjoyment out of this film. It was flat. Lacked spark. Stick a fork in it--it's done!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A slightly generous four stars","review":"This is a predictable, yet still mostly clever, romantic comedy. The heroine is recently divorced and not quite ready to admit she wants to start dating. Her meddlesome family is fairly endearing, the scenes with the losers they set her up with are mostly comical, and we do start to root for the romance to blossom. But it unravels a bit near the end. We know she's going to go back to the hero and the delays seem forced, almost like they had leftover dating scenes from the beginning that they didn't want to waste. The final mad dash at the end, when a simple phone call would have sufficed, was ridiculous. And the moment she jumped in the water, the movie lost most of its credibility.Overall, a light movie good for some laughs, but it probably wouldn't hold up to much repeat viewing.Amanda Hamm, author ofDear Jane Letters"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful and Very Human Film","review":"A delightful way to spend a couple of hours..A big family tries to do all it can to help Diane Lane find a new romance. Christopher Plummer is worth the price of the entire video. His scenes with his dauhgter (Lane) are funny and very touching. Treat yourself a wonderful romantic escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, heck...I liked it!","review":"Surprised at the lack luster reviews for this charmer. It was predictable-- so what! Aren't most romantic comedies? The dialogue was fresh and intellegent. The acting was fine. Lane and Cusack are both charming. We caught it on a snowy afternoon and laughed the gloom away. I will recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What dogs????","review":"I was really disappointed with this movie. I mean, it's in the title. Must Love DOGS. But the dog was only in, like, two scenes! What's up with that? The title makes it sound like a pet-lovers film, but it's not. The romance was sweet and comedy was great, but what about the dogs?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacking Something - (But John Cusack Was Great)","review":"This was a good movie and cute, but it wasn't brilliant. I always love John Cusack - he's great, talented, handsome and fun to watch, but this lacked something. I think the writting was bad. No one in the theater laughed at the 'funny' lines and neither did I. The story line was good and kept me interested, but it just wasn't strong enough. Stockard Channing was very good in this and Dianne Lane too. It's a shame that this didn't quite pull off what I'm sure the director/producer etc hoped to. It is definately a chick flick and any fan of John Cusack will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've seen it all before","review":"If you're in the mood for another assembly-line written girl-meets-boy, girl-loses-boy, girl-and-boy-bumble-around-for-a-bunch-of-scenes, girl-and-boy-get-together...then, this is the movie for you. Despite John Cusack's charm, Diane Lane's canned delivery, and Stockard Channing's ever-lovability the film never really lifts off and, at times, is down-right embarassing at times, and amusing occassionally. The scene where the two lovers go looking for condoms should be nominated for some kind of Golden Raspberry award for screenwriting...\\"Dopiest Scene\\" or some such thing. No surprises, a couple laughs and lots of overwritten scenes. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker - See AH-1Z Below","review":"AH-1Z's review below is pretty much spot-on.

It is songs that Zappa participated in from 1962 to 1963. Sound quality is good, especially for independent recordings from the early sixties.The first 2 songs were written by Zappa and performed by Zappa and Ray Collins (who would become part of the Mothers of Invention). The Heartbreakers songs are of unknown origin. These songs are typical early sixties, doo-wap rock songs. Think along the lines of Teen Angel.The two Bud Guy songs are Holloween, monster songs. These type of songs were popular in the early sixties, with Monster Mash being the most famous.If you want to get a historic perspective of Zappa, then you might enjoy this. There is some clumsy avant garde guitar work that is a sign of what is to come.

Maybe it was so \\"hailed\\" because of all the implied sex with hints of nudity, but I'm not hailing any part of it. The actors were good looking but their acting was devoid of any real emotion or charisma.What a waste of time. I rented it... thank goodness..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a porno without the sex","review":"Based on the many popular review of this movie on here, I rented this DVD. Yet having seen the film, I am suspicious of the over the top reviews on here and I'm left to wonder at their comments. Is there a married Hollywood producer somewhere being blackmailed into this film by his secret gay lover?This film was awful. It is nothing more than a sketched out premise, much like a porno aspiring to more than it is by adding a plot. Only there isn't even the sex to keep you interested.The characters are flat and one-dimensional, reacting to situations in incomprehensibly melodramatic ways. I don't mean that it's a matter of suspended belief for the point of the story. I mean that the logical gaps in the dialogue and character development are so big you can parallel-park a Hum-V between them. There is terrible character development, a weak plot, and in the end, one could care less about the people portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that all about?","review":"Ludicrous thriller with an incomprehensible plot. (Something to do with drugs and stealing some guy's money, I think.) This one has everything: bad acting, bad dialogue, bad songs. At least David Christopher gets to play a performance artist who spouts bad poetry. So in those scenes he does a good job. He gets to play a man who is a bad actor.

I thought the premise sounded intruiging so I rented it, and am thankful I had not bought it.The movie started out with promise, but quickly I found myself thinking no couple would endure what is going on. AND when the movie took a right turn (I am trying not to be a spoiler here), I found the actions being taken completely unbelievable and the ending was a total shocker (and not in a good way).Sadly, I wanted to like this film. It does have some good things going for it, but in the end, I cannot recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your taste","review":"I bought this DVD because of the mostly positive reviews. I now suspect that many of these are written by friends of the film-makers. In any event, I tend to like low-budget, independent films for telling stories Hollywood won't. Yes, the production and sound quality is poor/low-budget, the plot somewhat intriguing, while the acting was mostly poor-to-fair. There is potential in this story for a really good suspense film; however, the finished product falls far short. Rent before buying to see if this film is to your taste. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!!","review":"I bought this movie based on glowing reviews on another web-site and I was terribly disappointed. While the basic story was a good concept, it was executed horribly. There was literally nothing good about this movie. I wanted to turn it off but I kept watching, hoping it would get better. It didn't! Bad acting, bad writing, bad movie. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I have a friend from France who is a diehard Kelly Family fan and was very, very excited about this release. Paddy was always her favorite singer. I remember when this came out she told me she thought it was really awful and recommended I never waste my money on it. I'm disappointed in myself for not listening to her advice. Several weeks have passed since I ordered it and I have not even been remotely tempted to play it since the third spin (I always give a new cd a few listens to make sure I'm not just having a bad initial reaction). There really aren't any catchy songs here. There is strong religious content and Mr. Kelly has done some self discovery it seems... but that doesn't necessarily make for a good album. The lyrics are fairly strong, hence the 1 star, but the vocal delivery and melodies are... not memorable. There is also A LOT of repetition with lines in choruses. I mean one line over and over (I understand choruses repeat! lol). I'm in hopes of a better second solo disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic and dull","review":"The book contains all the elements for a nice legal thriller but somehow it never takes off. The characters are flat and the plot is so simple that already after one third of the book it is absolutely clear what happend. The relationships between the characters are all of the black and white type. Either they are very nice or they are complete idiots like the judge and the managing partner of the company. The personal relationship between wife and husband is of a similar type; they love each other dearly, but five minutes within the first row the man wants to book a marriage counsellor... All in all, not recomended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! A MUST for animal lovers!","review":"This is an absolute MUST for animal lovers!

I recently had to put to sleep my aged little dog, my best friend, and upon purchasing the book turned to a chapter I thought might help. It was ghastly, an ode to irresponsible pet ownership from the beginning to the end. The dog's 10 yr old mother is impregnated unknownst to owners who discover this little fact only when she's giving birth; the dog loses a leg due to an accident while roaming at large; and finally, his agonizing death from an attack by another dog - again because he is allowed to roam at large, guess the owners are REAL slow learners - it was an awful thing to read, this poor dog suffered so unnecessarily at the hands of these people. I was going to throw the book away, but why should the publishers profit by this? I took it back to the bookstore and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon doesn't deliver.

I was a little surprized by it and since my purpose was to use it in a coffee shop, I returned it since it was branded so boldly. I'm sure it won't bother most people but it did not suit me so I returned it.

I've had two before and I always had to turn them 30 to 50 times to get a good amount of pepper. I do like a lot of pepper. With this one I turn a few times and I'm good. It did take me awhile to figure out how adjust for fine or course but now it's easy. And it's pretty. Would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Pepper Mill, where form and function meet","review":"This is a lovely peppermill. The color is just slightly darker than what appeared on my monitor, but it's so smooth and shiny and a delight to hold in your hands. There were no instructions included and it took me a minute to figure out how to open and fill it, and how to adjust the grind to my preference, but once you see how it's put together, it's very simple. It holds a fair amount of peppercorns and the grinding is smooth and even. It puts out quite a bit of pepper with each grind. Freshly ground pepper adds so much flavor. The pre-ground stuff can't compare. I use maybe a quarter the pepper I used to, but have twice the flavor. I keep the 8 inch mill by the stove and plan to get a 6\\" or 4\\" Vic Firth mill for the table. I may even give some as gifts this holiday season. I love them that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mismatched","review":"Wrong color/ the two \\"Cinnabar color\\" salt and pepper mills didn't match each other at all!

Through each read characters came to life in a new way, emphasizing Follet's portrayal of the cyclical path we all follow and the paths that have never been trodden.From my first read through \\"Pillars of the Almighty\\" I was immediately aware of new dimensions of Follet's epic that I had never thought to contemplate. The beauty captured by Fitzgerald's camera will give any fan of Follet a new perspective on a tale they know well. For those who have not yet read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", this book is the introduction and guide into Tom and Jack's world of 12th century England that any fan of history, architecture or art is sure to treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"picture book","review":"There are alot of pictures of Cathedrals but I would have liked a description next to the picture.

That probably is true. However I read Pillars of the Earth first so this was a repeat for me, therefore I was only mildly interested in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a top rate for any die hard fan!

The brutality of ranching life and the oppression of a sensitive son by his parents has haunted me to this very day. Having grown up on a farm years ago, I can attest to the hardships and, at times, horrible events (such as slaughtering hogs). Still, the \\"truth\\" is in one's mind, not in the reality others believe to be objectively true.What parent today would tell their child, \\"Quit dreaming!\\"I never quit and I left the farm to never return. I became a multi-published commercial writer, an artist, and a professor, despite this book and the negative message it relayed.I realize I'm criticizing a classic here, but it has its downside.

A clinical description","review":"I am in the middle of lstening to this book. Its detailed descriptions of ranch life and horses are quite compelling. But what surprised me was the absolutely accurate description of a boy with ADD. This book was written some two decades before attention deficit disorder gained anyone's attention, but O'Hara's descriptions of Ken's behavior are absolutely consistent.And then O'Hara answers the question of what to do about the condition: give the kid something he really wants to do and stand back. Of course, it helps that Ken has two wise and good-hearted parents; but then, maybe that is the start to solving most problems that children have.A fine book on many levels, and a fine companion on the road for adult and child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Very Warned","review":"This has a lot of sexuality and violence, although just about all of the sexuality and violence are commonplace events on a farm or ranch. Most children would be disturbed at some of the goings on of everyday farmlife, but your child, if exposed to intimate animal life, may not be. It might be wise, however, to be cautious in allowing just any child to read this book. I'd put the book in a 16+ age group with the average, every day suburbia or city child in mind.Ken's father is a blunt, self-reliant, swearing military man. There are many instances of him cursing.Alcohol, tobacco, and smoking throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sugar coating","review":"I was surprised to see the treatment of Nell (the mom). As the book has a copyright of 1940 I didn't expect much at all, but her character had won a trophy for best all-around athlete at Bryn Mawr and she thinks of the difference of being a woman in the west on a ranch as opposed to in a big east coast city. So that was kind of a neat find. (I mean, she still cooks and cleans all day but we see her chafe a bit under these restraints, have fond memories of her active girlhood, and see her wonder at, and perhaps dislike, how she's required to be MORE feminine now that she represents the idea of WOMAN on the ranch).Dang. I forget, sometimes, that it was once the norm to not \\"sugar coat\\" childrens' books. Life is rough and sometimes horrible things happen. We see Ken struggle with this. However, life is also sweet and precious. The blend in this book is perfect. Very real and wonderfully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant Him His Due","review":"This book is flawed and not \\"fair and balanced.\\" I mean the book is not totally flawless. I could just write reams about its few small flaws (but that would be redundantly repetitive of other reviews). The book's also flawed 'cause it seeks to subject to logical analysis what can only be understood by the spirit-filled heart. Yep, no pure, yearning, and prayerful heart could find truth in the teachings of cults or those mistaken faiths. Lastly, this book doesn't present every known fact that could in any way be fashioned to point to the barest possibility that Smith could have been one bit less than an utter hoaxster. Now, that's just not fair.The breadth and depth of Grant's research is impressive. This is the best first book on the writings and teachings of Smith for those seeking to use the rational faculty."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opening read","review":"This book combines all the questions and answers to Mormonism in one concise and easy-to-read book.

And I hate to say it, I'm not a huge fan of Galway's playing style. It's too light and airy, just on the edge of going into overtones. He overuses his vibrato, especially on the higher notes.

Someone actually writes about the fact that therapy does not work much of the time, and that many therapists just cannot do therapy (many are too screwed up themselves). With that said, however, Masson, unfortunately, is very Angry throughout this book; he is just not distanced enough in many of the chapters. I suspect that he is upset that he had to leave his \\"chosen career\\".In addition, he is too superficial about many of the points he raises; there doesn't seem to be much analysis. He just states his opinion; and that's about it. This is a true shame. He raises an important issue; there is a real need for someone to write a good, deep analysis about why therapy doesn't work for so many people, why so many therapists are disturbed themselves, and where consumers who are suffering mentally can seek real help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated his opinions; loved his book","review":"Authors like Szasz and Foucault and Scully have singled out mental illness from other medical conditions for non-treatment before.

It's not that bad on songs like \\"Knock Yourself Out\\" and \\"We Gonna Make It\\" where there wasn't much cussing in the first place, but, on tracks like \\"Show Discipline\\" and \\"Put Ya Hands Up\\" it's unbearable how they block out every other word.One of the worst parts about it is that they take out 5 whole tracks, 3 of which are skits but come on, 5 TRACKS GONE! I'm not dissing Jada at all, he's an ill rapper and i think the cd is tight, it's just the i can't stand so much editing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Album of the Year","review":"Disappointing. That's all I can say about this album. Wack beats and only two subjects. Girls and Violence. I can't believe the Source rated this album 4 mics. I'm glad I let my man copy this from Internet and that I didn't buy this. Styles is street, Sheek is street, but Jada, nah. Beanie Sigel already killed him on wax. And now he drops this garbage album. Corny beats, corny hooks. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jada hatin?","review":"A music fan from queensbridge, NY, first off what are u calling me a jada hater for. A album is suppose to show an artist depth. I feel Jada didn't prove anything to me to be considered an elite rapper. I think the Lyrics are weak, so excuse me for having an opinion. If you think this CD is a classic I want to know what you listen to.

The Lox didn't do well and they admitted it on their debut \\"Money, Power, and Respect\\" for Bad Boy Records.. They did the smart thing and went over to the Ruff Ryder camp where they belong... Their 2000 release \\"We R The Streets\\" was descent, better than their debut album though... Then the hype began for JADAKISS!. This guy was and is appearing everywhere and everyone making so much a big deal about him.. His debut solo effort Kiss Tha Game Goodbye full of 21 trax is just bad... I gave this album 2 stars because of the nice job Jada did on \\"Put Ya Hands Up\\" and the collabo with Nas on \\"Show Discipline\\". The rest of this cd though is just horrible!. I recommend that no one picks this album up, and JADA, do us all a favor, stick with sheek and styles as the Lox, because wen it comes to SOlo, it and you don't fit.."},{"rating":"1","title":"interscope should be ashamed","review":"This the longest in the making, most overhyped, UNDERWHELMING hip-hop album in a long, long time!

This cd has some good songs like the for sures (knock your self out n put ya ahnds up) but other good songs are on my way,nasty girl,im a gangsta,we goin make it. he has some tight beats n his lyrics are very good. but i feel he could have made his debut better i think he will be one of the next big rap stars like todays big ones (examples-DMX,Jay-z) im looking forward to his next cd n i hope a better effort"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beanie Sigel vs. JadaKiss","review":"When you read most peoples reviews you are going to get a one sided opinion. There either fans Beanie Sigel or Kiss . So if Jada is calling out your rapper you going to give him a bad review . Its like east and west with Tupac and Biggie . People got they opinions before they even listen . So the bottom line without all that where you from , i rep better sh$* is the cd is tight . As far as him claiming hes the best since Biggie is a long reach but he got skill . If you like gangsta you will like this cd . If you like some smooth sh@# you wont . On the song \\"Nasty Girl\\" he spits he wants a girl that wont give him brains but gives him knowledge . You cant deny his ability but if you like it you like it , you dont you dont . Just listen first ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss tha Game Goodbye","review":"I own the Kiss tha Game Goobbye cd. In my opinion it is one of the best rap cds ever made. I can listen to it for hours at a time. My favorite song is \\"Jada's Got a Gun\\" and I like \\"Show Discipline\\" also. Jadakiss is a promising artist with some original material. For example \\"as a young boy always carried a cap gun/fell in love with it tha first itme I clapped one\\". I recommended it to a lot of my friends. All my friends seem to like it too.

Another party cd with all great songs. He got some mellower songs but they still good. Keep your head up is a great song but its a mellower , i just feel the lyrics in this song. its reals a motivator. And whoever thought Jadakiss couldn't make it and that LOX was bad were totally wrong. Jadakiss is great with the ruff ryders especially DMX.

While this album isn't a classic by far, it still is no where near horrible.... \\"Kiss Tha Game Goodbye\\" is a very good album. The first song (skippin the intro) is the best song on the album. \\"Jada's Got A Gun\\" is a premier way for Jadakiss to show off his talent, which he has plenty of to go around.\\"We Gon Make It\\" is another definite banger. The beat isn't new, but the lyrics are definitely on point. \\"Uh-hhh\\" is another great song. Jadakiss rips up Beanie Sigel, with help from DMX, who sounds like he's also takin shots at another self-proclaimed \\"King\\" of the rap industry (Jay-Z)Overall, this album doesn have a few bad moments, but the good overshadows the bad. This is a well-rounded album and hopefully Jadkiss won't keep his fans waiting so long for another round."},{"rating":"2","title":"JADAKISS","review":"Gold or Rust??? This CD is one of the games most anticipated and even though more than enough tracks were leaked via bootleg, etc.. it is still worth buying.

It has some listenable tracks....Put your hands up, we gonna make it (although Alchemist should have left Ras kass with this beat), put ya hands up, and especially show discpline are all decent...the rest of this album is terrible. The production is pretty good, but it takes only the best beats to make jada sound even slightly interesting. Boring flow, average punchlines and same subject matter. one of the most 1 dimensional rappers out there...and anyone from the New york would remember when he was on hot 97 talking about how he moved from the suburbs to become a drug dealer.

You can't fight Santa, especially when you wished something so much.The book is indeed, as Heston Blumenthal said in his foreword, not a book but rather a tool. I'm not a cook but I love food and I spoil myself sometimes cooking (or trying to). I think this one, among a few others (Larousse, Le Repertoire, The Modernist Cuisine - which I only wish, because is far too expensive for me), are a must for any cook, and not only a must have, but a must read!I wish I knew a better french to get the original, but I was surprised to find how good is translated this one.

Alas, I bought the ultimate guide on how to do it properly.To be clear, it is not the book for the after work in a hurry to put dinner on the table cook.

Now I can only compare it to a classic old black and white movie, silly and dated, but in it's time wonderful. It does what it does well, but with only 0.8MP it can't do much. A 14x optical zoom? Unheard of now! Takeing a picture at the full telephoto setting and then passing it off as anything other then abstract art would be absurd. Still, you've got to love them for thinking it was possible. This camera is a wonderful artifact (why I gave it 4 stars) of a not so far off distant time in digital photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but horrible quality","review":"The picture quality on these discs is really awful. In some cases, its difficult to even recognize which actor is speaking.

Prior to the advent brought by the Beatles and the British Invasion, the Beach Boys/Jan & Dean sound was the model for the post-Spector music of the West Coast. Bruce and his studio buddies put together this party album which showcases his abilities to play piano and sing rock & roll, which contrasted with his then-developing role with the Beach Boys as touring bass player and singer of proto-Beach man Brian Wilson's parts. An important historical document, light on content and sound quality, but heavy on party attitude. A must for BB/J&D fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this puzzle","review":"This is a very poorly made/cut puzzle. The pieces are not uniform in size.

Nice, but there is no starter opening because that is part of the clutch housing and therefore is laying on the ground next to you. You can still put the screwdriver there if you want but other than being a good holder it will not help you with your work :)At other times it gives completely incorrect information on disassembly of parts while completely ignoring the 1985-1987 models in other key areas.I suggest trying a chilton or some other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Time and In Perfect Condition","review":"Purchased book for a college course my daughter is taking.

Plus, it completely warps the Robin Hood legend and denudes it of its essential character, in oh, so many ways. It's really just not a good film at all.

Russell Crowe and Robin Hood surely would equal an intelligent and exciting film. But I was wrong. The problem begins with the screenplay, which apparently is another postmodern exercise in its boring faith in its perceptions to begin anew: it is an attempt to 'imagine' what kind of actual facts might have undergirded the growth of the legend. None of it, beyond the most obvious, is particularly plausible, and it does not add up to close to a satisfying whole. Its falsifying of history is much worse than anything in the Errol Flynn movie, because that clearly is meant to be just swashbuckling fun while this wants the audience to see it as saving people from the bad history of swashbucklers. If Russell Crowe is not ashamed of being in this movie, he is not as discerning as I thought him to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just boring","review":"The beginning of the movie called to mind \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" which really hurt it because the battle scenes and action just aren't that interesting in comparison. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one was because of Mark Strong. He plays the same kind of character he did in \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" and \\"Kick Ass,\\" but he's very good at it. Other than that, Crowe is completely forgettable, Cate Blanchet is wasted and I wish that I hadn't wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to Death","review":"It was challenging to believe this was the same great team that brought us the dynamic and powerful Gladiator. The movie was dark, dreary, and so all other the place that you never knew where you were in the film even though they identified the locale. Too many war scenes, too many bad guys that weren't given enough time to be really bad, no humor, no lightness, uneven script, and worse direction, and for the first time ever, I didn't enjoy Russell Crowe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, but this movie was a big disapppointment. The character of Robin Hood was too reactive and not active enough. It seems he spent most of the movie with his eyes on the ground. There was no brilliant or amazing action or dialogue. Too ho-hum, for me, and predictable. The one time the Merry Men get to rob someone, it is so dark, it's hard to tell what is happening. The really good movies, like \\"Master and Commander\\" you want to pull out and watch again and again. I have seen this take on Robin Hood once and it is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film falls real short of expectations","review":"I thought i was going to see an epic film, but this fell really short of expectations. Poor acting in places and honestly, it could have been better. Despite notoriously good directors, I feel this was produced and directed poorly. Epic failure with sporadic scenes of interest and entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Bland","review":"Rarely has such a potentially exciting and adventurous figure as Robin Hood been rendered so bland and listless as he has in this film version of the noble bandit. Russell Crowe seems lost, Cate Blanchett is far too classy for this film, and Max von Sydow phones in his performance. Although I'm usually a fan of Ridley Scott's work, this one is just an unfortunate misfire--I wonder whether he has forgotten how to tell a story. The numerous villains in this story are poorly developed (as are just about all of the supporting characters), the plot--which wanders aimlessly--is unnecessarily complicated by irrelevant subplots and revisions to the standard Robin Hood tale, and the whole thing devolves into a boring, pathetic mess. Perhaps Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland were hoping to breathe new life into this classic tale, but they ultimately sucked the last vestige of vitality right out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Worth watching, good acting, and a nice twist...many of the great people and events of history were influenced by chance and how they reacted is what made them the heroes or the duds that we know today. No one knows for sure how or if these things went down and this is a nice version. At least some form of the idea of freedom was rattling around at that time, for the gentry anyway, ala the Magna Carta, so the \\"freedom contract\\" isn't that far fetched in this movie.

Then not long after, the King is telling Crowe all about his father??? Made no sense.It was hard to understand many conversations in the movie.

The acting all seemed fake and the story was too convoluted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russel Crowe Glory-Fest","review":"This is yet another movie where Russel Crowe attempts to recapture glory from the likes of Gladiator. In fact, this movie blatantly copies Gladiator, Braveheart, and even Saving Private Ryan in one scene. His character is basically interchangeable between Gladiator and this; so IE - he is not acting, simply \\"being himself on camera\\". The part of his movie that were actually good are the scenery, sets, and costumes. But the plot? Or vacuous lack thereof? Forget it. Crowe plays a genuinely annoying/brash/arrogant version of Robin Hood, and I'd even argue that he acts nothing like any Robin Hood ever; not Errol Flynn nor Kevin Costner. For Russel Crowe fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, dark and boring","review":"I kept having to \\"rewind\\" to figure out who was where - it's very dark.

He is the master of period detail, moody cinematography and precise art direction. His character development though is increasingly two dimensional and Cate Blanchett amongst others is wasted here. The plot is predictable and so simplified that you feel they should be wearing black and white hats. So to rent on Blu Ray and watch on lcd whilst using the computer, a good bet. To view anywhere with lesser picture quality or try and hold your attention, not really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad mixture of title and work out routine","review":"The title is misleading.The DVD is 5 minutes of warm up, and 2 fifteen minute work outs, one of which is 'moderate' and the other is more 'intense', and a cool down.For a BEGINNER, it should be 5 minute warm up, 40 minutes of 'moderate' and then a cool down.She should have made 2 one hour routines, one for BEGINNERS and one for people that can do a more intense work out.I'm 60 years old, am in reasonable shape (and probably better shape than most 60 year olds,) work out at the gym, when I have time, for an hour a day.I feel I got cheated because I believed the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kai Anderson Go Step works for Beginners","review":"I thought that it would be for more beginners.

I did some step aerobic in high school PE, but that was 5 years ago and kind of \\"just for fun\\" to change up the old run-around the track or gym routine. That being said, I found the pace a little too fast at first. But like what others may have said, Kari provides cues at just the right time. If I ever lost the cadence I can get back without a problem. It took a while to get the sequences down, but I had fun doing it... definitely beats the death(tread)mill and got my heart pumping within the first few minutes. As a beginner, this dvd definitely provides a challenge for me. And it's something to \\"grow\\" into. I probably won't get bored for awhile with this. If you are looking for something slow paced, this dvd may not be for you. I do recommend it for those looking for a fun heart pumping exercise routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners","review":"I bought this because i love step aerobics, but have not done them in years. What attracted me to this was that it claimed to be for beginners and had gotten good reviews. What i found is that the only \\"bad\\" review i read, was accurate. If you have not been working out prior to this video and in good cardio condition, you will find this cd to be too challenging.The tempo is quite fast for beginners, the moves are not all that simple either. She gives bad cueing, and no examples before she just switches moves. I don't know of any other video that she has created, but this one is not for beginners, and it seems that she forgot that true beginners are not in shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for beginners!","review":"I purchased this dvd because it said it was for beginners. I used to do a step workout daily, about 15 years ago and loved it. I wanted to start doing my step workout again, so I thought I would try this dvd. When I actually tried the workout, the moves were not for beginners. They show one person who is doing the workout that is not on the step, but doing the workout on the floor. What a waste to time! I was very disappointed! I thought the moves would be easier since it said it was for beginners.

I am in my mid fifties and don't want alot of high impact moves, but still want something that will get my heart pumping. The first part is great, simple but gets you going even for an intermediate level. Don't like the 2nd part where the moves are a little more complicated and dancelike. As someone else mentioned, the first workout doesn't get boring as there is enough variety to keep you going.

All recipes are categorized bytheir main ingredient (pork, chicken, beef,seafood, ect. . ) with a chapter on deserts.My only qualm with this book is it doesn't providethe chinese name for many recipes. This mightbe because they have been generalize for awestern audience and the chinese names no longerapply, but I'd like to think thatthey are authentic originals from traditional dishes.If you only own one chinese cooking book, this isthe one to have.

P.G. Wodehouse is, hands down, the funniest author I have ever read.This book contains ten golf-related short stories featuring a typical assortment of Wodehouse-style characters: likable, good-hearted, but often clueless and bumbling. As usual, love (or the hope of love) is the impetus of the plots and many misunderstandings and hilarious high jinks quickly ensue.

This book is not a quick overview, it will take some time to go through each chapter, interpret each EKG and read the explanation to really understand. It has some great tips on how to look at 12 leads and each 12 lead is followed by explanations, although some of the explanations come before the EKG which can be a spoiler. Personally, I wish there were more practice 12 leads not just sorted by category as in the book (each chapter has EKGs about that chapter, ie QRS chapter emphasizes QRS variations and abnormalities). There is also an advanced level of interpretation available for each EKG provided. One last thing, the book does not read like a normal book but rather is read like a calendar which can be awkward at times. Overall a great learning resource if you have the time to go from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book","review":"This book is a decent book for learning 12 Lead EKGs. It is through and introduces things in a stepwise fashion. It was not as valuable to me as the book I used to learn single lead EKGs, the EKG workout book (Huff). After spending a weekend with that book, I became very confident. A weekend with this book has left me with a pretty rudimentary understanding.I think it would benefit from the addition of more practice strips. It is too easy to coast along thinking you are learning from reading the interpretations provided as you go. The language can be a little strange. PACs are called APCs, PVCs are VPCs.

This photographer was not known at all compared to most of the rest. I thought this book was an excellent display of his male nudes. There are about 63 pages of nudes here, not a big book, but a good representation of his work. These are photos of men from that era in clear black & white set in outdoor surroundings. It's surprising how muscular these men were for that time period.Denny loved photos of nude men, which were hard to purchase in the repressive 50's.

How could an otherwise intelligent woman agree to act as a prostitute, which is effectively what the female lead of this book does. Selling oneself for a business deal is the same as standing on a street corner. This woman obviously had no sense of self-worth or self respect and that I found sad.

Unlike all the other Black Lace books I've read the female lead doesn't have at it with every person she meets. Genevieve is a lady, not some alley cat, but boy oh boy does she purr for her master! Except for one F/F scene (arranged by her master so he can watch) every spot of sex is between the master and his slave. That's what makes this book so good, so intense, so romantic and so bloody sexy. It smacks of reality in this day of safe sex.I want to thank the author for doing the master/slave storyline with a master who is not into torture, cruelty or mutilation.

She is not only an absolutely beautiful singer, but an inspirational speaker as well. To most long-time practicing Catholics, many of the pieces in this CD will seem closer to the Protestant tradition although there are some that are included in contemporary Catholic hymnbooks. Listen to the underlying messages and you will find them truly prayerful. ValLimar is capable of getting you up off your feet and rocking, but most of the pieces in this CD have a more devotional aspect. She is accompanied by a small orchestra and other vocalists, which is fine, but she can carry the message on her own in a very powerful way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent cues at a decent price","review":"Not very high quality but very decent for a game room.

Kiri's gorgeous voice shines again in this album, but there is something new here. Although I cannot fault Kiri's technique or the beauty of her instrument, she often offers a somewhat superficial interpretation of the music. Not so in this case. Kiri offers beautiful, often emotional, interpretation in this recording. The music itself is stirring and the Maori group is fantastic. Kiri has done numerous \\"cross-over\\" recordings in her day as an opera singer, but this is the best. Though this is not operatic in any way (except perhaps the technique Kiri brings to the music) it is highly enjoyable and not a disappointment at all, even to the opera enthusiast! This album appeals to a wide audience. I strongly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Wonderful!","review":"Maori music is interesting, and a great background sound. Kiri's voice is excellent, but for those of us who don't care much for opera, just another great voice. However, in this album the Maori songs become a living, pulsing ocean, and Kiri's voice a beautiful dolphin swimming in that ocean! She moves smoothly and effortlessly, now vanishing, now leaping in the air, but always creating something that makes this album far exceed it's individual parts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"appreciation","review":"Dame Kiri performance is, as usual, outstanding.

She goes back to her Maori heritage and sings along with loud musical accompanyment. At least for my ear it is loud music -- in my opinion Maori music should be without any accompanyment, or at a low level. The true Maori voices are such a joy when they are singing unaccompanied. This CD was accompanied by The Abbey Road Ensemble -- nice for rock musicians, but not what I am looking for.The song selection is fairly good, although I was disappointed that some of my favorate pieces were not provided -- but what can you do on a single disk.A real plus for this CD was the provision good booklet notes on the various compositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of a great artist's life.","review":"...As such it is an extraordinary contribution to her repertoire, the simplicity of remembered childhood.Listen to the wonderful track 2 \\"shout song\\" - all exhuberant joy - and try to equate that with her later Mozart recordings, or the exquisite \\"Songs of the Auvergne\\"..

Secondly, the story is a hash of magicians, wolves, dragon, scorpion, slaves, etc., and 'let's all be friends and play nice' morality. Whoever produced, directed, and wrote this mess needs to 'examine their priorities', as Ron Weasley would tell them. Baby Jesus turns out to be a bright light, the angel is a poor rip-off of the genie from Aladdin, David's slingshot kills the dragon (oops! spoiler! but you aren't really going to watch this, are you?) and Herod (who probably was a monster in his own right with no help from sorcery whatsoever)is a spoiled brat.

It does have some of the traditional anime fighting like you see in such animes as Sailor Moon, it has super cool supporting characters and the kind of bad guys that make you want to throw things at your tv, but it also incorperates several exciting new story elements, the most important being the true focus of this anime is the rivalry between the two main protaganists. This is emphasized so much that the series doesn't end where all the other animes end, the bad guy defeated and everyone lives happily ever after, but rather two episodes later with one last contest of strength between the two main heroes. This is an anime of the highest calibur, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show.","review":"I'm very surprised that this series only has an average rating of 3 and a half stars. This is a fun series packed with enough action to make your eyeballs explode. The plot outline is based on \\"Alter Users\\", people who wield strange, unnatural abilities.

I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, I got on this Masonic conspiracy kick","review":"So, I got on this Masonic conspiracy kick a couple years ago and this is one of the books I purchased. Previously, I had read and very much enjoyed Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods book and actually picked this one up at the book store since it seemed to mix ancient history with Masonic lore. I was pleasantly surprised at the vast amount of research in this book. With conspiracy and New Age books like these, it doesn't really matter so much whether you agree with the author or not, but rather does the author present a plausible case just to get the reader thinking. This book excels at that.This book covers such diverse (yet possibly linked) topics as the rise of civilization, Stonehenge, Noah's flood, and Enoch's connection. (Enoch was Noah's Grandfather and a significant figure in Masonic lore).I recommend this book for anyone interested in antediluvian Biblical history, Masonic lore, Stonehenge, or undiscovered ancient human civilizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Supremacy?","review":"I have generally enjoyed Robert Lomas books. I have to admit this has to be the boldest attempt an author to paint ancient Egyptian white. This book reminds me of the turn of the centuary archeologist who would say \\"nothing originated out of Africa, it must have been the Greeks who gave them their knowledge\\". But even worst the Druids giving someone knowledge to build civilization? To even suggest that anything British or European are the twelve tribes of Israel are the founders of ancient civilization is a cruel, insensitive joke.I give it an extra star for it being a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic alternate view","review":"I've read this book 3 times, its an excellent alternate view of prehistory. It does tend to gloss over the details, but that seems to be just because it would be tedious to include everything - all points are referenced. As someone who grew up in Ireland I've always found the simple 'it was a tomb' explanation to be a bit thin - lomas and knight give a well explained theory on what the 'tombs' actually were, who made them, why and how it links in with what documents and evidence have been left to us. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A challenging and good read.","review":"I thought this was a little repetitive, but that is the style used by the authors to get their point across. This is well worth the read if you are willing to analyze the data presented objectively first, then make up your mind later.I personally thought the facts of the argument were well presented and didn't have an issue with any of the references to Biblical information that other reviewers mentioned. I say judge for yourself!Overall a good read.Rev. Stephan Bradley[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun to read but tremendous leaps of faith","review":"Like their other books this is a great story with all kinds of interesting tidbits of information to tickle your imagination. The problem is that these guys really aren't hardcore scholars in any way shape or form. They make tremendous leaps from idea to idea assuming that if A is true and B is true then C is connected and therefore every letter of the alphebet is also. Unfortunately often they are not and if you read the books critically you will see the gaps. Assumptions are not facts. The books are fun to read so enjoy but take everything with a grain of salt. I do agree however that we should be looking to the heavens for big peices of rock flying towards us and that we should be thinking globally. Some good stuff but overall just another story to pad the mystery of freemasonry and the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and offbeat","review":"Some parts of this book were riveting and I found myself convinced about several of their main ideas, relating to the astronomical uses of the ancient henge formations, the flood/comet theories, early use of writing and even the link between the ancient Jews and the Celts.The Masonic material was far less convincing, and I noticed when this topic came up the academic footnotes tended to try up - whether or not that's important depends on your point of view on academic rigour.There are some breathtaking assertions simply stated without any attempt at substantiation or even explanation. Despite this serious flaw, the book as a whole was fascinating and gave me a great new insight into prehistoric times. I enjoyed the deeper understanding it gave me into the structures like Stonehenge.Definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT connection to civilization one, Stonehenge, Bible, and more","review":"EXCELLENT, VERY thought-provoking book basically addressing the question \\"If people walked the Earth 2.6 [recently revealed to be 4.4] million years ago, why do we only seem to have civilization from about 10,000 years ago?\\" Suggests a comet hit Earth around 7460 BC, and again in 3150 BC; connects Bible/Book of Enoch to oral history, Knights Templar, and Freemason rituals. Addresses timekeeping, astronomy, megalithic cultures, origination of Old Testament text, Old Irish legends, Jewish-French nobles, and so much more. One of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read.Became much more interesting and instructive as I actually started creating (it takes at least one year for a location)a mini-Uriel Machine following the instructions provided! EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Research!","review":"I loved the book!

I'm not an expert on the Big Band Era, and maybe songs were known by different names, however several of the songs are easily recognizable standards, that appear to have the wrong name: Track 5 is listed as \\"See Saw\\", but is clearly \\"I'm In The Mood For Love\\". Track 6 is listed as \\"Nevertheless\\", but is actually \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\". Track 12 is listed as \\"Body And Soul\\", but is \\"Embraceable You\\".

Most of the songs are great and mesmerizing, the plot is great although the script could have been better.All in all this Bluray is a must have for all Bollywood fans who want to experiance a little \\"masala\\" in high defenition for the very first time !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably spent a good amount on the visuals but not enough on the plot","review":"The visuals (art, lighting, effects etc) were stunning - but that's it. I couldn't even make it halfway. The story was sooo weird. I've seen many Bollywood films (not more than your average Indian but certainly more than your average American) and I can honestly say this is one of the worst stories/plots ever - I don't even remember what was going on.. I just remember telling myself, \\"hold on..give it another 10 minutes.\\" After 40-45 minutes I pulled the DVD out and cursed at myself for wasting that much time.

The whole film is a like art painting. if you cut down any scene to a single frame, it looks like a peice of Art.well, certainly not impressive at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark.","review":"This movie was dark and depressing without a cohesive story-line. Who was this story about? The prostitute? The musician? The girl on the bridge? I still have no idea who the main character was supposed to be, but I also don't really care, because all the characters were unlikeable. There were too many points of view going on throughout the movie. I watch Bollywood films because of the colors and vibrancy, this film had none of that. I found the characters annoying and I couldn't wait for this movie to end! I had a difficult time watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Engrossing","review":"I'm a big fan of Sanjay Leela Bansali and when I had heard mixed reviews about this movie, I thought I might not like it.

Don't listen to the bad reviews...watch this movie and then judge it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever!","review":"I've seen Saawariya over 6 times at the cinema and each time I loved it more and more. This movie is a modern day classic. Each scene and frame is flawless. The two newcomers are just fanastic. Ranbir Kapoor proves that he is from the legendary Kapoor family and as for Sonam Kapoor, I can't say enough. She's just MIND BLOWING! She looked absolutely gorgeous and portrayed the role of a character with so many shades with much brilliance. Both of them will go a long way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-produced Bollywood","review":"This movie was well produced and has a beautiful, semi-fantastical setting (almost more like a village in France than India). The acting and cinematography were both very interesting, with some beautiful shots. However, it lacked the light-hearted comedy and story that attracts independent American viewers. My wife and I love seeing Indian movies about the conflicts between traditional Indian society and modernity. In these movies, the family is both part of the plot and oftentimes comic relief. However, I didn't laugh once during this film. It's a serious love story, but mixed with the dancing and fairy tale setting, it's hard to take seriously.A related problem is that this movie simply had too much singing and dancing. I know Bollywood movies tend to have a lot of singing and dancing, but at times this movie seemed to have more music video scenes than plot. I ended up fast-forwarding these sequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet sad","review":"i loved the film's fairy-tale quality. for a Westerner, i think you will enjoy it best if you don't compare it to anything else; although it reminds me a lot of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg in its overall emotional effect (plus lots of singing in both)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie, had to own it!","review":"I had rented this one last year and loved it.

I was raised in an all white-community and a lot of what he spoke of in the beginning of the book was completely foreign to me so I learned a lot. I started out hating Bryan Terry but came away feeling drawn to him. I can't wait for Mr. Wagner to write more and continue with this story.

If you're interested in this subject, it's a book you may want to consider getting.

Meanwhile, it is very interesting and revealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too tough to decipher...","review":"This is the second such book I have bought on the subject of Face Reading.

The author's chosen examples are absurdly, fantastically off-point - for instance, the Hebrew word mishpacha (family) is likened to the Greek word sperma (seed). The vague similarity in sound is scarcely better than random (I can think of lots of words which have an \\"s\\" and a \\"p\\"), and the meanings are sort of in the general area having to do with procreation; with this loose a standard, I doubt that there are unrelated words in any two languages."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I do know...","review":"What I do know for a fact is that Modern Hebrew is nothing but yiddish(fact) from the Askenazi's...

I thought the book would offer solutions to co-parenting issues or offer advise on how to work with a less-than-amicable former spouse. Instead, this book focussed on women who were dealing with deliquent husbands - how to make them pay, how to keep them involved, etc. It would have been more helpful to additionally offer advise on how to make her share the kids, how to make her co-parent with him, how help her move beyond the fight of the parents to the health of the children.

Instead the child in this book has a fit and is rewarded when his mom gives in and buys ALL the stuffed animals he wants.

Is this a reality for any of us???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensively didactic","review":"Schlessinger knows very little about children's literature and has written a bald moral lesson instead of a story fit for a picture book. The whole idea of teaching children through stories is that they will listen and learn more from an engaging story than from hearing an adult simply state a moral lesson, such as, \\"Don't be greedy\\" (the moral lesson this book offers). This title lacks an interesting story and is basically a short, badly written moral lecture with amateurish illustrations. Exceedingly few (if any!) children will enjoy hearing this book or looking at the ugly, poorly crafted art. A subtler story, such as Henke's classic Weekend with Wendell, will have a far deeper impact toward teaching children not to be greedy.This is a truly awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message passible with some follow-up","review":"I really looked forward to buying this book as it was so close to Christmas and my eldest child was pointing to everything in the store and saying \\"I WAAAANNT it!\\" I'd hoped maybe the book would open a dialogue about not getting everything we want as well as donating to the needy (as this book was billed). While the little boy did end up giving away his toys to a shelter and he learned what he already had was more important than all the things he got - it took a horrible way to get there. And by the time we got to the final message - the little attention span had spent! We talked about the book and discussed it - and I think the final message got through - but with a lot of work. Although the illustrations were very good - this book is probably not worth your time. You could do more just talking with your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesson Wrongly Taught","review":"This thing cost $16.00?

It's quite depressing to walk into a bookstore and see \\"books\\" such as these crowding out beautiful new or classic picture books.

When Sammy's mother takes him shopping for a birthday present for another child, he throws a temper tantrum in the store because he wants everything he sees. Instead of taking him out of the store, his mother goes ahead and actually buys all the toys for him, hoping that he will come to the conclusion that having everything won't make him happy after all. While Sammy may realize that things don't make him happy, he also has found a way to get what he wants. I can't help but wonder which lesson the child hearing this story will actually come away with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good message, bad delivery","review":"I think Dr. Laura's book has a good message, but she has delivered it in an unfortunate way. The books is about a child who cries and cries for certain items, and the parent gives in a buys them for the child--the message being \\"If you have these items, does it satisfy you.\\" That is a fine message. However, I think Dr. Laura's writing is just a bit sloppy because that message gets kind of lost in all the crying and begging. This isn't great writing for children in the end; it's a good concept, poorly executed. The illustrations are nice, though. I decided to get rid of my copy of the book finally; the book is just too problematical. I wouldn't recommend that parents rely on it as a way of teaching your children this message, I think you can do better with real-life scenarios or hunting for better writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I would do","review":"Initial excitement over this book brought disappointment when I saw the Mother's solution included buying every toy the kid whined for.

Bleagh. Laura Schlessinger's superficial story goes like this: baby cries and whines for different cool new things (\\"I Want It\\"), and the parent relents and buys them all. The point is *supposed* to be, Gosh, if you have everything you ask for, do you feel fulfilled? But, geez, Dr. Laura, way to write a story that misses your own point. I read this aloud to my six-year-old. She didn't get it--she though the point was, See, you should just buy me everything I want. OK, so maybe my kid may not be the smartest kid (I like to think she is, though), but you better hope your kid has graduate-level critical thinking skills to understand what Dr. Laura's message is. I was utterly disappointed and troubled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work for Any Age","review":"I have to agree that the lesson that comes through is \\"If you whine enough, you'll get it all.\\" Perhaps with a slightly older target group the more profound message of \\"Having *stuff* is not really important\\" would come through (there are some adults this would benefit). The text and illustrations are prepared for the very young, the underlying message is appropriate for an older group."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a waste of money....","review":"I was shocked when I actually read the book. In there, the fitful child actually GETS all the toys he fussed about in the store. The ending is idyllic. That a child, who is obviously prone to \\"I want\\" fits in a store, would somehow awaken to his own folly. In the middle of the night no less, after several times waking up. It is pure fiction. If you are buying this book to help stop your child of the \\"I wants\\", seek an alternate route."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives the wrong message!","review":"The fundamental message most children will take away from this book is that if you whine and whine and whine you'll get what you want. The parent in this story does this to solve the child's whining for objects. The abstract morality about \\"things cannot bring you true happiness\\" will be totally lost on your child and, in short, the message will backfire. Save your money on this title and explore better-thought-through plots in other children's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it.","review":"This book is no literary masterpiece, to be sure, but it is well-written and teaches an important lesson.

Anyone who takes the passage in the Bible that says that a woman shouldn't speak in church literally only needs to pay attention to what this woman says. What she says is so powerful and well thought out that she is clearly speaking according to God's will.The Battlefield of the Mind is a great book. Its popularity and success is well deserved. I was afraid that she would go in the spiritual warfare direction-spirits and rebuking, etc. I was wrong, the advice was very practical and down to earth.

This book is a great tool for a Bible Study session with friends. This book is guiding me through my life as a Christian one second, minute, hour, and day at a time. I am very blessed that a friend recommended this book to me in my time of need. When needing a little push or encouragement, I pick my Kindle up along with the bible and somehow Joyce Meyers always leads me to a scripture that speaks directly to me and my situation.

It really opens your mind to the importance of having the right mindset. I read this book from beginning to end without taking any notes, but I will be reading it a second time, taking notes. There is so much knowledge in this book, I recommend it to all women and men. I like the way she handles her use of scriptures in the book. Instead of just giving the place of the scripture ex: ( see Matthew 1:1) she actually quotes the entire scripture. I liked that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for women everywhere.","review":"Every woman should read this book, but I especially recommend this book for new mothers.

Having a newborn child has been the most trying time in my life - you're tired, your house is a mess, you wish your husband would help more, you would like to know what sleep felt like again and you have to get up and go to work. This book deals with all the feelings and thoughts that go through your mind and teaches you how to use prayer and stop sinful mind patterns. She is very straight forward and does not pretend that it is an easy task. She offers encouragement and examples of how bad thinking effected her life.You will want to read this book more than once, because it's teachings are so profound. It will truly impact your life. You'll wish you had read it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome so far","review":"I started reading two days ago and I'm almost complete.

The voice of the reader on this CD is very monotone and I didn't get the impact that I usually do when listening to a CD that Joyce reads herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Awareness","review":"The more you resist something, the greater power you give to it. That's the meaning, I think, of Jesus' words: \\"When someone strikes you on the right cheek, offer him your left as well.\\" You always empower the demons you fight. That's very Oriental. But if you flow with the enemy, you overcome the enemy. How does one cope with evil? Not by fighting it but by understanding it. In understanding, it disappears. How does one cope with darkness? Not with one's fist. You don't chase darkness out of the room with a broom; you turn on a light. The more you fight darkness, the more real it becomes to you, and the more you exhaust yourself. But when you turn on the light of awareness, it melts.For a different perspective on this matter, I recommend Anthony De Mello's book, Awareness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reckless drivel","review":"MISHANDLING GOD'S WORD.Reckless drivel.Inaccurate Biblical interpretation is deadly, ETERNALLY.Try Dr. John Macarthur and John Piper for life changing, inspirational and God honoring Biblical TRUTHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battelfield of the mind","review":"I can't believe I haven't read this book before.

I haven't completed it just yet because I keep having to use some of the beginning chapters to help me keep my mind focus on Christ and to win the battles the enemy tries to destroy me with in my mind. LOL! The best chapter is the chapter about mind-binding spirits, I always go back to that chapter and read it when the enemy is waging war in my mind. I am determine to fight the good fight, and the battle between my sinful nature and that of God's new creation(me)smile, is forever going.

Taking control of our thought life is paramount to walking in every promise that God has released to us. This book is a must-have for anyone who is serious about walking worthy in the things of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Charismatic","review":"Everyone should check the 'pedigree' of the author of any book. I failed to do this because I listened to her a couple of times. Those times, she was 'right on.' (Seemed to be accurate) But after buying the book, I found out that she was a Charismatic person and relects the Charismatic beliefs which I do not share. Later we watched her and had to turn the TV off because we could not stand what we were hearing.....because it was so far removed from the teachings of scripture.Now, I am not saying that the lady is not a Christian because I think scriptures come from all walks of life; but her beliefs are radically different from ours. But she has been in trouble with the government (IRS) and her taking of excessive money from the ministry is to me a real question of rather she is viable in any arena.The book is a hodge podge of charismatic 'mess'....if you please and this is from a person who was a practicing Charsmatic christian long before she ever got involved in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"This book is so poorly written that I couldn't even finish reading it.

I always wanted to know how to hear from GOD. Well, it's easy. If the thoughts you are having are not for your GOOD,they are not from GOD. Faith is not a feeling, it's a fact. Satan gets in your mind and plays on the area that you are weakest . God is real. GOD'S word is for you. God's promises are for us.

I am sympathetic to the plight of gentrification. However, the tone of this feels as though she were a professional complainer. Neighborhoods change, that is a fact of life. The residents who were displaced in this book were undoubtedly not the same residents from the time it was built. You get the sense that the author feels like everything about every neighborhood is worth saving. It isn't. I'm not going to cry about a neighborhood with less crime. And what solutions are offered? Should one never try to improve a distressed neighborhood, so that no one ever has to move? What sort of building *should* be allowed in a city? Ms. Solnit has some very valid points in this book, but she comes off as anti-change and not really offering anything close to a solution, other than fossilizing San Francisco in the \\"good old days\\", whenever that was for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow City: History of Its Flux from Origins to Eternity","review":"The historical journey Solnit takes through the reoccurring demise of San Francisco's bohemian culture only leads to sob stories in the end and does little for her cause. Remember, these now run-down neighborhoods and homes were expensive and new when first built 100 years ago. Yes, it's horrible that in our time the materially rich are pushing the spiritually rich out of the city, but the book only shows that artists will one day come back again.

I will buy from this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I remembered!","review":"When I was little, my mother always kept a bottle of 4711 on her dresser. I remember many a summer day helping myself to a splash of the cooling fragrance; it instantly elevated my mood and made me forget the heat. I hadn't thought about it in years until I saw it here on Amazon and ordered a bottle for old times sake. It's as wonderful as I remembered, pleasant and light and so refreshing on a hot summer day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Perfect","review":"My Mother in Law got me a bottle of this for Christmas, and I loved it.

Very interesting history."},{"rating":"1","title":"old lady smell!!!","review":"I should have payed more attention to the reviews that said their grandma wore this cologne. It is not like modern mens cologne at all. It smells like how old lady's like to smell. That is not a good smell for a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource book on farming and dairy production","review":"This book is highly enjoyable and informative for children, and I think that every child with an interest in farming would be happy to own a copy. I strongly recommend this book to parents everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MOO (smile)","review":"Good teaching book. It's like going on a school field trip to a dairy farm. Very explicit and detailed. The book teaches children and adults as well, how the anatomy and digestive system of a cow is different from that of a human. My favorite part is at the end of the book where the author presents a visual chart of milk and other dairy products. The illustrations are awesome and very detailed also. It is a seasonal routine demonstrating the process of where milk comes from, how it becomes milk and how the milk is extracted. It was very interesting to find out what other animals were milk makers.Jennifer Dunagan,author ofAuntie Jennie's Puppy:The Adventuresof Santana and Santana's Harrowing Halloween"},{"rating":"1","title":"Collins Robert French/English-English/French Unabridged Dictionary","review":"The name of this book is very misleading. It sure is not unabridged the way I would want. Compared to other unabridged dictionaries I own. As soon as I received it I could see something was wrong. The book measures 10.5\\" x 8\\" x 2.5\\" Hardly the size of a full unabridged dictionary. It's just an unabridged version of the first printing. I did keep it for a backup. It was also way overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grave Disappointment","review":"Long-time fans of Seven Nations may find themselves confused and disappointed by this bland homogenized mix of very short songs. While I've enjoyed their music for a long time, I find almost nothing to praise in this offering. In a departure from their other work, the guitar figures prominently, the pipes are missing in action, and Kirk's vocals are oddly muted. It appears Seven Nations is reaching (cautiously) for the big time. While I have no problem with the lack of \\"traditional\\" music, it seems the group has turned its back on everything that made their music distinctive and compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound on new album","review":"With all original music on this album, Seven Nations has hit their stride. Great lyrics, great music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And Now It's Come to What??","review":"If this is what it's come to, I'm not very interested in hanging around for the ride. I've loved the band since I first heard them while unpacking boxes at work, but listening to this album just leaves me feeling pretty empty. Wonderful is a pretty interesting song lyrically and musically, and I can find something to like about the re-worked version of \\"God\\" (now entitled \\"Up to Me\\"). Other than that, I really don't care for this album at all. Had this been the first I'd heard of 7N, I never would have become a fan. I liked the band for their energy, originality, and the escape from radio-mush that they provided. Unfortunately, almost all of that is gone. This may be their most radio-friendly album to date, but at what cost? If you haven't heard 7N before, this is not the album to buy. Check out some of their earlier offerings (Big Dog, Seven Nations, The Pictou Sessions) for some really rocking original tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven Nations no More","review":"If you're reading this, you have already read quite a few raving reviews of this album. This isn't one of them.I have followed Seven Nations since they were known as Clan na Gael, almost 10 years now. I'm a founding life time member of the fan club. If you are looking for Bagpipes & Guitar, traditional and skillful piping, this isn't it.Put simply, they've sold out. They're now about as Celtic or Scottish/Irish as the Boston Celtics. Gone are the 'pipes, gone is the emotion, excitement, the energy.There's not one song on this CD I'll list to again. It's not that they are bad songs, they're not, they're just not Seven Nations. Here's a clue guys: if I wanted to listen to this type of music, i'll pop Dave Matthews, Creed, or Incubus in - and they do it better than you do.Put the kilts back on, pick up the 'pipes, and do what you do best, don't try and be something your not in an already glutted marked."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THEIR BEST","review":"Love, love, love this CD . . . just heard Seven Nations for the first time about 6 months ago when their \\"Time as the Enemy\\" was in pre-release. Decided to collect all their past CD's - this is one of my favorites if not my very favorite. Kirk is so melodic and there is a good variety of song styles on this CD. BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing and Classic","review":"\\"and now it comes to this\\" is my third Seven Nations album. I am blown away by the energy of this album. I look forward to any new music from this band and admire the talents of each member. The \\"new\\" sound may be influenced by the new drummer. Crisco rocks! His youthful energy on percussion may be the perfect compliment to Kirk's voice and Dan's fiddle. This is evidenced in track 9 - \\"Up To Me\\". Struby's bass smokes and Scott's pipes rule! Thanks to this song I have quit playing air guitar and started playing air fiddle. I wanna be like Dan... but with less hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen to Duel D Christian","review":"I should have listened to duel's review he is right on! I first heard 7N on thier live at that palace CD and was blown away! Kirk now thinks he's Rob Thomas and has reduced the pipes and fiddle to background noise, He could have got a studio keyboardist to play back there and call the group Kirk. I love the Live disc but this is watered down pop crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical 7n material","review":"I saw this band live, and ordered this CD online two days later. I was bitterly disappointed. There isn't anything wrong with the CD, but it isn't the typical 7 nations sound. It sounds very mainstream and ordinary. If you are looking for the celtic flair, try another disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eject","review":"It would give me no greater pleasure than to say what a wonderful album this most recent release from 7N is. But the fact of the matter is, this is not a great or even a good album.After having seen them perform live many times since 1997, and even as recently as this weekend in Chicago (where they played 55 minutes of a show that was supposed to be 1 1/2 hours long, after starting 15 minutes late), I was immensely dissapointed. They sound like every other rock/pop group that say they are different, but in reality are not. If you want REAL Celtic Rock music, check out \\"The Young Dubliners\\". As for this album, it's come to this...it will be stored in the circular filing cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I bought this album after my first 7N concert. A friend of mine bought their last album and man, what a difference between the two. But I think it just goes to show that they are evolving as a band. In this album you can still definitely hear the Celtic influence, clearly not as much as in the last album, but it's still great music. I would highly recommend this CD to others"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Album","review":"You will be disappointed--unless you like fairly non-descript rock. There is nothing Celtic about this album--I can see why Dewar's dropped sponsorship. On the other hand, it makes a great coaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I looked forward to the new album with great anticipation. I own all of their albums. With Seven Nations unique style; choice of instruments, and Celtic melodys set them apart from all other groups. However, their performance in this album makes them sound like every other generic \\"garage/grunge\\" band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk","review":"In the mid 90's 7N was on top of the world. Rain and Thunder, Old Ground, and Big Dog are phenominal albums. I highly suggest you purchase them.But after Nick and Neil left Kirk changed the direction of the band. Not wanting to be known as a \\"Celtic Rock\\" band after you build your foundation on said music is truly biting the hand that feeds you.7N lost their sponsorship (and tour bus) from Dewars because their latest recordings aren't even in the Celtic Tradition.The songs on this cd are tepid, bland alternative rock. Most of the time you can't even hear the pipes and fiddle. The band needs to grow up, return to the music that got them gigs in the first place.If you are looking for a band that has blistering pipes and fiddle tunes go buy anything from \\"Enter the Haggis.\\" Those guys will make you dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLICHE","review":"Ok, the truth is that this album is not really Seven Nations. I mean, it says it on the album, but it is inferior to all of their other offerings. I like it when Seven Nations blends some pop offerings into their music...but on this album the entire list is just pop. CLICHE!!! Seven Nations used to be my favorite band. What they need to do now is go back to making music for themselves rather than to sell records to mainstream America, which, I must say, has arguably the worst taste in music. If you want real Seven Nations, buy every one of their other albums first, especially BIG DOG. Even at their last concert, the just didn't really seem to enjoy playing their songs as much as they used to. This album as well as this band's current trends are very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I had hoped","review":"I had such high hopes of hearing good Irish music first and foremost and just good music in general and was sorely disappointed. This band is a joke. I saw them live in Winnipeg and it further cemented my dislike for this group. We couldn't help but make fun of them the whole time. This is just the same old same old crap every other mediocre pop novelty band is putting out only the others do it better. If you were looking for cutting edge Irish rock and roll this isn't it. Go look at Lunasa or Flogging Molly instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story and very well told - a classic.","review":"This is one of the first 'good' SciFi books I came across as a teenager. The quality of the story-telling and the 'mood' created by the characters and the setting were quite memorable. I love this type of story-line but have never been able to find another book that really comes close. I will be dusting off my old copy and reading it very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a shortage of negative utopias, is there?","review":"Upon the recommendation of one of my oldest friends, I borrowed \\"MB\\" from him and gave ti a whirl. I loved it; the diary-esque storytelling was an interesting change of pace, and mirrored some of my own attempts to write in journal narration. The characters were developed, they storyline twisted-- all in all a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it.","review":"If you loved Niffenegger's debut, then this book is for you.When you're lonely.

I'd like to make one...","review":"I read this book a long time ago... I've just been waiting to forget the story so that I can read it again and enjoy it as much as the first time. I was told that a movie was made... I have searched but to no avail... this would trully make a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Kill a Make Nine","review":"Tevis's novel, although originally published in 1980, has an innocent and naive tone reminiscent of SF from the 40s and early 50s. The prose style is simple and unpretentious, the events that befall the protagonists never particularly extreme. These factors are not criticisms but simple observations. But there are major problems with this novel. The story is underdeveloped and the characters tepid and uninspiring. I was never really convinced by the society Tevis posits: there are just too many incongruities and implausibilities for it to ring true. Without doubt MOCKINGBIRD contains the kernel of a fascinating examination of humanity, mortality, and the role technology should be allowed to play within our lives, but unfortunately Tevis fails to realise its promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly book- go and read \\"Man Who Fell to Earth\\" instead","review":"I had high hopes for this book due to the glowing amazon reviews. Also I'd read and greatly enjoyed Tevis' earlier novel, \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\", which is indeed a classic.However, I just found the premise (of near-future illiteracy) and story too silly to enjoy. It's a \\"love-story\\" of sorts: boy love girl but later we learn it's a one-sided affair (after he's sent to prison). Later, he escapes from jail and after a long and arduous journey gets back to the girl- then she suddenly falls for him because he's now a real he-man (all tanned and buffed)! Give me a break....oh yeah, and then the robot takes a flying leap.Seriously, Mockingbird was old-fashioned the day it was published and like \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", it's not aged well at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book stays on my desk in the Lab.","review":"I find this reference to be greatly helpful. Bare in mind, that is a reference, not a textbook on organic spectroscopy, with little information on how to go about interpreting the various spectra. But nearly all the information one needs to interpret MS, UV/Vis, IR, and H and C NMR is in the book.My favorite feature are the combination spectra of common solvents. Much more helpful than simply peak data. I probably look at those pages more often than any others. I recommend this book, especially to newer organic chemists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as later versions","review":"I bought this book for a spectroscopy class I'm taking. I was worried that getting an earlier version would cause me to lose a lot of content, but really the only difference between this 3rd edition and the 4th is a chapter on heteroatom NMR, which you can easily get from someone else if others in your class get the updated version. The book is a fabulous reference for problem-solving, but doesn't go into detail explaining the theory behind it or anything, so if you are looking for that, I'd recommend getting a textbook like the ones from Silverstein or Crews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok!","review":"My 6 sting broke after the second day, I dont know if it was the sting or I put it wrong but I it dint last much! Not happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strings bent","review":"I normally use Ernie Balls, but since this is my first classical guitar, I decided to try D'Addario's for my initial string change. Ernie Balls are always nicely rolled, and the strings come out straight once you unroll them. I've never had classical guitar strings before, so I don't know if all brands end up bent, but the D'Addario's were. Once I had them strung up and tuned, it didn't matter.

I was a little worried when I received them in the mail that they would be DOA but they both worked. I bought 2 since they were cheap and as a back up. It's extremely hard to find replacement bulbs for my tree in local stores or they are ridiculously expensive. I bought one at Walmart last year and it only worked for a week.I used it through the Christmas season and was extremely pleased that it worked for my tree and that it didn't burn out immediately.I was also happy that I got it so quickly.

Instead of throwing it away, I opened it, found the ratings of the bulb, found this great bulb on Amazon, and placed an order. The bulb was shipped in just couple days, so that was awesome. I replaced the bulb, and tested it for a while. The bulb was much brighter than the previous one (which is good for me), and I also felt it was getting warmer. But after keeping it on for hours, nothing was burnt. I put the pumpkin back together, and tested it further for couple hours. Everything was just fine. Next year, we will have our beloved pumpkin ready for Halloween. I should have really given this a 5-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out in a month","review":"The bulb was as advertised, but it burned out in about a month.

Without a glass cover, it's so easy to break the quartz envelope (the center compartment where light is emitted), and you can feel the heat released by the light bulb immediately once the light bulb is on.

I suppose I should say this is one man's opinion of the best in literature because exchanging this title for that one could be the subject of many hours of discussion.About many of the stories included, 'Peter Pan' for instance or Dr Seuss stories, I think there would be little argument. About others, I would like this one, you would like that one. Remember though, we're limited to stories for which we can get rights or which are in the public domain, and to only a couple of thousand pages.All in all, here's a summertime of reading. Some 40 longer works, hundreds of shorter stories. 400+ illstrations including a color section. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this!","review":"An anthology that leaves no stone unturned. This should be considered for use in library studies, childrens' literature courses and post grad studies. Bravo- a resource that we can hold deep in our hearts and minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Chereau's characters brim with individuality and sincerity. While seldom seeing more than the surface of a first impression, as happens in life, each character is defined exquisitely and in depth within a moment of their first appearance. This sounds contradictory, but an examination of real life and our interactions would probably reveal this to be true.We are invited to observe an interacting group of self absorbed individuals whose relationships intertwine like a symphonic work, full of glorious sparkling moments of humanity and somber reflective emotions, sexual intrigue, confrontations that do not exceed the realms of possibility and sympathetic individuals. This is a film which I am sure will reveal more and more understanding with repeated viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um..it was horrible.

They had originally supplied me with a surfboard, so I expected this to work. No end of dropped signals - usually losing 3-5 hrs of internet access daily. Finally, Comcast came out and gave me another rental - this time an RCA, and that was the end of my problems. Except I'm paying Comcast to rent a modem again...

Easy Return","review":"Bought to avoid the monthly charge ($3.00) from Comcast when adding triple play (phone, internet and HDTV). Don't buy this if you are adding both Phone and Internet from Comcast. Comcast uses this exact modem for Internet only. If you are adding Phone and Internet, Comcast uses a combo Modem and charges the same monthly fee. I didn't get Comcast Phone the same day, so Comcast gave me this exact Modem temporarily until phone was ready to be switched. The only problem I had was that I had to unplug both the Modem and my Router every few days to reset because the Internet locks up. Comcast won't do anything because I have my own Router."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install, good performance","review":"After unpacking this cable modem, it took about 10 minutes to connect and to call my ISP (Cablevision) to register the new modem MAC address.

Motorola has, by far, exceeded any expectations in this realm. Although my equipment has been flawless, my system had issues.

I figured I was having line level issues, but a Cox tech came out (one of the rare good ones they have), and replaced the modem with a Webstar. Everything has been great since then.

In my last apartment, the landlord had a guy that took care of everything to do with the internet, I got this unit when I bought a house last winter. I don't even bother with Comcast C/S anymore, I just unplug all connections, wait a minute and plug back in. That seems to fix all connection problems I have ever had.

Incidentally, this modem is recommended for Macs as well as PCs and works fine with my Mac G4. Over the years I have had several Motorola products and have been satisfied with all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modem Suffers from Premature Aging","review":"This modem worked flawlessly for 3 years. But, then as other reviewers have written, connection problems became more and more prevalent. It got to the point that every time I wanted to send an email or access the Internet; I'd have to power cycle the modem and hope that it could complete negotiation with my service provider.Electronic devices (with no moving mechanical parts) should last much, much longer than 3 years. When they don't, there are two primary causes - poor quality components and/or internal heat issues which prematurely age the components. The rapid aging of components due to excessive heat is calculated with a mathematical formula that can predict when a component will fail. Because these modems are dropping dead at the 3 year mark, I suspect that Motorola has a heat issue with these modems. There's no impetus to fix the design, as 3 years is way beyond the warranty period."},{"rating":"2","title":"saves money on Comcast modem rental charge","review":"I should have brought this modem earlier, its the same modem provided by Comcast and charged $9 every month, i bought the used one for $25 (its even less now). now do the math of paying 9 bucks every month vs getting this for $20 one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"SB5120 Surfboard Cable Modem Docsis 1.1 and 2.0 Certified USB","review":"The unit sent t ome did not work after installation and set up with the cable company.

It did leak a little around the edges but nothing a paper towel could not handle. For less than $10, you can't go wrong with this--it is worth a little experimentation.Addendum: I found out if I used the 70% wattage on the micrwave that I can follow the directions included with the cooker exactly and get the right results.

I now use it on for white rice as well so I don't have to worry about forgetting to take the pot off the stove in time to avoid scorching the rice at the bottom.I would have given 5 stars, but the way the lid locks in place looks a little flimsy, though it hasn't caused any problems so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made plastic rice cooker.","review":"I bought this not expecting great quality, but I hoped for at least good.

Foster delivers an amazing performance as a somber and kind of psychotic teen. Noa Hegesh played the smart yet conflicted cheerleader down to a T, showing that even among the in-crowd you can still be an outsider. Unrequited love, which is usually interesting, and a non-clich�� ending (which is very much open to interpretation).The most significant adult in the film is their creative writting teacher (the around which most of the movie is centered), and I've read that the movie is somewhat autobiographical so I felt it did it justice because most people did have a teacher in high school who got them to change or grow up a little (I know I did). It also tried to turn a few stereotypes around.Three time lines occur in the film, which can be confusing at times, but I understood what was going on pretty easily.The storyline takes some pretty unexpected twists and it's got plenty of intense scenes and situations. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceeded my expectations","review":"Scott Michael Foster stole the show. His character, while very dark and misunderstood is brilliant.

Great film. *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good indie movie","review":"I first saw this movie on cable and after watching it 2 times I decided to purchase it for my home collection. I love indie films and this was a really great one. Scott Michael Foster the lead actor is not only extremely talented but so adorable in this role. He really makes you want to love him and makes you want to shake his love interest and say \\"can't you see how wonderful this person is\\". I especially love the way he protects his sister. He dosen't care about how others perceive him and that is his best quality. He is just this broken boy with a dysfunstional and crazy home life who wants to be loved. It really teaches you to not judge others and even though we come from different sides of the track it is possible to build relationships with someone who is not like us IF you allow yourself to. It's a story of love and regret and it really makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"This is one of the movies I have most enjoyed in my entire life.

This film may have more resonance if you were British and those things mean anything to you. Star Dennis Price is hilariously deadpan as he relates in voice-over his efforts to obtain said goal. Alec Guiness, assaying seven roles, is effective in playing the intended victims of Price. Guiness imbues each of these characters (including a female suffragette) with an identity separate from the others that it is quite possible that you don't know it's the same actor in all these roles.

Alec Guiness gives the performance of a life time as the D'Ascoyne family, while Dennis Price edges closer and closer to the Duckdom of Chelfont. No one in this movie is beyond reproach, even the supposed virtuous characters. In this immoral world we find the D'Ascoyne's and their assorted hangers on. Dennis Price is the black sheep of the family who is unrecognized because his mother married an Italian opera singer. As he goes through the elegent business of bumping off the members of his family he also is forced to choose between Edith and the ever engaging, though ultimately wicked, Sybella.

I enjoyed reading John D. Lee's writings and history here, WITHOUT the added derrogatory junk that is found in Mormonism Unveiled. For writing what he could in a short amount of time, mostly from memory, I think he did a fantastic job of bringing things to light that needed to be revealed. A must read for anyone interested in the life and times of this humble man. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"studs lonigan","review":"\\"Studs Lonigan\\" is a trilogy of novels written by James Farrell about his eponymous hero (who is far more like an anti-hero). Farrell is following the naturalistic method and mode which preceded him by authors like Stephen Crane and Theodore Dreiser. There are various flaws with the opus which are far too numerous to go into, especially if one has read the naturalists, for Farrell adds just about nothing to the genre. Farrell went on to write a huge number of books but from what I have been able to gather he never really departs from this formula. I can only recommend the book if you are not familiar with this American (and European) style. And even then in my opinion there is little to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Overall this is a good product; it has a lot of quality features and the pads don't miss.

I got it for Christmas, and.....I don't know, we'll see. The problem is the sounds aren't very real (especially the cymbals,) and the pedal doesn't react properly. Sometimes I click down on it with no reaction. Sometimes it triggers too early or twice. If it weren't for the pedal though, I would think this was okay...I plan on trying it out on MIDI really soon and seeing about having it trigger my propellerhead reason samples. But so far this isn't as cool as I was hoping it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a lot of fun!","review":"We set up a music studio for friends and family to enjoy (instead of all that TV and movie time).

The Enchanter Reborn is proof that De Camp has still a great deal of writing left in him. It is every bit as enjoyable as the first book in this series. Harold Shea returns in his role of bumbling adventurer as De Camp takes him through more worlds of myth come to life. Filled with surprising twists and De Camp's humorous delivery.

For whatever reason, the movie just doesn't doesn't get the humor right. It's not that the jokes themselves are horrible, but they're not great. Even worse is the execution. The jokes fall flat. I think it's partly Simon Pegg. He's not a horrible actor, but isn't funny. The final result comes across as amateurish.I gave the film 2 stars rather than just one for two reasons. First, Megan Fox actually adds some real humor - and is smoking hot! She plays the ditzy American actress perfectly. Second, there is one scene when the dog dies that is hilarious. It's not funny because the dog dies, but rather because it plays on conventional tropes in American comedy in which somebody throws a fall out the window and the dog jumps after it. I did laugh out loud at that one. Unfortunately, that's the only time I laughed out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, messed up disc","review":"I love this movie, its quite funny, but if you are squeamish or on the conservative side then you may not like it, anyway this review is about the actual disc i received, while my DVD play is able to play every other disc i've ever put in it before and since this dvd, it was not able to play this one, i would get an error message, and eventually i got the dvd to play on my xbox, but only once. so make sure and check that the dvd will play as soon as you get it in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS MOVIE, SIMON PEGG IS BRILLIANT","review":"THIS WAS A SURPRISINGLY GOOD MOVIE, I HAD NO EXPECTATIONS WHATSOEVER, I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE AS A GIFT FOR MY WIFE.

When we as a society search for new ways to heal, we overlook the tried and true ways of our elders that are powerful not only in their healing powers but in there emotional and tradition values that are just as important to the healing process. Fools Crow was a great healer who credited his healing to Wakan Tanka and the Great Helpers. He did not glory in himself but understood that there is creative power all around us that can assist us in accomplishing great things if we let it become a part of who we are in everyday life.This book makes you review your beliefs and opens new doors to the simplicity of healing that is such a wonderful gift from the Creator as practiced by Fools Crow throughout his life and in his legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life of Integrity","review":"A wonderful book, by one of the more renowned Holy Men in the Native American Community. \\"Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power\\" offers native wisdom and love.

While \`The Ties That Bind' does not have the same depth of skill as \`Plainsong' the gap between the two novels is slight. Haruf's tale of Sanders Roscoe and his neighbor Edith Goodnough and her demanding family is spare and haunting. Haruf's characters are so real, so genuine and alive that the reader can't help but develop an empathy for them that is rare in fiction today.

The Ladies of the Hymers family have faces straight out of 1940's films - think Greer Garson and Mrs Miniver (one of my all time favourites). The children clearly loved taking part, despite the rationing, possibly because they played as children used to play - look for the go-cart scene - instead of being in front of a TV or computer. The house itself is a time-capsule and the period detail is spot-on. Only one minor issue - I think some of the original music may have been removed to reduce royalty payments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic view of English life during WWII","review":"I am fascinated by the documentaries which have modern families living the way people did in years past. The 1940s House is wonderful with the three generations of the family really committed to living as people did in England during WWII.

It does not come apart, which I knew from the reviews and figured I would find a way to clean it anyway, but I can't get the dead bees and wasps out of it now.

Most info seems to be copied right from the BG manual and the maps are wrong and have wrong names for caption. No useful info in here. I feel ripped off and want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be on the Sales Table. Not Worth the price.","review":"The book is of little help and is frought with inaccuracys. For $5.00 it would be an OK book but for $16 it does not help you with playing the Great Game of Baldur's Gate. Good game! Bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother","review":"This is the worst strategy guide I have ever seen. I cant believe I wasted my money on it.There are no detailed maps, no weapons, armor, or monster lists. The info on magic spells was simply copied from the game manual.There is nothing helpful about this book that you couldnt get by posting messages on the baldurs gate newsgroup or message board.Dont waste your time or your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Here","review":"First, contrary to the description of the book, there are no descriptions of items, monsters, etc., to be found. Instead, there are a number of walkthroughs. The first is a very lame first person account of going through the game, which has no detail. The remainder are lists of quests and little more. Ultimately, they contain only incomplete quest information, and they don't much enhance the experience.There are also no detailed area maps (a shortcoming common to many Brady guides lately) so you're on your own trying to navigate to specific encounters or buildings.The guide to creating a character does little more than repeat what the manual tells you, with absolutely no specifics on how any particular decision will affect the long term development of your character.All in all, there's very little to help you through Baldur's Gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst hint books I have used.","review":"A hint book is to provide useful information. This book uses a \\"diary\\" format with vague references to things to do and get. Maps are virtually non-existent. There are no lists of weapons, armor or special items. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This book is probably the least useful strategy guide I've seen. At least a quarter of it is basically reprinted/rewritten from the manual, and another half is a \\"first person in character\\" account of a path through the game. Nowhere are the useful maps found in most strategy guides, descriptions of creatures, or good suggestions on strategy. The encounters section uses a location reference system which isn't explained in any obvious manner (I still haven't found it), and the text is laid out as if they had to fill a certain amount of space and needed to bulk up the book's slim content. Avoid this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is okay... If you lost your game manual.","review":"This book is incredibly bad. Its mostly just the manual reprinted. Under the character section I didn't find how to make a good character, I found the exact same descriptions used in the game. People say this book is good because it doesn't hold your hand. This book just pretends your inept. The \\"walkthrough\\" was mostly the exaact same stuff that your journal gives you, with the other being the decisions that the person who played the game made.It just tells you some of what you need to know to beat teh game, and the rest it jsut hints at. The guide just names the side-quests, it doens't help with any of them, also everything is piled around so that you don't have a cohesive, chapter by game chapter guide, rather parts of the chapter all over the book. For crying out-loud, they made two seperate walkthroughs, neither of which is very helpful.Save your money, because this book is just an expensive manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Quite frankly the only truly useful thing in this book is one page where is shows the area numbers for all the maps. So I threw it in the recycle bin this morning.It doesn't show hit points of enemies or any of the statistical figures or descriptions of where to find things you regularly expect from such guides. The walkthrough is completely lame and what info there is, is diffcult to find.I recommend you head to gamespot.com to check out Dessloch's guide to BG. It's about 1/3 the price and has absolutely everthing you could want. Also useful is strategy info on websites linked from the BG page.Don't waste your money on this guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"This was without a doubt the worst strategy guide I have ever had the displeasure of laying eyes on. Not only is it poorly written, and organized, but it doesn't elaborate on any of the items, quests or sub-quests mentioned in it. The best they offer on any sub-quest is a two to three sentance blurb. Curious about a magical item? Continue to be, for this book won't help you out. If anyone wants to write a strategy guide they should look to Prima's Diablo (the original Diablo) guide. That was without a doubt, the best guide I have seen out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with John Ciko","review":"I use stategy guides to answer specific questions about games, items, and quests. This book is almost worthless. The maps and diagrams are too small to read and have no labels on any of the streets, buildings, or points of interest. At least one of the diagrams is of the wrong part of town. Many of the subquests are omitted and the ones that are included consist of one descriptive sentence. The book has no logical organization for finding anything. I have spent hours looking for some information on some aspect of the game without success or with very limited success. This is probably the most frustrating \\"Strategy Guide\\" that I own. I agree with John Ciko's review that much better information is available on the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proprietary batteries","review":"I don't know what other product this battery may work in, but for my Konica-Minolta A-200 (which I bought it for), it works fine. After a few years, & many recharges, I've had no problem using this battery, along with the original.As with all things, they get dropped. This never seemed to bother the battery any.Battery life is kind of like MPG for cars. You never get what is listed. Turning the camera off after a shot helps, but what's the point? I will say that this battery will keep going till it can't produce any electricity.It doesn't lose it's charge too fast, while sitting in the bag, & fully charges (OEM charger), even at half full.

Mostly written by the Spanish keyboard player Carlos Plaza, the music has moments of White Willow's female vocals with lush symphonic keys, along with long composed passages of many instruments.There is no ad libbing or noodling around, but a constant flow of interesting ideas. Guitar and flute take the melodies briefly, always returning to the two players on keys.Other influences would be Kate Bush's dramatic overdubbed vocals and the odd chords perfected by bands such as Isildur's Bane or Anglagard, only in a happier mood like After Crying.Includes 12 songs with a full band and a solo piano piece. Both works have the range of ideas which push the boundaries of symphonic progressive rock without being annoying or boring. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important anthologies available","review":"If this book is not on your shelves, or better yet, in your bag, you are wrong!

Well, that version of the toy is hard to come by now; I had to order one from England. BEWARE, PARENTS! This toy now has rubber rings on the insides of the holes. The rings become loose after a really short period of use, and the pegs just fall right through them. Even before the rings get loose, the pegs sit in them wobbly and kids don't get the thrill of getting to pound those pegs (bang! bang! bang!). Just a light tap pushes the pegs through the holes. Argh. Do not buy this toy unless you can't tolerate kid noise at all. Try to find the old-fashioned version of this toy, with the tight-fitting pegs. HINT: the old-fashioned version will have longitudinal slots cut into each end of the peg. My 2.5-year-old daughter LOVES the old-fashioned version. She did enjoy this toy for a short while, but not nearly as much as the loud-banging one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, this was in Japanese, not English...","review":"My intent was to buy the video games soundtrack.

The Slauson Shuffle is a great dance tune, and the rest of the songs will get you up on your feet, too.

Man, these guys would have been KILLER live!I've always been a sucker for mid-sixties boogaloo sounds. Must have been that steady diet of bad Elvis movies I grew up on.

It seems that for half of the movie all that is going on is people are walking down the mountain then back up with water, then repeat. The drama unfolds with some slow motion shots of people almost tripping and/or spilling the water. I have to say there are some intriguing moments though. If you must see this movie, I would recommend the box set 'Beautiful Women of China'. For a few dollars more it includes this movie, Ju-Dou, and Life Show. Please note that as in the Ju-Dou individual DVD reviews, the video transfer quality is sub-par for Ju-Dou in the box set as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roscoe Style is The Right Stuff!","review":"Roscoe Chenier is perhaps one of the best kept blues secrets from Louisiana. Roscoe is often overlooked and has been overshadowed by his more famous cousin, the late \\"King of Zydeco\\" Clifton Chenier. However, those that have seen him perform at the New Orleans Jazz Festival and/or in clubs along the Louisiana crawfish circuit, know that Roscoe is the real deal. Unlike his cousin, Roscoe relies upon his guitar rather than on accordian to conjure up that cajun sound. Upon first listen, you will hear a lot of BB King in both Roscoes playing as well as his vocals. Give Roscoe Style a listen and you will find yourself looking for some of his earlier releases on the Avenue Jazz label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baby Book!","review":"You can't go wrong with this one.

It has a button that you push to get it to moo. The first book I got did not work upon opening the product. I returned it, and received a second book. It worked for one day, and it too would not moo. The book is cute, and if it doesn't matter to you if it moos or not, then it's a good purchase. Otherwise, steer clear of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Mooer","review":"I must echo the review of RJ Moya. We have gone through THREE of these books already. My daughter loved this book as an infant, and it taught her that cows go MOO--one of her first vocalizations (with identifiable purpose), but the mooer broke within weeks. My daughter cried rivers when we pressed the button and no moo sound came out. We took responsibility though because we really did use it a lot. The second book's mooer, however, died within two days. My daughter was once again heartbroken, so we returned the book and tried it for a third time. This one held in there for a little while, but the mooer died two days ago, and I'm OUT! At 17 months, it's no longer her favorite book, and she doesn't seem to miss it at all. I only gave it two stars because she did love it while it lasted. Quite frankly, I'd stay away from it altogether!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is defective","review":"This would be a great baby book, but mine arrived with the printing on the cloth pages in the wrong order! It should say \\"I'm your very own COW, and I like to go MOO!\\" Mine says, \\"I'm your very own COW, So true I do!\\" This ruined my gift for my nephew. Has anyone else checked their words to make sure they're right? I'd imagine they printed a whole bunch like this. I'm very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken MOO!","review":"This book is super cute. Too bad it came with a broken MOO right out of the box. It gives this odd scratchy noise instead.

I have the hard copy, which I like, and downloaded a sample Kindle version, which I do not like. The Kindle edition occasionally breaks words up; sometimes, more than once per word. While not a deal breaker, editing should be better. The big problems are equations and italics. The equation characters, particularly exponents, are sometimes difficult to identify because they are not fully rendered, and the issue is not with the Kindle. I have a Kindle DX, and expanding the font size does not correct the problem. Missing segments remain missing. Italics have the same problem along slants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting focus on examples","review":"I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley who used this book for an introductory course in Lie theory.I found that Hall's book focuses too much on examples, often allowing the reader to lose sight of the underlying algebra. In the midst of hacking and slashing one's way through matrix computations, one fails to gain a deeper, and more valuable intuition for what Lie groups and Lie algebras are.My classmates discovered and took a liking toFulton and Harris. I wound up usingHumphreys. Humphreys suffers the opposite failing, of being overly sparse and direct, but it succeeds in conveying an appreciation for the elegance of Lie algebras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"It doesn't take a lot of intelligence to figureout how to present lie algebras and lie groupsif you are going to take the matrix route.Namely, you give lots of concrete examples(requiring nothing more than calculus asbackground) and then just state what the generalcase is. In this book, the author uselessly dragsthe uninitiated through swamps of archaic notation(save that for the real thing) and incompleteproofs (where invariably the hard parts are just quoted)so that you have to wonder what in the world is the pointof committing this mess to paper. It is ironic that thevery same publisher already has better books out on exactlythe same topics.

If you're up on your Greek mythology, you'll know the entire plot by page 7. In \\"Matrix-like\\" or \\"Stephen-King-esque\\" style, the main characters have terribly telegraphic names. The protagonist is named \\"Cassandra,\\" for example, so it's not too much of a surprise when we discover she's forever making predictions that no-one believes... unfortunately they're all that obvious.There are, however, some neat sci-fi ideas contained here, and since several of them are quite a lot of fun, interest is somewhat maintained.A decent enough novel for a quick summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and thought provoking","review":"Seeing how Jewish society might deal with the Messianic era in the transitional period at its beginning was extremely interesting.

Why is that? I'm not familiar with all the in's and out's of HVAC's but from my experience with air filters is that there are standard sizes. Very annoying to take out the old air filter and put in the new one to see that it's not the same size and that there's room for a lot of play. I hope that the suction of the vent will make up for the space around the filter and pull the air filter to it to minimize the air going in that's not passing through the filter. Live and learn.

Thomas Dolby does a score to the film that's half trance and half Pink Floyd sounding. It is by far the best film and soundtrack out of all of the mind's eye series. This Turbulence is okay during one scene which is really trippy, but it's very very short and altogether i was unhappy when it was over. I'd like to compliment anyone who had anything to do with the making of it though. It did take some talent to make i'll give it that. Just poorly arranged and should not be sold in stores in a box with art on the cover. someone made alot of money on this back in the day and it just doesn't hold a candle to the 1994 one i was talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great surf album from Del-Fi","review":"First off, it should be noted that The Lively Ones were a much better group live than they were in the studio. That being said, there is some great rock and roll on this album. To me, the only REAL rock and roll is old rockabilly and surf music. This is yet another great album put out on the Del-fi label back in the early sixties. Bob Keane, President of Del-fi Records, recorded a lot of young bands in Southern California. His first claim to fame was discovering, recording, and promoting Richie Valens. But he specialized mostly in surf music bands (The Lively Ones, The Impacts, Dave Meyers and the Surf-Tones), and what was called Hot Rod Music (with a bunch of studio bands that featured guys like Tommy Tedesco and Glen Campbell).

Besides Rebel, which is a short instrumental song, this CD kicks ... It's honestly hard to describe. You have to hear it for yourself.Since I think this is the best CD I've ever heard, I obviously think this is Apop's best CD. It's not as dark as Soli Deo Gloria or as light as Harmonizer.

It's not easy to find prenatal workouts that will get you to break a sweat (if you're already in very good shape).With that said, if I could go back in time I wouldn't buy this DVD. First of all, the length of the workout is too long for me. I usually work out for about 30 minutes. A 50 minute + workout isn't practical for me, and there's no way (that I could find) to select components of the workout to focus on.Second, I think it's kind of boring. By the end I'm frustrated by the workout and I just want it to be over. It's not a fun workout.Finally, even though I don't see any visible scratches, this DVD skips all the time!So again, I wouldn't recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work out!","review":"I bought this along with two other videos and this is my favorite.

She was in incredible shape during her pregnancy and was able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight within 4 weeks of giving birth.

I have been exercising regularly and wanted to maintain a level of fitness and know it was safe.This video is great. As someone who has been exercising, it's nice to have a prenatal video that is comfortably challenging. While the average gal is not going to be in the same shape as a Cirque De Soleil performer ( I do not strive to have ab definition in my third trimester), it offers beginner, intermediate and advanced options to accomodate most levels of fitness. While not cardio intense, I do feel my heart rate comfortably rise and feel like I've gotten a solid safe workout when I am done...just what the doctor ordered!One personal down note - the scripted reading and french accent start to bug me, but I'm in it for the fitness...not the acting.Overall excellent video and workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging with good variety","review":"This DVD is probably one of the more challenging pregnancy videos out there and it is pretty long--45 minutes. But it is very doable because they give you three variations for each move.

Highly recommended by somone who was and is very active in her workout routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and challenging workout","review":"I'm 30+ weeks pregnant and I've been using this video since I was a few months along. Before I got pregnant I worked out intensely, so I was looking for something that was going to be challenging to me but safe for my whole pregnancy. The video was challenging from the start and has remained so thus far (it gets more challenging as I get bigger, but not unbearable). It has helped me stay toned and feeling strong and empowered throughout all of the crazy changes to my body. I would highly recommend this video to anyone who worked out intensely before getting pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Workout","review":"This is a great workout during pregnancy. It's very intense but in toning your arms, legs etc. If you're out of shape you will really feel the burn the firs week or so but I love it because on days that I can't go for a light job or walk I use this video and it really gets my heart rate up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch your breath and break a sweat","review":"This is a great whole body workout for us pregnant gals.

I'm athletic but have been non-active for a while and it pushed me enough to feel like it was doing something without over doing it. I would recommend this for all levels of fitness. At one point, she suggests propping yourself up with pillows to do an abdominal exercise. I found that using an exercise ball was much better because I couldn't get the pillows to offer the support I needed on my lower back. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I was not happy with this workout DVD.

I do the Advanced moves in the video and if you've never worked out before the beginner moves will be challenging enough. I worked out 3 days a week and did cardio 2 days a week prior to becoming pregnant and was unable to keep up with that normal work out so this video was just what I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I bought this DVD right when I got pregnant. I am not a huge fan of the voice over narrating, since it seems a bit odd to me, but I got used to it and this actually became one of my favorite workouts. The only downside to this DVD is that there are no special workouts for each trimester, just 1 workout which is for all of pregnancy which may be a little tough when you're in the last trimester. Although, there are always beginner, intermediate and advanced variations which I liked. (I'm 6 months along so I don't yet know how doing this in the 3rd tri will be.) It's about 45 minutes total including warm up and cool down, and I am always tired at the end which I like, since I frequently worked out before getting pregnant and like to feel tired when I'm done. I would definitely recommend this DVD for those who want to stay active and fit during pregnancy but aren't afraid to work hard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great, Great!","review":"I bought this DVD along with 3 other pregnancy videos and this is absolutely my favorite. The introdution, tips and instructions, workout and features are all on seperate tabs. I really get unmotivated if I am ready to workout and I have to sit through the same 3 minutes of intro and tips every time I play the DVD. I pop this one in, select \\"workout\\" and it begins.As far as the actual workout goes, it makes me feel so relaxed and the movements are so fluid and comfortable. I am sweating when I'm finished, but not exhausted. Karyne has a slight French accent which I find soothing and the music had to have been designed from the team at Cirque du Soliel because it is soothing and relaxing, but motivating and has a great beat to it that flows with her movements. I just purchased volume 2 & 3 and can't wait to add them to my routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Video","review":"I bought this dvd after using Erin O'Brien and Summer Sander's workouts for awhile. I wanted something different to add into my weekly routine. I was very disappointed with this workout. To me it's overpriced for what you get. It's very short and it's kind of bizarre how it's filmed, etc. The workout itself is OK but for some reason everything about this dvd- production, some of the exercises, the narration, just bugged me! I would recommend the Erin O'Brien and Summer Sander's workouts over this one hands down! They are less expensive too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not motivational","review":"I bought this video thinking it would motivate me to work out and it did the opposite. It is so boring and the woman doing the video looks like she is going to fall asleep. I don't recommend this video at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pregnancy Workout","review":"If you are looking for a strength training workout this is it. I felt that the instructor paced herself well so that I could acclimate myself to all of the exersizes. It definately got my heart rate up and made me feel like I was getting a substantial workout. I liked the fact that there was a bit of yoga in the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"good work out.","review":"I found this to be a good workout. The moves are \\"easy\\", but the combination had me sweating and breathing hard. She is a little annoying.The windows coming up with the different levels is informative but somewhat distracting. Overall, I think this video is for women who work out hard, regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & annoying","review":"I found this workout DVD to be very dull and annoying. I've worn out workout DVD's in the past from using them so often, but this one is collecting dust. The exercises are yawn-ville and listening to the lady narrating is annoying. Her accent is terrible. I'd shop around a bit more before committing to this selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Pregnancy Workout","review":"The work out is mostly strength training and takes alot of time-its not broken down into any segments and almost runs an hour for the complete workout from start to finish-not many people have a whole hour to devote to workout at one time. The trainer is from another country and is very fit but is hard to understand-its obvioius she is a gymnest or professional dancer-not a realistic workout. For the price the work out dvd you would think it would be a better quality but its just her working out in a gym that looks like a highschool gym or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I a contortionist? No.","review":"I was so disappointed with this video. First of all, the lady is Canadian. Her stupid French accent drove me nuts. Second, they don't tell you before you order the video that she's a member of cirque de soliel--during the video I felt like an idiot because I couldn't even do the \\"simple\\" moves she was doing. And finally, she can't keep a beat. If you're going to have music in a workout video, then do the moves at the same tempo as the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough DVD","review":"What I love about this DVD is that the creator has made an effort to modify it for beginners, intermediates and advanced pregger moms. That is the best feature of this DVD. If you are up for a challenge and really want to prepare yourself, then do this DVD at least 1 or 2 times a week for a couple of months if you have always been active. Don't push yourself on this one. It has a lot of repetitions and can get boring but it is inspiring to watch the lady do it so effortlessly. I did it for sometime only mostly once a week or so to change things up here and there and I always did the beginners because that is what my gut said. Good stuff.It is understood that you will need to consult your doctor before doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"love it... great... perfect timing.. not too long ... and you do a little bit of everything... beginners... advanced...she is showing different levels... i wish i could do it everyday... i feel it is a great pregnancy work out!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this","review":"Read reviews online and was thinking this was a little more challenging but was an easy workout. Is easy to follow good for beginners. Also purchased new and dvd skips and will not play certain part of work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this video!!!","review":"So i just purchased this video and i absolutely love it!!! Being a military mom i need something like this to keep me toned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I would recommend this video for pregnant mom's looking to keep their tone while they are expecting. I was extremely athletic before I got pregnant & was hoping to be able to keep somewhat in shape with 'pregnancy-safe' exercises. This video did the trick! I did this video 3 times per week (and did cardio every other day) & loved the results. I actually felt stronger than I did before I was pregnant. The video has beginner, intermediate, & advanced variations for some of the workouts and I loved being able to get a good strength training in while being pregnant. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowwwww","review":"Maybe I am more used to get in and out 20min quick workout. The first 3 minutes of dvd already lost my interest. It's a bit weird for a modern mom just wanna get this workout done. I keep telling myself I just have to give it another try someday. The overall motion is a bit slow and too artistic. I am very surprised it received such a high review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a woopsie","review":"I actualy thought this was the Yoga (#2) video and when i recieved it i decided to try it anyway. I didnt get passed the first 30min before i just felt like quitting. The girl is a gymnast for a circus or something and has muscles i dont. She does have different levels of intensity but even on the easiest level my legs hurt so bad the next day. I tried it 3 times and still felt very short of breath and tired too fast. (I did workout before pregnancy) i started doing this video 3months into pregnancy and am now over 7months and theres realy no way i can do it now lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even make it through","review":"I will start by stating that I probably should do the whole dvd before reviewing, but I also think the fact that I could not make it through the dvd is equally important. I did the dvd for about 15-20 minutes and found it so flat, boring and uninteresting, that I quit and put in one of my other prenatal videos. She did offer views of intermediate and advanced positions, and the woman was very toned. Bottom line, there are many resources for prenatal dvds and this one was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I ordered this because so many people rated it well; however, it wasn't good for me. I exercised at the lowest rating because I didn't want to overdo myself. My back hurt so bad the day after that all I could do was lay on the couch. Maybe it's just me, but it was not something I ever want to do again."},{"rating":"1","title":"too tough for average pregnant woman","review":"i was in fairly good shape before pregnancy- worked out about 3x week average intensity at the gym. but this workout was TOO INTIMIDATING for me while pregnant. this would be good for a PREGNANT ATHLETE who was in awsome shape pre-pregnancy and needed to keep muscle tone high while pregnant. i only did one time when i was 16 weeks along and it was too tough for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unbalanced - DON'T BUY THE HYPE!","review":"After reading other reviews and ordering this video, I had much higher expectations than what it delivered. The video was boring, short, and heavy on the arm excercises. I did not think the price was anywhere close to being a value for what they spent on production of this (which had to be almost nothing). I have Pilates videos that are similar moves but much more entertaining and a better, more balanced workout. I have taught aerobics before and would never have had such dull music and surroundings for a class. I could only get through it once, and decided if I want a low impact workout at home I'll just use my regular Pilates videos. What a waste of $30!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good DVD","review":"I got this DVD among others...and I was very displeased. It was very...odd. The woman in the DvD doesn't speak the entire time - instead there is a voice (an annoying one) in the background the entire time. I have been working out to DVD's for years, but this by far the oddest workout DVD ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ask your doctor first!","review":"This is a true workout! You will feel it the next day. She does crunches while elevated on pillows, ask your doctor first if this is ok to do! I bought the video without realizing that she does crunches and later asked my doctor. She said it is not a good idea to do crunches while pregnant. You can still do most of the video but if you are new to exercising I wouldn't suggest this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY WITH BLU-RAY PLAYER","review":"This DVD won't work on our Blu-Ray player and will not get past the menu. I have never gotten to use it. It also won't work on my MAC laptop. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a workout","review":"I bought this due to all of the great reviews and I am highly disappointed. I sweat more walking to my mailbox. This is being returned immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called the 1990's low impact pregnancy workout","review":"This video is not worth $1. I'm extremely surprised that it received so many positive amazon reviews. The production is low-budge, the voice over is annoying and it's not a challenging workout. After 5 minutes of stretching, the workout begins with astep-aerobics a portion. Like most people I konw, I have not done step aerobics since the 90's and don't care to start up with it again. Following the step aerobics are various exercises using chairs, weights, floor, etc. follow in a disorganized fashion. I have the Pilates during Pregnancy video by Niece Pecenka which works the same muscles, but is of better quality and offers a much better workout in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent, but NOT PERFECT","review":"pretty arrogant to call it the Perfect Pregnancy video, but it is ok....the soft tone of the instructor is a bit cheesy; i like the beginner exercisers but found the pace to be a bit too far off the beaten path. I recommend that you try other prenatal videos to form a well rounded opinion, but mine is that this is just ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's your fitness level?","review":"This is a great workout depending on your fitness level. I needed more cardio and more repetitions, but the exercises in and of themselves were great. This workout is probably best for beginners or slightly advanced. If you are used to working out and don't have any pregnancy problems this is probably too easy - it certainly was for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't try to keep up!","review":"I love the DVD. It's just what I was looking for... it has a great warm up section with wonderful and very helpful stretches that really ease pregnancy aches!!! If you only did the warm up section, I promise you, you will be happy. The workout itself is tough! DO NOT TRY TO complete the workout on your first try b/c, like I said, it's tough. Do as much as u can and stop when u need to... In time, i'm sure you (and I) will be able to complete the workout, no problem.the only issue with the DVD is the lack of verbal instruction during the workout. If you aren't constantly watching the monitor, you will fall behind - at least, I did. But the instructor seems very sweet and IN GREAT SHAPE, which works as motivation to keep up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but too tiring","review":"I own three DVDs, Leisa Hart and this one are my favourite... This is an acrobat from Cirque du Soleil who shows a workout from pregnant mothers. It is realy good, but I only recommend it if you are a very sporty woman... I've made sports all my life, and actually am in good shape, eventhough sometimes this DVD is still too tiring for me...I feel Leisa Hart's DVD is more \\"universal\\" for all women, I always take that one at the end, unless it is morning time and I'm not tired at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I like this workout. It's definitely not for someone who didn't workout at all before they were pregnant. There are variations for beginning-advanced. I like that her voice is soothing instead of overly perky like in some workout videos. Overall it's a good strengthening workout for during your pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The athlete's prenatal workout","review":"As a rock climber and runner, I found this to be the perfect workout for maintaining pre-pregnancy tone and fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for new beginners....I got intimidated","review":"I placed it into the dvd and after 1 minute stopped it. There is no real structure... you are exercising right off the gate with no stretching. This is not for me... but then again look at what she does for a living. If you want to pay for the shipping for what I got I will send it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout and has plenty of options","review":"I found this workout was hard enough for me - I am currently 15 weeks and was a regular exerciser before falling pregnant. There is plenty of variety and beginner/intermediate options throughout. I was a bit worried taking a class from a cirque du soleil trapeze artist (!), but with the different options available, I was comfortable through the whole workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"OLD","review":"I may just be being judgemental because I am pregnant. But this is not what I was expecting. To be honest after 10 minutes I turned it off. The video looks like it is from the '80s and the music is awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people who were extremely fit before pregnancy!","review":"I exercise all the time. I have done P90X, Insanity, Asylum, Chalene Extreme - you name it! I am halfway through my pregnancy and have been continuing to do the workouts mentioned. I wanted to try a pregnancy workout that would be challenging enough for my level of fitness but where I could learn what is safe to do during pregnancy. This workout is not it. Even the advanced option in the program feels like I'm hardly doing anything. I did not sweat - at all - and I did not feel sore the next day. I still gave this DVD a 2-star rating because it is better than any other pregnancy workout that I have found. It does SOMETHING, but hardly anything. Parts of it were similar to the Winsdor Pilates DVDs. This DVD is just no where close to my fitness level. I guess I will keep up with my Insanity and P90X because I don't think that an advanced level pregnancy workout exists :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming Back For More","review":"I am ordering The Perfect Postnatal Workout because I enjoyed The Perfect Pregnancy Workout so much! I've gotten a lot of workout videos and this one is the best. Even compared to videos for exercisers who are not pregnant, this one is the most interesting and challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard for me","review":"This video was well done, but the workout was wayyyyy too hard for me. I had to modify most of the exercises and I was so sore the next day, I didn't do it again. I didn't work out a lot before pregnancy, so I needed something more basic. This would be good for someone who is a big workout buff - but not a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"Love this workout...easy to follow and you feel like youve done something by the end. I alternate this with 10 minute Prenatal Pilates...im 5 months and have gained 4 pds. So its worked for me and keeps me feeling good about myself"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I am certainly the oddball here because I thought this dvd was horrible. I have a few other prenatal workouts and this one was used once. For starters her voice bothered me and I know she can't change that but I felt I could get a bigger workout picking up toys in the living room. This one wouldn't be bad for people who haven't worked out for very long or very little but I was doing Turbo Fire before I became pregnant and so this is way too easy for me. Some of the moves made me laugh so I just donated it to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for Pregnancy","review":"I just finished doing this workout for the first time and loved it. I am a runner and have done some Jillian Michaels workout videos in the past. Now that I'm 12 weeks pregnant I was looking for something with just enough challenge. This video fits the bill! I think my arms will be really toned and ready for baby by the end of this pregnancy. Not too hard but I know I will be sore tomorrow. Perfect! Plus there are different levels so you can always challenge yourself or take it a bit easier depending on the day. I also love how she incorporates Kegels exercises into the routine because I always forget to do those! I highly recommend this video :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Excercises","review":"I'm 8 months pregnant and this is the kind of excercises I was looking for. I really don't like the concept of being pregnant is like being on the thirdage, therefore, the most part of dvd's for pregnant women are full of soft excercises which don't keep the body in full activity and don't call up the muscles to keep working. This is a dvd for women who are and love to be really active in real life and are used to do excercises.However there are a few things that should be reviewed like: - When you go from one excercise to another, there is not enough time to make the change, the instructions go too fast. - There is no explanation in all excercises about what group of muscles should be working.I really recommend this dvd for those women who loves to workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"please read this and consider it before you purchase","review":"i was originally very excited about this dvd because the reviews were really good. my original pregnancy workout consisted of speed walking on my treadmill for about an hour 3 days a week, some light free weight exercises and yoga once a week. when my treadmill broke down i wanted to just get a workout dvd that i could rely on in combination with yoga. at 36 weeks into my pregnancy i found out that my baby was breech and in doing A LOT of research into what could cause a breech baby i found out that an overall strong core can cause all the ab muscles and ligaments to be extremely tight, giving the baby less room to move inside your belly and discouraging him to go head down. i only used this dvd a few times so i don't blame it for my situation, obviously, BUT this dvd has some VERY extreme ab work for a pregnant body and if you choose to use it consistently throughout your pregnancy, just be aware that it can have a downside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pregnancy Workout Video","review":"Would not have purchased if I had seen the video prior to buying. There are a few good exercises within the video but I can't get past the poor quality of the video as well as the background being dark and uninviting. I have done this video once and can't seem to get myself to do it again. Looking for another good pregnancy video in the meantime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge waste of money unless you are in AMAZING shape!","review":"I am not in bad shape in the slightest, I began my pregnancy at 5' 7\\" and 120 pounds. I walk, jog, and lift weights regularly; I am toned, but not STRONG. This workout demands an incredible amount of strength, as well as balance, something that very few pregnant people manage to maintain throughout their entire pregnancy. I am 26 weeks pregnant and cannot maintain the balance for half of the exercises. I guess I was looking for something a little more aerobic, and less muscle building.Kudos to anyone who can do this entire lengthy workout pregnant! I'm sure I could do it if I wasn't pregnant, but pregnant? No way! I have easier workout videos that aren't for pregnant people that I think I'll stick with.I'm so surprised that this video received such positive feedback, it's the only reason I bought it, and I really wish I had saved the $20..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for the bin.","review":"Wasted my time and money buying this.

I didn't feel like I worked out after the video was completed. I'm back to doing my prepregnancy workout videos. Hopefully what to expect when your expecting workout video is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instruction","review":"This is a great workout, and she does a great job giving variations for different levels of difficulty. The video is not flashy, but does a good job explaining how to do exercises safely, and shows multiple screens to remind you how to do the easy, intermediate or hard version. Make sure to watch the instructional part of the video before doing the exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far...so good.","review":"Just got the dvd in the mail and popped it in today for a first run through it. I was thoroughly impressed. No wimpy pregnancy workout here! I was sweating by the end. Loved the thorough stretching at the beginning and end of the tape and the clear directions in the voice-over. It was super inspiring to see a woman who was that pregnant and also that buff! Woohoo!!! I was dead tired by the end of my first round and feel certain that I got a good workout. I'm looking forward to building up to making it all the way through and then trying a few of the advanced or intermediate modifications. I love that she's worked Kegels right into the routine. Way to help us see our pelvic floor muscles as part of our body that needs to stay in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective whole body workout","review":"I like this DVD because she combines pilates, yoga, strength training, and even kegels for a great workout.

I don't think I can do another round of the exercise with the bad music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous workout!","review":"This is my fifth pregnancy and this is one of my favorite workouts. I work out 3 -5 times per week (always) and I think that I will continue to use this workout even after the baby is born - it is that effective. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout . . .","review":"I was in pretty good shape before my pregnancy and routinely did weight lifting and other aerobic activities. My physician said that my normal workouts would be just fine till 14 weeks of pregnancy and so I didn't even bother with prenatal videos till I was further along and needed to make modifications. There seems to be very little direction in this area so I was grateful to find a DVD that allowed me to do something I was accustomed to in my newly pregnant state. I'm in my third trimester and this workout video helped me stay toned. I use it alternating with the Shiva Rea prenatal yoga. This also helped strengthen my back and various muscle groups to help support the weight of my growing baby. Also, it helps your state of mind to buy some pregnancy workout clothes that fit and are comfortable. Looking huge in your regular T-shirts can be a disincentive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous workout video","review":"Personally, I hate workout videos. They are always hard to follow and you never break a sweat. This video, however, breaks the mold. It is very challenging and you will sweat and be sore afterwards. It is so perfect for preganancy because just as you feel like you can't do anymore, she provides relief, and then you are moving on to the next exercise. Plus there are beginner and advanced modifications. It's perfectly timed and will keep you in shape during your pregnancy. One thing though, you will not be able to rely on this video alone, you will need to pair it with some type of cardio such as walking or using an elliptical. As a woman who did vigorous workouts before pregnancy such as spinning, cardio kickboxing, and running between 3-7 miles at a clip, I strongly recommend this video. Let's face it, when your pregnant no matter how good of shape you were in before you became pregnant, you just cannot do what you did before....buy this!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This is a great workout. It only takes about 45 minutes and you are provided with different varieties of each move (beginner, intermediate and advanced) depending on where you in your own fitness. It's nice to because she is pregnant. It starts with a warmup and ends with a cooldown. I definitely felt the workouts doing their job and was a bit sore the next day, which is a good sign. I hope to move up the intermediate and advanced moves as I go through the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging workout!","review":"There were definitely some parts of this video that I laughed at, but generally speaking it's a pretty good workout! I consider my self to be in pretty good shape, and there were some parts where I was definitely breathless and/or having difficulty pushing through muscle fatigue (I did the advanced version of the workout).This will be a staple during my second trimester. I don't think I'll be able to do some of the moves during the third trimester though. I also don't like the crunches, and wish the actual workout portion was a little bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but great workout!","review":"This is a very challenging exercise video. I was sore for days because I completed it all the first time I saw it...and I did it under the beginners mode. You may want to build your stamina by breaking it up into sections per day. Overall, I think if you want a great prenatal workout, this is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I loved this video. I have not been exercising regularly prior to pregnancy and this video has a great beginner level which can take you a long way. What I loved most about this video is that it helped me get over my fear about what I can and cannot do with my body during pregnancy since this is my first child. I love the fact that the exercises have a lot of impact and you really feel you are getting a good workout, not just doing simple exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I really like this workout because it is challenging but does not require too much coordination. The instructor shows different ways to do each of the exercises to increase/decrease the intensity and you can pick which is right for you. Also, it focuses on the total body which I really like. I guess I should also add that I am not in great shape but not terrible shape either. I don't know if this is a good workout if you are a real exercise buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Pregnancy Workout","review":"I really enjoy this tape. It is the perfect length (@ 40 min.) and it covers all areas you need to work on. I like the soft spoken instructor and three levels of intensity. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Endurance and a great workout","review":"This is a great video. You do feel as if you actually did something. I am 32 weeks along in my pregnancy and I follow the beginning level. I consider myself a fit person. I try to workout four days a week to keep up with my exercise level. The moves are broken down from beginning to advance. The music has an excellent rhythm to use for each move. For a great transition make sure you have the following before starting this workout: a set of pillows or blankets set on top of each other, blankets, a dumbell (or anything for tricep extensions) and a chair. For advance levels, you need a step up. The transitions from moves to moves needs a little work.One thing I do follow like the other reviewers have commented are: if you feel dizzy or tired, stop exersicing. Follow what your body is telling you. Modify your moves to your comfort level. Otherwise, great video. I also do Niece Pecenka \\"Pilates During Pregnancy\\" for my alternate days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1","review":"Really great video. You can start and stop and follow along depending on your current fitness level, and the instructor makes it so easy for you. She always shows the beginner, intermediate, and advanced level workout on the screen, so you always have one to follow along to. The instructional portion of the video is definitely a bonus, where she goes over a slew of information and should answer most questions you have. I think this will be a good video to use after baby gets here, just to try to keep in better shape until you're able to get out and be a lot more active too. Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it!","review":"I've found it so hard to find a good prenatal workout, so when I read the reviews of this workout I desperately wanted to like it. I've worked out a lot prior to being pregnant so I am not new to exercise. I found this workout to be very odd. Many of the moves felt awkward and I didn't feel like I was working anything during large portions of the workout. I was very disappointed and probably won't ever do this workout again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I couldn't make it through this workout because I was so bored. It just wasn't what I expected. The music was awful, the narrating voice was annoying and it wasn't challenging. Maybe this is good for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applause!!! Applause!!! Didn't think I would ever find a perfect workout !","review":"What a great workout, from start to finish. I am a beginner and so did the beginner level of each move and excercise. I am only in my 9th week now, but , I can see how even in the very pregnant months, that this will be something I can do.I have to say, I am just worn enough to know I got a great workout but not in any pain. I'm so excited to find a workout that is pregnancy safe and still delivers that same punch I miss from my former gym going days. I did have to remind myself to keep breathing, but other than that, this was a very manageable workout. That last arm move is a doozie...save some energy for it! I cannot reccommend this workout enough! Buy it, you'll see.I actually feel better about myself and that is hard to come by in between the morning sickness, sore chest, and fatigue of the first trimester."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This exercise DVD is very boring! I can't imagine sticking to this for the duration of my pregnancy. I did this once and find it hard to motivate to do it again.

I was starting to get uncomfortable and the stretching and strength exercises made me feel like I have more room for my baby.I was really tired and a little shaky when I finished the first time, but then within a couple of hours I got a huge energy surge.The other reviews complained of the scenery and not enough explanation - that's the beauty of working out at home you can pause and rewind! I spend most of my time looking away from the TV because she tells you the next move before you have finished the current one so you can be ready for the change.My posture and breathing improves dramatically for hours after doing this video. My only suggestion is to not do the workout too late in the day, because the energy surge makes it hard to go to sleep. :)I have recommended this to many women. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I could never get into this but I am also someone that much more prefers being outside- walking, jogging, etc. I had another friend refer it to me so I know she liked it but I literally used it a couple times when I was pregnant and otherwise, it collected dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't have the space","review":"I researched a lot before buying this DVD as well as a prenatal yoga DVD (which I loved!). But I tried to do the work out in this one once and gave up. I do not have a lot of space in front of the TV in my house and the work out in this DVD requires you to use certain household items (like a chair) to aid in the workout. It might actually be very good but it didn't work out for me. I stuck to doing the prenatal yoga and walking for my pregnancy fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok dvd, difficult exercises, fast moves","review":"This is an okay dvd, not that great as reviews say.I exercised 3-4 times a week before pregnancy and am in pretty good shape, however I find these exercises are very fast , and some of the moves are very difficult.I like Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea much better- calm and a good yoga workout"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so perfect","review":"I consider myself to have a reasonable level of fitness and flexibility. I purchased this DVD based on the positive reviews posted on Amazon but I was disappointed and concerned when I tried the workout myself.Some of the exercises seemed unsafe especially the abdominal crunches, lunges, squats & push-ups (even the modified versions) when you consider the hypermobility of joints and centre of gravity changes in pregnancy.The instructor doesn't appear to grasp the concept that not every woman was a superfit trapeze artist prior to pregnancy. From what I can tell she does not have any formal qualifications in prenatal fitness, but rather developed this exercise program based on her own needs and level of fitness. On the positive the warm-up it very good.Erin O'Brien's Pregnancy Fitness Fix (for more experienced exercisers) or Leisa Hart's FitMama (more moderate intensity) appeared to be safer but still higly effective options."},{"rating":"1","title":"bblltwnty1","review":"I dont like how they show, intermedidate and advanced in little windows on the side of the screen.

It pulse/skip a lot, especially towards the end of the workout (starting right before the cool down), it kept pulse every 1/10 of second, and skipping quite a lot during cool down. Well, cannot really do the entire cool down due to the skipping. What a shame for bad DVD quality, even the workout itself is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem","review":"The Stradivarius Joshua Bell plays is made to sing sublimely in his hands.

Bell plays the Tchaikovsky *much* better at 36 than he did at 19."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very swinging!","review":"As an aspiring jazz guitarist I picked this up on a whim a while ago, coincidentally around the time Ray Brown died. I knew little about him or the trio, but had heard some of both John Pizzarelli and Russell Malone so expected good things. I was just delighted by this record from the get-go. Pizzarelli's version of 'Squeeze Me' opens with a strangely classical-sounding piano intro (think George Shearing) but immediately opens into a happy & strongly swinging tune with a great groove that sets the tone for the whole record. There's not a bad tune on the record, and it's great to hear such a great variety of guitar styles. Blues for Wes is just awesome -- impossible not to think of Wes Montgomery when hearing this. And the closing ballad 'Soulful Spirit' is just so sweet and touching. A great record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not well organized","review":"This book is more about measure theory and pure statistical properties. For me (as a practicer), I found it's difficult toextract important information for the book.My biggest complain is in first few chapters, the authers simplylist all definition, properties and proofs without a single exampleto help readers understand. And the notations are quite complicated which gives readers no clue if one reads directly from the later chapters (more algorithms involved).Through out the entire book, I can't find any complete and concreteapplications. The bottomline is this book is neither practicalnor can serve a textbook to understand fundamental statistical theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!!!","review":"I love Orson Scott Card's books.

It is a little different, but it is painfully slow and seems to be made up of smaller segments, each of which don't really make any contribution to the overall plot. The characters are quite thin and the course of the book is relatively predictable.

Orson Scott Card weaves a great tale full of mystery and magic placed in the era of America's western expansion.In this tale several of the most important characters of the saga are introduced and developed. They are likeable and believable as is the alternate history that Card develops throughout the tale. Many of the characters are based on actual historical figures but their role in the tale is purely fictional.A fantastic read and a wonderful story. Seventh Son and the whole Alvin Maker Saga are a must read for Card fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Opening to a Unique and Exciting Fantasy Series","review":"In Seventh Son, O.S. Card deftly pulls a 3-for-1: It's entertaining fantasy, well worth reading on its own merit; it establishes and develops the basic premises that define the series' interesting and unique alternate universe and sets the table for its climactic sequel, Red Prophet.Readers could probably jump right in to the series at \\"Red Prophet\\" without feeling like they're missing something. That being said, they would be missing out; While the most important events in Seventh Son are rehashed later on in the series, You won't get nearly the same flavor and richness without reading Seventh Son.My advice to readers comes down to this:If you want to read the series, start from the beginning, and you won't regret it. If you start with Red Prophet, you'll more than likely want to continue with the series, and the you'llwish you'd read Seventh Son First."},{"rating":"2","title":"A phenomenal read!","review":"Orson Scott Card has always been one of my favorite authors and this series is no exception. Seventh Son is the first of the Alvin Maker series, a tale set in a colonial America where magic is real and history went somewhat differently. Alvin is the seventh son of a seventh son which means he was born to be something special and powerful. The book is hard to put down and captivates you from beginning to end.My only big complaint about the Alvin Maker series came about this past rereading of it. My copies of the Alvin Maker series are all suffering from being read so many times. This last reread made realize how often religion plays a part. Perhaps in the past I somehow overlooked it, though I'm not sure how. Every few pages is mentioning, questioning or referencing some form of spiritual entity. I'm not uncomfortable reading about religion, but when I look forward to reading a fun alternate-history fiction saga, I'd prefer it with slightly less preaching in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Available on Kindle even though the other 5 are??!!??","review":"I think this is an excellent book, as well as the series being great; however, after purchasing my new AmazonKindle, I discovered that I could download the Alvin Maker series Volumes II through VI, but not Volume I - Seventh Son. How does that make any sense at all? I am extremely frustrated about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Boring mormon wish-fulfillment fantasy. In this arena, David Gemmell he is not. If that is what you are after, then by all means get it, otherwise something like The Jerusalem Man will be much more appealing. You could, however, use them as a cure for insomnia, or severe lack of homey American pastoral romanticising. You will know pretty quickly whether this holds any interest at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly slow","review":"I could not believe the amount of words in this text. I love long books, when they have a lot to say. One could probably tell this story in about 50 pages. It is unnecessarily descriptive, and all the description adds nothing to the experience of the reading of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh? Where did Old Card go?","review":"I love Card's old work, and Ender's Game has a permanent spot on my top 10 list. But what has happened? The man is slipping, as he cannot keep a coherent story going. Xenocide and Children of the mind come to mind. I got this hoping I could forget those travesties of writing, and yet, Seventh Son falls into the same pit. Card doesn't really bring up one reason why I should care AT ALL for any of the characters. So the priest is being fooled, its not like he did a good job of covering that up, he gives it away time and again! Not suspenseful in the least... Heck, I could already tell you the plot to the rest of the books after having read this one. Now that I think about it, if you read Ender's Game, you could probably figure out the plot from this one. Does \\"Extremely Gifted Child\\" sound familiar to you? Skip this and go try out some new author, SciFi needs some new voices, not Card (who spends his time screaming for attention... just look at his web site)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks but no thanks......","review":"I did enjoy Treason, it was a very good book. And Ender's Game was awesome. Usually, the stories from this author are excellent.However, I am very disturbed by the massive anti-christian theme of this book. Since the 1st Christian character appear to the last page, the ridicule and mockery they are subject is non stop. They are all ignorant fools that can be tricked with ease. And of course, Christian faith is false and even a child will know so and laugh about it. Was all this really necessary to make a good story?One wonders if the author will be so, uhmm, \\"brave\\" against more, uhhmmmm, \\"militant\\" religions.I have not read the rest of the books of the Tales of Alvin Maker. Maybe he has moderated his anti-christian message. Maybe not. I just will not pay for this kind of propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe someone published this.","review":"6 volume series? he man could have easily compressed this into 400 pages, but he's so long winded with everything. And reading this feels like i'm standing at the front door with Jehova's Witnesses. Ender's game was great. It deserves 5 stars. But i'm almost convinced it was written by someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Card","review":"Orson Scott Card continues to amaze me with his writing. I began reading this book during exam week and couldn't put it down. Card constructs each character in such a way that I find myself concerned with everything that happens to them, making the book more of a rollercoaster ride that slams me back in my seat and won't let me up till the it's over. I loved this book.Like all of Card's writings, this book deals with religious issues. The current trend in literature seems to lean towards ignoring the religious lives of characters all together. Card uses each character's religion to develop the characters into who they are. As a Christian, this book brought up some issues that allow for some great discussion. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy and American History","review":"This is the only fantasy book I've every read that takes place in America, on the frontier. It is VERY well written, and I have read everything I could get my hands on by Card since.

To say it was a letdown would be to put it mildly. Although Nachman lists the dozens of interviews he himself conducted for the book, the text is overwhelmed with quotes from old bios, fan magazines, newspaper reviews, etc. And Nachman has an annoying habit of skipping around in such a haphazard, non-chronological manner, that the reader is easily confused. He's also sloppy when attempting to place certain events in historical context -- for instance, he lists \\"All in the Family,\\" The Jeffersons,\\" \\"Sanford and Son\\" and \\"Different Strokes\\" as \\"late-60's\\" TV series,when in fact they were early-to-mid 70's. There are several more such sloppy mistakes. His earlier work, \\"Raised on Radio,\\" is far superior -- and it's obvious he enjoyed writing it a whole lot more than he did \\"Seriously Funny.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling and well-structured work","review":"I began flipping through this excellent book in a moment of boredom and just kept reading. Though I'm a fan of a few of the comedians covered in the book, many of them are of no particular interest to me -- moreover, I don't even care for most stand-up comedy (preferring sketch comedy), and the majority of the stories told here are stories of great stand-up comics. But the author is so good at describing the talents, contexts, and events that made these individuals important comic entertainers, that the book really grabbed and held my interest. I recommend it for anyone interested in glimpses into some brilliant comic minds from the heyday of sophisticated comedy, and in concise yet adequately detailed accounts of why and how these people evolved from unknowns to household words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxxum 5, easy to use, excellent pictures, very forgiving","review":"If you appreciate quality pictures and want to go beyond point and shoot this is the camera.

In a week I was doing double exposures, night time photography and close portraits each step I took more control of the camera as I learned the functions, what I did not know the camera compensated for me. I love this camera. One complaint that is not serious. I do not like the smaller size and do not like the small single focus buttons.

Since then there were times when I said Tigermilk or The Boy With the Arab Strap were favorites but I always come back to this one. It has a wider vareity of sound than other albums and besides \\"Beyond the Sunrise\\" which would've been better on a single, but isn't bad here, the album flows like water. If I could only have one of their albums it would be this one, perhaps for the flashes of 1983 that go through my mind when I hear it. The highlights are \\"I Fought in a War\\" which as someone already pointed out sounds almost exactly like Duran Duran's \\"Ordinary World\\", \\"Don't Leave the Light On Baby\\", \\"Nice Day for a Sulk\\" and \\"Family Tree\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"New ideas, new sounds, same great band","review":"\\"Fold you hands\\" shouldn't dissapoint fans of \\"boy with the arab strap\\". It's a further extension of the ideas on that album, and for the most part, quite a bit better. Each song has a very distinct sound. Unlike earlier B+S albums, \\"hands\\" eschews the sort of trancey song-blurring-into-song ephemeral folky groove for a much beefier almost chamber-pop style... now, don't get me wrong, it's not as if it sounds like Apples In Stereo or the Flaming Lips.. but there certainly is a little more meat on the minor-key bones of these tunes. Everything just seems a little less fragile, a little more fleshed out. The melodies are lovely as ever, and the lyrics sound much less precious bolstered by a more expansive pallet of sound. For fans of the minimal (and brilliant) folk-pop of \\"Tigermilk\\" and \\"Sinsiter\\", this record may require some adjustment, but It's a quality album throughout"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Grand and Dandy\\"","review":"1--I fought in a war: A beautiful, heartbreaking song about wartime.2--The Model: Possibly the song on the album. Good keyboards, strings, vocals, trumpet, etc.3--Beyond the sunrise: A quaint yet eerie little tune. Great vocals.4--Waitng for the moon to rise: I like the cello solo near the end a lot. Not a super great song but enjoyable.5--Don't Leave the Light on Baby: A really great ode to the late '60s, early '70s soul singers like Marvin Gaye.6--The Wrong Girl: Simple lyrics and an accessible melody.7--The Chalet Lines: A haunting song of abuse. Beautiful piano, vocals, cello arrangement.8--Nice Day for a Sulk: Light, peppy song. Sounds like a mid'60s Burt Bacharach tune.9--Womans Realm: For some reason reminds me of the Van Morrison song \\"Glad tidings\\" from the MOONDANCE album.10--Family Tree: I always love it when Isobel sings. Lovely song.11--Too Much Love: Really good, uplifting melody. I like the string orchestra fadeout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely...","review":"Belle and Sebastian is one of the very few bands in existence today that is actually good. I don't really think this is one of their best albums, but I'm not about to complain, because it's still wonderful, and if you're tired of all the mediocre crap on the radio that all sounds the same, give this album a try. My favorite tracks are I Fought in a War, The Model, Woman's Realm, Family Tree, and There's Too Much Love. Don't Leave the Light On Baby and The Wrong Girl leave something to be desired, however. All in all, this is definitely worth buying (but The Boy With the Arab Strap is even more worth buying)."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&S Fill The Void","review":"I recentlty discovered B&S after the release of \\"Fold Your Hands Child....\\" Loving this record is an understatement. If this one doesn't quite live up to the previous recordings, I'm on a fast-track to Tower tomorrow to buy the rest. (Sorry Amazon, simply can't wait that long.) Finally there is a band to fill the void left behind when such favorites as Galaxie 500 and The Smiths departed. Does it lag at times? Sure. But as soon as I heard \\"I Fought in a War,\\" I was sold."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous album","review":"i love belle and sebastian. this album is so beautiful, yet it is unlike all of their others. there are a lot more strings, yet most of the songs are very spare. stuart murdoch's voice maintains it's fragility (especially on, \\"The Chalet Lines,\\" \\"I Fought in a War,\\" and, \\"There's Too Much Love\\"), and even sounds sexy at times (like the lusty, \\"Don't Leave the Light on Baby,\\"). Belle and Sebastian are no doubt a very important band right now, especially in a time when mainstream music is not at it's best, and, \\"Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant,\\" is an essential album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I just want to say that I like Belle and Sebastian okay, but I think this is the most pretentious title of any work by anybody in any genre I have ever heard.

Just discovered If You're Feeling Sinister, which I think is really good. But this album is better. Someone already wrote that B&S have a sound that is immediately recognizable, as if you'd heard the songs before. I totally agree, and especially with this album. But it's not that the songs are cliches. They're, as always, really unique and extremely catchy. I think I love ALL of the songs on this album. And loved them all (except track 7) immediately! It would be hard to spotlight one or two as the best because they really all are so good. One of the things that I love the most about this album is the multitude of lead voices, and the home-quality of those voices... flawed, unmanicured voices singing with real heart.

Sure, the other songs have cute hooks and sweet instrumentation, but ultimately disappoint. The tracks I can really get into are 'Wrong Girl', 'Women's Realm' (named after a British weekly mag aimed at middle-aged, middle-class ladies of this sceptred isle), and 'There's Too Much Love'. These songs are up there with the best that B & S have ever done. Finally, why 'Legal Man' is not on the album is confusing. This recent single is on a par with the best album cuts and would have added a change of pace and extra colour to a fairly insipid affair.

This band grows with every release, although I'm sure not in the direction that many would enjoy most (this could be due to the recent re-release of 1996's \\"Tigermilk\\" and 1997's three EPs. Anyway, the record. Rigid Belle and Sebastian fans will wrestle a bit with it, but surrender inevitably to its profoundly understated charm. Non-fans, if not yet ready, will actively despise it.

If your looking for a hilarious TV series to watch while your waiting for a new season of something else this is great to fill the void. If you have Showtime (which I don't) you can watch this on TV but as I don't I started watching this through Netfilx and couldn't get enough. Funny as hell. At some point you want to question the moral fiber of Nancy Botwin but she's just doing what she has to for her kids and to survive. The character that Jenji created is strong and resilient kinda like a warrior. She deals with everything and makes choices to fix the here and now rather than dwell on the future. Wouldn't recommend this for your kids right off the bat until you watch the first few episodes of the first season. Has some nudity duh it's on showtime. But overall funny as hell and soooo worth your time to watch :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Show","review":"What's not to like.....the excessivley hot Mary Louise Parker, funny man Kevin Nealon, and the self righteous Elizabeth Perkins, along with an award winning support cast!

This silly show isn't as bad as many others, and a few really bad shows out there but I don't see why even a small audience would buy into something like this BS. I mean when you think about it a lot of fine things like classical music, cultural studies, unique wines and art really aren't always appreciated by the masses and within all those things I mentioned there are even sub groups that like certain elements about them as well. Just an observation. This show might deserve 1.5 stars for the cool cover and I'll admit there are far worse programs on the old cancer box (TV) than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A show about weed that's not funny, how?","review":"It's interesting that a show about weed is not funny. I'm not sure how they managed to do that but they achieved it. Half of each show is not even about weed, drug dealing or drug dealers. Half is about the next door neighbors cancer chick and her fat daughter. I despise Mary Parker. Her face looks like Michael jacksons and she is always wide eyed bug eyed staring around when she talks. Retarded. The guys that are on the show are effimanates and the women are supposed to be all empowered. Stupid show about weed that is not funny.

I was very delighted after watching Season one and couldn't wait to get into Season two. The characters are solid and couldn't have been cast any better.

This album is an incredibly satisfying experience. The songs are all well-written and arranged perfectly. Albert King may not have been the most versatile guitarist, but his playing always sounds good and he knew what to play and when to play it. Crosscut Saw and Personal Manager have two of the greatest guitar solos I've ever heard (I also like Albert's habit of saying things like \\"Watch this\\", \\"heads up\\", and \\"Woo!\\" during his solos). The Hunter is catchy like the flu. I Almost Lost My Mind is one of the prettiest blues songs you'll ever hear. If you like blues you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big sound, great tone, classic songs -- a \\"must buy\\"","review":"This is a super album, which sounds wonderful through headphones. It contains all first rate songs -- most are now blues standards ... and this is the definitive/original version of most of them. This is a \\"must buy\\" for any blues fan. Guitarists will recognise many of the songs and licks, which have been used by almost all modern blues players, including Gary Moore, SRV, Free and Eric Clapton among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"good blues/funk from Albert King and Booker T. and the Mg's","review":"This a good blues/funk album from guitar legend Albert King and the Stax backing band (also a seperate band too) Booker T. and the MG's. This album was monumental when it was released but is not as monumental today. This is still a good album that is a nescessary landmark in somebody's blues collection. The fact that the songs are too short and many of them fade out at the end (which pisses me off beyond reason) is a negative factor. The best songs on the album are \\"Crosscut Saw\\",\\"Personal Manager\\", \\"Laundromat Blues\\" and \\"Born Under a Bad Sign.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Souful","review":"This is really a fantastic blues album. Not even close to the most technical thing out there, but Albert King just pours out emotion into his guitar. It's a very soulful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"\\"King Of The Blues Guitar\\" is much better. However if I were starting my Albert King Collection I would first buy Rhino's \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" and then of equal importance I would buy Modern Blues' \\"Let's Have A Natural Ball\\" lastly I would buy MCA's \\"Door To Door\\". While there are certainly more Albert King CDs to be had, these three issues are MANDATORY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemed very biased at the time","review":"At the time this book was written is seemed very biased but now, years after the trial and after the Satanic Ritual Abuse scandals, it is closer to the truth than most imagined.The authors of The Abuse of Innocence is written by two authors who have a predisposition against child sexual abuse allegations. However, they clearly state this opinion and I simply skipped those sections. Normally, I would not rate a book highly when the authors show such bias, but history has showed that when it came to the McMartin case, they were in fact correct.This book illustrates the faults of the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, problems with the testimony of the witnesses, and most important, the inaccuracies of confessions obtained on procedures similar to the Miami Method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Read Pays Off for McMartin Buffs","review":"This book consists mostly of extremely lengthy excerpts from trial testimony as recorded by the husband and wife authors, who attended the McMartin trials.The book does not follow the standard true crime formula and takes some diligence to read. There are hardly any breaks in the text or chapters in the trafitional sense, so stopping in a convenient place can be difficult.The authors do a good job in showing how the overzealousness of the L.A. County D.A's office lead to the abuses suffered by the defendant's in the McMartin case.However, at times the authors go off on what seem like paranoid tangents as they rail against what they perceive as the ritual child abuse industry.If you saw the HBO movie about this case, the book is an interesting companion and goes into more detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"McMartin","review":"Did any of the reviewers attend the McMartin Preschool? Are any of you related to someone that attended the school? All of the reviewers and the author must be related to Peggy or Buckey.I guess none of the reviewers saw the aftermath of what that sick and demented school did to the children that attended.If the school was still standing, would you send your child there?I am disgusted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lamp was broken really good.","review":"so i called the company and they sent out a replacement. it took 6 weeks for the next lamp to be sent.

The new James Bond remix is pretty sweet, but much more mellow than the original mix. The track Featuring Debbie Harry \\"New York\\" is by far my favorite track, being a great high energy uncampy Euro-pop track that is great when played really loud. For Dj's out there, these are a great collection of mixable tracks. For the home entertainers, this entire CD could easily carry a portion of your evening with danceable beats and fresh sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary Null's NEW and Horrible Green Stuff","review":"Up until recently, I was enjoying Gary Null's Green Stuff for over 17 years. Drank it with water, and it was a GREAT product. A few months ago, I ordered some more, and the first thing, I noticed was the container was only 60% full, but when I drank it, I spit it out, thinking I had gotten a bad spoiled batch.So I opened another one, and....same awful taste.My questions to web site went unanswered, and when I spoke to someone at one of his health vitamin closets, they mentioned that it was a new manufacturer and new taste.I gave him my review, and said, after 17 years, I will never buy this product again...what a shame.I have since bought GREENS PLUS, and use it in water, with a little Blueberry Pomegranate, and it's very good tasting.I don't understand how Gary could change the product so drastically.....for the worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"An acquired taste...","review":"A good buy, but it takes getting used to. Tried it once, but will not order it again...not for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They changed the formula and it now tastes DISGUSTING","review":"My nutritionist had recommended this product partially because it was actually a pretty good tasting green supplement, and he had tried a whole bunch of them. Unfortunately for some reason, Gary Null decided to change a good formula and the \\"new and improved\\" version tastes ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. Luckily for me I managed to find the old formula at Vitamin Shoppe, but I don't know what I'm going to do after the old formulas leave the shelf. sigh! Why tinker with a good thing? My nutritionist is quite upset about this as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I can't believe how awful this tastes. I am a vegetable lover and figured it would taste like vegetables but it doesn't it tastes like grass with dirt. I have tried it in juice but even the smallest dose mixed with juice makes it undrinkable. Now it sits on my shelf reminding me that I need to try things before shelling out big bucks on a huge container. Maybe I will toss it and quit torturing myself, because I can't imagine trying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Album, Crappy Vinyl","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Unfortunately, Sides B and D are completely unlistenable due to all the skips and pops. Amazon should not be selling this faulty product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pressing Error","review":"I wanted to confirm again what other reviewers have said. This vinyl skips on Winter's Love, ruining my favorite song on the album, and as well has some skipping and popping in other places. I was really looking forward to the new pressing because the out of print copies were so expensive. I was so bothered by these problems that I actually sold my copy. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Batch","review":"As reported above this record is part of a defective line. I have a copy from the same pressing, and have experienced many skips and pop due to poor production surrounding the pressing. This is my favorite AC record, and I could not be more disappointed with the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutally Insincere","review":"This release is the most palatable to come out of the Animal Collective and does have some genuinely catchy, even, dare I say, \\"affecting\\" moments, but, everything I've been exposed to from these guys just screams insincerity. All the stuff they do live and on pretty much every other release is redolent of an anally-fixated infantile routine performed by priveleged hipsters revelling in the shock value of their \\"act\\". This particular release is all the more frustrating in that it suggests that they could produce some genuinely good \\"music\\" if they applied their efforts in that direction. Sadly, with these guys, the schtick is 1000x more important than the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Music at All","review":"Perhaps this collection of sounds might be an interesting experiment in what you can get the public to buy, but it certainly isn't music. Some might call this progressive or some other term to denote a lack of musical ability, which presumes that only those of great artistic sensibility can really appreciate the work; I call it worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definantly not for everyone","review":"The Animal Collective may well be one of the weirdest bands around. This is not music that's going to be enjoyed/appreciated by everyone. But after a few listens, it becomes clear that this group has a musical style all their own. \\"Sung Tongs\\" is unlike ANYTHING you've ever heard before, and is incredibily creative and playful. \\"Who Could Win A Rabbit\\" is one of the most fun and interesting songs of 2004, but all the songs are almost that good. If you give it a chance and listen with an open mind, I'm sure you'll find that this is one of the better, most original albums released this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best!","review":"i geek out whenever this band comes up in a conversation. it's true- there isn't anything to compare them with. you can hear influences of can and bugskull, but animal collective's sound is entirely their own. if you ever get a chance to see them perform, by all means take it! i took a friend for her birthday, and we had to run out as soon as they finished performing. we didn't want to see the next band, or any other band for a long time after a performance like that. we kept asking ourselves, 'how did they meet each other, and how did they know they could do that?'definitley get a copy of this album- the others aren't as 'listenable' and might disappoint the listener who isn't already a big fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good interesting album","review":"Don't let the overwhelming cuteness of the liner notes deter you from at least listening to some music from this band. The music is not 'cute' in a way that would reflect the fuzzy-animal pseudonyms of the two bandmates or their insistence on saying 'tongs' instead of 'songs' in the notes; the music, like the cover image of skeletons half-hidden by bright masks, sounds very primitive in its use of percussion at times and at other times is colorfully multi-layered with often-incomprehensible lyrics. Buyers should know that its a very experimental album. Its sounds similar to the Microphones and possibly even the more eclectic Sonic Youth. It places inventiveness ahead of user-friendliness and may take a few listens to adapt, but overall, its a pleasant and fun album."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant BRILLIANT B R I L L I A N T !","review":"Wow!Well, no, this will NOT be everyone's cup of tea. However, if you like Aphex Twin's musical reductionism, Squarepusher's disjointedness, Radiohead's stream-of-conciousness poetry, and Matmos's then-remembered melodic fragmentation, you will ADORE this album. Sets up a sort of harmonic mantra.It is often disjointed and makes me think of poorly remembered memories of songs I thought I knew. It's sometimes mayhem, yet quite tranquil at the same time.A little bit like Mum... on cocaine... with a guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"If everyone listened to the first few tracks and then ran to the computer to write a review, you'd get a long list of 5 star reviews. The beginning is obnoxious, strong, genius, and completely unique.

Dwight offers ways of looking at things that impact just about every area of your life. (Some examples: \\"How frightened are you of their fear?,\\" \\"Enough time is not the problem.\\")I read the essays at a very slow rate - only a few a day -- really digesting each one and trying to apply what appealed to me, and I strongly recommend that approach. Whether you want to take the brakes off and do things you've been putting off, or want to be better able to find creative solutions and communicate effectively, or just want to be more satisfied with the life you have - this book is a great resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage - The Key to a Thousand Doors in Life","review":"Who knew that Courage could be the KEY to unlocking a thousand doors in life? This truly unique and refreshing book goes way beyond traditional definitions of courage to empower you, the reader, to take actions in areas where you experience being stopped by fear, hesitation or anxiety. For me, this book has become a fabulous life-long resource, a treasure of ideas, writings and essays on the topic of Courage. The freshness of perspective is priceless. Be sure to check out the chapter on recommended ways on 'How to use the book' -- whether it be (1) reading from front to back, (2) on as-needed or as interested basis, or (3) randomly.I highly recommend this book for anyone with a keen interest in their ongoing growth and development!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Part, Right Price","review":"Genuine AC Delco parts, took care of my vent valve codes on my Tahoe.

I was very excited to purchase Homer's Trivia Game, and I was relatively certain that my plethora of Simpsons knowledge would be more than enough to conquer any question. I was wrong. This game is DIFFICULT! There are five levels of questions and I would classify levels 4 and 5 as \\"super hard\\".

Apparently his neighbor rented or bought it, and was lending it to him. Moments later, I was laughing so hard I was in tears, as this is \\"horror\\" movie, is so f--king bad its good. The plot is simple, 3 college kids, their teacher and his \\"friend\\" go exploring in some forest in Turkey. Unfortunatley for them the forest is A) Camp ground for a bunch of terrorists B) US Special forces, led by some rapper, are raiding the area and C) Prehistoric dinosaurs are flying around murdering anyone they see. Thus most of the cast is murdered in comically stupid ways, by poorly animated dinosaurs. I don't want to give any spoilers but lets just say you will be rewinding several times saying \\"OMG that did NOT just happen hahahahahahaha\\".I had to give this movie 1 star because its labeled a horror movie and it is 100% not scary.

There was a recall 4 to 5 months ago and I returned my unit. It was never returned to me. I have spent hours on the phone, been promised it would be shipped, been promised an upgrade, hung up on, and generally lied to for the last two months. I can get no satisfaction. They will not return my calls. It looks like I am out a radio. I plan to write letters to all the major newspapers in Florida where I live and let them know about my experience. In a state such as Florida, where storms are more or less common a person should never buy a weather radio from this company and expect service."},{"rating":"2","title":"could save your life","review":"the radio seems durable and fairly easy to program. It is great that it can be used as a fixed unit or as a portable one so you can take it with you if you need to take shelter. Last week I recieved Severe thunderstorm watches and warnings so it does work as advertised. My one complaint is that you cannot disable the siren for alerts that you are not interested in, being woken up at 3am for a dense fog advisory doesn't seem pleasant. Bottom line is that this radio does its job and I would encourage anyone to buy it as long as you don't mind get alerts for all watches, warnings and advisories."},{"rating":"1","title":"No On/Off switch a turn off","review":"Unfortunatly the fact that this weather radio doesn't have an on/off switch but a snooze button instead is a big turn off for me. I have seen many weather radios being a storm chaser and never seen one that didn't have an On/Off switch. It's battery powered so why wouldn't you put an on/off switch on it! If your looking for a radio for home use this maybe the one for you if you can afford the batteries. But if your looking to take it with you everywhere this is not the model for you. After emailing the company about this their claim was it was an alert radio so thats why it has no on/off switch! But to be painfully honest if it's an alert radio what's with the snooze button. After buying one of oregon sceintifics handhelds and taking for granted it would have a on/off switch I won't buy another one ever until they provide it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weather Radio","review":"Seems to work just fine.

My Champion 720A motor grader had several hydraulic cylinders that had small leaks and one that was bleeding 10+ gallons per day so basically a gallon per hour. With the size of the system I needed to add 3 gallons of the Lucas Hydraulic Oil Booster. The first day out after adding this product my fluid leaks were cut in half. That would have been good enough for me but the second day out I ended up losing only a half a gallon in a 10 hour work day. So, from seeing $120 per day run on the ground to $6 made me a believer.

I would say around 10 pages of the ENTIRE 375 page book is dedicated for this subject.Cutting edge methdology for repairing DNS and WINS are not mentioned at all. The book should have contained case studies and scenarios on how DNS and WINS can be best fixed. Instead, the author talks about what DNS and WINS is and how it functions.If you want to know what DNS and WINS are, then this is not a bad book to get.

This game doesn't really have many maps or modes of play. It tries to add some elements from Battlefield 2142 but kinda fails, you don't even keep you extra skill from one battle to the next, so you start from scratch each time. The strog have vehicles that make the human ones look like jokes in how fast they fire and how much damage they do. The graphics are really nice though and it doesn't seem to tax my graphics card as much as some other games do.

Splash Damage has taken Wofenstein-ET with the Doom 3 engine and the Quake plot line, pumped the grpx engine full of visual steroids but sent the writers and creative consultants home way too early. The game has really nice eye candy, and runs well on my notebook (nice surprise) but I was honestly expecting more plot and more 'Meat' to this newest addition to the Quake family.Maybe it was just me but, from what I was reading, prior to release I got the impression that this game was going to give us a lot of 'back-story' and the reason we 'Went to War' (hehehe) in Quake 3. Unfortunately, this game (like the reasons WE were given for going to war) fall far short of the commitment that WE gamers usually make in a title. Bottom line; this game can be a nice reminder of Wolfenstein-ET, but will not stay long in you game rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total garbage...the death of Quake.","review":"This is the final nail in ID's coffin.

If you want to make these games make them but don't ruin them but slapping a Quake/Doom logo on them to sell them, that only makes fans think you sold out and are now making horrid games.....which you are.

But there r good points too, i like the fact the both side have different vehicles and weapons and that the game i running very good on my not so new pc (Pentium 3,0 GHz / Nvidea 6700XL).My conclusion, this game is only for Quake fans and Clan Players and not for mr. averrage and instance gamers. So its not a real contender for Battlefield 2142, the current leader of egoshooters."},{"rating":"1","title":"So lame I'm selling it...","review":"I received this game as a gift and it simply wasn't very much fun.

I had worked out with her Perfect Pregnancy Workout up until a couple of weeks before the birth of my son.I personally found the exercises not challenging enough and awkward...maybe I was looking for doing too much too soon?! Just was not as impressed with this video. I found myself going through the entire video to feel like I had exercised. I did the workout half a dozen times and then went to the library and got a Denise Austin video. Sorry...it just wasn't as good as the pregnancy video.Her Prefect Pregnancy Workout is definately worth it, not this one though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the first couple of months...","review":"My baby is 7 weeks old and already I feel the need to get something more intense. This workout was awesome and I started 3 weeks after birth. It has gotten me much stronger and I think that's why I'm ready to move on. Most moves have the mom using the baby as resistance, and while this might be great for a baby about 2 or 3 months old, my newborn didn't really care for it at all. Even now at 7 weeks, she struggles to get through the whole thing and is usually crying. To remedy this, I simply use hand weights instead and let the baby nap while I'm working out. I highly recommend the Perfect Pregnancy Workout as it kept me so fit right up to birth - and I believe my labor was shorter because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun activity","review":"This dvd is not the best workout ever...

She accepts the one true God and God intercedes for her in miraculous ways.The events in the story are true and it is a privelege and a blessing to share this story to children who may live with unsaved parents. Ti-Fam fears and loves her father. She overcomes her fear and shares the Gospel with her father.The illustrations in this story are two color (blue and black) but very compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest View of Creativity & Faith in Art","review":"Objects of Grace reminds us all that art is an important part of the fabric of faith. The breadth of mediums and locales represented by the ten artists interviewed serves as an insightful glimpse at the range of concerns, processes, and mindsets of artists who are engaging not just the church, but the culture at large.James Romaine spent a good deal of time becoming familiar with each artist's work prior to the interview, particularly evident in questions addressing the artist's influences, pursuits, reviews, and published writings. When paired with full-color reproductions, the artists' articulated answers created an approachable text, making Objects of Grace a rare entry point for the person unacquainted with art world rhetoric. The interviews also uncovered a wealth of reading sources relating to the intersection of creativity and faith.Objects of Grace belongs in the library of artists and non-artists alike, regardless of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Race Car Areo","review":"A good resource for the basics on the subject matter.

It starts from the Bernoulli law, passing through the definition of drag, lift, coefficient of pressure,...(always recalling to the objective of the book: understanding cars aerodynamics), ending with lot of examples on real-world race cars. There's no need to start reading this book with an advanced knowledge in engineering, because in here you can find all the recalls or new knowledge that you need in the subsequent chapters: so I recommend it for all kind of knowledge that you have. Lot of graphs, formulas, and very well described examples. So: not only theory but lot of practical examples and observations.

Wiping down with alcohol wipes or other cleaners didn't change this. I know how to use canned air products correctly (not upside down etc.) but even using this correctly creates a taste issue I can't shake! Don't buy this, don't use this, don't even touch the can to throw it away! (use gloves or at least a paper towel) And the dairy/chocolate idea from 3M's website doesn't work to remove the taste.

This product was handy and a great idea, until 3M caved to the pressure to keep morons from damaging themselves. The trick to using this canned air without ruining your keyboard is to keep the can upright at all times while using. That'll keep the bittering agent in the can. If any moisture comes through the nozzle, you've effectively covered the item you're spraying, and in my case the keyboard, so you're stuck with the bitter taste for... well, ever. Now: Try to clean a keyboard with a vertical can -- tough, huh? 3M says you can remove this with a 50/50 mix of alcohol and water, and remove the taste with dairy products. I'm going to drink my milk, wash my keyboard with alcohol and water, and toss the 6-pack of compressed air into the trash. Might be good to keep your dog from licking his paws....Under no circumstances would I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter agent added is horrible","review":"I bought a 6-pack of the 3M Dust Remover and was immediately disappointed. There was no red tube to spray the dust remover so that left ALL the dust removers completely useless because it doesn't function properly without the skinny red tube. And then another HUGE disappointment with the added bittering agent. After a failed attempt to use the dust remover without the red stick, the bittering agent left a nasty, greasy residue all over my laptop keyboard which got on my fingers and then to my lips when I applied lip balm. I washed my hands and my lips until they were dry and damaged from soaps, but the taste and smell still remains. I will not be recommending this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"I understand we have to protect idiots from themselves however the bittering agent is awful.

It has a very awkward feel to it. The slight curve on the keyboard isn't ergonomic at all and there is no elevation change as you would expect from an ergonomic keyboard... so what you get is the worst of both worlds... people who want ergonomics won't get it and people who can't stand ergonomic keyboards won't like it either.I really have no clue who Microsoft's target audience was for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse","review":"I like this keyboard because it's so thin and light weight.

To make matters worse, documentation is sparse and online support info is virtually non-existent (I ran into lots of instances of the exact same problem, but no solutions.)Finally, I tried getting support via e-mail from Microsoft, but they were clueless and all but admitted that they couldn't guarantee their receiver would work with anything but their keyboard and mouse.

I hate the mouse more than any mouse I've ever come across. I played World of Warcraft for hours and so put a ton of demand on my mouse and keyboard. For whatever reason the bluetooth connection with both the mouse and keyboard was VERY spotty at times and really really ticked me off at critical gaming moments. The mouse connection sucks worse than the keyboard connection and even when I would just be sitting still in the game for a few seconds the mouse would time out or something and I'd have to jolt it back and forth to get it to start responding again. The keyboard would also do this... I'd have to mash keys to get it to kick back into gear and start recognizing key strokes again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE FOR ANY REASON. I cannot stand it and wish I'd never blown $100 on such an inferior product. RUN the other way and buy something from any other company.

The keys are low set, so it's very easy to hit something wrong, BUT, by far, the worst is that the keyboard will not put the numbers(and sometimes letters) where you want them, and put them in places like the address bar, or any open box above the address bar, and even take you completely out of your program, or back to it's home page (at the very least)Now it does not always do this,BUT IT DOES IT A LOT,and mostly when you are in the middle of important work. It will drive you nuts re-doing your work multiple times, so in general don't let it's good looks fool you. I think MS has more work to do on this keyboard"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, Great for Media Center. Not the best for gaming","review":"The good: If you use your computer mainly for multimedia stuff you will get one of the best keyboards here. The bluetooth reach a decent distance, from there you can use the touchpad-like area and you wont need to bring the mouse with you. It uses 4x AA batteries so be prepared to have other pack ready in case the charge is out. The mouse is very precise and can be used just fine with most tasks.The bad: Function keys are very cool looking, but can be easily unintentionally pressed if you are used to not look at your keyboard while typeing. This makes the keyboard not very godd for gaming, since you dont press the buttons looking at them.Great Product anyway. You can get it or wait for the next version wich will add some other stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit!","review":"Another superior effort from \\"El Puma\\".Fabulous arrangements, seamless vocals, and Jose Luis' purr.

At least on this disc, the computer manipulation of the original vocals is more flowing, but still not quite the same as the original recording. Another vain, dry attempt to give live to something that is not there.

It came very sharp out of the box, and with frequent honing on steel or ceramic rod, it remains EXTREMELY sharp. Most of my other knives are MAC japanese stamped knives, so I wanted a forged knife to complement the kit. This fits the bill- and how! The japanese knives seem to retain the sharpness a bit longer, but- like I said- with frequent honing this sucker stays good and sharp.

When the war ended over 250,000 Japanese troops were sitting looking at the sky and ocean, armed to the teeth but with no one to fight.

In 75 (This book) he returned with better equipment and started much earlier in the seasion.This expedition was a true 'seige' climb, on a totally unclimbed route. Climbers would head up to the front for their three or four days, manage to lay a thousand feet of rope and then retreat back to base to recover.The writing in this book must be Bonnington's best with a lot of real emotion.

This applies particularly to S. Felman's part of the book. D. Laub's articles are straightforward and clear, Felman's essays, however, are intellectually self involved, and convey a nervous kind of circular argumentation. This comes across as a very neurotic writing. But may be it's a sign of the times that trauma becomes a pretext for the somewhat usual textual interpretations of academic authors. May be it's also to be expected that most writers fail somewhat when they try to talk about personal or collective suffering. It is a difficult subject for sure.

Of course, there is no way you could determine that you wanted to go to the Upper Eastern Shore because it does not have its own descriptive section.

I thought about it and thought about it and I've decided that they need a different vocalist. Or a lot of backup vocals. I've listened to the rest of the tracks to get a feel for their sound, and it's very college band. They have just enough groove and funk to get airplay on pop stations, but from the vocals to the limp guitars they're largely unoriginal.

Where have they been hiding?...Wherever it's been it's been far too long. Bands like Maroon 5 only seem to surface every once in a great while. They have a unique twist on their music simply by taking sad/depressing subject matter and putting it to a snappy-happy/funky beat. I don't know whether to grab a box of tissues or step out on the dance floor. This is a great album for the band cause nearly all of the songs are phenomenal...you don't need to hit the skip button.

It does have that late-'80s R&B/rock feel and a lot of funk in the songs, but it's very now, very today. I'm surprised it came out in June 2002. How come nobody checked it out then and waited until Harder in late 2003 or This Love in April 2004 to jump onto it so rapidly? Right now, Maroon 5 is a hot group and they have the talent, the drive, and the chance to be a very successful band. Liked the lead singer's falsetto too.

The song was unlike anything playing on the airwaves. I decided to buy the CD even though it hadn't satisfied my usual criteria of at least three songs released to the radio, and my liking them. I was not disappointed.The influences of Motown and Stevie Wonder are evident, but Maroon 5 lends its own spin to that genre with the sublime vocals of Adam Levine. A truly unique voice among all of those boy bands' postpubescent tenors, Mr. Levine's is aptly suited for this type of music. With a little more edge than Stevie Wonder's, it is nonetheless effective on such moving songs as \\"She Will Be Loved\\" and \\"Sweetest Goodbye.'I highly recommend this album for Levine's voice, but the rest of the band's talent and ability to groove is also a good reason to obtain it. Songs About Jane rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY, VERY SATISFYING","review":"I bought this title because I listened to one of their songs, 'Harder to Breathe', at Circut City.

I encourage fans of Linkin Park and Green Day to buy this title, because I am a fan of them all and enjoy them almost equally.

Actually, I like all of the songs on this album, which is not something I can say about every album I own.My most preferred songs are: The Sun, Tangled, Sunday Morning, and Sweetest Goodbye.It is just an easy album to listen to. Not thrashy, full of soul.

I recommed it to anyone who likes Dave Matthews Band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best cd to be released in the past five years","review":"This cd is amazing. There is not a single bad song on here. Maroon 5 combines funk, R&B, soul, and rock flawlessly. These guys are going to be huge! Everywhere the band plays, they gain the entire audience as devout fans, and everyone who listens to this cd loves it. Look at the reviews! Maroon 5 are special; they have created an original sound, one that will sweep the charts fairly soon. If you need a comparison, they sound like a mix between Stevie Wonder, Jamiroquai, Ben Fold Five, and the Rolling Stones. By the way, they are unbelievable live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor","review":"This is a great CD. Seems like everyone who hears it gets addicted--with a few exceptions. If you are an elitist music nerd, you won't like it--It's too much fun. And if you have a problem with white musicians being influenced by black music, you won't like it on principle. Otherwise, you'll love the combination of rock and funk and the cool, the excellent musicianship, and the literate lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite cd ever!!!","review":"This CD is my favorite CD ever! Every song is different and I just love the lead singer's voice! Every song is so funky and I could swear to that on every song ( except number three, which i dislike) i could say I have atleast ten favorite parts. My favorite song is She Will Be Loved- it reminds me of walking alone in New York City with an umbrella and splashing puddles. Adam's voice is really great, and another favorite song is Must Get Out- Reminds me of parking in a car and making out. I love all of the songs and I recommend this cd to all of my friends and everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Must Be Mighty Embarassed....","review":"It has been loudly insisted for so long that this band is brilliant, to the point where many have started to believe it. \\"Songs About Jane\\" will be coveted among former boy-band-lovin teens and obssesive Maroon 5 fans. But, musically speaking, it's a terrible album. With the acception of the somewhat catchy \\"This Love\\", the entire album is a listless collection of tepid ballads. \\"Harder To Breathe\\" seems to have wandered off of the last N'SYNC album, and \\"She Will Be Loved\\" has more crooning than an entire Alanis Morisette album- except Alanis does it better. \\"Tangled\\" is a funky little song with a good beat completely ruined by Adam Levine's rough voice. \\"Must Get Out\\" would be good if someone else sang it. \\"Through With You\\" is the worst song of the album. Ouch."},{"rating":"1","title":"REFRESHING?, HOW ABOUT THE WEAK VERSION OF MATCHBOX 20","review":"Since THIRD EYE BLIND and MATCHBOX 20 are taking a well deserve break, this POPPY LOVE group MAROON 5 notice the resemblence with MATCHBOX 20, bot begin with M and have a number, HARDER TO BREATHE makes us believe they were a ROCK BAND, then comes the extremely anoying falsetto track THIS LOVE a pure POP rip off. It's not that original, sorry. SHE WILL BE LOVED is like those MOVIES that their intention is to make people cry, and they try to steal that tear...so obvious. SUNDAY MORNING prepared to the we made it lay back song...so so so average. It makes me wonder if this group was not crafted in the studios of Sunny Cali, the singer thinks he's so cute....and he's not eat a burger and his falsetto it's now overplayed. Their formula is purely proved so they used once and again. BUY GREEN DAY skip THIS(Love)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing!","review":"I LOVE MAROON 5! I think they are truly amazing.

The lead singer sounds like an a** also. I saw him in Rolling Stone and was reading about him, I was shocked hes such a a** and perveted. Hes not even really taleneted I saw them on MTV once cause I was living with this family for a while and her son's watch MTV alot and were watching Maroon 5, I thought to myself no talent at all.

Stevie Wonder has more talent in his little finger than this whole band. If you listen to some classic Stevie and still insist on making comparisons, then I feel for you. You obviously lack taste. To say that they suck is unfair to the word suck. I'll bet that, unless they have another hit single from this atrocity of an album, we have heard the last of Maroon 5. The high school kids who listen to them will graduate, pass them by and they'll be TSOL. I hope they get while the gettin's good because pretty soon there won't be anything left for them to get. Goodbye and good riddance Maroon 5. You suck worse than any band that has ever sucked before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moron 5","review":"Okay first of all the CD is called \\"Songs about Jane\\" So what do you think all the songs are going to be about? JANE! That's it. It's all about Jane. They could have atleast done a good job of it, like Hawthorne Hieghts did with \\"The silence in black and white\\". They made songs about one girl good. But Maroon5 is the opposite. Why in the world am I comparing Maroon 5 to Hawthorne Heights? They are totally different in every way!In the section \\"People who bought this title also bought...\\" They have listed Kelly Clarkson. And I have to say Kelly Clarkson is more of a rock band than Maroon5 will ever be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad.","review":"If I were to describe Maroon 5's sound, it would be a poppy blend of rock,funk, and jazz. To be honest, I bought this CD because I really liked track 1,\\"Harder to Breathe\\". Had I known that NONE OF THE OTHER SONGS WOULD SOUND REMOTELY CLOSE TO THIS ONE, I would have skipped the purchase. Granted - the lead singer's voice is a pleasure to listen to. The fact is that the rest of the songs are just plain Boring. Good tracks: 1,2, and 4.My main point is just that there is better stuff out there than this.

I wish I could start a band and rip off the idea from a previously popular group and have my swill played on the radio/movies/tv for the next year. Hmmm. . .sounds like Maroon 5. Hmmm sounds like Godsmack (taking their name/sound/ideas from Alice in Chains) go Check out the originals and then tell me that Maroon 5 isn't a cheap knock off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Wate YOur Time With this Band","review":"One of the best live bands to come around in a long time? You have GOT to be kidding me. I saw them live opening for Jason Mraz. Mraz was great, but watching Maroon 5 really put a damper on the whole evening. The lead singer tried to act all cool and everything, but came off as being REALLY annoying. Their live show is really nothing special and altogether boring. As for the album, come on people. This is major music industry at its finest, producing mindless sludge that has been used over and over again and then labeling them as being totally \\"unique\\". So what makes this band so \\"unique\\"? Believe me, if you really want to listen to this band, you're better off downloading the songs than buying the album. Trust me, it's not worth the price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I was unpleasantly surprised the the average rating for this CD was so high. Let me be blunt-this music is just disgusting. \\"She Will Be Loved,\\" is just annoying, I'm ashamed that these guys are even associated with the rock genre. I guess this is what people listen to today-which is really pretty sad. If you like pop and all of that, you'll probably enjoy this album. On the other hand, if you like good music, the kind that doesn't make you want to throw yourself in front of a moving train, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Great, But Solid Album","review":"A fine album from a fine band. You won't find anything brilliant or original, but you will find some enjoyable songs and riffs. The Singers Voice is very Sting-ish, which unlike some bands who try and imitate sting this works.

The lyrics are great, it's amazing how they capture relationships and love through their songs. The music is wonderful, some of the songs are worth blasting \\"Harder to Breathe\\" \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Tangled\\". Or relaxing to \\"The Sun\\" \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"Secret\\". I love all the songs, they're great, need i say more, this is the best cd i ever bought this whole entire year and i dont just like only 5 songs but all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maroon 5 Rocks!","review":"I first heard Maroon 5 on MTV and I thought they had a really unique sound.

How anyone could force themselves to listen to a bunch of wiggers doing r&b that would make the likes of \\"raven symone\\" cringe is beyond me. I guess it's this talentless hip-hop explosion (which will die out soon, trust me), that's got everyone excited about a middle-of-the-road, nothing special cheeze pop band. They have huge egos too, ones that would make kanye west green with envy. Total garbage, and if you call this rock, you deserve to be shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Depressing Depths","review":"Another band that prooves 'hype over content' is the poisoness cocktail slowly ruining contemporary guitar music. I've tried to come up with a suitable logline - I hope you like it - Buy Maroon 5's Album - or soak yourself in tepid bath water. Not particularly unpleasant, but you wont try it again.Dreadful Dreadful dreadful. On behalf of Maroon 5, I appolgise to the real song writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 songs short of being a great cd","review":"After listening to the first two songs on this cd, I had high hopes that this might be the first complete Cd that I had listened to in a long time. Apparently this should have been an EP if they still make those. Harder to Breath is certainly a catchy song but unfortunately the disk peaks on the first track. After that, you are left wanting. This is a frustrating CD. After the first track you want the entensity to continue but it quickly fades away to some very forgettable tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"......* insert something clever here*","review":"Great cd. It's punk jazz. I personally never thought that was possible. I guess it is, and this band pulls it off spectacularly! If you want more by them here's a hint: they used to go by the name Kara's Flowers. This is a band proclaimed talented by the likes of John Mayer and Jason Mraz. It doesn't have that characteristic richness of regular punk, the guitar is very...well, it's... it's great yes.. what's the word I'm looking for... It's specific, they're songs have some very specific guitarwork. I suppose. Don't listen to me I play piano not guitar. Anyway, great cd, although the guy's voice gets on my nerves after a while. That's just me though, I still like the cd a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I finally bought this recently because I was going to see them in concert & wanted to know more than two songs. I'm kicking myself now for waiting so long. I have listened to this CD straight thru about 20 times in the last week alone. The blend of blues, funk, rock, & pop is brilliant. \\"Sunday Morning\\" is such laid back groove you could listen to it over and over. Same with \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\". \\"Tangle\\" & \\"Harder to Breathe\\" have a hard, funk, rock edge.The lyrics on this album are incredible, from deep love to bitter regret. It reaches every emotion you face in a relationship. This is definately one of my favorite albums I've heard in the last 5 years. It's nice to see new artists bring in the influence of yesterday's legands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Sound","review":"Maroon 5 has brought introduced a new sound in music by fusing R&B;, jazz and rock into their own brand of music. Indeed, I personally feel that Maroon 5 has given us music listeners something new; just like how Norah Jones in 2002/03 stormed with Come Away With Me. The main reason that Maroon 5 is doing so well is to do with its unique music, which no one else offers at the moment.Adam, the lead singer of Maroon 5, has a very good voice and best of all, he uses it well on this CD. You won't find the usual hoarse voices of Nickelback or 3 Doors Down or Lifehouse. I find similarities between Adam's vocals and that of Justin Timberlake - perhaps even better.I am a great fan of music and listen to almost anything. But I only purchase CDs that are worth keeping and listening to over and over again. This CD is that type of CD. One more thing - Maroon 5: expect Grammys next year.Update 2005: What did I tell ya? Hail this year's Best New Artist at the Grammys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably one of the best albums I've gotten.","review":"A lot of people on here don't seem to understand what Maroon 5 is. They are not trying to be some hardcore rock band, they are a pop-rock band. I love this CD, all of the songs are different and have an interesting story to tell, unlike all the pop music today that seems to be all \\"Oh my I want you baby!\\" All of their songs are beautiful...most contain sexual innuendos, but it's all good. I could listen to this CD over and over again. If you are looking for some hardcore rock stuff this CD probably isn't for you, but if you are looking for a pop-rock lighthearted CD with lovely vocals and beautiful sounds of guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard I suggest you give it a shot. And by the way, for those who say that Maroon 5 doesn't know what rock is, uhm well I suggest you get your facts straight..."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingly different from any sound you've heard before","review":"I've loved this CD from the moment I bought it and played it for the first time driving in my car. There is just something compelling about Adam Levine's voice and it goes perfectly with the rock beats that are heard throughout this album.i'd say my favourite song would have to be Through With You, although each and every song is great -from the edgy Harder To Breathe, to the balladic She Will Be Loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"Their single \\"Harder to Breathe\\" is a great song and I love it so I thought I would like some of their other songs, but I was disappointed. Some of the other songs seem way too pop for me and seem totally different from \\"Harder to Breathe.\\" I wasn't impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock and Roll, what?","review":"I heard the song \\"Harder to Breathe\\" many time on the radio and TV, and liking the song I decided to go out and buy the cd. From that song, I believed that Maroon 5's sound was part old rock and roll, mixed in with some new pop sound. Boy was I wrong, the rest of the songs on the cd are much softer than \\"Harder to Breathe,\\" in fact they sound nothing like it. The cd has a very distinctive pop sound, with little to none of the rock sound I was looking for. While I have nothing against softer rock, the songs just did not seem to be of the same quality as \\"Harder to Breathe:\\" they just were not good. I was very disappointed. I listen to \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and then jump to the next disc in the changer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me make it simple","review":"I don't have MTV and I don't listen to pop radio. They won a grammy or something, so I downloaded the album. It was the first time I ever heard Maroon 5. Here is a completely unbiased review without being pretentious in the least:My first impression was, that this sounds like N*SYNC with real instruments. I'm not exaggerating for effect.A bit of Third Eye Blind thrown in for good measure. This is total boy band stuff.If you like N*SYNC you will like this. If you like Third Eye Blind, or Matchbox 20, you might like this, but will be annoyed by the N*SYNC/BSB vocals and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now what?","review":"Jeez people are still listening to this? How is this rock? It's bubblegum pop. I got the cd in April last year! I listened to it for about a month then got sick of it when I realised they weren't really very good. The music itself is unoriginal, the subject matter is all the same and now most peole have lost intrest (even the MTV teenyboppers). They can't really play their instruments in harmony with each other, the guitar is almost unheard, the drums are boring and slow (I've been playing since February and I can already play their songs) and the music doesn't compliment the lyrics or the other instruments. But it has 2 stars cos they sucked me in for a while. But now, they have no real place to go cos no self-respecting woman would date the lead singer so he can't write songs, and their sound is tired. If you want rock with a funk element, go for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. These guys have real staying power."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it two for potential","review":"This group dissappointed me.

IF YOU ACCIDENTLY RECIEVE A COPY, DISPOSE OF IT IMMEDIATELY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best new bands out there!","review":"I love Maroon 5! This album has a nice blend of up tempo rock songs and slower songs. They nicely blend elements of pop, rock, funk, and soul to create a cool style. My personal favorites off the album are Harder to Breathe and This Love. Overall, it is a great album and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good music!! Another artist to check out who I am also really into right now is Howard Lee Edwards. Check him out at www.HowardLeeEdwards.com!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of 2003's best","review":"On the advice of a friend, I decided to check this record out. I'm very glad I did. To be honest, with all the less-than-average music coming out today, I had low expectations. To my delight, this record instantly pulled me in. The sound sort of reminds me of a modern Paul McCartney/Wings with a bit of Sting splashed in. The sound is refreshing and delightful and the melodies are hard to forget.In my opinion, this is easily one of the best records of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"unexpected.. but delightful","review":"i honestly only bought this cd because i couldn't get Harder to Breathe out of my head and i wasn't sure how the rest of the CD would actually turn out. i was very impressed. most of the songs are catchy and once you learn all the words, you'll constantly be singing along, in your head, or actually to the music. i definitely recommend this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marroon5 Get it you won't regret it!","review":"REFRESHING, DIFFERENT, FUN, HAPPY!! It's about time! I'm in that 30 something age group and the pop stuff is sickening. On the other hand if I hear one more Billy Joel or Elton John song I'll just scream! This group just gets it. They have a great sound that makes you want to get up and rock. I'm a huge Black Crowes fan and believe me I've been searching for something good for a long time. You can really sink your teeth into these guys! MMMMM YUMMY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOA!","review":"Thats what i said when i first got this cd, and listened to it all the way through, im a fan of music that you can just chill and listen to. This definately hits the spot. A must see cd !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maroon 5 Rocks","review":"As I received my cd in the mail, of songs about Jane, I popped open the plastic wrap and couldn't wait to hear from Maroon 5. And I have to say this Cd is what I have been waiting for in years. Very nice to listen to while working, with the popular tunes \\" This Love \\" and \\"Harder to Breathe\\" they did an awesome job on this album. Ladies, this one mends the heart, like no other. Their vocals are amazing, each song has it's own beat. Definetely recommend this for purchase. This a CD definetely worth your 15 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal CD","review":"There is not a bad song on this CD. What a fantastic, amazing debut albumn for Maroon 5. I bought this CD based on hearing \\"Harder to Breathe\\" on the radio. I was a little hesitant, because sometimes great singles don't always translate into great CD's. This was definitely the case with Maroon 5. This is a fabulous CD and I cannot say enough about it. It has literally not left my CD player for weeks. Maroon 5 has a totally new sound which is remniscent of Stevie Wonder and Jamiroquai (but w/ better songs than Jamiroquai!). Their songwriting talent is similar to Better Than Ezra ... varied and interesting and with a little something for everyone. Each song is great, catchy, and you will find yourself singing along in no time. I highly recommend this CD for those of you who enjoy kind of jazz-y, alternative, rock tunes. Great music, great voices. It is simply an incredible CD. I think Maroon 5 will be next year's Best New Artist at the Grammy's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Time & Touring For Great Talent To Break Big!","review":"This CD came out in the summer of 2002 and it has taken 2 years for it to break to a larger audience. After hitting the road, they have polished their act, their on stage presence and their playing and singing skills. Singer Adam Levin reminds you of singer Colin Bloostone from The Zombies (British Invasion) and the soulful feeling of Simply Red. I am quite sure that if they hold together and continue to write within this soulful and skillful vain into their next album, they do have the talent to become a big international act. Nope, they are not a \\"one hit wonder\\". Listen and listen carefully. There's a lot of talent here. Kudos! And on to the next for 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those not in the know check out their previous band...","review":"As good as this album is, check out Kara's Flowers \\"Fourth World\\" if you can find it. \\"Soap Disco\\" still ranks as one of my favorite 90s tunes. Out of print, it's fetching at least $25 on ebay.Bonus: Do a search here on amazon (Kara's Flowers) and read some comments by the band's guitarist.Majorly talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10","review":"One of the best all around albums in my collection to date!

Pity, I love Adam, but their music is just they same sounds over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"The first time I heard this band was their song \\"This Love\\". Before I saw the video, I thought they were a new R&B group. I was very impressed and I instantly fell in love with the song. They are a great mixture of R&B, funk and rock. The more I heard the song, the more I loved it. I decided to buy the CD even though I had only heard 1 song. The CD is absolutely wonderful from the first song to the last. I listen to every song on the CD without skipping any. These guys are amazing! It's good to know there are still musicians out there and musicians who know what REAL MUSIC is all about and appreciate it. I would love to see them perform live. I am now a Maroon 5 fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"I bought this cd because I liked the first 2 singles I heard off this album, Harder To Breathe & This Love, and was pleasantly surprised when I liked all the other songs on the album even better than those 2 songs!!

All the songs are good most are great I recommend it highly I have already ordered their 2007 album can't wait to hear that I read the reviews some people say it's too commercial not as good as this one but look how much time they had to perfect this one.

I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE CD'S TO ANY PERSON WHO LOVES TO LISTEN TO MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!!","review":"I love Maroon 5. They are sooo good!Adam's voice is refreshing, and all the musicians are talented so well. Maroon 5 is one of those kind of bands that you do not find a lot. On the radio there are mostly those kinds of songs and artists that basically anyone can sing. But Maroon 5's songs and talents are different from everyone else, and that is one of the reasons I love them so much. If you're sick of all those same, rap or punk rock artists on the radio, come listen to Maroon 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing mix of rock and funk fusion","review":"This is Maroon 5's debut and it is a strong start to a band that shows so much promise. There are a number of songs on this album release that have become hits to the fans and romantics as well. Songs like This Love, She Will Be Loved are made for romantic evenings in with your special someone with soft slow sensual beats to slow dance too.The you have suave songs like The Sun and Sunday Morning that one would love to hold their special someone close and listen whilst relaxing on a weekend. Another great song and possibly the unsung hero of the CD release is the last song, Sweetest Goodbye. Now this is a song that should have been a hit from the start. Many of the songs are sung with a vigour by Adam that leaves many leads wanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNKY!!!!!","review":"Four stars!!!! If it is 5 stars it will be perfect, no room for improvement on the second album, which will be the definitive(if not the jinx, as the usual superstition) album for any artist there is. Seriously, Adam's voice is not that brilliant but it sure fits the whole context of the album. I JUST CANNOT STOP CRANKING THIS ALBUM UP everytime I play it.Amazing!!! I still have 100%of my hearing (so far I had been listening to this for almost 2 years running, on my daily commute).Cannot wait for the sophomore album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it, you won't be dissappointed!!!","review":"I heard Maroon 5 a few years ago when they were still Kara's Folower's. They were good, but still needed their music to mature. When they changed their name and matured musically and lyrically I saw them perform at the gorge. I love them. They had such a wonderful stage presence and all of their songs are exceptional. BUY SONGS ABOUT JANE!!! Some of my favorites on the CD are: This love (I'm sure you've already heard it), Sunday Morning, Sweetest Goodbye. They also show their edgier guitar/rock side with songs like Must Get Out, and The Sun, which I love because they performed it as the sun was setting. This CD is one of my favorites, everyone who I play it for instantly falls in love with the band. Just try it, and if you love it you have to see them in concert, if not then resell it or give it as a gift. What do you have to lose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ecclectic Mix","review":"Maroon 5 seems to be a fine blend of many musical styles. The lead off track Harder To Breathe is a crunchy New Wave Rocker with powerful guitar licks and strong vocals. Not Comming Home is another rocker. Howeer the wah wah guitar licks take on a funkier tone and the stylings somehow are reminiscent of the modern boy bands particularly the Back Street Boys.Other tracks have more of an Rhythm and Blues feel. The Sun seems to ofer a compelling organ track which is somewhat reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's mid seventies work. Sunday Morning seems to combine the Rhythm and Blues vocals with some fine piano jazz chops. There are some intriguing ballads as well.If you like a variety of musical styles, Maroon 5's Songs About Jane is a good addition for your music collection. Good songs, instrumental embelleshments, and vocals complete the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but...","review":"Maroon 5 has a unique alternative rock sound that I like. The only thing I hate about this album, is, every song is about sex! It's the only thing they sing about! So if that bothers you, you might not want to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another overhyped and overrated pop/rock band","review":"yet another boring pop/rock band that is pushed forward by media hype, this simply does not mean that it is good music in anyway shape or form,i know good music when i hear it and i've been listening to music for many years now(old & new). Simply put is that pop/rock music is not the same as its used to be, now we have overhyped rubbish such as this band making overrated annoying music that people sadly buy and \\"think\\" it is good music, listen to older pop/rock music and then you'll see what i mean when modern pop/rock bands in today's world suck. It also sucks when bands with actual tallent such as \\"creed\\" break up and we still have these other rubbish music in the airwaves, people who buy this type of music are only fooling themselves and that truly is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"I purchased this CD after hearing the single \\"Harder To Breathe\\" which is a great song. The rest of the CD sounds likeit was done by a different band. There is not one other song like Harder To Breathe on the album. That wouldn't be so bad if any of the other songs were good, but they are not.The rest sounds like a total Jamiroquai rip-off. Beware, this has one hit wonder written all over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maroon 5 Sucks!!!!","review":"I own this CD, and it is a piece of crap! All of the songs have crappy instruments playing, and even worse lyrics. If there is a worse album out there, I would be verry surprised. Plus, I saw a show about their album on T.V., and all they were saying was \\"It must be good, we played our own instruments.\\" What morons. Whatever you do, don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn these guys are annoying","review":"I loved Harder To Breathe, but the rest of the album is pure garbage & filler. I understand that the lead singer might have had some relationship problems, but does he have to write about it in EVERY DAMN SONG? Theres too much pop and not enough rock also, theres more synthesizers and FX then there is guitars, bass and drums. It doesn't help that This Love is on the radio 24/7 nonstop either..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and relaxing","review":"I bought this cd, only having heard one of the songs on it - I instantly was in love with the whole thing! It can cheer me up, chill me out, help me sleep, anything - and my 2 and 5 year old kids like to boogie in the backseat when we listen to it in the car - great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"I don't know what all the hype about Maroon 5 is?

All I can recommend is don't get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"mAROON 5 REVIEW","review":"Take one sneak peak into new bands these days and if you want to find raw talent you have located Maroon 5. The pop/rock/soul combination had made this band a complete first album.With there hit song Harder to Breath these 5 young guys who debueed 1997 with there album The Fourth World with the name as Kara's Flowers. Now as the band prepares to debut there brand new C.D. with a new name called Maroon 5.With quotes like, \\"Is there anyone out there, cause its getting harder and harder to breath.\\" With there brand new video just realesed by Octone Records it shows the 5 members rocking out to there future.Though as the sound of music sounds just like what you will here on the radio stations like 91X and 933 every day, but there is something unique about the band, it is not the usual boy band music. The CD contains addictive, energetic, innovate pure funk rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original?","review":"How can a band have the originality of Jamiroquai? Surely copying originality would make you unoriginal and awful. Well that's what it did to Maroon 5. Possibly the worst album of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"excrutiating","review":"And bland beyond belief. I can only hope the Best New Artist Grammy Award Curse befalls this group. Look back in Grammy history and you will see the likes of Starland Vocal Band, Tracy Chapman, and Arrested Development as winners of that particular award whose careers went nowhere FAST. Maroon 5 are watered down, fourth division white boy blue eyed soul of the worst kind. Jamiroqui rip offs ( who themselves are Stevie Wonder rip offs ). Maroon 5 are so safe and so corporate. The lead singer has an annoying whine of a voice and his lyrics are akin to reading the poetry diary of a \\"sensitive\\" high school freshman. Just terrible, and unfortunately, all over the place. THIS IS WHY I DON'T LISTEN TO THE RADIO !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs About What Sorry?","review":"The singer whines out poems about women, the guitarist plays three alternating chords, the drummer hits a drum. The world falls at their feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED TO REAL MUSIC?","review":"I know this is pop music but I dont ever remember pop even sucking this much. When im flipping thru the channels and see VH1 on the only thing I see is this horrible band and John mayer and both make me want to vomit, it seems that horrible music is in style or something. Oh well in a couple of months there will be a new trend to bug the crap out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING","review":"These guys are really annoying. They do sound a little bit like a boyband, every song is about girls and love, and plus theirs just as much synthesizers as there is guitar. The drums are drum machine quality, and the bass? Hah! Is there even any bass being used? The guitar is very choppy except for in \\"Harder To Breathe\\". Listen to the chorus of \\"This Love\\", the guitar sounds really bad. If you want a bunch of love songs with more synthesizers than guitar, then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band is like AIDS to music.","review":"First of all, I work at Hollister in the mall and this CD frequently makes the rotation on our jukebox where customers get to pick songs to play. I cannot tell you how much my fellow employees and myself hate this CD. It's actually aggravating to listen to. We still have no clue why they are as popular as they are. To start off with, the singer's voice is so annoying that when I hear it, I get an uncontrollable urge to throw furniture and other things at customers. As if that wasn't bad enough, the lyrics to the songs are just []repetitive. I think just about every song on the album is about some dumb girl that the lead singer is obsessed with.[] If you want to hear some good alternatives to this musical atrocity try Trapt, Linkin Park, Coldplay, or Seether."},{"rating":"1","title":"soon we'll catch them on the one hit wonder marathon","review":"This Love is their only good song, it has a catchy motown-sounding musical sound to it but that's it. The voice is annoying and their performing with instruments and in the bedroom as seen in the video was a real turnoff, I knew they were losers the minute I laid my eyes on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep they suckered me with this one.","review":"I went out and bought \\"Songs About Jane\\" based upon online reviews and the impression \\"Harder to Breathe\\" made upon me. I am music lover of varied styles and genres, but I must agree with several reviews that this album to closely resembles 'pop, boy band music'. Do not take the single \\"Harder to Breathe\\" as a good indicator to the sound of the entire album. From the second track the album becomes a soft, generic sound of funk beats and groove rock. The lyrics are nothing to speak of, and the vocals began to get under my skin. If you like \\"Harder to Breathe\\", and you are still intrigued, then buy a used copy, for I am sure there will be no short supply. I have already traded my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nice guys.","review":"I just wanna say that my gf is a huge fan (for some odd reason) and the one time I agreed to go with her to a Maroon 5 show proved to be a total nightmare. We stood in line for an hour waiting for an autograph, and about 1/4 of the way to the front, the entire band packed up and left. This was AFTER telling everyone they'd get their stuff signed. Everyone was like \\"hey, what about us\\"? And do you know what these jerks said; \\"too damn bad, we're leaving\\". On top of that, they had some 300 black dude (security detail probably) forcably remove a 12 year old girl just for going up to them and saying \\"I'm your biggest fan, I love you guys\\". What kinda pus*y does that? I wouldn't give these low rent, college bar band a*holes a penny of my money, and you shouldn't either. There's much better out there if you want good pop-rock music. Thx for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"I slept on this CD.","review":"I have had this CD for a couple of years, but apart from harder to breathe, and This Love, I wasn't feeling this CD as a whole. Fast forward to April 2007. I put the whole album onto my MP3 player, and like wow! It was like listening to a completely new CD. The first song that lept out at me was 'Sweetest Goodbye', which I kept on constant auto play, great song. Then 'Secret' wrapped it tender grooves around my ears, soon followed by 'Tangled'. Now I'm at the point that I can listen and appreciate and listen to the whole CD. The funk/soulfullness of this offering, allied with Adam Levines great vocal are a devasting combination that works, and works throughout this CD. Can't wait for the sophmore joint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"Usually, i will hear a song on the radio, buy the album and then be dissapointed by the cd. However, with \\"songs about jane\\" EVERY single song i absolutely love. It has a unique and different sound, and every song is captivating. The vocals are amazing as well as the instruments. I definately say this album is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great new band!","review":"Maroon 5 is one of the best bands which emerged on music scene this year. After a small failure at the very beginning of their career, Maroon 5 did not give up, and re-released \\"Songs about Jane\\", with all the promotion that this record deserves.\\"Harder to breathe\\", \\"This love\\" and \\"She will be loved\\" are songs which are getting lots of airplays on radio these days and are conquering positions on charts all over the world. One of my favorite songs is \\"Sweetest goodbye\\" and I really wish it becomes a single. If you like pop music, give it a chance, and buy \\"Songs of Jane\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"I bought this album after hearing their single \\"Harder to Breathe\\" The song just blew me away with the lyrics and over all sound combined with the percise rythm. However, it was the one and only song on the album that fits into the rock genre...the rest of the cd consists all pop songs, some of which made me ill. There are at LEAST 5 filler songs on this album. I can definately see the appeal of the song \\"This Love\\", but the rest of this album consists of a very tired out sound that almost all pop/rock bands have.Overall I'd say if this cd is priced over $8.00 find another band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maroon 5 - Songs About Jane","review":"Maroon 5 hit it big with their song This Love, which I admit, was a catchy tune and I did like it and sing along. However, their album is not very solid. They've got tracks that just seem really plain and like filler tracks. The other single which was Sunday Morning is a nice song. But their other single She Will Be Loved gets on my nerves. The lead singer has a high nasaly voice but it didn't bother me in some of the songs. But in that song and some others it does. So I can't really listen to this album for more than one rotation for example so it ends up sitting there in the corner. If you like She Will Be Loved (assuming you've heard it on the radio or something) then the album should be fine but for those that don't really enjoy his voice all that much this album isn't strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!! I'm shocked !!!!","review":"I love this CD. And I'm shocked. I bought it with the knowledge that many people who like Jason Mraz also like Maroon5 (they toured together). So, I thought this band would just be another Guster (who rock, by the way). But, they aren't!! They are funky, groovy, jazzy and many times Adam sounds just like Stevie Wonder, if that's possible! :) I'm really impressed!! BUY THIS CD! I play it all the time- just put it on shuffle and go! Between this and Mraz's WFMRTC, I'm good to go :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAROON 5 IS ON ITS WAY.","review":"What I like to see when I buy a new CD that the first single \\"Harder to Breathe\\" which a great song, is not my favorite.This CD has a lot of strong songs such as \\"Shiver\\", \\"Tangled\\" and \\"This Love\\".The lead vocals are always in fine form, well produced and the band is top notch.Maroon 5 is a band that is on its way. A lot of great songs to listen too - a definite long trip on the road CD. A very consistent and thorough album with great songs, lyrics, production and most of all well spent dollars.Maroon 5 has my vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"NEW \\" BAND","review":"Maroon5, a band that started playing about 10 years ago, just made it big with their hit song:Harder to Breathe. But on their CD:Songs about Jane,I don't see any reason why they would not became famous with any of their other songs off their CD. I was skeptical at first, but when I heard them for the first time from my friend, I instantly fell in love with their music. Their drum beat (played by Ryan Dusick) is very simple however, James Valentine (guitar), Jesse Carmichael (keyboard), and Michael Madden (bass) come together to make the simple drom beat work. On their CD, there is mixture of up beat songs and slow songe like my favorite: Sweetest Goodbye. Some people would say that Maroon5 is rock while others say it is a little \\"pop\\" punk, but in my opinion I say it is a little rock. So in my opinion, Songs About Jane by Maroon5 deserves a 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"After listening to \\"Harder to Breathe\\" on the radio, I had to get the CD. I must say that I was not disappointed. I could listen to the whole CD without have to fast forward. If you're into Rock/R&B kind of music, I'm sure you'll love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many albums, so few this good","review":"I first heard \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and was immediately hooked. It's a harder edge soft rock, which isn't a bad thing. They have their own unique sound that seperates them from just about everything else on the radio. Very few bands have accomplished this lately. Maroon 5, along with another one of my favorites Matchbox 20, have found there place in pop music. I've read some of the other reviews saying that they are just \\"a boy band with guitars\\". That's fine and well for them, they are entitled to their opinion, but they are missing out on a great band and a great album. The fact that the band writes their own songs lends credence to this fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...","review":"Never have I listened to a cd that had every single song putting me in shock. My friend told me about this cd a good time before I finally bought it and when I finally did, I was amazed. Songs about Jane came out a while back but Maroon 5 is now starting to get the respect and popularity they deserve This cd is amazing. It's definitley different than anything I've ever listend to. I saw them in concert recently with Marc Broussard and Gavin Degraw( who are also amazing) and they were just phenominal. I can honestly say that anyone who picks up this cd will be VERY impressed. Maroon 5 is definitley my favorite band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have these guys been!","review":"Seems as if Maroon 5 just appeared out of no where. Literally. This band is the best of the best...from Harder to Breathe to Sweetest Goodbye, Maroon 5 gives an awesome effort in their latest album. I'm def. satisfied. They vibe together well and mix funk, hip/hop and alt. rock all in one. If you are versitile with your music you'll def. want to pick up Maroon 5. For a great band, that can both give meaninful lyrics as well as great beats, Maroon 5 is one of the best, if not the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"When I first heard \\"Harder To Breath\\" one day while swapping Cds casually with a classmate, I was intrigued by the natural, well-done combination of rock and funk elements. Curious, I got the album, and am happy to say, this CD really pulls off the unique blend. Adam's vocals are top-notch, and his back-ups create a nice, smooth feel on the entire album. The only reason I gave this CD 4 out of 5 is because of the idea behind the lyrics; an entire album (except for the first track) being about an ex-girlfriend reminds me of a typical pop band lamenting a relationship they didn't have. Surprisingly, Maroon 5 makes this idea sound good. Great vocals, awesome guitar playing and nice, ambient drums make this album a great buy, and Maroon 5 a band to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy music","review":"its rare today to find musicians with true vocal talent, who know their instruments, and write the perfect words to accompany their perfect notes. but maroon5 does so, flawlessly and seemingly effortlessly.formerly kara's flowers, a more pop-punk sounding band, maroon5 has become a band that revels in sensual music. the more funk inspired maroon5 creates all around sexy music that doesnt come off tawdry or dirty. its the type of music that you wouldnt be embarassed if it came on your cd player in your car and your mom was sitting in the passenger seat. trust me, this is amazing stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD","review":"I really love this CD. I was watching a student dance show which featured an amazing solo dance to \\"This Love\\" and couldn't get the song out of my head (in a good way). Afterwards I bought their CD, which hasn't left my CD player since. Their songs have some cool lyrics like \\"the sex she slipped into my coffee, they way she felt when she first saw me,\\" and \\"I twist to fit the mold that you are in\\"... etc., but the instrumental music behind the words is what really makes the album for me. Sometimes it sounds like it comes straight out of a Stevie Wonder album (Sunday Morning) other times it is hard rock (not coming home), but no matter what it has a really rich quality. If these guys don't become famous and get on the top 100, all my faith in the music industry will be lost. They are so much better than so many bands on the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd","review":"Maroon 5 are one of the few bands out there that can successfully fuse r&b and rock together. Adam Levine's vocals are amazing, as is the music. People have been puting down this band alot, i have no idea why. I guess they dont see the magic that this band produces. Absolutely amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunday Morning","review":"AWESOME CD! AWESOME GROUP! Love this CD, and the all the songs.

What an investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, Very Refreshing","review":"This CD is great, I would highly recommend it.I don't believe that there is a song on the CD that I don't like. Maroon 5 has a great sound, that's very refreshing from the mundane crap that you hear on the radio day after day.Two Thumbs Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"L'il Stevie Wonder","review":"I rated 4 stars (instead of 5) because of the album's first song (stinks!)...This young guy must have studied Stevie Wonder - he's picked up Wonder's nuances as well as much of his style but added much of his own. This Love is his most popular song, but in my opinion, what sets this group as being unique and cuts them apart from everyone else is their song, Secret. The lyrics are great and the melody you'll play over and over once you've heard it. Sorry if I'm rambling (I'm 58 but I love good popular music), and I asked my daughter & her fiance if we could hear Secret at their wedding reception. Buy this album and look for this group at the Grammies."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great album!","review":"I heard \\"This Love\\" about two summers ago. I fell in love with it and got the album right away. It's great that they're finally getting the exposure that they need on radio and TV. Never before have I heard such a great blend of funk, soul, and rock. Unless you've got a stick up your ass it's hard to imagine why you wouldn't like this album.I gave it 4 stars because I find myself getting bored with it sometimes, however the album is still one of my favorites will be getting a lot of play in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all good...","review":"I've been listening to this CD almost non-stop since I got it over a year ago. The R&B and funk influences are evident throughout. And though their current single \\"Harder to Breathe\\" is a great song, it is just a nibble of this great CD. I just saw them live and was blown away. Alex Levine has a great voice and is absolutely handsome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential...","review":"I bought the Maroon 5 cd when I heard they were having a free concert in town. I recognized Harder to Breathe, and it was tolerable but definitely not a musical gem. The majority of the cd was a real disappointment, and I was on the verge of throwing it in my \\"[unacceptable]\\" cd pile when Sunday Morning came on. It was different, had lost that annoying boy band sound that sticks to the other tracks. I listened again, and they do have some songs that are reminiscent of Sunday Morning, but not of the same quality. In my opinion, if Maroon 5 moved more into the direction of these jazzier sounding songs they would be so much more successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's my job to make you understand you want this CD","review":"From seeing them on Carson Daly's show randomly one night, to listening to some of their songs online, to going out and buying the CD, e-mailing Adam (the lead singer) and him e-mailing me back, to seeing them open up for John Mayer, Maroon5 has never let me down. They are so innovative-\\"neo-soul\\" music if you will, like nothing I've ever heard in the best way possible. The power that Adam puts behind his vocals combined with the talent from the rest of the band, as well as their awesome personalities (when's the last time you got an e-mail from a famous recording artist?) prove that Maroon5 will soon get the respect they deserve"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performers","review":"I listened to a few Maroon5 songs because I knew they would be playing at a Jason Mraz concert I was going to, and I was curious to see how they sounded. At first, I was not impressed. Though, their live performace completely blew me away. Lead singer Adam Levine was so intense, passionate, and sexy, not to mention his vocals was incredible. Also, the lead guitarist was a true wizard of his craft, his playing was spellbinding. Seeing such an amazing band live is awesome, and I recommend seeing them live if you ever get the chance. If you can't, get the cd While they are one of the few bands 10 times better in concert than in studio recording, the cd is also amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"think this is good, check them out live","review":"this cd is awesome--definately one of my favorites. and as good is as this cd is, their live performances are even better. i caught them opening for john mayer last fall and just saw them with jason mraz and they were amazing! i recommend that any fan of the album checks out their live show so they can see just how awesome maroon5 is!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of hits","review":"This cd has many hits on it.

Their lyrics were so genuine with funky, indie beats. Lyrics that tell stories and involve you without resorting to gimmicky stutters. My favorites are This Love, She Will Be Loved (a huge song with brilliant vocals from Levine), and Sunday Morning but the whole album is cohesive. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've Heard in a LONG time!!","review":"When I first heard Maroon 5 open for John Mayer, I immediately went and bought the CD. As I listened to it, I was not disappointed. In fact, I was blown away. This band is truly unique, and there is not a single song on the CD I don't like! If you're looking for a favorite, I would have to say number 6, The Sun, and also, um, all the rest!! Buy this CD and u won't be let down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a noncomercial success","review":"This is what a band should sound like, this is the backstreet boys with talet as opposed to marketing. I found that every track was good and had it's own sound, not that Boy band rubber stamp that 16 year old girl seem to like. I am a 46 year old male music lover from Pachebel to Elvis to Nat \\"king\\" Cole to Telonius Monk, and I give this CD a hardy endorsement.

It is well done, sounds great... but most of all.. the delivery of the songs is fantastic. Adam Levine is the true genious behind these songs as far as I can tell. He sounds amazing, and his voice really conveys the feeling of what he sings. I have even heard the Demos of these songs, and when you hear them stripped down to basics, with mainly Adam's voice to carry the emotion of the tune.. you can hear the quality in their art.Maroon 5 have really progressed in their sound since they were Kara's Flowers. They had a sound similar to WEEZER, I would say when they were KF.. but now they have an amazing sound all their own. I have seen them LIVE 3 times, and have never been dissapointed.This is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I am a huge fan of Hip-Hop, Electronic and Rock Music. This is a funky bridge that brings out the best of what there is to offer!

The remainder of the album is great, too, but I would've preferred more songs like the aforementioned -- songs with a distinct, funky beat fused with melodic jazz rhythms. It's good, but I'm hoping their next release is packed with more exceptional songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy To Rate, Hard To Categorize","review":"\\"Songs About Jane\\" is rather an unique collection of music. Listening to the different songs you feel as if there are numerous influences behind this CD. Sometimes the lead singer reminds me of Sting with his wonderful voice, and sometimes the music gives me the impression of jazz, other times rock-n-roll. With such a myriad of songs and each one is distinctly different, one can not put this CD in a music style category. That is the great thing about it.It is original, easy to listen to and easy to appreciate. You can tell this band has got a talent that not many can capture. I liked some of the songs, not all of them. I imagine it would take getting used to. Great CD.Joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Standard Pop-Rock Nibbles","review":"That is to say, it won't blow you away, and highly expendable. 1 star because Maroon 5 isn't terrible, but I assure you no one with respectable music taste would give this album a third spin.\\"The perfect blend of melody and grit. One of the best live bands to come along in a while\\".John Mayer said the above, which leads me to think that his music taste is poor and he has not heard any of the great live bands (Grateful Dead were legendary, for one).

After listening to only a few songs I have come to the firm conclusion that this is a decent band with good talent and a possible future... if they ditch their lead singer. The boy sounds like a shabby ripoff of Justin Timberlake and should not be allowed to open his mouth and release any vocal utterence for any reason whatsoever. After the secon song... not second listen second song.... the album sound repetitive and whiny. Don't buy this album unless you have a disire to listen to music that makes one desire to beat your head against a hard object.

The rest of the disc, however, totally blows goats, in my opinion. I am a rocker who is open to new stuff, but this ain't it ! Besides the first song, the rest of this disc sounds like that crap you hear on top 40 stations. CORPORATE RADIO SUCKS !! Looks like I accidently stepped into the wrong genre of music. Unfortunately, I threw away my receipt and now I'm stuck with it. I guess I'll have to sell it on the used CD market for like 3 bucks.

I waited until I saw/heard them on \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" The true test of any band is whether they can perform live. These guys sounded GREAT live. I was taken aback. The next day, I bought the CD and played the it over and over. What was even better is that there is a live version of one of their songs, \\"Not Coming Home,\\" on the CD. The song is absolutely fabulous. It has instantly become one of my favorites along with \\"Harder to Breathe,\\" \\"This Love,\\" and \\"Sunday Morning.\\" You would never know it's live if it weren't for the audience.

With the addition of James Valentine (bass) to the band, they changed their name to Maroon (briefly) and then Maroon5. As this band has grown up, their music has as well. \\"Songs About Jane\\" is one of the most amazing albums I've heard - from an independent (recently noticed) band. With their first single \\"Harder To Breathe\\", they draw you in and keep you going with each amazing track they have to offer. With the seductive lyrics they pour out of their souls, to the outstanding music they lay out for the taking - Maroon5 has single handedly created an album that will be around forever. You can not compare them to anyone else and do them (or the other band) any justice. They have an amazing sound that only Maroon5 could pull off.

Pesach is a Chag , and in Chaggim a fundamental Mitzvah is to be in joy of Mitzvah. This Haggadah then is especially appropriate as the teachings of Shlomo emphasize how we are to come out of both inner and outer 'meitzarim' ( confined places)and know true freedom and joy. This Haggadah can thus be a very valuable addition to helping bring out and maintain an inner emotional understanding of Pesach."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment -- Not that interesting or well-written","review":"Based on the reviews, I expected more from this book than I got. The story didn't keep my interest. The characters had potential but didn't live up to it. There are so many other good historical romances out there where the author creates interesting and believable characters and puts them in an interesting and believable environment. This book used up my suspension of disbelief about a third of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex-ay!!","review":"Every time I hear Sandy Hingston has a new one coming out I wait, with bated breath, and never am I disappointed! For this one, she went all out. Characters I fell in love with, a romance that's the stuff of dreams, sex scenes that are, well, dripping with steaminess. If you love romances--and who doesn't, really?--you MUST pick this one up. Now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill out, everyone, this book is fab","review":"Reading other people's critical reviews of The Suitor made me realize why many romance writers/readers get on my nerves - they act like The Rest Of Us have to KNOW AND CARE DEEPLY about all kinds of history in order to allow ourseives to enjoy a damn fine book. What a competitive, prissy horde horde they are. When I read their sniping reviews, I feel taken aback and a little bad, like someone is chiding me for being hoodwinked into allowing myself to be swept away by a truly good yarn.What a bunch of pedantic, joyless scolds. It's a BOOK, gang.So, fine, call me an dolt for not much caring whether the language I found so entertaining, real and accessible in Hingston's book may (or may not ) be lacking in historical accuracy. I loved the story, and I love Hingston's writing. I want characters that draw me in, plot lines that surprise and love scenes that rivet. This book has it all. I adored it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AGREE WITH \\"CHILL OUT\\" FROM CANTON","review":"Romance readers who turn romance reading into an academic exercise, a hunt for historical accuracy, are missing the whole point of romance reading--it's to escape the drudgery of day-to-day life and who cares if one or two minor details aren't true to the Regency period? What matters is that THE SUITOR is great reading, fast reading and juicy on top of all that. Hingston really creates three-dimensional characters and a hero you just want to, well, take a bite out of. Yummy yummy is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance and Laughs - A Wonderful Read!","review":"... this book had me laughing out loud several times. In fact, I can't help but grin when I recall Katherine's encounter with the \\"highwayman\\". All in all, I thought this book took a different approach than most in that you started out almost disliking the heroine from page one. But as the story progresses you begin to understand her more and more. Katherine won my vote by not being your typical \\"damsel in distress\\" waiting to be rescued by her Prince Charming. And Alain...he was adorable. I mean, he was just real to me. Sure, he wasn't exactly \\"titled\\" and his \\"nonchalant\\" attitude towards life might have proven a bit frustrating to some but to me...it made him all the more believeable.

Even my hubby who is usually skeptical of fangled gadgets heaps praise on it.However, if you read the fine print on the manual, it only has a 90 day warranty. Right after my baby turn 3 months old, the timer went blank. I gave it a change of battery, I even cleaned the contacts where the batteries would connect to. Nothing worked. I opened up the unit to look inside and found that the wire that connects to the battery wasn't soldered on properly. On further investigation I saw some components were dead, but I'll spare you the details.In short, it has poor quality control by the manufacturer. I wouldn't pay this much for something that spoils this easily, I would have given this one star if it isn't for the fact that it was a great help while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor and buy this now!","review":"As the mother of a 4 1/2 month old, there are not many baby products that I can say have been \\"must haves\\" for me so far. But this definitely is!! Especially for those first few weeks, when you need to track diaper changes and feedings closely each day and are running on little to no sleep. Even now that my son is on a pretty set schedule, this timer is helpful. When he starts to fuss, I can glance at the timer and see if he is actually hungry or if he's just being fussy and needs some extra TLC.This was particularly helpful to me since my son had trouble gaining weight at first and needed to be fed at least every two hours, per the doctor's orders. It was so hard to remember when his feedings started and how long it had been since the last one and which side he should be fed on next time. This product made everything so easy - just click a button, no math required!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver, order one now!","review":"This little device has been a lifesaver for us the past 4 days with our new born. If you're wondering how hard could it REALLY be to keep track of a few things, trust me, it's near impossible when you're constantly sleep deprived! Order this now and make your life a little bit easier.. you're going to need all the help you can get! Even the 4th \\"custom\\" timer has been really handy for us. We're using it to keep track of my pain medication that my wife needs to take every 3 hours for her stitches. My wife and I both LOVE this product and love its simplicity. The night light feature has been very useful too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing special, but can be useful","review":"We bought this product a month after my daughter was born. We use it more now at 5 months then we did at 1. It has been helpful in night feedings. When should I feed and when should I just rock her back to sleep. At 4:30am i'm not sure when I last finished feeding her. But with this product I just look at the timer. It has also been helpful in keeping track of her sleeping habits without having to think about what exact time I put her down vs. when she woke up. I know she sleeps for 1 1/2 hours to 2 1/2 hours between feedings. With this, it's easy.Is it necessary...No. But for a sleep deprived 1st time mom, it has been helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS SO AWESOME","review":"It helps so much during the day!

It is so easy to forget which side was last.I recommend this for any mom!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for twins!","review":"Perfect for parents of twins. We use ours religiously as we would be lost without it. It really helps put order to the chaous in the early days. Knowing the last time a baby was fed or when they were changed helps you resolve the crying in short order. We have one for each child as they don't stick to a schedule just yet. Also, for new parents, you cannot imagine how little sleep you will get in the early days and this product really helps you remember the important things. It is simple, but it works. We will be recommending this to all our friends with new borns... especially those with multiples!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very useful !!!

The concept behind the product is great, how long has it been since I last fed my child? They accomplish this half way. The reason I say this is because it does not have any memory options. So basically you get short term reminders, meaning, it will tell you the time since the very last time you changed a diaper.This product would be very useful if it could track a few days worth of activities, then you could identify patterns and even have that information available to discuss with dr. if needed. In order to achieve this, you still have to write times down, so, just skip this, save your money and simply use paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful!","review":"I liked this a lot. I found it to be most useful in the first month, but not afterwards. Now, I use it only for the light feature. I clip it to the diaper station in the baby's room, and can unclip it quickly and put the light one, (which acts like a flashlight!) to go & check on the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this timer!","review":"I purchased this timer a week after my baby was born. It took a little bit of time to learn all the functions (about 10 min) but after that I could program this in my sleep deprived state. I exclusively breast feed and used the feeding timer and misc timer to time feedings on each side. Being a month in to new motherhood, I don't care as much since my baby is packing on the pounds. I mainly use the timer for feedings and changings. I'm sure I'll later use it for naps as well as \\"time outs\\". The only thing I don't like is the clock keeps getting changed by buttons being hit. I also wish the back light would light up when you hit a button even when the buttons are \\"locked\\". All in all, I would highly recommend to any new parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nana LOVES the ItzBeen!","review":"As the nana who does the babysitting, I absolutely love this item!When baby is dropped off the first thing I grab is the Itzbeen to see how long it's been since the baby ate, pooped, or had it's meds!Same goes when mom picks baby up, I don't have to make that second call to tell mom that baby didn't poop (making sure baby not constipated) all day or I have already given the baby it's latest dose of medication!Used it a lot when first born for feeding etc, but now that baby is old it's still useful.I print out labels and stick on it to keep track of different things. Like now baby has ear infection and on antibiotic, tylenol etc. I just stuck different labels on the Itzbeen and set the timers. I keep it sitting on my end table and when I see it flashing I know it's time for meds again!Wonderful Item. One of those things you don't know you need until you have it!A Must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me survive the first 2 months","review":"I have the this attached to me, or on my night stand all the time. I would say it's the most used baby item I have right now. I remember with the first child all the math I had to do in my head to calculate how long she fed, which side she last fed from, how long it was in between feedings, when was that last diaper change? When I saw this while pregnant with #2 I got it right away.I even used it before my son was born. I used it while potty training my daughter, and I used it to time my contractions.Now that I am trying to get my son on a sleeping schedule this is making it useful to help me figure out his naps and how long he is sleeping through the night.This helped me get past the \\"new baby brain\\" forgetfulness and feel like I had some sense of control over feedings and diaper changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST have for all parents","review":"This timer is one of the most useful things I got since I had my first child, it makes keeping track of everything so much easier.

I recommend this product to any new parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it but poorly built","review":"Fantastic idea with some useful functions, especially when nursing.

Several in fact if you have an iphone/ipad/iwhatever.

During the first few weeks with my newborn son it was hard for me to remember when I last fed or changed him as one event seemed to blur into another! It has been great in determining my son's eating patterns after the first month when we got into more of a routine and the nightlight is so helpful for night time nursing! It is not perfect though and it would be more useful if it would keep a daily record of each feeding, diaper change, etc for tracking. Overall, a cool tool for moms but not something you can't live without.Makes a fun baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live with it!","review":"When our little girl was first born I couldn't have lived without this! In the middle of the night all I had to do was re-set the button rather then trying to remember the last time I fed her and it helps you keep track of which side you nursed on last. I am still using it and my little girl is over 4-months old now. It's small and compact and I take it everywhere with me.One more thing I used it to keep track of when she was first born was when I was taking 2 different pain medications every so many hours since I had a c-section. The less I needed to keep track of with as little sleep as you get the 1st month the better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I've had this timer for a couple of days and it's helped out a lot so far. I really like how simple it is to use and that an alarm will go off if your baby is in a diaper for too long (or if you forgot to reset the timer). It has a nightlight feature and a lighted LED display for nighttime use. Definitely a great buy for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't live without it those first few weeks","review":"I think this is a must have for new moms! I always had it within arms reach those first few weeks; so nice for timing feeding and for knowing when I could take my pain medication. Once my baby was old enough I started feeding him on demand, so I didn't really need this anymore, although I do now use it to time how long he sleeps at night. I like that you can press a button for backlight, but sometimes I have to press the button several times before it works (that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but it's only $20, so it's well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Display didn't work","review":"This might have been a useful baby care item if the display worked. We received this as a gift from our registry. When we arrived home with baby we hadn't set up the Itzbeen yet because the baby came surprisingly early. We took the timer from the package, inserted new batteries, and the entire right side of the display was cut off. The timer would keep track of hours but not minutes. We called the manufacturer who returned our call a week later. In the meantime we contacted Amazon to return the item. Amazon sent a replacement, which arrived a couple weeks later. The replacement works, but we didn't have the timer to use in those critical first weeks when you really need to keep track of this information and are too tired to do so. Use a clock, a pen, and paper - cheaper and more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Thought this should and could do more. It just keeps track of how long it's been. So it really is just 4 timers in one without alarms for each. For what it does, it should sell for $10! Wish it had memory to keep track daily. I still had to write down everything anyway since the doctor always wanted to know daily totals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely worthless","review":"I was given the timer by a friend in celebration of baby #5. I don't understand what anyone would need it for. When a baby cries, you feed it, if it smells change it and they will sleep when they're tired. I have never with any of my children had to write down what I did and when I did it, because frankly it didn't matter. Baby #4 was on a biliblanket for 2 weeks and had to be fed about every 2 hours, so that's what I did, not that hard to look at a clock and figure out about 2 hours. With multiples I could see how it could be more useful, but otherwise just not necessary. It's just one more way for companies to step in-between the mother/child relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!","review":"This is a great idea, but the quality of this item is so poor that I was never able to use mine. The first one I got when my youngest child was 4 weeks old. It faded out, even with brand new batteries within the first 12 hours. I then shipped it back to recieve a replacement. I recieved my replacement by the time my son was 2 months old. It only turned on once, then it was a goner AGAIN. I returned it once again, hoping that this time I would get one that actually worked. No such luck. By this time my son was 3.5 months old, and I really didnt' even need it anymore. But, even if I did, it only lasted about 30 seconds before this crap died on me again. I just threw it out, in hopes of forgetting I ever wasted any of my time with this piece of crap. DON\\"T BUY THIS!!!! It is a complete waste of your time, get sleep instead, you will need it with your new bundle of joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Itzbeen Returned!!

Exept I used new batteries.and the same with the second one I bought. Actually the second one was worse. At first you only saw parital numbers then they just faded completely!!! I don't know maybe it was just sheer luck or maybe it was a bad batch. I hope that this item is not just poor quality manufacturing. Im a new mother and am still trying to get used to the hectic schedule. However, I am going to try and get it somewhere else.

I wish I'd gotten it sooner...the first week at home with my baby girl was hell and having to track everything by writing it down in a notebook was a bit tiresome. I have to say, though, it would be nice if the Itzbeen (gotta love the name) could tell you how many diaper changes that day and how far apart the feedings were, etc. Still, this makes an excellent gift for any new mother/father parents and the price is just right! Stunned that it's not available at Babies-R-Us or other such stores.I give it 4-Stars because 4.5 is not available. I take off the 1/2 point for lack of activity history data storage capability. Will that be in the Itzbeen II??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this for a shower gift after having a child of my own and thinking that this product could have saved me some wondering during blurry-eyed nights. Of course months after the shower after the baby arrives, the couple removes the packaging and throws it away before turning it on- the display is broken. It has a few bars showing and the functions don't work. How embarrassing to spend money on a shower gift only to have it broken!!

Your doctor will laugh at you if you bring in this information.#3 - People will make fun of you. Remember, if you really want accurate information, you have to take it with you everywhere you go and press a button with every poop.#4 - My husband found an iPhone app that does the same thing for 1.99, so if you REALLY think you need this (which you don't), save some money and just get the app. You have your iPhone with you everywhere anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality not good","review":"1. every week need change battery.2.

We kept forgetting to set the timer, and couldn't agree when to push the sleep one (do we time from the beginning of when the naps start to the end of the nap, or from nap to nap, or use it to tell how long he'd been awake?). The first couple weeks with a new baby are such a blur anyways, while this helped us be aware of what we needed to be doing, I don't think I'd spend the money again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver","review":"For one that doesnt keep track of time too well when not on a structured work schedule, this gadget is wonderful. I'm a first time mom and the first couple of weeks I wasn't sure how often babe was eating, sleeping, or being changed etc. This timer kept me abreast of it. The vacant button also allowed me to keep track of how often I took my meds. Now I use that button for how often I express milk. I enjoy this I've had to change the batteries once since about 7 weeks ago.I also enjoy the 5 second blue light that can be pressed in the dark during night feedings or the long standing standard light that can be pressed and times out after 5-10 minutes. This is a wonder. I would buy it for a shower gift for any first time parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Sleeplees Nights or any other time","review":"The timer is simple, hassle-free, and extremely helpful for what it is designed to do. One push of a button and the timer starts over. The indiglo backlighting is helpful for late-night viewing, the flashlight provides decent light without being too bright or concentrated, and my wife found the basic left/right tracker for breastfeeding useful. We have used the timer most for keeping track of our baby's feeding schedule. Sleeping and feeding tend to run together in the early days, and diaper timing becomes less important after the first week or ten days. I admit that having a counter along with the timers would be nice, but I am not sure if that could be added without depriving the device of its simplicity. Overall, it is hands-down one of the best baby products we purchased before the (early) arrival of our son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived defective","review":"It arrived defective.

I thought that it would be so helpful and that it would also come in handy while in labor to time the contractions. I was wrong. It is by far the least used baby item we have and it was totally not worth the money we spent on it. It is not user friendly at all. Once you start one of the timers, it's impossible to turn it off. You just have to keep resetting it. I found it much easier to just write down the feeding and poop/pee diapers in a notebook than using this worthless piece of techno-junk.I completely regret buying it and even if it is something that other parents have actually found useful, it's still not worth the money because it's poorly made for the price.

I should have sent it back but I have used it so kept it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big helper","review":"this product is great. me and my husband are first time parents and when we take turns at night its easier just to see what time the baby ate instead of waking my husband just to ask him. It also helps when your tired and have a lot on your mind and forget to look at the time when you feed the baby instead you just push the button. This item could be improved by keeping track of how much he ate at what time that would make a great difference but other then that this product is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver!","review":"This is the most ingenious invention of all time-for me. Buy this or register for it if you have more than one child. Also makes a great shower gift. Could only be improved if images were engraved into buttons. My images are worn off and I have only been using for 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clip broke while trying to install batteries","review":"I was very excited to get my Itzbeen timer up and running and just put the batteries in. The clip on the back just snapped off as it doesn't really seem to allow enough room to get the three AAA batteries in. I don't know how much I would have actually used a belt clip but I know it would have been helpful in the diaper bag or my purse- to make it easier to find. A little dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for ITZBEEN!","review":"My mono-mono twin girls came home at 3lbs on Christmas Eve. Our heads were spinning and I was EXHAUSTED. My brother-in-law brought this home for us and it really helped me keep track of the basics. I label each device with their names and you simply press a button and it keeps time for you. It has a button for the following: diaper, feeding,sleeping, a clock and other helpful features. It has a small \\"night light\\" and lighted display. I think ppl should use it for what it was made for to indicate how long its been since... Nice gift for a parent with multiples. It was easier just to use the Itsbeen than trying to write stuff down in the dark at 2am when your brain seems full of marshmellows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby monitor","review":"I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR A BABY SHOWER FOR FIRST TIME PARENTS. THEY LIKED IT. HAD NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE IT BEFORE. IT ARRIVED IN PLENTY OF TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really needed","review":"We got this timer as a gift and it just simply isn't needed. At least not for us. We never really used this other than to use the light on it as a flashlight to check on our son as a newborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"It remembers so you don't have to","review":"I bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers. With the touch of one button, I can keep track of how long it has been since I fed my baby. I don't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone. The first unit I was sent was defective and I received terrific customer service when I contacted the company. I am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well. Maybe a future model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, wont last a year.","review":"Poorly made product! Worked fine for the first 4 months and then started to have problems. First, the alarm started to fail. Now, I cant even adjust the time to get it right.By the way, this was my 2nd itzbeen in 5 months. The first one just did not display anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you are not ASLEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Hi I bought this product and it is great if you are not asleep as long as you are awake you can here it but if you have a newborn and you need to wake up to feed them this will not help at all it is not loud enough and you will miss feeding your baby. Other than that it is a great product to keep you on tract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy and does exactly what it claims","review":"We received the Itzbeen from a friend who had a baby just before we did, and it's been beyond invaluable. I agree that it would be *nice* to have additional features like keeping track of ounces (mostly for formula fed babies) and whether or not a diaper was wet or messy, but we found that after our 2-week appointment our doctor said we didn't need to keep an exact count of oz or messy diapers (as long as it's at least one per day). However, I think those features would bump this device into a higher category, like a baby PDA. I gave it 5 stars because it does exactly what it claims to do. It's so handy for trading off shifts between mom and dad (as well as other caretakers), and as new parents we haven't quite gotten the hang of distinguishing his different cries, so it takes most of the guesswork out of soothing him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes newborns easy!","review":"The Itzbeen is so simple to use and makes having a new baby in the house much easier. It helps decode the cries related to diaper changes, feeding and naps. The little flashlight on top is much handier than one would initially think."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"i thought it would be a great thing to have, i think it's useless. you need to change the diaper as needed not in certain amount of hours, especially poopy ones. also it's better to feed on demand. so this thing is left unused.plus mine just didn't work - the numbers were shown partially, so i could never figure out what number it was. it faded really quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two little complaints","review":"First I'd like to say I really do love my timer and I don't know what I would do without it. It makes handing baby off to grandma or daddy SO much easier because I don't have to guess on what time this or that happened last. My only two complaints are that A) I hate where the batteries go. Its the MOST inconvient spot. B) that its not chargeable. I really wish I could plug it in at night and not have to worry about batteries. Other than that I reccomend it to EVERYONE and LOVE LOVE LOVE it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gadget For This New Mom","review":"The Itzbeen Baby Care Timer is a revolutionary product for those of us bleary-eyed, exhausted new parents. This timer allows you to track how long it has been since the last diaper change, feeding or nap. This is important for me since time seems to blur between feedings. I'm always thinking, \\"didn't I just feed you 30 minutes ago?\\" Well not with this little device.My only quibble is that the sleep button is not as helpful since there is no way to pause the sleep timer when the baby wakes up. This means that during the day, it looks like the baby has been sleeping for 15 hours. What would have been more helpful would have been to be able to pause the timer upon waking and then to restart the timer at the next nap.However, that notwithstanding, what a big help this Itzbeen has been."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent item for those new parents","review":"i would have to say this is an essential item for brand new parents. no more trying to remember when the last time baby did whatever. also the little night light on it is very useful for peeking in on baby when they are sleeping.a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps the sleep deprived parent keep track...","review":"We use two of these for our twins. Being so sleep deprived we were tending to forget when the last feeding was and possibly leading to overfeeding as a result. That doesn't happen now. Also it helps if you're working in shifts with your spouse. You can simply hand off the timer and it instantly communicates how long it's been between feedings, diapers, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST Quality Product EVER!","review":"I bought this item knowing we would need to keep track of our babies feedings and diaper changes for the doctor. This thing did not work out of the box! Half of the LCD segments did not work, and you could not set the current time, or turn on or set any timers. Very poor manufacturing and quality. If they improved the product it would be worth it, but don't waste your money! If it was possible, I would rate this item as a ZERO!!! Fortunately Amazon has 100% money back guarantee, including returning shipping costs. Thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last 2 months","review":"I wish I would have read some of the negative reviews before buying this simply on the positive ones. This poorly built little device worked fine for almost 2 months before it just died. The display just went blank. Of course, my first thought was that the batteries were dead. After replacing them with new batteries, the display showed a bunch of partial digits, then faded away. If I paid 5 dollars, I probably wouldn't care as much. Before buying this, READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, not just the positive ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned out to be useless","review":"My baby ended up being her own baby care timer. I thought I was all prepared before she was born by having this thing to help out, but it was more of a pain to try to use. I was too busy trying to get on with just taking care of her to even use it for more than a week. And the settings kept resetting themselves anyway, which is SO FRUSTRATING on 2 hours sleep!! It was easier for us to just use pen and paper to write times down, no buttons to fiddle with, no wrong times."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"Bought this at Babies R us and like many other reviews I just read the display doesn't function properly and I can't set the clock. I've tried changing the batteries and that's not it. I will be returning it to the store. Not sure if I'll try a second, but based on the reviews, if I do I won't leave the parking lot until I've tested it. Update 1/27 - I tried another one, again at Babies R us and that one had the same problem - the display doesn't work. It's a good concept, but I would not recommend it unless you're getting it for yourself and have the patience to go thru many until you find one that does work and then keep your fingers crossed that it lasts while you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept. Can't compete w/ Total Baby.","review":"I bought this product when my twins were first born and it was helpful. It takes some of the hassle out of keeping track. HOWEVER, it has many limitations. It's bulky, takes batteries, and I was disappointed by the lack of other tracking options. There were times that I'd find myself jotting down other notes w pen and paper because Itzbeen couldn't keep track of everything that I needed it to. A friend recommended that I download an app called \\"Total Baby\\" on my Ipod ($4.99). With it I can track feeding, sleeping, diapers, baths, milestones, growth charts, medication, doctor visits, etc. I mean EVERYTHING! I can even write additional notes if I need to. I can even track multiple children with one device. If you have an Ipod/Iphone GET THIS APP BEFORE YOU SPEND A DIME ON THIS PRODUCT. It is a must have and blows the Itzbeen out of the water. I wanted to share because I wish I would have heard about the app before I spent money on Itzbeen. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better options out there","review":"I thought this was useful until I discovered the BabyConnect app for iphone. That is much more versatile and lets me keep track of only one device (my phone)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Need","review":"Great concept, but I have not used this once because I find that my smart phone app is easier to use and has more features. If you have a smart phone, I highly recommend skipping this product and just using your phone (which you are going to have on you at all times anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for new sleep-deprived parents sharing duty","review":"Some of the reviews here made us nervous about buying the product, but overall, we've found it extremely useful for coordinating care for our newborn. We have not experienced the quality issues after using it for 5 weeks. I also keep a paper log of the items this product tracks, but since my husband can remember to push a button, but not to write a diaper change or nap in the log, this makes it much easier to coordinate care. It's especially helpful late at night, when I'm waking up after just a few hours of sleep, to determine if I need to nurse him. It includes a back lite as well as a small flashlight, which is great when you need it but don't want to wake everyone up with the overhead lights. One feature that would make this better is a counter, to track how many times a timer has been reset in a 24 hour period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Mommy","review":"I absolutely love the Itzbeen!!! I bought one while I was pregnant with my son, and I found it to be so helpful that I got one for my sister when her son was born. It is amazing how quickly you can lose track of time when taking care of a newborn, and this took the guessing out of how long 'itzbeen' since baby has been changed, fed, and napped. I used the extra * button to keep track of how long it had been since I pumped. I would put this on my top ten list of must have's for new moms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful!","review":"After several feedings, diaper changes, baby sleeps and poos/pees, It is hard to track when was the last time?This product is very intuitive and easy to use. Don't think, just buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty useful","review":"If you are a bit absent minded like I am and who isn't when you have a baby, this is a good tool. I did not like keeping a journal with my first child and did not want to start recording times with this one either. This is a quick reference and holds information for so many things that I seriously would not keep track of otherwise. This is a good gift for new moms too."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!!!","review":"This item is a must have. It takes the guesswork out of feedings and napping. The alarm feature is very handy also. Would definitely recommend it to anyone that is having a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This product is great. I got one for my sister-in-law for her first baby and she LOVES it! The features are exactly what new parents need to help them keep track of things, especially when they are trying to get through those first few weeks on little or no sleep. I would particularly recommend it for breast-feeding mothers. I'm jealous that I didn't have one for my 2 kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is amazing!","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers! This is definitely a WONDERFUL device. One time I left it at my in-laws house and was lost without it. They should issue these at the hospital when you give birth. I have dropped it lots of times and it never broke - thank goodness. But one time the batteries popped out and I lost all my times!I will be giving this a part of a shower gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never used it... just get an app on your phone","review":"We absolutely NEVER used this once. I would seriously recommend just getting an app on your phone that does all this and more. This may be great for folks who don't have smart phones, or whose spouses take equal amount of watch time with little one, but I am more with our daughter than my husband, so I just use the app on my phone which will track everything over time and show trends, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This thing is pocket size with a clip in the back just in case you want to carry it around.

Clipped it onto metal tray at hospital and clip broke. Still works well just realize that the belt clip is pretty flimsy. That said, this works wonders to help you keep track of time and get baby into a routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to break the belt clip plastic","review":"Haven't had a chance to use it with our babies yet because they haven't arrived yet. But within a few minutes of getting the product the clip on mechanism is already broken. The plastic that holds the metal clip in place is so flimsy it broke almost instantly. I barely put any pressure on it to open it and it snapped. I thought about returning it but doubted I would be using the clip anyway so I will just keep it as is. I will update my review once I have used the timer more. I gave it two stars due to the cheapness of that design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"Works great, handy, nice to have so many timers when you are juggling a baby. Easy to use and smaller than I thought which is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last long","review":"Would have loved it, but it's not rugged enough to survive being dropped, and let's face it... a sleep-deprived mom is going to drop it at least once. Was a great tool while it lasted. Now that it's stopped working it's just a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful & Nice little product","review":"My husband and I love gadgets so instantly we liked this product.Our son is now 2 weeks 2 days old. When we first brought him home, this was helpful until we got into a routine and for the need of tracking soiled/wet diapers and feedings. I was nursing so this helped remind us and helped keep track.I also keep a paper log because I want to keep everything recorded and have a history, so I don't use it as often as I did in the first week... but I still keep it around and use it from time to time.It will come in handy for when I need to give medications or something.On another note... Amazon's customer service is excellent. This item initially arrived with the clip broken and they sent me a replacement immediately the next day!! Because of their outstanding customer service (and great prices and shipping) I now turn to Amazon more and more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, too fragile","review":"I bought this timer for my newborn baby to record feedings/sleeping. I've used it for 1 week, but today it fell from my rocking chair to the floor and now the screen is completly cracked and the timers do not work. My chair seat is about 18 inches from the floor.It's a great idea, timing your feeding and sleeping, but buy a different brand or download an app on your phone. This product is cheaply made and not durable through standard usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Invention for a new mommy!","review":"As soon as I got home from the hospital, my husband and I have been using this. My son is now 6 months old, and I still use it. He is on a schedule, which is wonderful since I went back to work full time, and I pump at work for his milk intake. I need to know how much milk to send to whomever is watching him. When I was home, it would help me with how many minutes per breast.As for the battery, in the 6 months, I've changed it 2 times...I HIGHLY recommend this product. It made motherhood so much simpler..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not working after 5 hours","review":"Update:I returned this one too, because the spring broke, and after that a handle broke.. Dohh.. quality is terrible..No more Itzbeen baby care timers for me!UPDATEI got a replacement and sent my item back. Returns are really easy. That's great! New item is working great until now (3 days)!original (5 stars):I like the idea very much - it's really hard to remember everything in first weeks/months - how long ago he ate, how long he slept.. it's important information! So I bought it! And few hours after opening a package Itzbeen the * and last bottons are not working. So sad!! I'm still using it, but be aware that Itzbeen bought in Amazon might not work, so better buy it in Walmart or somewhere you can return it easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This thing was ok while it worked, but it was a novelty and not a convenience. For starters, it was a pain to keep carrying around. When you are a frazzled mom, it's just one more thing to remember and to keep track of. I didn't like clipping it to my clothes because it would either fall off or I'd accidentally bump it and reset a timer. Then, during a middle-of-the-night feeding, I went to drop a bottle in some warm water to warm it up and forgot which hand had the bottle and which one had the timer. That was the end of the timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only used it for a week-not useful at all. Save your money and buy an app instead!","review":"I had high hope for this gadget when I registered it on Amazon. After giving birth to my baby, I found this thing does not do all the things I need it to. I had to use it in addition to a baby tracker. Finally I found an app on my iphone called log4baby, it costs nothing and does everything this time does and a lot more! Don't waste your money on this any more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, but would pay more for a few added options","review":"For the price, this is a great item for first time moms. An easy-to-use \\"timer\\" quickly shows you when you've last nursed, changed a diaper, napped, etc. Basically, it's a glorified set of four stop-watches, but a great item nonetheless. I would pay extra for a few additional features such as the ability to transfer data (nap times, feeding times, etc.) to a computer via a USB. It would also be nice to have a magnet on the back to stick on a fridge or metal door. Still a great product that I used often during the first few months of my sons life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute ideal but waste of money","review":"This was a cute ideal but in the end I felt it was a total waist of money. It was taking more time for my wife to set it then actually being happy using it. The product is so much smaller than it looks in the photos and that makes the numbers so small and the buttons too. The sound is so quiet that it wouldn't wake her to know it was time or she was in another room and I would come hom and it has been ringing for a couple hours because she didn't hear it. It is a gimmick and not a necessity or even a help like we believed it might be when we ordered it. Save the money and buy some more diapers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your brain as a new parent","review":"OK, I know this seems like an idiot gift, but if you're a new parent it's hard to remember ANYTHING with the lack of sleep going on. This thing pretty much ruled our lives the first few months. It really helps you keep your baby on a regular schedule (good for babe and you)and helps you figure out what's wrong if the baby's upset since you can just check the time to see when he last ate, slept, or was changed. And if you're nursing, good luck trying to remember which side you started nursing with last (i never could) so this was GREAT.The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because it would be awesome if they made a feature to track the times that you could hookup to your computer to look at trends, etc... then again, who has time to track trends with a newborn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you have iphone/ipod-touch: Sleepyhead / tv-apathy does it all BETTER","review":"What I like least about the device is that it only knows when something happened the LAST time. It does not help you answer the pediatrician questions how often the diapers are full, or how often baby eats, or how long baby sleeps in total. If you have an iphone or ipod touch, buy the applet sleepyhead from tv-apathy. It tracks everything, is easy to use, gives nice overviews, provides useful history, and is not another piece of techtoy that will only be useful for a short time ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an essential","review":"I thought this would be incredibly helpful once our baby was born, but ended up using the Total Baby app on my iphone instead. The app is much more user friendly with an intuitive interface. In contrast, I had to read the manual for the itzbeen twice and still couldn't make sense of it. I thought the nightlight would come in handy, but it is a glaring LED light that was disruptive both to our baby and my sleeping husband. There is a blue background light that's much more innocuous, but it only stays on for a few seconds at a time. Overall, I found this to be a non-essential item. Now I just use it as a clock next to the glider where I breastfeed. HIGHLY recommend the Total Baby app if you have an iphone, ipad or itouch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know how I would have managed without it","review":"How did mothers raise babies without an Itzbeen timer? I am totally glued to mine 24-7. When the baby's crying and I can't figure out why, the first thing I look at is the timer. How long has it been since she ate? How long has she been sleeping for? When did I change her diaper last? A perfect baby shower gift imo."},{"rating":"2","title":"The back of the click broke to fast,still good for timer:)","review":"I like i recommended ease to used.but do not count on this 100% babies need more care and attention this is only if you tire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive nightlight!","review":"I used this timer for the first few days with my newborn before realizing it doesn't keep track of the things you really need - if you are feeding your baby on demand, then you really should be keeping track of how many feeds and how many diapers, not the interval. I downloaded an app for my iphone for $4.99 which does all this and more, which if I had known earlier would have saved me some $$. I now use this as a nightlight because I have no other use for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool!!!","review":"I bought this timer for my wife. We have a 2 month old son.

It has really helped us keep him on a schedule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, we love it!","review":"In a few words, this is a great product, very helpful for new parents like ourselves. Pretty much everything you need to control your newborn routine is there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Greatest","review":"We did use this for the first couple of weeks until we got tired of replacing batteries every day. It goes through batteries WAY, WAY too fast. It does track useful things but, as other reviewers have mentioned, it only tracks when something happened the LAST time. It does not help you answer the pediatrician questions (how many times a day baby poops & pees, how often baby eats, how long baby sleeps). Either get an app for your phone OR do what we did and put a big white board in a central location in your home, divide into columns, and just make tally marks. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but very handy","review":"It's not perfect, it can't do all the things an app would do but it's not meant to be complex and it's very handy.I've been using this everyday for 5 weeks. When baby is fussing, I check how long it's been since feeding or diaper change. I use it throughout the day but it's especially helpful at night and when someone else is watching baby (no need to ask me when last diaper change or feeding was).The nightlight feature is handy too because it shuts off on it's own.The only improvement to this simple gadget would be to add a function that keeps track of how many total feedings in a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"lcd screen no longer works","review":"i used this for my first child and when it came time to use it again 18 months later only a portion of each number was working making it useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - Several Design Flaws","review":"I was excited to receive my Itzbeen baby care timer at my baby shower. I had read the reviews and was convinced it would be very useful. Well, it is about as useful as 4 stopwatches. It does not carry any memory for previous entries so it does not replace a log like it says in the descripton. Also, my Itzbeen would lose all data once a day or so. I returned it to Amazon and am waiting for my refund for a defective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the first 8 weeks of our sons life this was a necessity","review":"We went to Santa Cruz CA to adopt a baby a few years ago. He was in the NICU and was detoxing from Methadone. The doctors were using Morphine Sulphate orally every 3 hours. The timer on this was beyond useful since we used it to wake up for the midnight, 3 am and 6 am doses. Also it helped to remind us during the day but we were on high alert since he was the only baby we've adopted. After 8 weeks he was detoxed and we used it infrequently but when we needed it was a Godsend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have when sleep deprived!","review":"This is the best product for moms and dads to keep track of their baby's schedule! In the newborn stage you can set a timer to wake you up every 3-4 hours to nurse your baby. The light on the Itzbeen is the perfect amount of light to use when waking in the middle of the night...not too bright. I honestly have used this thing every single day since my daughter was born and can't live without it. Remembering when I fed my baby last when sleep deprived isn't as easy as you'd think. Also nice to have a clock and which side you last nursed on. Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Called and ITzBeen for a reason","review":"I have read some of the negative reviews and here's what I have to say:1. I purchased this item on February 25, 2008. The batteries last FOREVER. If you use the light a lot I am sure that it will drain the batteries faster.2. My 2nd child was about a year before she slept all night. Being sleep deprived I dropped this more times than I care to mention. Apparently I have a habit of setting it on my lap and then standing up... Still works perfectly.3. It's called an Itzbeen (that translates to It's Been). As in this will tell you how long \\"It's Been\\". If you need to track feeding habits, diaper changes, etc it is very handy because you can track it 20 minutes later when you get to it in a notebook. Of course it doesn't track much more. It's called and Itzbeen, the name explains what it does...Bottom line, I love this product! I still have the one I purchased in February of 2008 and it is in perfect working order, all ready to use for the next baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifesaver while it lasted","review":"Greatest invention ever! It helps me and my husband especially to stay on track with feeding and diaper changes! Great buy!!!!Unfortunately after not even 4 weeks the device started to have issues. First one button stopped working and then one after another to the point where the device was no longer functional and programmable . We changed the batteries twice, but nothing helped! So it was great while it lasted! I now just use the timer on my phone. TIP: If you have an iPhone just download a free app which works just as well and seems to be more convenient!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says it does","review":"I bought this product for our first child to my wife and keep up with our babies schedule. The product does exactly what it claims to do and also is simple to use. I don't really have any negative comments for the product, only that we ended up not really using it that much. After a few days you figure out the routine and we didn't really need a reminder. Also they have the same type of device for the iPhone which might be more appropriate for some people (cheaper)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It can be a lot better","review":"The product works great as intended. It keeps track of feeding time and stuff. However, we stop using it after about a month. We have our twin babies back and forth between their bedroom and living room. It's too much of a hassle to go find it and reset the timer. Also, it cannot keep track of how much they ate and how many times they pee or poop. We end up making a chart on a wall and enter it by hand. It would be nice if Itzbeen can do all of the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame! I seriously never needed this...","review":"My advice is to wait a few days before purchasing this item, to see if you really need it.The quality of the product is just fine, but the functionality is pointless. I thought (prior to having my baby) that I would need reminding of how long it had been since he was changed, fed, put down for a nap, etc...which turned out to be completely not true. I never wonder if enough time had passed since feeding or changing or napping--it doesn't matter how much time has passed when your baby lets you know he is wet or hungry or sleepy! Like many extraneous baby items that I purchased because I was so excited about my impending arrival, this item got zero usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but...","review":"After reading reviews and getting an idea of what this thing does, I decided this would have to be my first baby gadget. I loved the idea behind it and everybody that used it loved it to. I purchased mine from babies-r-us. When i got it home and started to play with it the display went out before I could even get the time set. As you can imagine I was very disappointed. I returned the bad one and exchanged it for a new one. This time it was bad as soon as I turned it on. Most of the display worked on this one but about 10% of the characters would not show up. I even tried changing batteries several times in hopes that that would fix the problem. unfortunately it did not. The display seems to be a major problem. This time I just got my money back. So if you do decide to buy this thing I hope you have better luck than I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for new moms and dads!","review":"We registered for this product but then removed it from our registry as we thought it probably wasn't totally necessary and a little gimmicky. After a few days home from the hospital we promptly ordered this product! We tried writing down last feeding times and such but when you're a walking zombie writing down the times didn't always happen and then even if it did figuring out how long it had been/math on no sleep is not easy! So do yourself a favor and start out with this product! The only thing I wish it did was count feedings/diapers in a 24 hour period as that is one of the things they tell you to count in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Keeping track when you're sleep deprived","review":"We didn't purchase this until my baby was about 4 weeks old. Now she's 6 weeks and I wonder how we survived the first month without it! I love how easy it is just to push the button when something has been done. No more trying to remember, when did she eat last? How long has she been asleep? Etc. It makes it easy to see her sleep patterns as well. We started giving her medicine for reflux 3 times a day last week and I love that I can use the fourth timer to keep track of it. When you are running on 2 hours of sleep you'll be happy you have this!The only thing I might add is a way to keep track of how many ounces she ate last... but that may just further complicate the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have, ESPECIALLY 4 1st time parents!!","review":"i read the negative reviews on this item & really dont understand them. this is a great product! we use it mainly to see how long itzbeen since his last feeding & the last button u can use 4 watever. we really dont need the nap button or the diaper change because u will just no wen 2 change ur kid. this is y i didnt give this item a five. they could also add a lil more to it, but it is still a genius idea & works very well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Photo deception still a big item in a lil'package","review":"The photo leads you to believe this is something that you place on your diaper table or inside your nursery. However the item is actually quite small and very portable! With a clip you can attach it to a diaper bag, pants pocket, purse, just about anything that will let you slide something over. Which means you can take your timer with you anywhere! Each timer can have an alarm set for it, so once you notice about how often your baby eats, poops, and sleeps you can set the alarm so that you know just about when something is coming up. The nifty part of this is that the alarm can be a sound or silent, meaning the buttons flash when set to silent, or the device chirps.A great product for trying to keep track of the times you've done what when you know you can't always count on your math at 2:30am or even 4 pm as you've been up and down for three days. So that you get accurate stats on what your baby is doing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of Junk","review":"It never worked correctly for my daughter & son in law.

Starting from the first day in the hospital I was able to learn our baby's routine! My baby is now four weeks old and I still walk around with the itzbeen. I've learned that she is on a three hour schedule. So when I've \\"zeroed\\" all the buttons I can go out for errands with her and have confidence that she will be set. I attach it to her crib at night and use it as a nightlight. It is the perfect brightness. I can see everything but it isn't enough to disturb her if she isn't really awake yet. The slide button for nursing is a life saver in the middle of the night when I can barely remember my name let alone the last side I nursed on. I'll be buying this for all my pregnant friends in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"I was suggested the Itzbeen by a friend and initially thought I could just use a watch to keep track of his eating and sleeping primarily. I realized quickly after becoming fatigued that I wasn't able to remember what happened when...things were blurring together. The Itzbeen has been a great help, especially when you are switching care providers during the day--everyone is able to see when he should eat and sleep without having to be familiar with his cues. The only thing I don't like is sometimes I will reset one of the buttons when he starts a feed or nap and it doesn't go as planned, so I wish I could set it back to what it had been on instead of it starting over. Very helpful little tool! I'll be getting one of these for all my pregnant friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No necesitamos esto!","review":"Lo us�� 1 semana y despues me olvide que exist��a.

Last week when we were visiting her, she had this clipped to her waistband and she just raved about the timer! She mainly uses it to time the baby's feedings at the moment, loves the L/R breastfeeding switch, and was very surprised at how bright the light on it is for such a tiny unit - a very helpful feature for those nighttime feedings! She just couldn't live without it.Best Gift Ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Wife Can't Live Without it","review":"My wife and I love this, it is very useful to help keep track of things. The different timers are great for remember when he last ate, when he was last changed, medicene and other things. My only complaint is that it's a bit larger then I like but my wife likes the size. The Itzbeen is very very very useful for anybody who looses track of time easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best baby gadget I received","review":"I added this item to my baby registry on a whim, not really expecting to get it or really need it. I could not have been more wrong. It has become the most used item I received, besides clothes! My husband and I use it all day, every day. It is very easy to pass our baby off to each other and know exactly when the baby last ate, had a diaper change, and how long he slept. I even bring it with us when we visit our friends so we can keep our little one closer to his routine at home. I highly recommend adding it to your registry or going out and purchasing one if you don't get it as gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply works","review":"I was a bit reluctant about buying this product. After all, a quick look around had shown multiple smartphone apps that did pretty much the same, with more features and a fraction of the cost.But:PROS1.

Unlike an app on a smartphone, you can easily \\"share\\" it.My wife and I take turns taking care of the baby. whenever we pass one another the baby, the timer goes along;CONS:Nothing significant. I've seen apps around that keep track of the duration of each operation, along with a log. Frankly, I do not find those features that useful right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary with an app on my phone","review":"I thought I would use this and just had to have it.

The tiime between diaper changes, wet and dirty, breastfeeding, then you may want to know how long the baby is sleeping, so this contraption seems cool. The internal light (blue) broke after a month, and by time the baby is a month old... these times are irrelevant. I still use the night light though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated & Useless","review":"ABSOLUTELY USELESS. This is what the item does: It tracks the time for last diaper change, last nap, and last time the baby was fed.These are absolutely useless because diaper changes need not be timed, it needs to be changed as often as needed anyways to prevent diaper rash; naps need not be timed - babies need naps most of the time anyways.And it only records the last time the baby was fed (which is probably the one single helpful thing this item does), BUT there is no way to track the MORE important stuff: how much the baby was fed, and how many has he taken so far for the day.I still ended up using pen and paper to communicate with the other people who help care for the baby.I hope the manufacturer can come up with a more useful item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase an App instead","review":"I got this and used it for 2 months before discovering the iPhone app \\"Baby Connect\\" which does the same thing plus TONS of extra features.This app is $4.99 but it's worth way more! It tracks daily information about your baby: feeding (bottle, nursing, solid, pumping), diapers, sleep, mood, activities, milestones, health, medicines, vaccines, photos, and more. Several authorized users can be specified for each baby: parents, family, nannies, daycare staff, sitters, au pairs. Entries are immediately securely synchronized on each user account.

Last night I told him he should develop an app as a nursing log, and tonight I realize that actually there are a few. I just downloaded a free one that works on my iphone/ipad and does exactly what the itzbeen does but it does keeps a record, lets me imput whar breast or (if) bottle was used, what kind of diaper was changed and keeps a log of sleeping times.

After the flimsy cords frayed near the jack after a few months of light use, I sent it in for a warranty replacement. The replacement arrived and died after only two uses. I think that it would be good business for Monster to offer cash refunds to all who purchased this product and experienced one or more failures. This would go a long way towards restoring their brand image . . . I have completely avoided Monster ever since when purchasing cables.

There was just too much static and fussing with the modulator, so I found out about the cassette adapter. This adapter worked great, the sound was perfect. Only for about 5 months, then the sound started cutting out. I then looked at the wire, and there was a fray in the wire right where the adapter connects to the ipod. Now, I believe the thing is discontinued anyway, because it's not on Monster's website. Very disappointing.

I ride a 96 Nissan Altima and at first it seemed okay. But within seconds the quality mimicked that of a beat up old record. So I tried it again and again assuming my tape deck was dirty.

Unfortunately, I snapped a cable on that one so I had to replace it to play with my 2nd gen iPod Mini. Monster Cable iCarPlay cassette adapter was the replacement. I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks in the car, not music, so I do not care too much about sound quality. Speech is legible and thus acceptable to me, although it is a noticeable downgrade as compared to my old unit.What is not acceptable, however, is that the 3.5 mm plug does not fit the iPod's input snugly. As a result, even the slightest jiggling of the cord causes iPod to pause as if the cord was unplugged.

I ejected the adapter and just turned the sprockets with my fingers, and sure enough, the interlocking gears in the adapter itself were causing the noise.I put it back in to the cassette player and fast-forwarded, rewound, and just let it run, to see if the mechanism settled into a different, less noisy position. No such luck.So back it goes.If Monster had paid a bit more attention to the mechanical quality of the adapter, I'm sure I would have been satisfied with it. But I will be purchasing a replacement from another manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems here","review":"After reading some of the negative reviews here, I wondered whether I should return this before I even opened it and spend a little more on a better solution. I'm glad I didn't. Maybe the results vary with different cassette players, but with my VW Golf (2000), it works like a charm. I set the iPod volume at 3/4 as instructed, and had to adjust the bass on my stereo a bit, but I have no complaints about the sound quality at all.I only give it four stars because it does have a certain \\"jury-rigged\\" feel to it -- you've got dangling wire and have to find a convenient place for the iPod itself.

Most admirable thing about Levi's interpretation is that everything he does is governed, not by analytical mind, but by emotional and spiritual intensity, unlike so many of our generation of cool conductors whoes music comes, not from heart, but from head.My only complaint is the stiff solists who sing their part like R.Strauss Opera area towards the end, and too brightly lit sound, but of course that's matter of personal taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mocs","review":"These moccasins are the very best for around the house wear.

This DVD works, although I did fall over a few times during moving tree pose...there's that non-graceful part. It is indeed something to work towards, and far more challenging than it looks. I read somewhere that mind body fitness is the new way to go, and Ellen Barrett has been considered one of, if not the best, instructors in this field, she'll get no argument from me...sore arms and all.

The latter being said, Polkinghorne is actually far more orthodox in his theology than many modern academic theologians. For believing Christians who are uncomfortable rejecting either orthodox science or orthodox Christianity, this book provides many fascinating insights. If you need to believe that God does not exist or that he created the world in six 24-hour days, you won't be happy with this book. A final caveat. The reading is challenging. However, Polkinghorne provides a short glossary of scientific and theological terms. This book is more accessible to the general reader than his most recent work \\"Belief in God in an Age of Science.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"sophistry","review":"An interesting piece but no more than an apologists attempt to reconcile two fields that have no common ground. Polkinghorne attemts to treat the metaphysical as though it had more substance or basis than the legends, myths and superstitions upon which it is based.

Although the book is wickedly funny and irreverent in parts, it never strays far from its serious (and very worthwhile) central theme - how to be a decent human being in a false and callous world. As is the case in real life, the young hero finds that there are few, if any, reliable guides to help him in this, and he is forced to find his own way.

The characters are pretty well fleshed out - even many of the minor characters - and the caricatures are kept just the right side of believable. Put it this way, this is the first book in weeks that I've read right through to the end and it says a lot for any author that they can hold my interest and not have me skipping paragraphs let alone pages.

Truthfully I'm not bothered by the inaccuracies of films like this or U-571. They're 'based' on things, not anything else. I recognize the need for consolidation and composite characters to keep things flowing dramatically. However that's where i thought this movie failed horribly. It didn't keep things moving. It moved from set piece to set piece without once being interesting to me or provocative. Heath Ledger was horribly ineffective, especially after hearing all the buzz on his breakout performance. His romantic scenes were forced and misplaced, only serving to set us up for a tragic event later in the film. Again, I'm all for foreshadowing, but how about a little ambiguity, huh? I just kept wondering how they could have spent a reported ($) million on this shoddy, poorly photographed and horrifically uneffective film.

If you want some Mel Gibson, see Chicken Run instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"A classic case of Americans revising history. This movie is historically inaccurate, filled with lies and misrepresentations of what really happened. The Americans were responsible for their own fair share of attrocities in the war, perhaps more so than anything the English did. Furthermore the main character was not the shining light he is portrayed to be, but rather a vicious, brutal slave owner who was notorious for the extreme abuse he inflicted on his slaves. Yes such a vicious, ruthless individual is ideal in a war, but then let's see him portrayed as such, let's see the things he really did, rather than this weak, whitewashed nonsense. Or are Americans too weak-minded to deal with a 'hero' who has his (very) dark side?The lies aside, this is just a typical action movie, nothing more, but that's to be expected from the makers of ID4. If you're looking for a good action movie I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funniest Movie of the Year","review":"Mel Gibson is a peaceful plantation-owning father who wants nothing more than to make a nice rocking chair for himself, from which he can (presumably) sit on the porch, pat his yung'uns on the head and command his slaves with wise benevolence. Then one day a merciless Redcoat slaughters most of Mel Gibson's family. Silly limey! Didn't he see Mad Max, Lethal Weapon, Braveheart, Ransom, Payback, etc.? Doesn't he know Gibson is hiding a violent past, and is just going to come after him in a bloodthirsty rage, mowing down scores of dimwitted Brits with his trusty tomahawk (in some of the most incredulous action sequences in Gibson's career--all that's missing is the dislocated shoulder gimmick from \\"LW\\")? Gibson has never looked more jive than he does in this pretentious vigilante's tale; he has played this character one too many times, and anyone who appreciates American history at all ought to be offended by the crass misuse it gets at Emmerich's hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your typical Hollywood flick.","review":"Oh geez....This movie is a dud. It was a total Hollywood piece of junk.I strongly recommend avoiding this movie if you are a fan of great period movies such as Gettysburg, Gods & Generals, The Duelists, Last of the Mohicans & Barry Lyndon (for starters). The Patriot is more in lines with movies such as Titanic, Pirates of the Carribean, a Knights Tale and Pearl Harbor....This movie was directed from the same guy (Roland Emmerich) who directed Independence Day & Godzilla for heaven sakes. That in itself should keep people away from it. Or at least people that know their history and appreciate it. I wish Gibson would have directed it.

Mel is great in this flick as Benjamin Martin. [Yea, Martins!] A close remake of the Swamp Fox with a new twist. Like Gettysburg, its a male tear jerker. For anyone who as served his country, you can really empathize with these men. Watching it again and seeing the American Continental Line march up beside the militia with their red bordered uniforms, I now realize that they are supposed to be the Maryland troops and our ancestor, John Jarvis, may have been with them in the battles they were trying to represent. Once again special effects make canonballs do what they are supposed to do on the field of battle. The family story is just as important as ours is to us.

All my expectations were in vain. first thirty minutes were perfect than came the troblesome scenes, like \\"I'll join the army\\" everyone getting up in that church; it was an awfull wiev. The scene the priest dies and throws his shotgun. Those scenes were like a directoral debut of a new graduate. Horrible...

The entertainment quality of this movie should outweigh any such qualms of the petty quibblers. OK we didn't see the concentration camps and outrageous British blitz of Nyack, but the producers obviously didn't want to totally alienate the Limeys. To this end Mel Gibson refused to play the scene where Brit lieutenant Callee shoots up the village of Engleton and massacres all the rebels - cowardice I call it.

The photography is great. The story line believable. Mel Gibson did a very fine job. We would highly recommend this to anyone who loves and appreciates the REAL AMERICA, not the media-corrupted, welfare state. We only noted one disturbing flaw--the appearance of a baby which may have been born out-of-wedlock. Not the message we condone.

The British have never rounded up people and herded them into churches and then set them alight, a fact even american history admits. And to make out the lead character to be whiter than white when even in american history he was not even close to that degrades the good acting and great cinematography that the film obviously has. I think you have to look past cinematic licence of fiction when you're dealing with things that actually occured and are well documented, it's a shame the director and writers didn't agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall very well done","review":"I reluctantly went to see this movie with the oft mentioned \\"Braveheart\\" comparisons in mind.

Not only did it depict honor, integrity and principles, it showed an ordinary man in times of crisis turn to God for answers. Being a Christian, I was amazed and very pleased to see a movie come out of Hollywood that actually showed someone praying to God instead of blaspheming Him!The action is incredible in this movie, but it is definitely NOT for the faint of heart. There is a LOT of blood and gore, but the overriding themes of love of family, courage in the face of crisis, and seeking after God in the midst of trials were enough to make this one of my all-time favorite movies. I will indeed buy this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Canada Loves The Patriot","review":"This is a movie I guarantee you will embrace. It is a civil war tale of epic proportions. The acting performances logged in by both Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are shoo-ins when Oscar ballot time rolls around. The cinematography and music are breathtaking. I believe that a film can never achieve excellence without first establishing a conflict, for conflict you need a villan and the Patriot offers an antagonist you love to hate. The widescreen transfer to DVD and the digital sound makes the Patriot worth purchasing.

My son chose this movie for a history project. He has enjoyed the characterzations and the actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywooden","review":"The Patriot is pretty much your typical Hollywood blockheader. Cardboard characterizations and a formulaic script overwhelm the excellent cinematography and glimmers of good acting. I was put off by the distasteful villainization of the British, who in truth, acquitted themselves quite honorably in their conduct of the war; and of Lord Cornwallis, who was a decent man and general. In this movie, Hollywood once again shows its odd understanding of how warfare is really conducted. In warfare one wants the HIGH ground! Not to mention the foolishness of shooting your enemy from a circle!!! However, the most lamentable fault of The Patriot is it's utter predictability. I continually annoyed the people I was watching it with by telling them what would happen next.... Rent this movie if you like Mel Gibson, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Everyone should see this movie... once. Its merits include: Heath Ledger showing good growth as an actor; Jason Isaacs as a supremely oily villain; and Tom Wilkinson playing a fairly noble Cornwallis to balance Mel's overblown and flagrantly inhuman brutality. Unfortunately, these fine points aren't enough to deserve watching this film ever again. The film has, at best, a tenuous sense of dramatic tension. The filmmakers attempted to remedy this by periodically slaying major characters. At best ineffective; at worst insulting. At times it seems that Emmerich is peddling some kind of distorted British propaganda by painting American revolutionaries as savages bent on bloodshed and revenge. So rent it; watch it. Enjoy the three good points it has (Ledger, Isaacs, and Wilkinson). Then, when one of this film's unreasonably fanatical followers asks you with bright-eyed enthusiasm, \\"Have you seen this?!\\" you can nod, smile, and walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"This film is shallowness itself.Take a measure of historical inaccuracy, add some banner waving, a touch of over-acting and mix well with a predictable story and script. Next add a villain who would not be out of place in a Victorian music hall skit, and finally a huge amount of sentiment - until it drips out the sides preferably. The result is a movie like this.It has nothing new to offer, nothing new to say.It's only redeeming feature is that it was nicely shot (which is what the makers should have been ;-) which is why is gets 2 stars.If you want originality, look elsewhere. If you want a film made to a formula that amounts to little more than eye-candy, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me nonsense or give me death","review":"From a historical point of view, this movie is claptrap made worse by the grotesque superimposition of late Twentieth Century movie morality on the American Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST FILM-THE BEST DVD!","review":"Now I know there have been a lot of people on here who won't agree with me on this, but I wan't to be perfectly clear when I say: This film is the best movie I've ever seen! A great story of country, family, and vengeance set against the backdrop of the American Revolution. I think this is DEFINITELY Mel Gibson's best performance. Who else could pull off a performance as a man with a dark secret who must leave his peaceful life behind and join the American Revolution in order to protect his family? Tom Cruise? Never! Tom Hanks? Maybe! Mel Gibson? Perfect Fit! The film's got great storytelling, fine visual effects, and superb acting from all involved! And the DVD is AWESOME! The featurettes are amazing, and the commentary track is exceptional! The rest of the DVD is awesome! It is a must-buy! I guarantee it! Grade: A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been much better","review":"You could sum this film up in five words. BRAVEHEART DOES THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. As a history buff and reenactor, the PATRIOT had it's moments, but it was overly long and inaccurate.At times it was silly and predictable. This film is a major improvement over earlier films that deal with the Revolution, but it still could have been better. Students of uniforms and period weaponry will notice quite a few inaccuracies.

He tries to exibit them as an evil empire comitting constant atrocities (which never actually happened).

Anyway, there are some really great action scenes in this film, including the HUGE final battle between the Redcoats and the rag tag Continental Army. The revenge story line was kinda hokey, but at the end of the film I actually heard myself yell \\"GET 'EM!!!!\\" It also makes you really think about what was sacrificed by so few for what we have now today....kinda boggles the mind if you ask me! An all around action packed romp through South Carolina with Mel's portrayal of the Swamp Fox. This one is not for those who like their movies historically acurate, but hey I enjoyed it, and it is one of those films that makes me say proudly.....THE USA IS A-OK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patriot is trash fest","review":"One of the worst films of the year 2000, this film stinks it stinks because it has no depth or orginality and is purely an excercise in watching Mel Gibson look sensitively into the camera.

The A/V quality of the DVD is no better that that on the VHS tape.The cinema release was crisp and sharp and clear. Not so with the DVD. Also, due to copy protection this DVD will not play on older players and will probably not play on computer DVD's.They really ruined what could have been a most excellent DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Patriot","review":"I love this movie and I am just starting to get into DVD's. What I don't understand is why they can't all be released in either Widescreen or Full Screen formats. This reveiw pertains to all DVD.

Is someone out there realizing that not all of us can appreciate the Widescreen Aspect Ratio thing but do appreciate the better quality of veiwing on a DVD rather than a VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible pseudo-historical nonsense","review":"This is perhaps the worst film about the Revolutionary War ever made. I suppose historical accounts of British troops weren't scary enough for the producer, so he transformed them into anachronistic Nazis, burning townsfolk in their churches and summarily executing those suspected of disloyalty. The fictitious Benjamin Martin and his progeny are inflated with so much virtue, charisma and martial prowess that they overshadow the events surrounding them. The entire issue of post-revolutionary slavery and racism is whitewashed out of existence in a manner that would be silly if it wasn't insulting. Awful stuff, even if you intend to give the silver screen devil his due. Hopefully, true patriots can still THINK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable!","review":"Any student of American history will be alternately cringing and laughing through this movie...if you can sit through the whole thing!

We had the most highly trained and well diciplined army in the world, the only reason the Americans won was because of the fact that we were already fighting a war with France, spain etc and as a result only a quarter of our army were actualy over there.I am 15 and considered gullable to this yanky propaganda, well i say anyone who is taken into this film should be considered dumb or racist as we are portayed as nazi type figures and its so WRONG!!!!!

From the very beginning of the movie you want to know what is going to happen and there are very few scenes that are boring! From the first time to the fourth time I saw this movie I loved it and even if the historical information behind the movie is inaccurate, who cares it's a movie and what is a movie supposed to do?

It would of been alot better, if they'd knocked off that hour of boredom, they really went over board with the plot development."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Parrotriot","review":"I admire Mel Gibson with his directorial prowess on Braveheart, The Passion and Apocalypto. But this movie is just down the drain an insult to American history. Full of historical inaccuracies,over long, corny scenes. Killing of prisoners war may have occurred based on diaries of colonists which perhaps was biased to instill more hatred to the Brits but not rampant and blatant as shown on the film. Worst is the locking of civilians in a church and setting it on fire now this absolutely has no documentation, no historical basis. Apart from those never-happened banzai charge of both American and British soldiers the action scenes are patterned after Matrix and kung fu Steven Seagal movies. If you have a penchant for Rambo style action this is for you. This movie is for power drinkers and trouble makers in parties. Not to be shown in any history class!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood revisionism","review":"I truly believe an historical movie should attempt to recreate the past to further our understanding of events as they occured. The Patriot merely follows the age old revisionist pattern which Hollywood continually serves up to a gullible audience.I still cannot believe Mel Gibson would allow himself to be used in such a farce. Does he really think the British rounded up women and children and burned them all in a church after locking them in? Does he think loyalist americans were themselves treated fairly and decently in revolutionary/civil war America?Admittedly the movie was visually stunning in its effects but this only left me with a feeling of sadness, sadness that such an important event in history after 200 years, cannot be gotten right.Perhaps it is because I am Canadian and from Loyalist stock, perhaps it is the memory of a war that pitted neighbour against neighbour and father against son that this movie leaves me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Gibson garbage...no stars","review":"I wouldn't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that I had to when I saw what Christiane Schmidt had to say.Now we all know Mr Gibson has got issues with the British (as well as others) - just look at that other pile of tosh - Braveheart. But here is an example of why rewriting history to fit your own personal prejudice is dangerous. The usual response is \\"It's not history but Hollywood, it's fiction based on historical events\\". But the problem is that some people actually believe it really happened like that!Now I'm sure that many atrocities took place on either side of what was in effect a civil war, but I've never read of the British burning down churches with people inside - Nazis, yes....British, no. But who cares about whether it really happened....it's only a film!!Good grief, next thing you know they'll be making a film about the US recovering the first enigma machine.....oops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Independence Day + Braveheart = The Patriot","review":"This movie really disappointed me! First of all, I am not an american citizen, and therefore this movie doesn't manipulate my national feelings...If you put ID4 and Braveheart (the fighting scenes) together, then you end up with \\"The Patriot\\". I love ID4 and Braveheart, but I didn't like this one. Why Mel Gibson in this movie?? They could just as well have hired Steven Seagal or Arnold Schwarzenegger, 'cause this would be the perfect role for them. If you're american, then you may like this one, but I guarantee you that you easily will forget the movie within those nearly 3 hours it lasts. It's just TOO american, and that is NOT a compliment for a movie nowadays..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad History Lesson","review":"Director Roland Emmerich and Producer Dean Devlin? Do you recognize those names? They brought us Independence Day and Godzilla. Two of the worst movies of the nineties in my humble opinion. Now they are giving us a history lesson in the form of The Patriot. This movie has good sets, neat costumes, and good computer graphics. This movie does not have originality, good acting, or the convictions of it's own plotline. The movie is similiar to Braveheart, another Gibson movie. Again Gibson plays a man of peace turned savage when a loved one is murdered. As for the acting, forget it. Yes, Mel Gibson is a likeable screen presence, but he cannot carry this film. The rest of the actors are horrible, especially that broad who plays Heath Ledger's love interest. In thier defense, the actors can only do so much with bad dialogue and a hack director. If you want an intellingent historical movie, go for the 1989 movie Glory. If you want a Mel Gibson historical piece, watch Braveheart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another over dramatisation","review":"Again we are hit with a movie that makes a convenient slant on history.

I got up several times during the movie, left the room, and came back, to find that I didn't seem to miss much at all, except some pretty poor dialogue. I'm sure the actors did the best they could with what was given them, but the writing was just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Patriot-review","review":"As the Patriot himself was based on at least three different colonial frontiersmen I believe it calls into question the historical accuracy of the story. The story itself is well written though, and the movie is well acted,the cast was well picked, and Mel Gibson actually made me feel as if he were fighting a battle inside himself up until he was pulled into the fray. The movie was well directed, and the cinematography was excellent. Again the quality of the picture as well as that of the sound was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie!","review":"I believe the Patriot was made in 2000. It is now 2012, I saw this movie for the very first time on a cable network that ran it at least twice and I was amazed at how GREAT this movie truly is!!I guess in the past - I never paid attention to the movie, because the type of movie is not anything that I gravatate to, but shame on me, because the movie has excellent writing and well acted!!Powerful movie, good story line, and at the end of the day, this is just the type of movie I would gravatate too!! Thank you, Amazon for carrying the movie, and of course, your values can't be beat!!Excellent Movie!!Valarey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-Ray Quality (Short n Simple)","review":"I recently added this to my Blu-Ray collection. The sound is 5 stars. The video quality is 4 stars. Some of the extended scenes had quite a few black specs that were distracting. The detail in 85% of the film was spot on though. Worth upgrading from DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"The settings are gorgeous, the battles are great, the acting is appropriate, atleast for this story. From the beginning we hate the villain... then we hate him more. Then more. He is given so many opportunities for us to find nothing but disgust with his treachery. But in doing so, he looses his humanity. That doesn't necessarily bother me, its just obvious.There is a sweet romance utterly crushed in the worst manner, leaving us with maddening contempt, but no doubt accurate to the period.The most powerful moments in the Patriot come in the \\"saving Gabriel\\" scene towards the beginning. Gets me riled every time. Highly recommended, in the same spirit as Last of the Mohicans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inaccurate yet enjoyable","review":"No it isn't Braveheart but it is still an enjoyable movie. If you can suspend belief for U-571 and all if it's inaccuracies then you should enjoy this. A good movie, not a great one. Gibson obviously isn't fond of your brethren across the \\"pond\\". Decent battle scenes - for as long as the movie is the characters could be better developed. Nice photography.Caveot: I am having problems getting Scenes 13-15 to play. I've returned the DVD once and the new DVD has the same problem. Don't have problems with any other DVD's (and I have dozens). Is anyone else having this tracking problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Good Price","review":"This story is akin to Braveheart in that it stars Mel Gibson in another epic movie, and that they go whomp the English. Also like Braveheart, that acting is quite good, the visuals are amazing, and, of course, all of the nit pickers out there found something wrong with it. Movies are meant to be entertaining, not 3 hour long documentaries!I really like this movie. The only thing I would have changed was the pacing of the film. It still could have been very good if the director had chopped 45 minutes or so from the film. There were some scenes that I thought were uneeded.At ...

DVD has 10 deleted scenes with optional commentary, getting an insight into why they removed them. The deleted scenes are shown in context of the moving giving the scene before and after. The Talent files are a little light, it didn't cover some of the minor characters who you look and say \\"where have I seen him before\\" The featurettes are more than just a behind the scenes mini-documentary.

Mel Gibson is an ok (Just OK) actor. Most of the others are too, with some really really bad ones thrown in- just for kicks!5)People say it was entertaining- really? I was writhing through the entire thing. Oh, and the war scenes really aren't that gruesome... maybe its because I saw Kill Bill a month ago?I wish I didn't waste my time with this movie!

It was very cheesy and did not follow a constant theme. One minute it is love story, war story, or revenge story. I was half-way through the film and turned it off.

Stereotypical British (to be more exact, ENGLISH) red-coated villains. I've enjoyed Mel Gibson movies in the past, and even enjoyed some facets of this film, but I'm beginning to sense an Anglophobic trend to some of these \\"historical\\" movies...and what a shame it is. This sort of film, sadly enough, is historically uneducating America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this movie","review":"This movie is like Braveheart \\"Lite\\". I'm a big Mel Gibson fan, but this movie was boring. You can appreciate the depiction of what it may have been like to be internally conflicted over going to war with mother-England, but that is about it.The battle scenes don't make it interesting. The love stories and all characters are undeveloped so you don't really know why they are doing particular things or even care. Of course, historically, you don't gain any insight either. (Braveheart at least made you want to read more about the actual people and compare the movie's depiction of them.) Overall, it is really shallow and not the least bit believable. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is wrong with the murkiness of real life?","review":"Why does hollywood have to be so black and white. Would it not be more interesting to try to understand the ambious nature of conflict. Instead we are treated with a ridiculous pantomime that should only fool a child. Apart from the Slavery issue, there are too many inaccuracies; where are the Scottish and Irish Soldiers in the British ranks - they were the majority in this era. If Mel Gibson could dispatch British troops so easily, why then did the war drag on for nearly a decade. Why is it that counter-insurgency conflicts are so muddy, brutal and full of civil conflct - except for Mels? Grow up and learn to deal with the real nature of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Much","review":"Combine the sacarine of Little House on the Prarie with the bravado of Braveheart and you get the Patriot. Manipulative, lacking character development, it results in a big 'who cares?' Compared to work like Glory or Gettysburg, this is totally forgettable. Gibson's stilted portrail of 'Braveheart meets the British' is astonishingly poor...I don't for a minute believe in his limited romantic interests. John Williams' worst music score in years does not help (he really has no clue how to write for the battle scenes in this film); it should win an award for the ultimate in pretentious, clueless scoring. They could easily have removed an hour of boredom from the film, which remarkably builds up to nothing at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Racist Film Ever","review":"Ridiculously racist and historically inaccurate anti-English rubbish -aptly describes The Patriot. As a even more anti-British remake of Brave Heart this deeply offensive film should be made illegal on the charge of racism.The actions of the Nazis have been transposed onto English in a typical Hollywood distortion of history.In reality the British lost America, the Americans did not win it. As a result of the madness of King George III.More to the point the British soldiers-much more well trained and elitie than any Americans- were outnumbered 10 to 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best war movies I've seen, and one of the best overall","review":"Mel Gibson gives a performance to stir the soul in this instant war classic. It is the tale of South Carolinian Malitia in the Revolutionary War. As the story unfolds, his house is divided between joining and neutrality. A crazed British Cavalry Sergeant's quest to kill Mel adds fire to the already stirring plot. This is a great movie for history buffs and anyone liking to see gore (and there's plenty)."},{"rating":"1","title":"one useful lesson","review":"Any American wondering why much of the world despises this country should perhaps watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad hollywood doesnt own the rights to history!!","review":"two aussi lads in a hollywood film about the American indpendence!! says it all really! if you want entertainment spin the toilet roll around and around. the historical account is stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Widescreen!?!?!?!","review":"In my opinion this is a great movie, but it's hard to watch when I'm only seeing the picture half the size of my TV.

The themes, the story, the scenery, EVERYTHING, is so beautiful. If you truly want to understand what America is about, see this movie! These men gave their homes, their families, their very lives so that we could be free. It is a true masterpeice.The characters are so moving and the story is so sad. I cried terribly when the British burned the church building, and I hjad to choke back tears in the scene when the militia man finds his dead wife and child. The battle scenes are gut-wrenching and nausiating, but so REAL. This movie has some of everything. Comedy, such as with Cornwallis's dogs and the whole ink-in-the-tea thing. A love story, with Benjamin and Charlotte and of COURSE Gabriel and Anne. Drama and action, which speaks for itself.This movie truly reveals the American dream. Freedom. I recommend it whole-heartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable","review":"If your buying this DVD as a gift, or if you haven't seen the film, I would strongly recommend that you rent it first. Unless you can detach yourself from the characters in the film, you will not enjoy it, because everybody suffers painfully. The films demographic is definitely male 18-35, with graphic violence, digitally generated imagery of arms, legs and even heads being blown off by cannons, and the depiction of the burning of helpless women and children. Although well acted this film is devoid of tenderness and many will feel they've just wasted 2 hours of their life watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braveheart II","review":"Very disappointing! I can't believe actor/director Mel Gibson agreed to play in what is grossly Braveheart II in an american historical setup. Change the uniforms and the props and it's the same thing... without the magic! A poor remake working on the same emotional strings: torn family/couple, an unwilling hero dragged into war, very cruel english enemy.

The Director / screenright pursue a cheap plot. It is certainly not about what most would expect, the traditiional reasons for the war. Mel Gibson seemded to lack focus.

The acting was so bad I actually knew what people were talking about when they said the acting was terrible.

All though this movie may have been fun to watch you will learn hardly anything about the time period. Many things about how the british treated the Americans were false like how the british burned the church with all the towns people in it. This would not happen back then the british were not likely to commet war crimes at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the facts, please","review":"Little about this movie appealed to me. The characters sounded more like modern Americans rather than Rev War folks. Their politics reflected modern concerns of social equality and cooperative politics. Not that I don't want these thigns for ourselves, but being a US History major, I assure you people didn't think like this back then. The battle scenes struck me as the mythical guerilla minute man exposes, which indeed happened but not the way nor to the extent Mel envisions. I think it is a shame when directors have to make history what they would prefer it to have been, rather than display it for what it was. Mel Gibson clearly dislikes people who misread their history to support bigoted ideas, so then why does he continue to misread history to do justice to his own ideas? That question haunts me when I walk out of his movies, as it does most history lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably Silly.","review":"Viewed: 6/05Rate: 36/05: The Patriot is a cheesy extension of Braveheart. There is too much emphasis on ripping off Michael Mann's Last of the Mohicans, David Lean's works, William Wyler's Ben-Hur, and Edward Zwick's Legends of the Fall and Glory. It is so easy to identify the poor copies when comparing the action scenes to Last of the Mohicans. The story is boring. The acting is laughable. Well, everything about this film is totally laughable. I laughed literally when they burned down the church. Why not substitute Tim Roth for Tavington character? I could believe more. Heath Ledger is so poor in this film, resembling much of a cardboard-like kid. Mel Gibson, I know he can do better than this lurid piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Patriotic As The Patriot Act","review":"Horrible film on the American Revolution starring Mel Gibson. I would give this film a -100 if I could. In addition to the formulaic cameo shots pointlessly and continuously revolving around Mel; the film is further debased by a pathetic script and horribly gross historical inaccuracies. The story line is generic and can be found in an introductory film class textbook. Mel Gibson's rigid performance kills the film beyond redemption. Shun this film like the plague! Watch 'Last of the Mohicans' or 'Revolution' for films on Revolutionary or Pre-Revolutionary America instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding?!","review":"This movie has so many flaws that it makes it almost a joke more than anything. The dialog is horrible, the acting is second rate, and the plot is so bad that you can tell exactly what is going to happen the entire 3 hours. Not only that but the movie is horribly unrealistic. Really, do yo think that Mel Gibson's character could take down 30 guys with about 5 shots and a hatchet? It's bad enough this happens, but it happens over and over again. No one has this many lives. Sure the movie Die Hard did the same thing, but it was meant to be funny the way he couldn't die, and he joked about it too. This movie has some redeaming points in the fact that the full scale battles are fun to look at, but the other 2 and a half hours are just a waste of your time. you're better off renting this movie because chances are you won't want to watch this 3 hour bore more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"God bless Australia","review":"Plucky and unusually enlightened Australian farmer saves downtrodden Americans from villainous Brits.To misquote Henry Ford \\"Hollywood History is bunk\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriotism is Here","review":"One of the very few movies that Mel Gibson was involved in that deserves a special kind of respect.

If there's one movie that you need to purchase on Blu-ray, I would highly recommend this one.While I don't consider myself a Mel Gibson fan, this movie portrays the events of the Revolutionary War, back when the colonies fought for independence against the British Empire and this is one of the very few movies that the Blu-ray format was designed for. With such notables as Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger (before he died) in one of his few quality roles, films about the history of the United States have always intrigued me.I couldn't recommend this movie high enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat of Braveheart","review":"Mel Gibson is a respectable and talented actor. But the character he played was a spitting image of William Wallace. The portrayal of British officers was inaccurate and upscaled for hollywood sake. The storyline was OK, but the depth of the characters were too cookie cutter and unrealisitic. The setting, and the truth behind Mel's character was lost in translation. Too bad they tried to make another Braveheart. The first one was fabulous, the second was far from fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"We deserve better","review":"This depiction of Revolutionary War figure Francis Marion has Epic written all over it - from its choice of Mel Gibson as its reluctant hero to its 2 hour and 45 minute length. The only problem is that its a bad movie - the characters are uninteresting and cartoonish and whitewashed to make it a \\"feel good\\" drama - how many times can you roll your eyes at its cliches, trite dialogue and sacharine tug at the heartstrings - well again, the movie is 2 hours and 45 minutes so the answer is Lots. While the director may have been attempting to make an action epic more on par with his other blockbusters - Independance Day and Godzilla - i feel this movie should be held to a higher standard unless you feel our nations history should be treated with the same level of gravity as aliens and giant radiactive lizards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tribute to the Men who founded this nation","review":"Classic Mel Gibson, very well done.

It is one of the best films I have ever seen. ... It simply tells of one man's (Colonel Tavington) brutal war tactics in colonial times and the only reason they tell of his brutalness is to bring the plot together perfectly. This film has terrific action and also very emotional parts. If there is any movie that shows the true brutality of war (on both sides) it would be this one.

Bravehart, We were soldiers, and The Patriot, all the top three, and this epic has the water mark moved to its limit. What this movie does so well that others have tried but failed is blend realism,Drama,anger,rage,and tenderness all in an epic package. I am very critical on movies about history, and I will tell you I have never been more pleased on two fronts before, both on Realism and drama.

Avoid this one unless you like slipping your brain into neutral - may cure insomnia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Hogwash","review":"The thrilling action sequences do not make up for the complete lack of historical accuracy, and anti-British tirade. Will American audiences swallow anything? The portrayal of a peace loving, patriotic, slave-freeing Hollywood hero is enough to make Ghandi vomit. Not that Mel Gibson is a bad actor, or the directing is poor, it's just that the message is absolute garbage.I'm a student from England, and am particularly interested in the British Empire and the colonies in the Americas. But this portrayal of valiant and innocent rebels standing up to evil, Nazi-like redcoats is laughable. British soldiers burning people alive in a church? On what grounds do they base that? The American rebels were early terrorists, not freedom fighters. Half of Americans liked British rule and King George, bless them!See the film if you must, it's quite enjoyable, but dig out your history books later and learn a few home truths about the American revolution. Long live the British!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A unrealistic, sterotypical mess!","review":"This film is horrible, it is boring, unhistorical, and it is filled with violence as a substitute for a horrible story. I hope tyhe American public is not that shallow as to where violence can make up for a bad movie. It unrealistically make the English look like red monsters. Also to its unrealistic side, there is a scene where Mel Gibson and his two eight year old sons attack thirty English soldiers, and win.

Sorry folks, but that's the truth.Oh - as vapid eye/ear candy goes, it'll probably suffice.

Unfortunately, like, kinda, like, Roland, you know, Emmerich, is like kinda totally unable to complete a coherent sentence. Every sentence he utters has at least one of his pet phrases, and usually all three of them repeatedly. Somebody should have given him a script to follow. His speech habits render the commentary useless. He spent so much time saying kinda-like-you-know that by the time he finally made a point I couldn't stand to listen anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent movie on the American Revelution","review":"This was the first major movie on the American Revelution. The character Mel Gibson plays was actually Francis Marion \\"The Swamp Fox\\". The British commander Col. Tavington was actually Bannistre Tarleton, The Loyalist commander in South Carolina. The movie was inaccurate in some ways in its depiction of slavery, The role of African-Americans in the Continental and British armies, The non-existent role of Native Americans (particulry the Cherokees), and the role of Generals Gates and Greene. It did not cover the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, which broke General Cornwallis' Western flank and drove him into North Carolina. It was a major accomplishment to bring this era on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Patriot","review":"For the true War movie fan, this is a must own. In my opinion the first modern epic to depict the War that created our great nation, and do it well.

The battle scenes are awesome, but Emmerich also keeps us intuned with the lives of the family, Benjamin Martin (Gibson) left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Mel Gibsons Best!","review":"It is my favorite movie i have ever seen it is worth every penny it is such a great film it is sad but it has lots of action at the same time.

If you want to experience all of the angst, dispair, turmoil, and exhilaration of the times with gave birth to our great nation, then this is a must see for you.

There are not any cut out scenes, which i enjoy, but other than that it is a very good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived Plot; Soap Opera Movie","review":"The plot has all the depth of a college freshman's fantasy. The film production is soap opera melodrama at its worst.One example among hundreds: The patriot's son's wife (and everyone else in the village) has been burned to death in the church by the super-evil British officer. So by this time it is all too obvious that the plot can now dispose of the son too. And sure enough, even though the son has shot this super-villain at point blank range with a rifle, the guy is not only not dead but not even wounded (just like in the horror movies). And Mr. Evil rolls over and shoots the son who dies making closeup grimaces into the camera.It is a poor highly over-contrived story plot. And it is poor film making. It is not worth wasting your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie,very stirring,forget the fussy historians","review":"Forget the fussy historians who complain that this movie isn't historically accurate,people go tosee movies to escape and be enetertained,it appears that some people have forgotten this. Hey people this is Hollywood,what do you expect,a dry and fussy boring history lesson? Yuk. Go to the movie because you want to see Mel or any of the other fine actors and the scenery and clothes. Gibson's character is thought to be based on the swamp rat and his real life doings during the Revolutionary War. And people like Tavington do exist,unfortunately,in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOW ......WAS IT REALLY NEEDED???","review":"With just 11 minutes of unseen footage, the film makers found an excuse to cash in with an \\"extended edition\\" of the film.

It is full of drivel and pap. If you are a Mel Gibson fan, stick with Braveheart and forget this [stinker]. Any American history buff should also avoid this movie. It is a waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad History","review":"A hilariously bad film, very loosely based on the experiences of Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox. The film wishes to avoid the obvious hypocrisy of slaveholders fighting for (their own) liberty, so planter Marion here becomes farmer Gibson, who has freed his slaves. At the time, the colony of South Carolina was sixty percent black, but here the region is virtually all white, with the exception of a single slave who fights in the state militia in exchange for his freedom. (In reality, the SC Assembly banned free blacks or slaves from serving in the state militia.) Following the burning of his plantation, Gibson then arrives at the plantation of his sister-in-law; she too has freed her slaves. Evidently they are the only two whites in SC to do so. The screenwriter, who wrote Saving Private Ryan, knows better. In fact, this film is so inaccurate that one might fairly regard it as racist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This was an overall good movie, but not the best. I thought the storyline seemed to take some expectred turns and frankly I wasn't surprised by the outcomes of some of the battles. If you want a movie with surprising twists and turns this isn't the movie for you, for everyone else, this is a good movie to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Braveheart, but still great!","review":"The first mistake I did when I first saw the Patriot, was that I was expecting another Braveheart. But this is not Braveheart, and it isn't trying to be.Roland Emmerich really shows that he is a great director who can handle a great script without destroying it with specialeffects. After Independence Day and Godzilla, Roland has finally stopped relying on the effects (allthough there are effects, but they do not own the screen at any time) and started to trust his own skills.He also has great help from the cast. Mel Gibson is great as both the carrying father, and as the cruel buther he is in war. Heath Ledger is abolutley a name to recon with for the future, and makes the son very well.So all and all this is a graet movie, that does NOT make all englishmen out to be a sead of evil, that some people have claimed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pro-American, Pro-Southern Classic","review":"For those of you tired of seeing honorable themes like devotion to family, moral courage, bravery, and the right to keep and bear arms bashed in Hollywood, this film is a surprising departure from the normal left-wing garbage.Those of you Brits and others out there who think this film is an exaggeration, get educated. Put down your pro-UN pablum for a minute and read Thomas Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" and Thomas Jefferson's \\"Declaration of Independence\\". You will find our grievances against the crown more than justified our taking up arms. And remember this- if it weren't for the Yanks and their guns, y'all would be speaking German now. The truth hurts.All that aside, this film is a new classic. Its superb battle scenes, plot, moral arguments, characters, and costumes make it well worth buying.Patriotic Americans, especially Southerners, will go away greatly satisfied.Bitter, hateful, anti-American Liberals and gun-grabbers need not apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"God bless america my arse british arse!!!!","review":"What a surprise another hollywood film where the USA is a poor defencless country and the Brits ,Japanesse or the Germans are demonised. In this films case its the brits turn to be baby killers.Sure the film is patriotic but sure its just an excuse for the US to win another battle, no wonder the US goverment is so arogant its because films like this come on the scene.

I suppose the historical inaccuracies annoy me because i am a history fanatic but it doesnt stop there.Black people were made to look like subordinate fools in this film. The blacks in this film should be shot.Heath Ledger? Fool of the year. He was only in this film for his supposed good looks. He has proven nothing from what I can see.Positive points: The costumes were fantastic and who ever styled this film did their homework.Jason Isaacs. He is great. Paradigm of Evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Patriot","review":"This film is a winner. Not only is Mel Gibson at his best, but the story is realistic and one can identify with it.

I recommend this film to all who love America and what it stands for."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo! boo! hiss! boo!","review":"I am a mel gibson fan. Have been one since mad max days. As you can tell by my stilted language, it has had a profound effect on me. Let me give you a quick story. Man is asked to fight the british (who are ruthless). Man says, no, wants to farm, and raise his family. British kill member of his family. Man kills lots of british. Man forms group of inspired fighters, and without any real support, wage battle against the \\"ruthless\\" british, beating the heck out of them. Now, tell me, was this \\"Braveheart\\", or \\"Patriot?\\" Kinda hard to tell, ain't it? Look, also, for similarities between Frances Marion, the Swamp Fox, and Benjamin Martin (last name, headquarters, state militia, left behind to harass the british, etc.) If you want a better movie, same story, get Braveheart. If you do get this one, then use it to throw at the British the next time they are picked as mel's mortal enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they fighting about?","review":"Can't recommend this movie. They never make it clear what the fighting is about. The director never really figures out whether he is making an action movie or a chick flick. So he tries to do both and does neither well.The first 45 minutes or so are at least somewhat interesting. But after that the fun is over. The British are portrayed as caricatures. The reasons for fighting are never really explained, beyond the fact that one British officer is a mean, nasty fellow.The best line in the movie, where Gibson states that he sees no reason to prefer 3000 tyrants one mile away to one tyrant 3000 miles away is wonderful. But I am sure the point is lost on 99% of the audience.Yes, some suggest that we have to ignore the historical failures of this film. Fine. But simply as a film this movie was not very good. Rather typical of all Roland Emmerich films. BAD"},{"rating":"1","title":"As the world turns - plus violence-no stars","review":"Finally borrowed this from the library.

I think that the movie does a great job in showing the reality of the American Revolution. It wasn't a war that we won easily; it affected the lives of many adults and children. One of my favorite scenes in the film was an overview of a battlefield. It showed the fighting formation of the British Army; everyone was lined up in rows and marching forward. It looked like something from the board game Stratego. While there were numerous sad parts, there was also some humor. All in all, this was a very good movie and I would strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie","review":"This item was ordered used. It had writing on the box in marker.

Instead of fighting for his wife he's fighting for his children. And once again he's fighting the British. By the films he's chosen to do you would think he hates the British. Mel Gibson plays the role great and so does Englishman who gibson hates throughout the movie. You'll hate him too but what an acting job. Some grusome scenes in the movie and watching the battle scenes you'll think the people are crazy. After a few shots they charge at one another.

This film may be a rehash of \\"Braveheart\\", but there is one important difference...this one is entertaining. Enjoy it as an exciting adventure film with a good cast and some great action scenes, but be forewarned: if you have strong feelings about the misrepresentation of historical fact, you will not like this film. It is definitely \\"History for Dummies\\", with black hats on one side and white hats on the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blehhhh.....","review":"Well, I suppose I should be happy that any major studio is daring to touch American history as a subject again; in that way I did actually look forward to seeing this film.The rumors are mostly true: it is in essence Braveheart transplanted to the American revolution. The English are still either effeminate fops or sadistic monsters, and the sole French character is also as stereotypical as ever (but in a slightly humorous way). The entire issue of slavery has been evaded, tearing gigantic holes into the plot. I shudder to think of this movie being used as history education---as much as I thank its creators for taking up this perenially neglected era.Despite all this, The Patriot is still significantly better than, say, Mission Impossible 2. I was curious enough to see it through to the finish (although I fast-forwarded liberally)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good entertainer","review":"Brought tears to my really. It shows a different side of the war, that we didn't know. We never trough in the war as something really violent as the movie showed us. Realistic really. Mel Gibson was great, in fact, all the actors were great. The movie rocks! Too bad that they showed us the British as a very violent and cold-blooded people and the Americans as big hero's, honest and kind people. That was unnecessary and unrealistic. Buy it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good but not Amazing Movie","review":"The simalarities with brave heart are going to be drawn no matter what.

The plot relies on history which obviously the director decided to ignor and they managed to insult almost every English person in the world , depicting them as cold blooded killers . The main character (Mel G) managed to defeat the British army on several occasions seemingly with little effort . The final fight , showed the poor American Colonial militia out numbered by the british but yet they managed to hack there way through 3 battalions of Red Coats ! , an astonishing victory for the people who had been losing the war untill (Mel) joined in . Unless you are a patriotic American you wil not find this film any good , if your British like me then you will probably find it either laughable or insulting ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Epic for my Collection","review":"While most people who watch a movie like this look to the major star who plays the hero (in this case, Mel Gibson), I have found that the supporting cast makes the movie more rich and believable. I was particulary impressed with the villan character, Colonel Tavington, played by Jason Isaacs. Isaacs gives a stellar performance and makes you love to hate him. Gibson plays a role that seems to have been too similar to William Wallace in Braveheart, but regardless, it was a wonderful performance.All in all, I was very happy with this movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Braveheart type of genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings the American revolution into the living room!","review":"The passion and emotions of a father and his children, the value of friends and family in times of upheaval, the measure of commitment to freedom of our forefathers, it is all in here.

Through the ups and downs, highs and lows, career milestones, and career missteps, this band on stage, you can always expect a kick ass rock n roll show and this one does not disappoint. Geoff Tate may be an acquired taste from some, but you've gotta give the guy love, for always giving it his all when performing...he immerses himself in the performance, like a singer possessed. The band, hey even without Chris is Stellar! Scott's Rocken the Drums as always, man he's a Monster on the kit. Visually and audio wise this is top notch. Editing and sound quality are perfect.

Even at the time in my callow youth, I couldn't help but think that such behavior was profoundly inconsistent with even a minimal evolution of consciousness, and this guy was supposed to be a master! In my opinion, truly enlightened people don't blame, and they certainly don't whine: Rampa totally blew his credibility (with me at least) when he did that. The story's entertaining though, and I liked it. It is even has mild historical and perhaps even spiritual interest but overall, the work is just light entertainment.

In near future his dicoveries would be valued no less than Eisenstein's or Vertov's. In many ways Amarcord (and Rome) is more sofisticated than 8.5, which is constructed around plot (last cry of modernism), when the PoMo (late) Fellini is focusing story around thought-feeling, that is a true existential EVENT.

Set in the 1930's, this film featuring provincial Italy during this period, is full of droll scenes, some of them very funny indeed. Typical of Fellini, this film is a mosaic of fantasy and reality. Italy was in the pre war era of Mussolini and Fellini takes digs of the fascist regime including a hilarious scene featuring a parade. To balance this, there is a brief scene featuring the sinister side of fascism. From a biography written by Tullio Kezich ( a worthwhile read for Fellini admirers) I found that the tiltle comes from 'm'acord', the dialect of Rimini for \\"I remember'. Rimini is ellini's birthplace and \\"Amacord\\" is full of memories of his youth there, presented in his unique style. In 1975, this film won an Osca for best foreign language film.

The Cowboys series is an example of such a wonderful find. I've only read two books in the series, but as I'm reading them and new characters are introduced, I find myself wondering if the new character will be featured in an up-coming book. The most appealing part of these books for me (aside from the romance part) is that the female characters are strong, independent women. Even if the romance was removed...the story is still engaging.

The cover of Tequilla Slammer is, in particular, choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"STENCH!!!!!!!!","review":"This album is the worst compilation of distortations, unmelodic rythms, and poorly sorted beats that I have ever purchased. I liked Klute's remix of Mogwai's track \\"Summer\\" on the Kick A Dead Pig Remixes LP so I decided to give this Klute CD a try when I found it in the Used Music section of my local music store --- BAD IDEA & HORRIBLE WASTE OF $6 . I love industrial, breakbeat, trip-hop, electronic rock, metal and all other types of music this CD tries to incorporate but unless you like stuff like nails on a chalkboard or the emergency broadcast system test - I would not buy this album!

The first six and the POSIX specification at the end should not have been included, while the rest should have been written more concisely. In other words, the 500-page book could be boiled down to 150 pages worth reading.The book is also showing its age. First, the code style is not up to the final C++ standard (say, using such older header files as <algo.h> and <stddef.h> instead of <algorithm> and <cstddef>), nor up to the standard of moden C++ design (see code examples in \\"Accelarated C++,\\" \\"Modern C++ Design,\\" and \\"Efficient C++,\\" etc.). Second, although the term \\"object-oriented\\" is part of the book title, the code presented is still a mixed bag of toy C code and C++ classes tied together in long-winded, procedural main() and thread() functions.In spite of the negatives, one may still learn a few tricks by reading chapters 6-12."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat useful until a more concise book comes along","review":"The book is repetitive indeed -- sometimes with paragraphs copied VERBATIM from one chapter to another.

It's not a concert but a string of music videos produced at the time the album came out. They're strung together, with credits at the end, like a TV special, which I understand is what it was.If you're an ELO fan, this is a must have, moreso if you remember the original saucer they used for concerts!

There are some minor gaps in this book that Roe will cover, and vice versa (for example, Haynes recommends Loc-Tite for throttle body screws, which can work loose and fall in the engine, Roe ignored this potential issue). The Haynes book does a better job covering other Rochester carbs, including a side by side guide for rebuilding the DualJet and QuadraJet, though the side by side instructions can be confusing at times.I was able to get through a QJet rebuild in a very measured, cautious six hours.

If you are ever tempted to use his consulting services, please just read one of Al Ries' more recent books first. He briefly quotes Al here on page 245, but just in passing to make a point of his own. He complicates, Al simplifies.You might think that, hey, branding and marketing is a complicated business. It has been made complicated to justify big consultancy fees, like just about every other business. But it doesn't have to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff from a guy who knows what he's talking about","review":"I have read countless brand books, most of which are pretty average, but I put Brand Aid in my top three. It's real world, practical and insightful stuff written by a guy whose been there and done it. I would even put this ahead of books authored by 'gurus' Aaker and Keller because it is so practical.

It has flashcards, a parent guide, everything you'd want for a good solid introduction. I have used it as supplemental material in my own Spanish classes. It's a little advanced for most toddlers, so try Flip Flop Spanish for that age group, but for ages 5 & up, you'll be pleased, if you put a little planning into your lesson beforehand.It is quite interactive, which is the best way for kids to learn. Being a hands-on teacher, I wish there was a little more writing - even watching someone write a word helps a child to focus on it for that much longer while he listens, uses it in a sentence, or repeats a song or phrase.Sra.

Over a period of three years using at least three three set boxes.. I experienced that every replacement set , one of the low silverplated strings will break /pop/snap on the guitar on it's own just sitting on the stand.

Some other brands I have tried (La Bella, Yamaha, Alice, Augustine, Seville, Alliance Savarez...), they torn out and lost their tone in about a weeks or two. Specially the D string, it always the first to go. The golden rounded string start to break and poking out which makes you afraid to slide your fingers over them. I used to cut them using the fingernail cutter. But this D'Addrio Pro-Arte last for months and keep going. This really cut down the money I spend for guitar string for my practice.

This makes hearing in high noise backgrounds better than the outside ear buds. Downside is that the earbud is not held in place and fast head movement can result in ear bud falling from ear.

That's no fault of motorola, but something you should be aware of. Now the major bad... this picks up all kinds of background noise, whether it's there or not. If you're in a crowded room then forget it. However even if you're in a quiet room, then there's all kinds of background noise such as buzzing and what not. I'm not sure how the headset is picking up sound and I don't care. It's picking up extra sound, even if it isn't there.This is for you if you don't want to have conversations and are only checking voicemail.

I'm happy to say that I'm over that fantasy.As far as the H9 goes, it is without a doubt, the worst headset I've owned. It's absolutely useless outdoors, even in low wind, unless you just want to irritate whoever you're talking to.

A slight breeze could interfere with the caller's reception.I paid $149 for the unit when it first came out; the price has dropped considerably since then.

Again, there is a little explanation. I was truly dumbfounded that I just read the book anyway even though I didn't enjoy it.

It is pretty straightforward and she picked up the rules really fast. The kids have to realize that they can move around the volcano much faster when they find more of the animals they are looking for, but that it may be wiser to go only one step forward instead of turning an unknown card and risking to go backward (dragon pirate). The materials are really nice: good quality card board for the cards and the board, and wooden dragon figures to move around, so it should be very durable.

However, competitors often include several connection tubes, this only has one. The manufactured poked 3 large holes in the middle of the edging to keep it rolled up. Through the holes were poked hard plastic rivets which were difficult to remove and which left multiple holes in the edging. The reason those rivets are there brings up the main problem. This NOT-PROFESSIONAL edging is made of very stiff plastic which is very hard to adapt to whatever edging needs you might have. Even getting it to hold a straight line is difficult because it wants to return to the packaging curve. Because the plastic is so hard and unwieldy apparently they just cannot keep it rolled up for shipping with simple ties, and must resort to poking those damaging rivets through the middle. I have purchased edging from multiple sources in the past and this is definitely the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had really looked forward to this. When this first came out, Byrne was near the top of his game and he was combining the New Gods with Galactus and the Silver Sufer. Unfortunately, the final product proved to be kind of sloppy. First, the Silver Surfer's entire purpose is to find worlds suitable for Galactus to consume and for some reason he couldn't tell that Apokolips didn't meet the basic criteria. That just sort of ruined the whole thing for me. Second, and less important, is that the Surfer is portrayed as too powerful for Orion to defeat. Based on my familiarity with both characters from years of reading comics, I'd have done it the other way around, with Orion pretty much mopping the floor with the Surfer.Artwork is very good, which sort of makes up for the glaring problem with the story I mentioned above.

You must step up high to get on the treadmill. I imagine this is because it needs to be higher to accomodate the motor housing under the walking surface. The instruction booklet is easy to read. Being able to change speeds and include both the downhill and uphill features in my workout is great. It is a very quiet treadmill. It is great that my feet do not kick the motor housing when I walk. This is very important if you need to hold on to the hand rail when you walk because you are closer to the front of the walking surface. My only complaint is the way that the console is attached to the treadmill. I think longer screws and also more than two is needed for a more secure attachment. This is a minor detail. I choose to keep this treadmill in one spot because it is heavy. Overall, the treadmill is sturdy and attractive and the controls are easy to read and use. It is easy to fold and unfold.

Finally, an articulate, funny, witty and lively chronicle of the DMB from way back--without any of the dubious scuttlebutt or envious misgivings so typical of books in this genre. Really dug all the groovy pictures, but what I really wanted to see was one on the jacket cover of this Morgan chick. She must be one hot cookie--you can tell by the metaphors she uses. Too ladylike to kiss and tell, I wonder how she knows so much about the DMB? Will there be a band wedding in the future?

But this book is so poorly written, that I could barely stand to read it. Sure it has some cool info on the band. But I already knew all that. Sure it has interveiws of people. But not of the band. Wow. She interveiwed Dave Matthews' neighbor. Jeez, that was so interesting. Don't waste your money on this crap. Go surf the Net a bit, and you'll find out a lot more, and it'll be better written. Actually, if you want a copy of the book, I'll sell you mine, real cheap. It's in good condition.

I think if this book had been arranged by subject, rathen than chronologically, it would have suggested greater in-depth coverage to the author. But its weaknesses aside, this is a good compendium of information about the band; its fans; the music itself; Dave; and to a lesser extent, Boyd, Stefan, Carter and LeRoi. The book is also a useful look at merchandising and publicity for anyone seeking to enter the music business. I was most interested in the stories of the business side of this Band.

I couldn't even stand to finish his book.A friend of mine recommended that I check out The Dave Matthews Band: Music for the People. Reluctantly, I did. It was great!I did some research and found out that Nevin Martell is quite a writer. In fact, he used to work for one of my favorite labels -Atlantic Records.

Author never interviewed him.","review":"I am a very big of the DMB and was let down with this book. The author has never met Dave and therefore never interviewed him. The text in the book was all compiled from previously released material. I learned a handful of interesting facts about Dave and the band. The second half of the book was basically taking us from show to show. For some readers this may be enjoyable, but it becomes very repetitive. The main reason I purchased the book was because it seems to be the only one on the market about Dave and the band. The problem that arises when you don't interview the person that you are focusing on, is that a lot of the stories are here-say and perhaps false. I can't fathom writing a book about someone and not interviewing them. Overall, I would recommend it to an avid, hardcore DMB fan but be prepared for a big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad","review":"This book lacks any real soul. Sure, it certainly contains a great many words, but there's not a whole lot else to be said for it. If you're new with the Dave Matthews Band, you'll learn some neat things.

This book was about five teenagers who all go to the same high school together. They thought it was an average day going home from school. The teenagers are not ready for what is about to happen to them next. The next thing that they know is they are being kidnapped and taken to a cabin in the woods where they cannot get away. (The reason they were kidnapped is because the people who kidnapped them needed the money.) After the teenagers had been in the cabin for so long, they finally decided that they should breakout. When they do try to escape, they get a big surprise. I found this book very interesting, but you have to keep up with what is going on especially to figure out the end of the story. I recommend this book to people who love mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the book Ransom was horrible.","review":"The teenagers in the story were too boring.

I really never like Lois Duncan until I read this book. Now I love all of her books. This book is for kids that are an older age, but I encourage younger kids to read it. While reading the book you get to know the characters because they reveal so much personal information. I felt like I knew them forever! The best part is all the suspense. Right when you think you figured it out something happens out of nowhere! I could not put this book down! I had to read what happened next. Overall this book was one of the best I read and I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ransom","review":"Lois Duncan is well known for her mysterious and suspenseful books. Ransom is not an exception of the great novels written by Lois Duncan. If you have read and enjoyed her other novels, you will like this one as well. This novel is in particular one of my favorites. Duncan allows the reader to read the novel from different views. The novel is written in a way that each character \\"says\\" what they see. The five protagonists are interesting and high school students will probably relate to one of them in some way. The characters learn more about each other, and realize how they really are. For example, Glenn Kirtland; the popular handsome guy, football captain and president of the student body , turns out to be the most selfish guy anyone would ever imagine. I would recommend this novel to anyone that enjoys suspense, specially teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"barbie corvette","review":"I don't like fact that the barbie corvette cannot turn while going forward, it can only go straight.

My daughter received this as a b-day gift and I tell you that I would return it in a heart beat if I could (no receipt and it's been taken out of the box). The only good thing my daughter said she liked about the car is that it's pink. My daughter just turned 5 and it is way too slow for her, she would rather push it across the room herself than waste her time driving it. The slowness of the car along with the steering problems of the car ... make it impossible to cross a small room in less than 5 minutes. She says it's boring so I give it 1 star for fun!! Educational, definately 1 star because if anything it's confusing having to go in reverse to turn in one direction only.

The standard definition programming scales quite nicely and looks a lot better than on some of the other TVs I compared it to. I have only done over-the-air high definition broadcasts, but I can tell you that those look great! With the right settings, our DVDs also come through quite nice and it is just enjoyable to watch.A couple of things I don't like: the built-in speakers generally perform well, but can cause an annoying sound at medium-loud volumes when the deep base vibrates the plastic housing. The other annoying thing is for OTA broadcasts; if you lose a station's signal for very long, the TV erases it from its memory and you have to redo an auto-channel scan to get it back (or know what its true \\"channel\\" is and not the remapped one).Overall, I would highly recommend this television."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Deal Around","review":"I purchased this TV over a month ago after comparing it to the comparable Samsung model and am happy I did. The design is as beautiful as the picture. It is hooked up to my HD Cable box with a DVI to HDMI cable and the standard signals as well as the HD signals are outstanding. The only con is that there is only one HDMI input, but then again, in a couple months from now I'm sure all HDTV's will be coming with 4 HDMI inputs and people who only have two will be complaining - to try to keep up with technology is impossible. Bottom line is that this Television was an excellent buy and I would recommend it to anyone else who is looking for an great TV at an affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Spellbinding","review":"Unbelievable, impeccable picture and sound quality.

Can adjust backlight! Easy to use control features and simple to setup. No unnecessary, excessive packaging in the box. Just pull it out and you're ready to go. My only gripe regarding this TV is that it only offers one HDMI jack. A second would be nice considering i may be upgrading to an HD DVD player in the near future. I HIGHLY recommend this LCD. You will not regret buying this LCD."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good","review":"I've had this Panasonic for three weeks now and am very pleased. It looks beautiful even when turned off.

If you're going to purchase this TV, make sure the stand comes with, because some online sellers won't tell you the price doesn't include the stand...unless you directly ask.The non-HD channels look kinda bad, as do the DVDs playing on my non-HDMI DVD player. But since this TV has a built-in HD tuner, the HD antenna I purchased makes all HD channels look amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE RIGHT CHOICE","review":"This TV reinforced my confidence in Panasonic engineering excellence. I was able to set it up very quickly after it arrived via UPS on my doorstep. It is light enough to easily/quickly unpack it. It was very intuitive to start up when I initially hooked it up to my Digital Cable box. The next day the cable company came out and for a mere $13.99 hooked it to an HDTV cable box. I am very pleased with the various input options available such as TV, Component, Video1, Video2; and Full, Just(ify), 4:3 and Zoom aspect ratios. Something for everyone. The most striking feature are the brilliant colors. the Super Bowl was super on this HDTV. The only minus I find is that Closed Captioning cannot be set to automatically happen when sound is Muted but this seems to be true for all the other LCD HDTV models that I checked out. Overall I am extremely pleased with my choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highest recommendation for this product.","review":"We could not be more pleased with this product.

This album was a letdown. The reviews before me indicate that it is more \\"old school\\" than turbo, and they are right, but to a fault. This sounds like it was recorded in a garage, and the band is back to day one without practicing. The horns are flat, there nothing that hooks you in.

I love the Cure, and it's totally sad to see the beautiful masterpiece original songs screwed up and \\"modernized\\" by today's industrial/goth bands. Plus, the Cure's songs are way awesome in the first place not only because the amazing poetic lyrics, but also due to Robert Smith's unique and groovy voice which further defines the moods of the songs and words. Without his voice the songs seem to be missing their souls. As a Cure fan, I bought this album just to have all the Cure's CDs, but I advise everyone not to waste their money on this and get Standing on a Beach- the Singles, or The Cure's: Galore (both are Cure cd's that anyone will love)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"gothy\\" covers of some classic cure","review":"I admit I wasn't expecting much from this tribute. I bought it mostly out of curiousity. It is actually a pleasant surprise. I'm not a huge fan of goth but hearing cure songs covered by some straight-forward goth bands was actually pretty interesting. This album does help prove Robert Smith's contention that the Cure was never a goth band. I've always been drawn to the Cure's darker element, though I do love the \\"Kiss me\\" album. Most of these songs stay true to the original versions while adding a bit of the cover band's personality. Not as bad as some of these reviews would lead you to believe..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"As an avid Cure fan for approximately 15 years, I was excited to find this CD. Unfortunately, after listening to the awful tracks, I wish I hadn't bought it. These bands obviously do not understand the music of the Cure - all of the tracks on the CD do not in any way capture the surreal essence of the Cure's music and lyrics. My recommendation? Invest in some more obscure Cure import CD's or singles, but please do not waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set","review":"Nice set if you are into a trade or to get your collection going of good quality bits.

Why didn't the church have the art destroyed and condemned as heretical?Hock's book was interesting in that I was not overly familiar with this story of Mary. I did hear it alluded to in a Christmas pagent but didn't know it's sources. It information was interesting but I can see why it was not added to the cannon of scripture. On the other hand I do not think it should be banned either, but is interesting legend and reading.This book is good for anyone who is interested early church history and early manuscripts by early Christians. -- Valerie Lull, Author, Ten Healthy Teas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"After reading all the reviews in favor of this unit, I didn't hesitate to spend the $100 (a lot more than the other options) to buy one. The sound quality was ok, and the portability was great. There is NO bass in the music though, and you typically have to turn the volume up really high to hear it clearly.Now the problems. I ordered it direct from DLO. 2-3 months after I got it, the unit quit broadcasting in stereo, and music would only come out of the left speakers, and sometimes it would just cutoff completely. I contacted DLO about it, and the response was \\"tough luck, we only offer a 90 day warranty\\". They were really rude about it. $100 and you only get a 90 day warranty??? So now I have a $100 paperweight. BOOOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save you money","review":"I went with this more exspensive product to avoid getting something that would have static.

It fit's in very loosely and the contact is spotty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a lemon","review":"I was really excited about this product and couldn't wait to install it. Having done so, I don't have a problem with sound quality (except as other reviews have said, higher volume produces distortion) but what is driving me crazy is the automatic turn off feature. Even with the Ipod playing, i.e. it is not on pause, etc. it is actually playing a song, it turns off after 2 minutes no matter what I try with it.I assume the feature is defective on my unit and wil have to take it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is probably the best product, also, the best company for creating this type of device.

Worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DLO Transpod","review":"This is really a great item! I love the fact that there are no wires. The problem (and you know there is always one) is the stick shift on my car gets in the way. I tried one from a local store before ordering from Amazon since I will save by not paying shipping or tax. If you do not have a vehicle with a jack, this is the best transpod simply because it has no wires, plus it is about 25.00 less than in the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this if you live in the city.","review":"Love the design. Love the idea. Love the Price (compared to changing my stock radio to adapt to new technology). HOWEVER! this toy is a bad idea for people that live in big cities. I live in Miami, FL and I might get a clear channel for 10 to 15 minutes max! Im liable to get into an accident if i resort to switching stations on the transpod then switch stations on my radio to get another 10-15 min of clear sound. If i could turn back time id save my 70 bucks and wait till i had enough to upgrade my car stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transpod DLO 009-3031 review","review":"The item requires the dc outlet in your car to be located in a spot that is convienent for your iPod.

While this is fine for some vehicles, this is unusable for other vehicles, such as minivans where the outlets are on the floor in in hidden areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited waranty where one is really needed for this item","review":"Worked OK for 3 months of average usage, then broadcast was so bad it was unusable. No matter what frequency, it just basically quit working. Guess I could be more upset if I'd paid full retail. Should have listened to the multiple reviews stating connections that go bad easily, also see poor reviews under same version in white. Just past the 90 day waranty which I should have expected from this manufacturer. There are other options, even some not FM transmitters such as iPod speaker systems for around the same retail price. Be warned about the 90 day waranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong value, great design, not for big cities","review":"I bought this DLO Transpod (black) after waiting some time to make sure there was a product on the market I could live with and not be disappointed by. I got it just before a road trip from Nashville to Gulf Shores, AL and it worked wonderfully. I could not have been more impressed, CD-quality sound with no static or interruptions. Now driving to work every day in Nashville I sometimes have to switch stations to ensure there is no static or interference, and songs with a lot of bass (hip-hop mostly) do cause a little static from time to time, but overall no regrets. I'd say if you lived in Atlanta or a city over a couple million people with lots of radio stations, you might want to spend more and invest in a direct hard-wired solution (I have a Honda Accord and considered it but would lose the satellite radio option should I ever decide to use it). For me this was an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget FM transmission...","review":"I've had my DLO for about 5 years now and it's still going strong. Personally, anyone telling you that they get \\"excellent\\" sound quality from an FM transmission doesn't know quality sound at all. It's not possible to get that kind of dynamic range from this or any other product's FM transmitter. I do not like any FM transmitter I've heard. Ever. Period.Why the 5 stars then? I use the AUX-OUT on the DLO to connect to my CD player's AUX-IN to get the best possible sound from an MP3. Noting that MP3's are inherently lesser sound quality than a CD, this setup allows the signal the least degradation possible before hitting your ears.The DLO is absolutely the best solution for this type of use... and I've tried them all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I have 3 of the older, white Transpod units. I purchased this one to better match my black video iPod. I was very pleased with the quality of my older Transpod units and have even given several as gifts. Honestly this one sucks. For my taste it is unusable. Maybe it would be passable for rap music, but for instrumentals or music other than gangster type, the music is not clear. It is not static or interferance, and I tried all frequency ranges. The quality of the output signal is terrible. I tried my old one again, and while it is not as pretty, it works great. Unfortunately I cannot return it because I threw away the packaging not expecting it to be junk. If you purchase one of these you will be very disappointed with the quality of the sound. If you can find one of the older Transpod units for earlier iPods you will be much better off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of it's Kind.","review":"Well, this is an excellent product. Out of all of the car-mounting, charging, docking, transmitters, this one offeres the highest quality and best performance available. It however, is not perfect. The only issue with it is that the volume is preset inthe machine itself, so it will only go as loud as your car stereo will allow, not as loud as the ipod AND the stereo. That's still respectively loud without distortion. So all in all, it's a quality product, a little on the pricy side, but as far as this arena goes, ya get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad for the money","review":"I first tried the iTrip for my Ipod and wasn't impressed. There was too much static and the least little touch caused noise. I've been much happier with the Transpod. I don't know if it's because it is plugged into something metal in the dash or what but the reception is much better, and it makes a nice dash mount holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Favorite iPod accessory!","review":"We have had a wonderful experience with the Transpot In-Car Cradle. Compared to the Griffin iTrip and casette audio adaptor, this device is a jem! We have used it for a few months on several long drives and local city commute, and find that it is worth every penny. It's key for long trips to have your iPod being charged as you drive. Also, the sound quality is great. Far superior to the iTrip. It's a breeze to change the station even while driving through various cities. The arm extends to a convenient height while keeping the iPod safe. We enjoy it so much we are purchasing it as gifts for friends.Edit: two years laterWe still love this TransPod, and have never experienced any difficulty or fault with it. Also, unlike other devices that claim to be the same, this one will never burn out your iPod battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...","review":"My husband and I had some old DLO transpod's that we purchased when they first came out. They were awesome and lasted for about 3 years with tons of use and being left in cold and hot vehicles constantly. My husbands transpod started to sound a little funky, so I purchased this new one for him. Since day 1 the new transpod didn't work properly. The sound is \\"off\\" and only plays in 1 speaker of our truck. He started using his old transpod again, and it actually sounds better than the crappy new one! We are sending the new one back and we are hoping that the next one has great results like our first couple of transpod's had. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, works and looks good in the vehicle","review":"I have really enjoyed this item. It works just as described and looks good in the vehicle as well.

This was better than the Griffin products I tried, but you still cant' listen to classical music without being annoyed by all of the static.

It cannot charge and play at the same time it messes up. Super flimsy as if it moves around a little bit it would break.

The plugin for my car is sort of in a akward position for this transpod to fit nicely. Also, the ipod music comes across with a lot of static in some places while driving I have found. And because i had to use both arm attachments instead of just one, the transpod bounces up and down and is unstable...the ipod itself has fallen off of the transpod a few times...BUT if you have a car with the cigarette lighter plug as shown in the picture - it would probably work better.

Thankfully I didn't have to use the flimsy extension they provided as it JUST clears my shift when it is in park. The plug is also VERY tight and required (I think) considerable pressure to seat it in the auxiliary power outlet. Once I found an empty FM station and inserted the IPOD it worked extremely well.

Yesterday, when I pulled it out, the entire top part of it came apart. Some of it even was stuck in the lighter cavity, which I'm not sure how I'm going to get out.

It had me hooked for a while as having so much information packed in each sentence kept my interest; however, while that format works for an intimate scene between two people it has the opposite effect when it takes three pages to do simple tasks like getting dressed. Often, the action feels like it's extremely slow because so much information goes into every meticulous detail.There's also a section where we get to see what went on during the protagonist's childhood. Again, I was intrigued as it offered a view into what crafted Iago into the man he is, but then I was disappointed to find out that it became to BULK of the novel.Ultimately, this book had a lot of promise but the character never grows and the story (whatever there is) gets lost in the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsympathetic Main Character Makes This Book A Trial To Read","review":"I considered waiting until paperback for to read this book, and how I wish I had! Not only is Golding's writing style needlessly verbose (even the dialogue swims amid multi-page paragraphs), the main character, James/Iago is a snotty spoiled brat which makes it difficult to sympathize with his plight.

A total snore, and not highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too elaborate, very annoying to read","review":"The only thought I had reading this book is why the editor did not do his/her job (if any editor read it at all)? There are too many damn words. Sentences of about half a page long are not uncommon and horrible to read. By the end of the sentence you would have no idea what the beginning was about. Too many discussion of tiny insignificant details that are not important to the story, like elaborate descriptions of rooms. The constant flashbacks are very annoying. I lost track of the story and time frame we were in so many times. All this elaboration really took away the joy of reading because the story would 'stop' at so many times.

The reader may freely skip parts one and five of Mr Golding's novel, unless he needs to learn that some homosexuals are obsessively preoccupied with their own body and clothing and that because one of their major concerns in life is sex, their bound to be unhappy, their life being an abomination indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"The Abomination was not, for me, an easy novel to read. The writing is always excellent and in some parts, remarkable, but I personally found the narrator to be a little too hostile and angry. The world has not been kind to him--abandoned to boarding school by his parents at a young age, betrayed by friends, cruelly ridiculed by enemies--he has every right to be hostile. He's just not the best narrator to spend over 400 pages with.

First off, beware of duplication, this is the same show that is the 2nd disk of the Aura Anthology. You might as well get that if you want this show. The main problem with this one is it's badly recorded. The vocals are up front and too loud. This is not the proper way to hear Nico's voice. You can hear every flaw in her voice and it also takes any from the rest of the band. Her voice needs the echo of a club or hall and it needs distance. I would highly recommmend Do Or Die. This is great. It was properly recorded from the audience and not a line feed. To date Do or Die is the only Nico live release that properly captures her live sound. I think Nico knew this as Do or Die is one of the infamous tapes that she herself sold at shows.

I read it in two days! Will's Choice is A GREAT READ--WONDERFULLY WRITTEN, HEARTBREAKINGLY TOUCHING,AND EXTREMELY EYE OPENING! I also suffered from depression when I was a teenager. I picked up this book expecting to be drawn into the stories of Gail and Will, son and mother and their struggles to overcome depression. I was delighted to find that this book is part memoir-part educational tool filled with relevant tips and research to help all those who've suffered depression or know someone who has suffered from depression. I only wished Gail had written it a decade a go when I needed it most. Will's Choice is a page turner and made me I laughed and cried(Will's a very funny writer). But I also learned a lot from it. I've purchased copies for friends. Thank you, Gail, Will, Meghan et al for your bravery and courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book!","review":"There are no perfect families and there is no child without problems. When and how do we react as parents? Thank you Gail Griffith for sharing your story with us. This is an exceptionally poignant account of how a family deals with depression and teen suicide.We, as parents, are not prepared or professionally trained to handle such sensitive issues. More importantly, each individual child is unique and will react differently to alternative therapies. We must listen closely to those who have made the passage and learn from their experience. You will not regret reading this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really amazing, compassionate, and courageous book","review":"Everyone who suffers from depression, or knows someone who does, should read it for the important lessons it conveys.

The photographs are really poor (blurred, poorly lit) and only a few are in colour. I would have expected at least a clear description (with images) of the different colours Maine Coons available, but again here were only written descriptions.

Many other books on Maine Coon care (barrons,etc) are just generic cat care books, with Maine Coon pics inserted. The Maine Coon is different. Mainly because of its shear size and particular genetic health problems. The only other Maine Coon book that I would recommend is: Maine Coons, Popular Cats Series, Vol 2 by the editors of Cat Fancy Magazine (Jackie Franza). That Yankee Cat tells more of the history, character and basic care of Maine Coons. The later book is more up to date on all the specific health care and grooming requirements. If you are new to Maine Coons, both these books compliment each other and are a must for new owners.Maine Coons"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This CD was done on the cheap.

In fact, I ordered a 2nd last week for my daughter. It makes perfect hardboiled eggs in 8 minutes. No little measuring cup or the need to pierce the egg shell. You just fill it with water, put the top on and cook. I make 4 eggs every other day and so far each egg has been perfect. The peels slide right off. The only downfall to this unit is that it only makes 4 eggs. I am finding that 8 minutes every other day is not that big of a deal.

No cracked shells with egg white streaming through the hot water, and no risk of a boiled down pot if it gets forgotten. My only thought is that if it weren't quite so \\"cute\\" (egg shaped), it would be more flat on the bottom and less tipsy.

You do not \\"screw on the top and cook\\" as it says in the Amazon description. The top does not screw on.

I agree with other reviews that you need to do some experiments till you arrive at the right duration in the microwave (expect somewhere between 7 and 9 minutes) depending on the power of your appliance. Although the package inserts tells; you don't need to pierce the eggs, NO, if you want boiled eggs that are not cracked while cooking pierce them at the fat side. I use thumb tack or I tap the part to be pierced with the tip of a knife; if I don't I get around 50% of the eggs cracked and leaked. Another important tip that I used to omit, is to leave the eggs to cook for sometime after the end of the cooking time in the microwave (I leave them for 2 minutes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I call it \\"a good egg\\"","review":"Three parts to this little wonder: a bottom, middle, and top. The bottom has a fill line that you fill water to. The middle is Nordic Ware's egg-cradling tray that supports the 4 eggs you position into their nuking vessel. The top snaps into place to provide the thermo-dynamics that surround and help to cook the eggs.This product is dishwasher safe and easy. I like hard boiled eggs, so with my 1000 watt microwave, I warm eggs for 8 minutes. The directions chart also shows the times for soft and medium boiled with a few other wattage settings.This is not the first Nordic Ware kitchen product I've purchased.

Added to that--and more seriously--the cutesy factor of having the model shaped like an egg means that it isn't very stable.

Three eggs will be more done than four while using the same cooking time.

All in all, I now own two of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST","review":"Just got this item via Fedex. I am a lover of soft boiled eggs on toast. Always trying to guess the exact time etc, detered the old way.First use was right on. I filled the bottom with 374 grams of water, and added 30 sec to the cooking time to compensate for my 950 watts microwave [...], and the result was great. Make sure you fill it to the line exactly. I use digital scales which may be a bit excessive, but I'm retired and don't have that much to do on my off golf days. Highly recommended. The only problem I have found is that whites seem to stick to the shell, much more than the old way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy camper here!","review":"Love this little gadget.

This takes just as long, maybe longer, than cooking them on the stove. The results are variable - it's hard to figure out how long to cook them depending on the egg size. I don't remember that ever being an issue with eggs cooked on the stove.So, unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Eggs blew up twice!","review":"I've been using this product for about 3-4 months now.. and eggs blew up twice. Seems you have to keep with the same brand/size of eggs or if you buy another brand (even if the same size), they'll take less/more time and then blow up in a microwave. Very scary to hear the huge BOOM and extremely unreliable! After the blow up, the microwave is very hard to clean - but the worst is the top part of the egg cooker, blown up egg sticks to it and nothing will scrape it off.. i finally threw out mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get reading for exxxplosions","review":"I can't believe this product is rated so high. I have to admit it works pretty well 4/5 times - and on the fifth time one of the eggs will explode, blows the top off the lid, and you've got a nasty egg mess to clean you in your microwave. IT REALLY NEEDS A LATCH TO LOCK THE THE TOP ON! This is the 3rd time its happened to me so i'm giving this thing up. For some reason even after spending 20 minutes cleaning my microwave, and my entire kitchen still smells like eggs and i haven't been able to get rid it for days. i'm on the paleo diet so i need to make eggs quite often, so i'm going to spring up for the brun cooker and see how that goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eggsplosion!","review":"I've used this product for the past couple of months and I absolutely loved it! ...right up until this morning when it exploded in the microwave. My cats ran for cover and the KA-BOOM! sound nearly gave me heart failure... and then instead of breakfast I spent the next 45 minutes cleaning up the mess. There were eggs everywhere--on the counters, the stovetop, the floor -- every surface within 2 feet of the microwave got pelted with fine egg particles (and the microwave door was still closed). Well, it was nice while it lasted. I won't be buying another one though."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is wonderful!","review":"I love boiled eggs and I love egg salad but I've never been able to boil an egg consistently well. It seems like I always undercooked or overcooked. Even when I got it just right, peeling the shell ripped chunks out of the egg white. That problem is now solved. I have a 1300W Panasonic microwave and cooking 4 eggs on high for 9 minutes yielded PERFECT results. I could not be happier. However, there is one flaw in this device that prevents me from giving it 5 stars and that is opening it after it's done cooking. This baby is seriously hot coming out of the microwave so you MUST use oven mitts or something similar to handle it. Trying to open this smooth egg with oven mitts is like trying to trim your nose hair with a weedeater, it can be done but it's not easy and will likely be painful. I'll have to invest in some fairly thick rubber gloves to be able to grip this thing well enough to get it open while it's hot but other than that I really love this little bugger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the perfect egg!","review":"I keep this egg cooker on my countertop, and use it frequently. It's so easy, and I just cook my eggs for 9 minutes in my 700 watt compact microwave oven, let them sit for a while - sometimes I forget them altogether, but the cooker makes very good hard boiled eggs. I have never cooked less than 4, and always make sure I have enough water in the bottom. No explosions here."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great while it lasted, then it blew up and made a huge mess","review":"I had owned this for a few years and been very happy with it when a massive EGGSPLOSION happened last night. I heard a boom, went into the kitchen, and saw that the microwave door was open and there was mostly-cooked egg all over the inside of the microwave.

I love kitchen gadgets, but this one wasn't worth keeping. The only reason I'd suggest buying this is if you don't have a stove. If you live in a dorm or want to make eggs in a hotel with just a microwave, this might be good.If you have a proper kitchen with a saucepan at your disposal just boil your eggs the old fashioned way:5-steps to Boiling Eggs:1. Place eggs in saucepan with water about 1\\"-2\\" over the eggs.2. Bring pot to a boil, no lid.3. Turn off the heat once boiling, put the cover on the saucepan.4. Set timer for about 12 minutes.5.

It sure seemed like an easy way to prepare my breakfast. And it was for about 4 days. Regulating the microwaving time allowed me soft boiled or hard as I desired.

Not soo fast. The cooker metal egg holder would not fit properly in the plastic cooker. I tried to make it work but it was hopeless so into the trash it went.

However, the design is very poor in regard to the user safety point of view that makes this product dangerous for a user.After being cooked in a microwave, the external surface is very hot and slippery. The upper cover got to easily stack to the lower part. I had a hard time to open this cooker as its smooth surface had no features to grab it and swing open, particularly with a paper towel. A boiling water inside of this cooker can be easily spilled on your hands. I had to cool down the cooker under cold water before opening it and getting the eggs. That precautions make use of this cooker longer and messier and way more dangerous than a conventional cooking in a pan.Stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"The whole egg cooker will not screw together properly.

Finally, the book helps the reader to understand that there really is no understanding a love like Tracy and Hepburn shared.

My 3 year old DS loves it. I can't wait until I have the new baby and can fully use it. When I compared it to the Baby Trend comparable stroller, I am completely satisfied.The only thing I wished the Joovy had (that Baby Trend does have) was a strap that goes across the handlebars in the back, so when my son stands up on the ledge, he doesn't fall back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont like it.","review":"The wheels lock when I put it into my SUV and its hard to get the stroller in. When I get it out of the trunk and lay it on the ground, the food tray is directly on the ground and I have a hard time trying not to let that happen. The pockets in the infant seat are way too small. Its very hard to push when both kids are in it. The baby doesnt seem to confortable when she falls asleep. My toddler seems to like it, but I honestly wish I never purchased it. I wish I hadn't given away my Graco stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max height problem","review":"I soon as I saw this stroller I fell in love with it. I have 2 kids. My son is 3 and my daughter is 1. I have a Graco Duo Glider and my son does not always like to ride it anymore he prefers to walk. So this would have been perfect for when he gets tired of walking. The only problem is that the max height for standing child is 40 inches. My son is already 41 inches. I have read reviews with people saying they put there 4 year old in them. Maybe my son is tall for his age?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this stroller","review":"I just purchased this stroller recently and even though I only used it a few times, I already love it! It's a lot lighter to push then the Duoglider (by Graco double stroller). My 3.5 year old loves to get off and on when he wants to, it is a lot easier then lifting him in and out. I have the organizer and I think it's a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller","review":"We went through several strollers before settling on this one a few years ago. Its been used a lot including several trips to Disney and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it all the time...","review":"I use this stroller for my baby and 4yr old and it has proved invaluable. The only this is I wish it had more storage room, but I guess that would defeat the purpose of it not being bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stroller","review":"I bought this stroller to accommodate my 3 year old as well as our new born. It has been a huge help, it is easy to open and close, while holding one baby in one arm as well as a diaper bag. The seat does not recline that much but kids fall asleep in the oddest places anyway. The backseat also has limited room for sitting the child in the back will have to sit very upright. My daughter did not mind it at all, and now she is four and still has no problem with it. She enjoys being able to see her sister in front of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"- It's a heavy stroller and doesn't fold up easy.

It is SO BIG and HEAVY. Its ridiculous feeling and so hard to push around. Also the seat in the back slides which is just annoying...I really wish I could return this item but I used it a few times. I am hoping to get more use out of it when my infant is grown. I am going to have to start lifting weights so I can get it in and out of the car with ease. I recommend spending the extra money for something lighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joovy Caboose","review":"The stroller is great, what I had expected. The only drawback is that I don't like the front tray. You can't get a child in or out without taking it completely off. Not very convenient. Luckily my kids are old enough I don't have to use it so it works for us. All in all a great stroller that we love to use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as great as I thought it would be:(","review":"I was looking for a stroller that I could carry a 8 month old and 18 month old. The back is uncomfortable and the 18 month old doesn't like it. But, I will say they said it was for an older child in the back.... But, its bulky and heavy to lift in the car and its wider than my car so its a bit difficult to put in. I have a Mazda prodege wagon... The lower basket is hard to get to to put your things... the hood gets in the way... I was disappointed:("},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!!","review":"The stroller is exactly what we wanted and it was so easy to put together! The kids love it, it is very easy to push and it arrived fairly quickly. I would recommend this stroller to anyone with 2 kids, my 3 year old loves to ride on back sitting or standing, and my 1 and a half year old loves to be right up front. It's great on turns and has a little room in the basket below. Great for walks to the park, library, at the mall or at the museum."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS STROLLER!!!!","review":"I absolutely love this stroller! I read all the reviews and did research on a variety of strollers and I definitely picked the best one for us. I have a three year old and one year old and the Joovy is awesome. My three year old loves that he can either sit or \\"take a ride\\". One review said that the front seat doesn't lay all the way back and although this is true, it does lean back more than I thought it would. My daughter that is one and rides in the front has taken a nap in there easily but may be difficult for smaller infants. I did not use the infant carrier b/c my little one is bigger but perhaps that is the answer for that issue. Overall, I love this stroller and can't find one thing that I don't like about it. It is very well made, easily to fold, and my new best friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fot two!","review":"This sroller is great. It is easy to push and turns easily in small spots. My only concern is that there isn't a lot of head room for the child sitting in the back, when you are using the car seat attachment (and a car seat) up front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!","review":"My wife and I have two kids. We have a toddler and a baby. We wanted a double stroller which both kids could fit in, but didn't want a side-by-side stroller or something cumbersome. This stroller is a perfect fit. The footprint is almost the size of a single child stroller, but fits both kids without issue. We're also loving the lifetime warranty. We had a small issue with the sun-shade and JOOVY took care of it right away. Love a company which stands behind its product!

Our only regret is that we didn't order the rain cover as well. Also the joovy cool essentialsParent organiser could not be shipped to our address?Very happy customer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inadequate storage space","review":"Overall we are pleased with this purchase, however the primary complaint is the very limited storage space. I certainly can't stash my diaper bag in the storage basket and even with smaller items it's a nuisance trying to stuff them in there and even more so when you're trying to get them back out. Also, while the stand-on area is great in theory... it's not very comfortable for the older siblings especially when the car seat is hooked on to the stroller for our newborn. finally, i recommend that parents buy the accessory pouch because otherwise you're stuck carrying small things like keys, pacifiers that you want quick and easy access to. Other than that, it's comfy, stylish (we have the green) and easy to maneuver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for baby and preschooler!","review":"Bought this stroller because my 2 year old would not sit in our single stroller and we now have a 4 month old. We traveled for Christmas and this stroller was perfect for the airport and visits to stores. It is a bit heavy, but what else can you expect from a double stroller? It folds up almost as well as our City Mini but is a little bulkier. Overall this is the smallest double I have seen.This stroller is also very sturdy. My very active toddler was swinging from the handle with nothing else attached to the stroller and it did not flip or even fall over. I also love that the back \\"seat\\" is adjustable, sliding back and forth to where your child prefers it. (The seat belt in the back was also a must for us) There are lots of ways your older child can ride. This stroller is perfect for anyone with two small children.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and Sturdy","review":"Great Stroller. My toddler loves to ride on the back. Makes him feel like a big boy! Only complaint is if the front seat is in car seat mode you have to recline the seat back, so if your toddler is sitting, the seat back sticks into their head and they have to lean forward. But this will only last until my baby is out of his carseat. Would recommend this stroller to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS STROLLER","review":"I wish I would have bought this when my 2nd child was born. We had 2 separate strollers we would use for the kids and anytime we went somewhere they would take turns CRYING on wanting out. Half the time we were pushing around an empty stroller. We wanted a double but didn't want to go a store and be bumping into EVERYTHING because it was to wide or to big. This stroller is great, it's not crazy long so its easy to push and it's not wide since the kids aren't side by side. My 3 yr old loves that she can stand or sit and thinks of this as a ride not a stroller. So most of the time she stays on and when she does want off we at least don't have to be pushing around and empty stroller. For a double I feel it's way COMPACT I don't feel like I'm pushing around a bus. WE ARE SO HAPPY WITH IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mobility with this stroller!","review":"I had a Graco Duoglider, and found that it was difficult to manuever when shopping. I saw someone with the Joovy Caboose at the mall, and thought it was worth a try. It is wonderful! My 2.5 year old loves being able to stand or sit. It is much easier to fold and to take in & out of the car than the Duoglider was. It is also much easier to steer in general (my husband said he felt like he was driving a BMW), but especially in tight spaces, like clothing stores and fitting rooms. There are 2 cons to the Caboose:#1 is that it has much less storage space than the Duoglider, so a traditional diaper bag doesn't fit well, and doesn't leave room for much else. #2 is that your toddler/preschooler can put his/her feet on the wheels or even on the ground when sitting on the bench, so you do have to instruct them about keeping their feet on the platform. Overall, I am really happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I just tried this stoller in the store and I have to say I was very disappointed. The concept is great, but they still have some work to do. The seat in back for the older child slides back and forth. Also, there really isnt much room to sit comfortably. My3 year old daughter, who is little and only weighs 26 lbs, didn't have much room. She had to lean forward when she was sitting. I asked her if she liked it and she said no, she wanted out. Also, who wants to sit facing backwards. All she has to look at is me!It really wasn't much better in the standing position either. Even though I know she really might not want to use it that often I would rather pay the same money and get the Graco double stoller. At least then when she wants to sit she can do so comfortably. When I put her in the Graco double stoller, she did not want to get out. She asked me to please take her for a ride around the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stroller, bad company service","review":"On my first use, the stroller restraining strap stitching started to unravel. This curtailed the use of the back portion of the stroller during the remainder of the trip (safety issue). So, I proceeded to called the company about the possible exchange of the stroller. The warranty on the back of the instructions says \\"satisfaction guaranteed\\". Apparently this is a small time operation because the same person handles all the customer service inquiries. The person is insistent on having everything repaired regardless what the warranty says. They don't care who repairs the stroller stitching. They referred me to a shoe repair shop they never dealt with before. Apparently satisfaction guaranteed means repair at all costs even when you get a stroller with poor workmanship. It says something about the company. I would never buy a Joovy. Imagine what kind of service you get once you are out of warranty. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Design Flaws","review":"This is a great concept for an innovative stroller. I love that my [...] old can fit in the same stroller with out dragging out the double stroller. However, after using this stroller for 3 months, I returned it. There are several design flaws that were driving me crazy. First off, the front footrest was horrible. It has a flip-up design that does not allow my son's legs to rest on anything when it was in the down position. The footrest had to either be up at all times or my child's feet would flop over because there is no room for them. In addition, the front seat is very shallow and my son needed to be belted at all times or he would slide right out. Also, the tray is very difficult to remove and the stroller didn't break-down with ease (it was stuck opened several occasions). So, therefore I returned it and found another brand (same style) with out any of the flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIGHTMARE!!!!","review":"Where do I start????

I LOVE it. My active 3 year old actually ENJOYS being able to sit on the bench for our walks, and my 5 month old likes it too. The basket is easy enough to get into once you figure out the bench moves. ;)2 things - 1, I wish the seat straps in the front seat were softer or padded. My baby fell asleep in the stroller, and the strap rubbed a raw spot on her neck. 2, I wish there were hoods covering the back wheels. It took all of 5 minutes for my toddler to realize she could rest her feet on the wheels, which not only wears her shoes down, it makes the stroller harder to push."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I got this stroller as a gift along with the baby trend sit and stand. When I put them both together it was clear which one was the better stroller. The Joovy leaves very little room for the toddler to sit once the car seat is in place. However the sit and stand has plenty of room along with cup holders for the parent and child as the child gets older. Even the person at babies r us said he returned is because of the same problem. I live in the city and need something that isn't as big as a double stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for toddler on the go","review":"We got this stroller after our 2 1/2 yr old son decided he would prefer to push his 4 wk old brother, rather than ride in the regular tandem OR the side by side. We sold this stroller to him as the \\"big brother stroller\\" that he could ride behind, or sit down when he gets tired. He really likes it. His father and I absolutely love it. Our oldest son will stand & ride every time. Now we are using it with our Graco carrier, and the boys are facing each other. I would have given it five stars, but when you're using the carrier, it's impossible to access the storage basket (I read where someone had a zipper put in a different stroller's basket, so I might try that), and no cup holder or anything for storage for the parents. It's so easy to maneuver & to fold up. It's not very light, but it's not heavy, either. We love it. Highly recommend the Joovy stand-on tandem for anyone who has a toddler who wants to be the \\"big\\" brother or sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"vey satisfied","review":"it is a very good product for the use it is designed for. i bought it now that I have 3 kids. when the 2 of them are on it, our walk is very pleasant. the plus is i can use it also for the new born using the carseat. the old one has also the opportunity to rest whenever she needs. the truth is that it is a bit heavy for me to push but everything has a \\"cost\\". overall very satisfied with this stroller and gad i bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stroller","review":"First out of the box, I was so impressed with the quality and look of this stroller. It was easy to put together and it is easy to use. I love that it is not much bigger than our single stroller...so much smaller than most other types of double strollers out there. I have a 2 1/2 year old and a newborn. My 2 1/2 year old loves to be up running around mostly and only sometimes wants to sit down while we are out and about, so this was the perfect solution. He also thinks it is fun that he has a \\"special seat\\" all for him and can also stand and ride. I also love the fact that I can use our bucket carrier for my infant until she can sit on her own.The stroller is very easy to fold up and so much lighter than other doubles I have looked at. One suggestion, make sure you purchase the parent organizer which doesn't come with this stroller (but should!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller","review":"Love this stroller. I am getting a second stroller because we use the other so much. It is lightweight and small. Easy to push. It would be nice to have more store more, but I make do stringing a bag over the back. Definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Joovy","review":"This is my second Joovy, we already have the Kooper but needed this double when baby girl came along. It moves great and folds down very flat. The easy fold to close it is nice too. I wish it had an area for hot beverages like some other double stand on strollers, but that's not a huge deal. My son loves sitting on the back, and acts like it's more of a \\"ride\\" for him, than a stroller, he gets on and off with ease and it's great for not having to lift him in and out of a seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not very light, but pretty convenient","review":"The assemblying is very easy. I got it set up within 30 mins even with my kid playing around. Since then, I have been using it for more than 2 months and have used it a lot. My overall impression to it is very satisfactory. It's still a little heavy. I guess it's because it's basically a double stroller, and it's indeed very sturdy. By that means, you can not take it out of your luggage chunk and open it by only one hand. With two hands working together, it's very easy to fold and open it. The tip is that before you fold it, locking the rear wheel, then you can easily pull the tab and fold the stroller by stepping on the rear foot-step.The cons is that its front tray has to be inserted and clipped, not easy to take out and put back. It's not like some other strollers whose tray can be swirled and latched, a convenience when your kids are wearing heavy cloth in winter. That's the only complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm, not so satisfying....","review":"I got this item thinking that it was the best thing on the market. while it can be nice for short jaunts, it is not a good choice for long days at the zoo or other amusement park. the basket area is too small, we wound up having to tie things to the sides to keep them on. If the baby carrier is in the front, the child in back sits awkwardly. So we set the baby carrier on the back (somehow), but this was an unsafe way (thank goodness the cart didn't get away from us, and you can't use the canopy if the baby carrier is in the front. Additionally, I don't like that there isn't a real seat for the child in back. Again, this is a great stroller for short trips, but when your two year old gets tired...they are not going to be able to sit comfortbly in the jump seat. I am going to shelve this stroller and purchase a sit and stand deluxe. The baskets are bigger, there is the second seat option for the child in back, and I think overall...a better stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hate this stroller","review":"This is a great stroller for 1 child but not for 2It was impossible for my 2 year old to sit or stand in the back with my 1 month old riding in the front which I thought was the entire point of this strollerIt is only a good buy if both of your children are old enough to ride in the seats only the infant carrier part is completely useless !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want to ruin your back, buy this stroller","review":"I have had this stroller for 3 years. It is heavy and ver hard to manuever once our children passed a year old. For two years I have been highly annoyed at having to fight with my stroller everyday. Now in year 3 I am having serious back issues - which I attribute largely to this stroller. Save your back and a lot of chiropractic $$$. If you plan on doing a lot of walking or will be putting this stroller in/out of your trunk, buy yourself a good stroller that is easy to push and light enough to lift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Double! LIGHT WEIGHT","review":"Great Double, turns on a dime!!! and is the lightest double stroller I have pushed. Like that the back has a option to stand or sit. Great for our two year old who doesn't really like to sit all the time. She can stand to enjoy the ride aswell. I just don't like that the front seat does not recline. but if it did the back child could not sit. It allows you to place the car seat in so for a younger infant sleeping it great! Easy to push, great price, both kids love it, Plus I got the purple perfect for our two girls!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than ideal...","review":"I researched the purchase of this stroller quite a bit. I have to say, I am disappointed with the purchase.1) If you put a car seat at the front of it, it is not comfortable for the toddler to sit at the back side. My son complains about it non-stop. If he stands, he is fine.2) The stroller is heavy and oddly shaped, making it difficult to fit into car/closets...but I was not too upset by this.3) My husband and I went for a walk where there were some rocks on the road, not many. When I got home, there was a rock lodged into one of the wheels. I pulled it out as it was making it ride uneven, and there was a huge hole in the cheap wheel form this tiny rock.4) The cloth on the stroller is fraying with only minimal use.Luckily, Amazon has great customer service!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Stroller, can't live without it!!","review":"This is by far my favorite duo stroller and I have had many others.

I drive a Mazda Protege5 which is a hatchback and the stroller does not fit unless I jam it in and slam the trunk shut! I have had a Bugaboo and a Bob and both have fit with no problem. Big bummer. The other issue is that if you have a car seat on the front there is NO way an older kid can fit on the back. I figured when my little one could sit up in the stroller my older one could ride more comfortably. I was wrong. My kids are tiny and they both seem really uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bulky and hard to steer","review":"I used this stroller only once and it was so heavy and hard to push and steer that I got rid of it. Great idea but heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite","review":"The good things: the price, the stand on platform, steering, the length. The bad: the storage underneath is TINY and not accessible at all, to use a car seat in the front you have to use an adapter which does not fold up with the rest, and the seat for the older child moves (which might be a plus for someone, I don't know, but my daughter was sliding all around knocking her head into the car seat).I drove it around and tried to use it for all of an hour before packing it back up and returning it for the new Baby Trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, poor design.","review":"I bought this stroller because I found it on sale for almost the same price as a ride on board attachment for my stroller that I already have. I ended up selling it 2 weeks later. My 4 year old and 7 year old did like the back seat..but did not fit under the canopy. My 3 year old fit in the front seat..but the tray does not come off easily so I had to lift him in and out..and that gets old fast!! The basket is nice, and the fabric is high quality, but I went back to my bob revolution duallie and used the money from selling this to just buy the adapter to the duallie that I am very happy with."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best stroller for 2 ever!","review":"This stroller is totally awesome! I have a 2 1/4 year old and a 5 month old, at first I thought my older daughter wouldn't like sitting in the back, but she loves being able to sit or stand. The stroller very light and manueverable, even more so that the traditional single strollers. It folds down very flat and fits nicely in the back of my station wagon, not so with the traditional tandem strollers. I've tried them all, this one is absolutely the best, bar none.Also, the customer service is phenomenal! I had a problem with one of the tires, Joovy is sending me a brand new stroller so they can investigate why the tire is defective. Talk about customer service, its refreshing to come across a company that care so much about quality and accountability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for an infant seat and a toddler","review":"I bought this stroller in March just before the birth of our little one. My older daughter has just turned three and is pretty small for her age. When we finally put the stroller together to use we realized that with the infant seat attached, there is no room for our daughter to sit or stand (which is the purpose of the stroller am I wrong?) The basket is almost inaccessible once the little ones are using the stroller. I might hold onto it for use once my newbie is old enough to sit up on her own, but really seems WAY too small for two kiddos."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I am loving this stroller so far. Very easy to open and close. Only complaint is that is is hard for my toddler to sit on the seat when I have my infant in the car seat in the front.

Even my husband thinks I made a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I bought this stroller wondering if I would really like it. After two months of use it is the best double stroller on the market. I agree that a parent tray and better access to the basket would make it better, but the compact size really is what makes it better. My four year old son just loves it. He can stand or sit, but more importantly feels like a grown up because he can decide what to do by himself. We never use the rear harness and he really likes the freedom. My four month old rides comfortable in a Britax car seat in the front."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for small kids and on flat surfaces.","review":"We bought this stroller for the Summer knowing we would be out for long periods of time and my older children would eventually get tired of walking. Very quickly we found that we were on the grass a lot visiting parks, festivals and fairs etc. This stroller performs very poorly in these conditions, is hard to push and we can only push one child, our 2year old, in these conditions. Even on flat surfaces it is hard to push with 2 children, our 2 and 4 year old, in the stroller. I love the concept, but does not live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller","review":"This stroller is a great alternative to a full-size double stroller. My daughter is 4 and I just had a baby, and it's perfect. The only drawbacks I've found so far are the lack of cup holders, and the basket underneath is rather useless, at least as far as being able to fit a diaper bag or anything of bulk besides a couple jackets. If these problems were resolved, it would be a 5 star stroller! I got the lemontree color and I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you have muscles!","review":"This stroller moves and handles ok, but man is it heavy!! Folding it is quite large and barely fits in my crossover SUV trunk. We are using the infant car attachment and it won't fit in my trunk unless i detach that part. The sit-on part is pretty teeny when the front seat is reclined, which is how it has to be when using the infant seat. I would not recommend this sroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sturdy stroller...one thing though","review":"This is an awesome stroller. One of the sturdiest ones I've had! Smooth riding and turns on a dime! The only complaint I have is the net underneath to hold the diaper bag is pretty small. I had to shove and I do mean SHOVE my diaper bag down in it, and NOTHING else will fit under there. I also think it should have come with a parent tray or something similar to hang on the handle. Other than that this is a really nice very sturdy stroller. Plenty of room for the kiddos. :-) The Appletree color is very nice as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joovy Caboose","review":"I love this stroller, easy to go around about with my two kids specially when we go out for a day. The only problem is when the front seat recline down, my two year old does not have much room to seat at the back when he doesn't feel like standing.But overall I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came with a hole in it","review":"These gloves are inexpensive, but they're also cheap. They came with a hole already in one of the fingers on the seam. I don't expect a lot from costume gloves that are this inexpensive, but I also don't expect them to be that faulty. It's not a huge deal, as I can sew them, but really. They are adult size but are kind of small for many adult hands, especially males. Other than that they are really just basic white gloves. I imagine they'd serve your purpose as long as they arrive without a hole in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stellar compilation","review":"Get this, get this, get this if you can find it.

But, look at who you get on this: Yayo, Daniel Santos, Celia, Bienvenidos, etc. It's absolutely amazing from the start of Disc One to the end of Disc Two and is, in typical ORFEON form, in fantastic sound quality. It's worth the cost of the cd alone just to hear \\"OYEME MAMA\\" by Bienvenidos Granda.Again, get this now. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Allen obviously knows the business!","review":"My wife and I own a couple of hair salons in Cincinnati with 24 awesome people who work with us. We were hoping to find some creative ideas so that we can better promote the folks in our salons who aren't as busy as they'd like to be.Allen D'Angelo has written an easy to read, well thought out book which I would strongly suggest any salon owner read. I was shocked to find that he doesn't own a salon, but loves helping salon owners do marketing. This book has 67 Chapters with at least 5 - 20 suggestions in each chapter toward understanding and implementing marketing, something we salon people despite our creative backgrounds, have trouble with.Brandt and Joan JunkerPS: Sometimes we wonder if some of these reviews aren't written by friends of the authors, or the authors competition. We don't know Allen or any of his competitors. We did buy 101 Marketing Ideas by Nanette Miller and were disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and dated","review":"This book is simply a list of things you can do to promote your salon. It is hard to read and boring. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"I wish I would have looked at the date it was published. The information is outdated and obsolete. I was looking for more current marketing strategies using the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid development environment","review":"I have been a user of Metrowerks CodeWarrior since almost the very first version, as a student programmer. Prior to Mac OS X, it was *the* development tool for Mac developers.One of the things I like best about CodeWarrior is that it comes with both the Mac OS and Windows versions; I've literally worked on my projects on both Mac and Win, sharing the files between the two (not the project file, though).Overall, recommended. If you're a Mac OS X user, though, try using ProjectBuilder first, since that comes for free, and may do what you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to spark my interest...","review":"I picked up this short-story collection because someone had gushed about how wonderful it was. However, I was not able to get into any of the stories. The situations failed to spark my interest and the author's voice did not capture me the way other short-story writers have enthralled me. The only story I was able to finish was \\"The Tutor.\\" There was nothing special about the story, but it was the only one out of the five stories I was able to read from beginning to end without wanting to close the book and never open it again. This does not mean that Lucky Girls is a bad collection -- I was simply unable to get into it. And judging by some of the reviews below I was not the only one who had trouble enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlucky Reader","review":"This assemblage of stories about spoiled, vapid, and, worst of all, utterly ulikable young American females abroad is a shining example of how mind-numbingly poor Nell Freudenberger's writing can be. Reading her prose is like listening to a 17-year-old girl on the telephone with her friend -- a rampage of dead-end discussions and trivial details. Freudenberger throws around enough foreign words and phrases to lend to her excruciating tales the air of \\"diversity\\" required of any young author who wants to win awards and endorsements from the creative-writing-department Gestapo. This book is a pointless mess and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"This book is very bad from the beginning. Boring prose, dull characters, trite themes fill this book. Please save your money!I wish these publishing houses would stop trying so badly to promote the hottest \\"cutting edge\\" young author who really can't write her way out of a hat. I am pleased to see that others agree with my review.Note to Deb- don't use big words you don't understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is good who cares about the hype?","review":"A very solid first collection. A lot of the reviews below, which talk more about marketing and advances, are clearly sour grapes from jealous would-be writers. Who cares how much she got paid?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd like it, but...","review":"It's funny--most of the positive reviews for this book seem to be from the New York area--where the author is from--I feel fairly certain they're friends of hers. The strories here are just dismally mediocre, the \\"musings\\" of the socially privileged and insulated..the author just doesn't seem to have anything to say. It's certainly not envy that provokes me to write this--I am a reader, not a writer--I cheer every time a good book comes into the world but this one made me sigh with frustration. It's just...flat and amateurish. I think the so-called \\"jealous\\" reviews below are more bewilderment that this author has gotten so much unwarranted media attention when there are so many worthier candidates...sigh--better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Narcissists","review":"Simplistic, cliched, shallow, not well developed, unlikeable and uninsteresting aimless characters with hollow lives populate this book of long winded stories. The author admitted in an interview that most of these stories were the salvage of a single failed novel attempt, and it shows.Every story has at least one young woman who is just like a young woman in all the other stories. Her name and biographic details change but she has the same personality in each story, the same narcissistic, selfish outlook on life, almost sociopathic, where all other people are viewed as objects from which she tries to gain advantage or pleasure.In the end of just about each story the main character is not proven wrong in any way, but is vindicated, which makes the stories read like lectures. You can just see the finger wagging in your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and amateurish","review":"I knew nothing of this author when I picked up this book and find all the back and forthing in these reviews pretty amusing.This is a perfectly OK collection of stories but nothing special. This is not some \\"talent for the ages\\" that some in the Eastern establishment seemed to have decreed. It's competent if rather shallow writing, standard-issue \\"Iike, I totally didn't know what I wanted to do with my life so I went and got an M.F.A\\" stuff.."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better for your money","review":"Simply put, this book is fine. It won't stay with you, however, nor will you find it particularly moving while you're reading it. I mean--well, it's fine. And that's not exactly what I look for in a book, and I doubt you do either. If you're interested, my advice is wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and dull","review":"It's funny everyone keeps talking about the hype I hadn't heard any of it--have I been living on a different planet or something?--but I did think this book had an attractive cover and I generally like short fiction so I gave it a go. Well it failed to engage me in any significant way. The narrators and characters are completely stock and the writing is self-conscious and pretentious and precious. For short fiction I recommend Lorrie Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a waste of my time","review":"I am not at all pleased to give bad reviews but I agree with winfieldscott to the fullest. At the end of each story I was left wondering...what the heck was that story about? So I would actually sit down and read the story again, thinking that I hadnt caught the *boom* I thought maybe it was so subtle, in a word or single sentence...disappointingly there was never any *boom* just a whole lot of \\"what the...\\" It took twice the time to read with no pay off. Perhaps even if her writing was beautiful I feel I couldve overlooked the poor story lines. The writing was not beautiful, but confusing and rather weak. I am so sorely disapointed. I couldve used my 14 bucks to buy underwear or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"merely \\"okay\\"","review":"This book presents an interesting dilemna--not good enough to be something memorable, but not bad enough to be a complete train wreck. The author has clearly spent time researching and revising. Although meticulous, her writing is not strong enough to carry this book without the \\"spark\\" of something like a plot, deeper insight, more humor, etc.These stories are all about expat, young, upperclass women living in Asia. I'm amazed by how stories set in the most exotic (At least from the perspective of a middle class person living in the US) places can be described in such an uninteresting manner.Many reviewers seem angry that this book was offered a $500,000 advance, when it of such an average, writer's workshop quality. These reviewers should remember to review novels solely on their merits, not over any bitterness or anger towards the author. For a truly interesting and well written novel about expat women, read \\"Interesting Women\\" by Andrea Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"exquisite","review":"It's sad that the whiny, undereducated people below have nothing better to do than trash this book. It's an exquisite, elegiac, subtle and very unusual collection. It has it's weaknesses, but it remains the best debut of the year, and I've read everything. Read it.An addendum: the \\"reader\\" below has given one star to every book he's ever reviewed (and trashed) except for American Psycho. Nice going reader. But get a dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up","review":"While Jane Austen's reputation is safe (as is Meg Cabot's), I think we'll hear more from Ms. Freudenberger. This isn't a great book, but I think it's a very good book from a young writer who is learning her voice and honing her craft. I don't have the book in front of me, so can't name them all, but I thought the last story and Tutor were the best....the last one was uneven, but tackled some very tough subjects with alacrity and skill. In two or three of the stories, including Tutor, I was impressed with her ability to, I think, accurately depict sexual yearning in the protagonists; when the men felt it, they wanted to mastrubate and when the women felt it, they wanted tot alk about it with their friends. BTW, I think her picture on the book jacket shows a cute young woman, but I can not imagine anyone calling her hot just from that; but I'm a middle-aged former English major, so what do I know about that stuff these days?:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent new read","review":"This new collection is great. I hadn't read the story that was published in the New Yorker, and I was very impressed. The tone is mature, the pace is fast, and the charecters are quite well developed. Altogether, a gripping read. I have bought it as a gift for 2 friends since. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick-lit trying to pass itself off as literature","review":"This is yet another chick collection of stories- fluff to say the least that is trying to pass itself off as real literature. Nell's prose is flat and dull- no flair for language or words. Just because you can type sentences does not make someone a writer, just as brick laying doesn't make someone an archetecht. I'd put her writing at an Elizabeth Wertzel level- by the time her 2nd or 3rd book comes around no one will care about her, just as Wertzel has faded. (Although I have to say that Wertzel is overall a better writer- and wow, they both went to Harvard- the spawn of bad writers). Readers make the publishers look smart for advertizing this juvenile writing to the world & leading people to buy it. Luckily my book belongs to the library. Don't waste your money or time on these trite tales. Hopefully Nell will go away, and soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stands up in comparison??","review":"Lucky Girls stories stand up in comparison to Interpreter of Maladies? You must be smoking whatever the author of this awful book was. I dont have anything to gain by giving a bad review. I just did not enjoy this book. The characters were not likeable, the stories were not exciting, some didnt even make sense. To compare Lucky Girls to Interpreters is ludicrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Over hyped and surprise, surprise--under delivering! I'm all about the under-30 voice in fiction, attractive writers too, male and female, but this is simply absurd. In the end, it comes down to 1. a compelling narrative voice and story, or, 2. not great writing, but a fun dishy read. This book delivers on neither account. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book reads like someone's senior year project for a Literature B.A. program. If you want to read about Asia- go for Salman Rushdie or Arundhati Roy, not the writings of a spoiled and petulant American girl. If you want to read about unhappy young women - read Jane Austen or maybe just pick up a copy of Seventeen magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"I knew the author in college and enjoyed her fiction for the Harvard Advocate, admittedly against my will.I read this collection hoping that the spark she had shown back then had developed into something more substantial. Unfortunately, \\"lucky girls\\" is as unimpressive as she was--mediocre, pretentious, run-of-the-mill with a passably attractive cover.My advice to Nell: Better luck next time (though perhaps her luck has run out--much has been wasted on this overhyped collection). There's talent in there somewhere....but these stories ain't where it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at American women abroad","review":"There are no weak stories in Lucky Girls, yet a couple dazzle more than others. Each presents a look from the perspective of an American woman, in her 20s to 40s, with ties to Asia. The writing is very accessible, and also gives us access into the worlds of these five \\"lucky girls\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand the hype.","review":"I gave this my best shot, but was left feeling cheated, after all the buzz surrounding this author.

This author would be a great tween novelist - you know, coming of age stories for 15 year olds, stuff like that. Like the Sweet Valley High books, that's what she should be writing. i didn't get a real feel of any depth from any of the characters and I found the sex scenes gratuitous and boring. Also, having been to Asia myself, her little infobites about the locations of her stories seemed to be taken straight of guidebooks to Asia. (Details from the 1st story in the book for example -yes, the taj is closed on Mondays and there may have been a twin black Taj built across from it --- I bet the author read that info in the same place I did- the Taj chapter in the Rough Guide to India!) This is pop stuff, pretending to be high art. so, two thumbs down. I bet her publishers feel pretty dumb now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Girls - But Lucky at What?","review":"I read the book based on a strong review, but I was greatly disappointed. The stories are all well-written, but after each one, I wondered what I had read. What was the point? What was the author saying? The stories seemed to be about spoiled girls from comfortable families just going aimlessly through life. The girls had no goals, so they could not be faulted for making no effort to reach them.

It's just not. It's a perfectly pleasant book of short stories some better than others but almost uniformly mediocre. There are sooo many better writers out there, young and old, male and female. I wish there were some way to take some of the publicity this overprivileged girl has gotten--she was photographed in Entertainment Weekly next to a bowl of cherries--I mean, why?--and spread the wealth a little to the more deserving.
