If you would like to connect your Palm V or Vx to two computers, I suggest you either buy another cradle, or pack your cradle. A cradle takes up as much space as this travel kit, and it's better.

Some have said they would just like the hotsync cradle to connect with their laptops. Personally I only need the recharger as I can Hotsync using the infrared capabilities of the Palm (available on the Palm OS 3.3 upgrade) and I plan to do away with the laptop almost completely when the keyboard and modem arrive.

The sync attachement is good for using other peoples computers to do a quick program download.Since my palm is ESSENTIAL to my life, i find this a very useful product.

It is great to not have to carry around the full cradle just to charge the battery in my Palm Vx while I'm away from home and office. The extra sync cable is rarely useful for me, as I feel awkward syncing to someone else's machine but it has been handy for installing a needed program update or grabbing a new game while on the road.The only quibble I have is that the kit has a lot of bits to keep track of. A more elegant design would have one cable that connects to the Palm device with the other end capable of plugging into the charger or a sync connector, depending on your needs. That would perhaps enable the charger to have all the various international adapters in one unit instead of loose. Still, it is a valuable accessory and has been worth the cost for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty useful !!","review":"This is very useful addition for Palm for people who travel internationally.

I hope this is what you mean when you say that it is compatible with UK, Eurpoe etc. However my original power supply had a five pin socket that fitted on the back of the serial port connector.

It simply walks around and does it's own stuff. Could the show get any worse? Yes. The cat \\"sings\\" in it.

All of the mental preparation stuff is good, all of the advice on booking is good, some of the ideas about playing a tight game are good, but the solutions proposed by the author are things that even the most humble online regular knows.Aside from that, there are some really disturbing cop-outs. For example Vorhaus admits that there are online casinos which have simply robbed players of their money, but he won't tell us which ones they are because he wants us to \\"do our homework\\". What a joke. Let me get this straight, the book is all about how to make money by \\"Crushing the Internet Game\\" yet deliberately won't tell us which online sites are the con-artists?

Each chapter, with the exception of the first one, takes the work of one mathematician to analyze the mathematics of the period. One can argue with the book here and there (putting Einstein as a mathematician, covering very little of 20th century developments) but all in all this is a good volume.

But the best songs on this entire album are Tupac's hands down. \\"Late Night\\" just took over the whole album in terms of being a well produced track. \\"Mr. Officer\\" is cool also but I couldn't stand to hear Michel'le's annoying voice when she dosen't sing. If you are tired of cheaply produced No Limit-like songs then this solid album is for you, but if you don't want to hear the style- biting that this album has, then you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Somebody bought me this album by accident, when I asked for Chronic 2001.

There's some hardcore verses from Daz DIllinger, Kurupt, and Soopafly and a couple of Pac songs that are alright, but mediocre lyricists like \\"Tha Reelest\\" and \\"Mac-Shawn\\" make this album a bomb.

The movie shows us God's will for every one on earth. I wish what happened in this movie were expanded and happened a lot more. People would know what God truly desires and so many more people would have a purposeful/exciting/fulfilling life.I don't think the producers of this film would make up things, also I have seen what happened in this movie happen in real life.

The fact that this episode began in Nevada, and had no scenes take place in Denver or the Office of Billy Vail shows how this particular staff writer was unfamiliar with supporting characters. There was a lack of detailed descriptions, and a lack of validity in some areas of the book. How can 2 men, one with a bullet in his shoulder possibly herd 600 head of cattle.

They either just stopped working (ice in the pond), or trip the breaker because they are water logged. I live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, it very seldom freezes here, so they are only use 2-3 months a year. I'd suggest another brand, they seldom last more than a year!

But after calling to find out why I had still not received my order, I was told by their new call center in the Philippines that I would have to contact the third party directly. They also said they have no control over any part of that transaction and need to contact the seller (which I thought I was doing when I called Amazon).I won't order from Amazon again until they bring back the customer support they were known for.

Of course the same basic characters are there, but that is where the similarities stop. As my title suggests, this is another example of Alan Moore's ability as a writer and story teller. This volume, along with its sequel, are fantastic reads and are worth the money I paid for them. The story, dialogue, and art all fit together perfectly and there was never a moment I was not entertained. Perfect for any fan of Alan Moore or Graphic Novels in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alan Moore goes Victorian","review":"The most lighthearted tale even written by acclaimed comicbook scribe, Alan Moore, is likely the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Moore borrows characters from famous works in Victorian Literature, including Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, Alan Quartermain, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, and places them in a Justice League-type team, gathered together to find a stolen device capable of unleashing the horrors of aerial warfare on London. Moore constructs a dead-on parody of these high-flying romantic heroes; their stuffy attitudes and language; their utter political incorrectness; their obvious sexual hang-ups. Fans of Moore's darker work, such as Watchmen and From Hell, may be disappointed, but those of us who have read the rousing tails of adventure it masterfully parodies will find the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen entertaining and hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is good stuff!","review":"i had heard about the LoEG movie coming out, and i heard later that it was based on a comic book. being a new comic fan, i went out and got this, and i was impressed! the art is great, the premise is fantastic, the plot development is superb and these guys do a marvelous job of giving it that 19th century feel (the language, etc). if you have never read LoEG and want to start, start with this book. it is the first few issues where everyone is introduced, and it is just fabulous!this has been Apollyon"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Adventure","review":"The best part of this fantastic work, in my view, is the dialogue. Truly, this might be Moore's greatest effort at creating believable interactions between characters. I especially liked how he does this at the beginning of the story. The illustration work also is incredible, and leaves a reader fully in the world of the United Kingdom at its peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steampunk by Mad Magazine","review":"The characters are classic Victorian heros, the art is from Mad Magazine (Mort Drucker) and the story is fantastic H.

I liked the art in Marshall Law, and its just as well done here. All of the literary cameos are fun too.

Narrative passages at the end of each issue (Watchmen style) help add another dimension to the story.The idea of making a superhero team with the heroes from Victorian literature is very fresh. The plot twists a bit, but in the end, it's just that: a superhero story. But this is what Alan Moore is doing. He deconstructed superheroes in his seminal magnum opus, \\"Watchmen,\\" and now he's recreating them again with the entire line of \\"America's Best Comics.\\" On one hand, League is something truly unique and fresh, but on the other hand, it's still a comic that could have been published by Marvel."},{"rating":"1","title":"illegible","review":"If you're trying to read this on your phone then forget it. The print is far too small to read and nothing you do can improve it"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'm waiting to be impreshed...\\"","review":"Alan Moore is perhaps the finest author of graphic literature today - even all time. At his best (The Watchmen, Miracleman) he pushes the limits of the genre philosphically as well as artistically - questioning the very foundations of comics and superheroes. This may not be Alan Moore's best work, but it certainly is entertaining.Basically, this is The X-Men set in Victorian England and populated with characters from Victorian literature. In actuality, this is what comics were made for - creating an alternate universe where the Invisible Man and Mr. Hyde get together to do some damage. It is pretty-much a straightforward adventure story, told with Alan Moore's cynicism and wit. The artwork is much more mainstream than I am used to in the typical Moore story, but don't worry - there's plenty of blood and guts.I have not yet seen the movie, but I'm pretty sure the book will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Intro to Alan Moore","review":"Although Promethea's recent forray into preachy Sandman lecture style format has turned me off to some of Moore's writing, the League proves that he's still one of comics most formidable writing forces. This collection offers an excellent introduction to Moore's craft, and Kevin O'Neil's art really grows on you if you give it a chance. Whether you're looking for high drama or smart comedy, this collection kicks....and the next collection looks to be just as worthy of repeat readings. I've already gone through this one three times, and I'll probably read it again soon. Worth hunting down the online annotations also, sure to add depth to your enjoyment.And if you like this and want more Moore, I recommend Watchmen, Tomorrow Stories, Top Ten and From Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing colorist","review":"For 10 bucks you will find no better example of fine colorist work.

Even if you already know the story, you will likely find this volume well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I only have one complaint of this book, but it's big enough to knock four stars off the rating. It's extremely, *yawn*, boring. There's not much else to say; like it seems most of the reviewers here have, I've read Alan Moore's other work. Watchmen and Promethea both changed the way I looked at things, Promethea especially (the artwork and layout are beyond beautiful). But this dull piece of garbage is only filled with grey, or light brown, panels and slow, *yawn*, rambling, dross dialogue that I can only imagine the dullest of people enjoying. But still, Promethea is out of this world, even if this comic is chained to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"After reading comics such as Girl Genius and Archie comics, I feel like buying this book was a waste of money.

Thankfully, I started reading it before he did as it is very much an adult themed graphic novel, with a couple of rape scenes in the first half of Vol 1 alone. I haven't finished the book yet - just wanted to give a head's up to other parents out there before they made the same mistake I did. With Captain Nemo, et al. it never occurred to me that it would lean in this direction. Fine for me, just NOT AT ALL APPROPRIATE for preteens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I had seen the movie first, so thought I knew a little of what to expect.

The amplifier S53AMI blew and from what I have been able to learn on the web this is not an uncommon problem.

About a year after purchasing it, I had the same problem with the amplifier blowing and it was fixed under warranty. About a year ago the speaker sounded like it was blown and I discovered the plastic gasket or casing that holds the speaker in place broke and I will have to replace the woofer to the tune of 80.00 just to fix it. For now I have been keeping the volume down, but it only vibrates on really loud rumbles. Conveniently, there are no service centers in Northern California; I cringe at the thought of giving them 80 more dollars....grrr"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this subwoofer.","review":"Same problem here...loud Harley Davidson motorcycle noise emits from subwoofer when amp is off.

Never will buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your BU-120 before you call the police.","review":"I was out of town when our sub started to make it's noise in the middle of the night. My wife thought someone was in the house so she called the police who showed up, heard the noise and drew their guns before entering the movie room. I would have only given a rating of one star however thinking back on how much excitement this piece of equipment added to our lives I gave it an extra star.This is the second time this thing has given up and I'm not going through the hassle or expense of fixing it again. The first time was covered by warrenty only after infinity made me the middle man arguing with their approved service center for 2 weeks. Ya gotta love these warranties.... Ya we'll fix it, but we aint gonna make it easy on ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinity Powered Subwoofer, BU120","review":"Great subwoofer when it works but fails with a steady, loud, annoying burst of 120 cycle thumps. Infinity is know for great speakers, I have an entire surround sound system built around them. I cannot understand why they would jeopardize theirname based upon a poor design which really stresses the components or a good design that uses marginal components. Note! I am an electronic's engineer.... You would think that they would send out an announcement about the problem and offer a work around or recall the unit and offer something new. Too bad. Based upon the reviews and the bad luck I've have, it looks like I have to find something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinity BU120 review - replacement","review":"I, too, own an Infinity BU120 Subwoofer (since 1998) and have experienced two amplifier failures as described in the other reviews. The unit is currently making the machine gun popping sounds described by others. I contacted Infinity to buy a replacement amp and they are offering a new (not reconditioned) replacement unit - Model PS212BK Subwoofer (12\\", 400 watt) - delivered to my home for $227. After pricing other replacement subwoofers, I took them up on their offer. The new unit retails on the Infinity website for ~$574.

No matter.Gilbert Kaplan and others are definitely better among modern interpreters, and Klemperer has a great older recording on EMI."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the art and craft of Tarot","review":"As a Tarot reader and teacher for over 30 years I find this deck insulting to the art of Tarot and possibly harmful to the querent. It reduces a great divination system to the level of cootie catchers or the Magic 8 Ball. Sure, telephone psychics can use it when they know nothing about Tarot, but are they then calling themselves Tarot Readers simply because they can read the words off of a card? For this a client is spending $3.99/hour?! There are great books available on the Tarot.

I thought this set was really handy because the booklet includes basic instructions on laying out the cards and their relationship with one another, as well as providing an overview of the history of Tarot cards and the story of the cards themselves. The cards themselves include brief explanations of the meaning of each card in both the upright and reverse positions. Altogether, I found it easy to grasp. I was able to perform my first reading within a few minutes of finishing the instruction book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For The Beginner.","review":"This was my second tarot deck many many years ago. This is a perfect deck for novices and intermediate readers. I'm sure even advanced readers would like this deck to refresh their skills.

In addition, this deck facilitates readings because there are no thumbing through books for meanings. Excellent deck for the beginner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"There's something wonky with the product description.

The real surprise came the next day though when she suffered a loss of bowel control; she's never went #2 in the house since we got her over a year ago. Afterwards, we took her on a hike and she couldn't seem to stop \\"going\\", had 7 bowel movements on a 2 mile hike; and they were very watery. She's still not acting back to her normal self.

Thanks to the success of films like \\"Deep Throat\\" and \\"I am Curious Yellow,\\" for a brief time adult films moved into real first-run movie houses. These were movies shot on 35mm film with relatively high budgets. DEEP NOTE: Music of 1970s Adult Cinema captures the excitement and fun of these movies from the golden age of adult film with great soundtrack jazz, soul-jazz, and 70s era rock.

However, there is also some wacky trad jazz, some of which has some very erotic talking over the top of it. There is also some early space rock/synth pieces that feature experiments with moog and ARP sounds - the beginings of electronica maybe? there's also a few \\"soundbites\\" of people talking - not having sex, but talking about it - very funny. if you like Blowfly, you'll dig this too. Kinda something for everyone here: fusion fans, porno film fans, even a little post-rock sound (sort of like Tortoise, Mushroom, etc) , although recorded about 25 years before that genre was invented. Also a few country-rock instrumentals with some cool twang guitar.

The fijnal chapter in this episode remains to be written, but this represents an excellent review of the information at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting book - BUT...","review":"...Interesting book, worth to read by anyone who is seriously interested in Amelia Earhart's fate, but alas too much incorrect in many details, both technical and historical, so probably cannot be recommended for \\"unprepared\\" reader. Some claims are controversial, some picture captions are doubtful or just wrong, some statements in text are factually guesses without factual support etc. Especially sad is this repeating of old bizarre rumor about some alleged connection as if existed between Amelia Earhart and Japanese wartime broadcaster \\"Tokyo Rose\\" - pure myth that was debunked on a strict factual base since long ago.

It took me about 3 months to pry it out! Every song on the album is catchy in it's own way and I just can't wait for the follow up to come out. A nice blend of early Sheryl Crowe rhythms and chords mixed with the honesty of Sarah McLachlan's writing, it's a real keeper. She's a great entertainer live, and Philadelphia Flyers fans know how she can belt out the National Anthem.

They are pleasantly predictable--but this one had some wonderful surprises. For instance, we meet the characters when they are just children. The heroine is of gypsy descent, a first for any Regency I've read. The hero wears glasses, another first, and self-consciously doesn't wear them in order to fit into the Ton's image of a dashing young man. Ms. Skinner writes so well, it is easy to just zoom along on the hero and heroine's journey without being jarred by murky descriptions or poor dialogue. I highly recommend this read to anyone who enjoys a Regency but thinks they've read every possible plot line already.

The only merit I can see in groups like Cattle Decapitation is that their album artwork always pushes the definitions \\"sick\\" and \\"grotesque\\".A friend recently bought this on picture disc just for the artwork. I convinced him to play it to find out if the music was as repulsive as some of the song titles.What a hellish din! There are no 'songs' as most people understand a song to be, just a non-stop grinding assault on the senses. If this recording is popular anywhere, it must be in Hell's Top Ten.Of course, there are some people who pretend to like this sort of aural rubbish, but I can't imagine anyone serious about music finding any entertainment value in Human Jerky beyond the warped artwork that graces the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is a journey not a destination","review":"This book laid the ground work for a program of recovery that now serves over 2 million people world wide.

Alcoholics Anonymous publishes under 'World Services'....not 'AA Services'.This chameleon book is a shame, especially since AA Services could add/contribute more to recovery scene if they wanted to.

I don't know how she does it, but she encourages you, she takes it slow, she seems to meet every need for the inexperienced tapper. She includes LOTS of routines, LOTS of different steps and 90 minutes makes you feel like you really are getting your money's worth. The only problem is I wish there were even MORE! At the end, she says \\"See you on the next tape\\" -- has anyone seen or heard of one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY !!","review":"When I turned fifty I decided I wanted to learn to tap dance. Every class I signed up for turned out to be too fast, too confused, too advanced, etc. and I became discouraged. Then I discovered BONNIE FRANKLIN'S tape and the quality of the instruction, pace, reinforcement and overall presentation were superior in every way. In a word, Bonnie is SPECTACULAR! She has been tapping since she was nine yrs. old and it really shows. Her ability to present the material at the level a beginner can grasp is nothing short of phenomenal. I play the tape several times a week and have REALLY LEARNED TO TAP !! It is so wonderfully satisfying to succeed at something you really want to do and this tape turned me into a tap-dancer. It is worth every cent I paid for it and I'd gladly pay MORE for another.

If a dancer truly wants to learn the steps correctly, and practices them daily, s/he can progress until after just a few days the sounds are crisp and the foot movements are automatic. A few minutes of daily work can increase speed until, LO!, a tap dancer is born!Bonnie then puts the basic steps into little routines to give students an actual dance to practice. This just increases interest. What a GREAT introductory tape! Sign me up for Bonnie's next instructional video!bacongirl"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought this because I HATE to exercise! I took tap when I was little and really enjoyed it. The steps are easy and are explained really well. My only problem is that \\"big girls\\" should not tap! My husband was in the basement and thought the roof was coming down!

In an interdisciplinary manner, Fiand draws the reader into a view of reality that manifests the power of thought and of prayer and the healing of both personal and cultural brokenness. The marriages of the \\"sacred\\" and the \\"secular,\\" the past and the future, the time and space dimensions give birth to an awareness of the interconnectedness of all of life in God. I personally experienced a call to a deeper prayer life that draws all into a consciousness that moves to health and wholeness and holiness.

I tried this based on the reviews--figured if it can control litter box odor, it must be great. I hoped it might help with smoke odor from a frequent guest. Normally he goes outside but in bad weather uses the garage. Even though he opens the outside door the smell lingers. Not a big deal but this sounded so good I thought it would help. Wrong. Perhaps the larger one which can be put in a more central spot & uses 3 filters would work better. Putting it in a wall outlet limits how much air it can pull in--directions state it works for a 6 foot area.In the interest of a more accurate review, I also tried it in our kitchen. Didn't make a dent in cooking odors. Then tried it in our very small half bath. Same result.

Compared to other filters in my home, though, it's quite compact. It's not hard to find space for it on a wall outlet.I've had this thing running for a couple of weeks and I am very pleased with it. It does a great job of knocking out odors before they have a chance to fester and become a lingering problem. I was worried I might have to replace filters really frequently, but I'm only a quarter through my first filter according to the handy indicator, so that's better performance than I was expecting. My favorite thing about this filter, though, is how quiet the fan is. I can't hear it unless I'm straining my ears for it.

I guess they were hoping for a lot of buys from parents who figured it would be of the quality of the first film. I'm not a huge fan of children's movies, but even I enjoyed the first film. The music fit with the picture, and the story was well-paced and fun. This attempt lacks all of those qualities.

My eight-year-old cousin fell asleep in this, so I'm sure that I'm not the only one thinking the way I do.

Nothing too exciting, heartbreaking, wonderful, or anything that falls into that catergory ever happens in this movie.

This is the follow-up movie to Tarzan and a rather poor follow-up. Basically the movie is a cut and paste job. The movie deals with Jane trying to figure out what to give Tarzan to celebrate their one year anniversary of marriage together. She talks with Terkina and Tantor, later on her father joins in on the discussion, and they all recall flashbacks on how things went wrong. The flashbacks are episodes taken from the television show The Legend of Tarzan. The three episodes are: \\"Tarzan and the British Invasion\\", \\"Tarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine\\" and \\"Tarzan and the Flying Ace\\". In the end Tarzan turns the tables on Jane by giving her a diamond wedding ring, a surprise party, and wearing his father's suit.

What tends not to be emphasised is that many of Bruch's lesser-known compositions are also fine examples of late Romanticism. It goes without saying that this recording can be heartily recommended to all fans of the chamber music of Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, and Dvorak. Well-done interpretations of some delightful works by a composer who deserves to be heard more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality reproduction","review":"This is a very poor production.

It's brilliant--intellectually rigorous, complex, and musically exciting. Parker's poems are delightful and (at times) funny without resorting to easy, winking irony. His series on the gods--a sort of experimental ars poetica--is at once hilarious and deeply moving, as is \\"The Librarian's Song,\\" among others.I'm a fan of Alan Michael Parker's first two books--Days Like Prose and The Vandals--but his achievement here is astonishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comeback Album!","review":"This cd is great because Snoop went back to his old \\"Doggy\\" style!

Almost like a free agent, Snoop is picked up by No Limit, and makes a much anticipated album that didn't meet up to people's expectations. He then follows it up with this release, hoping that Dr. Dre and other producers could spice up his ailing style. It doesn't work. Most tracks, his voice isn't even loud enough to understand, and it sounds like his lyrics are an afterthought to the music. You should have stayed with your old style, Snoop. Doggy Style is still a classic in my book, but the rest are all going to the Pawn Shop. Better luck next time. This CD is not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is crap","review":"Basically Snoop totally left NO Limit on this cd. It has those stupid Snoop beats instead of the raw thumping Beats by the Pounds ones. \\"Down for my N's\\" and \\"Ghetto Symphony\\" were raw as hell, but \\"Gansta Ride\\" and \\"Snoopafella\\" were the only two non-Beats by the Pounds songs that jammed somewhat.

I bought the album a few years ago, shortly after its release, and have only been able to bear listening to it about three times - each time entering with a clean mind, hoping to be impressed, only to find myself extroidinarily dissapointed. Top Dogg doesn't touch Doggystyle, nor does it even deserve the recognition Snoop has earned as a featured artist on numerous recordings by Dre. Pac, and others.

There's no question that \\"Doggystyle\\" was a masterpiece, but after hearing the last two records he put out, I wondered if Snoop still had it in him to deliver a quality album. I'm glad he brought his sound back home to the City of Angels.My favorite cut is probably, \\"Betta Days\\". I haven't seen the CD cover, so I don't know for sure who produced it. But I believe DJ Quik produced it. Quik's production fits Snoop's voice like a glove. I also like the Wild-West sounding, \\"B-Please\\".It was a nice change of pace to put Xzibit on the record. Dre produced another winner, and laid claim once again to the title of best producer of all time.

Snoops laidback and charismatic flow is perfect for the west coast gangsta funk and makes this album another Cali classic. \\"Top Dogg\\" starts off with the hardhittin' \\"Buck 'Em\\" and tells us that the Big Dogg is back.

Would buy again from this vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD","review":"I lived in Japan for three years--fifty years ago--and every time I listen to this CD I get homesick. The instruments are western--a harp, a flute, and a viola--but they sound Japanese, and the Japanese vocalist, Hiroko Masaki, has a wonderful way with these songs. The name of the violist, Vladimir Mendelssohn is left out of the credits above, but the three songs in which he has a part are three of the loveliest. I can't think of a better introduction to Japanese traditional songs. Translations are not given but there is a short description of each song."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what is the point of this?","review":"I really do not understand what people find great about this stuff. I thought I was listening to a Jazz album when I put it on but shortly thereafter, the music disintergrated and digressed into noise consisting of feedback, drill-type sounds and other mumbo-jumbo.You know if any of you saying Britney Spears in no-talent but yet try to hand my this nonsense that THIS is genius or whatever, I must say, I am a total loss to understand your idea of music....even as an art. Now while Britney Spears may not be much in the way of art, she is good entertainment.

I passed the CCA exam but would not rely on this book as the only source. Get exp. with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad intro","review":"Covers the basic concepts well. However, if you're looking for something indepth, or need help with a complex installation, keep looking. This is a fairly thin treatment of thin client solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter book, great reference book","review":"This is a good review of pretty much everything you need to know to get started with Terminal Server and Metaframe. I especially like the appendix in the back listing all command line options, toggles, and whether they are native to Terminal Server or Metaframe. I'm not sure why Amazon lists this book as not available yet; I bought it at the local bookstore last week. Overall it's a good book, but it's no replacement for following the Microsoft newsgroup threads and reading about real-world problems and solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increase your knowledge of Thin Client Computing","review":"This is a great book to start with for those of you that are considering the Terminal Server / Citrix Metaframe environment. Although the detail is a bit low, the understanding of thin client technology and the connection topology of the Citrix product was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!!","review":"I bought this because Chris Noth and Edward James Olmos, two of my favorites, are in it. I love it! I was very pleasantly surprised by Noth's performance. I have seen him do some roles that were not particularly impressive. However, I can recommend this movie without reservation. Even though it's about 3 hours (it was two parts on TV), I didn't get tired of it. Sometimes I can't last through an entire movie if it's too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, So-So Movie","review":"I'm a great fan of Martini's books. I was rather disappointed in this movie. Although the actor protraying Madriani looked the part, the woman playing the asst. d.a. didn't at all match the one in the book. The plot was changed,and the locale, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a great book","review":"Not only is this book packed with useful information about writing, it's presented in such an engaging manner that you almost forget you're reading the book to learn something. A lot of the information deals specifically with writing for children, but even if you're writing for adults I think there's enough in this book to make reading it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have Reference","review":"I found this book invaluable. If you are new to writing, you must have Nancy Lamb's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is jam packed with a lot of info.","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book. I have read a lot of books on writing but they were all too simple and had stated what I already knew.I wanted a book that had information I could use and to explain what items editors looked for when accepting a story. This is the book ALL writer's should read and own, so they can include it to their library of writing references! I know I am glad I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and Error Laden","review":"With the plethora of suitable tomes on this topic, it is sad to see such a sorry effort in print. The author parrots some of the more familiar arguments favoured by the pop analysts, and attempts to hide the lack of useful instruction by inundating the reader with charts. The charts are given superficial examination, occasionally leading to a proper conclusion but just as often revealing a simplistic or erroneous analysis. This book is a fine guide to accumulating a small fortune, provided, that is, you begin with a large fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Spotty Treatment","review":"I very much regret the money I spent on this book. I need a primer on technical analysis, one that starts with the fundamentals and builds to some more complex illustrations. This book, however, is weakly organized and compels the reader to consult external sources for the gaps in its coverage of the topic. Much of the text is preachy, sounding like the hucksters pitching an investment scheme on AM radio. The author has either done a poor job of illustrating the method behind the calculations, or has incorporated several errors in the text. I suspect both.I looked forward to the charts, but they are not drawn intuitively, they do not support the text, and they are largely repetitive. It reads as though the author was getting paid by the page count. This one will be collected dust on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book on technical analysis","review":"This is the best book I have read about technical analysis. The author explain the different topics well. The book is well organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Treatment of \\"Tech Analysis Lite\\"","review":"Much of this book contains some very tired theories on stock movements from generations ago. While stock patterns may have some historic trends, it is a gross oversight in failing to consider how computerized trading has affected both patterns and the timing of trades. This book would have had some use in 1975, but it will hinder the modern technical trader, who must compete with others using state of the art technology. And as others have noted, the text is rife with errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Errors, Poorly Written","review":"The author takes a simplistic look at the subject; he explains nothing that cannot be found in the most basic primer. To compound the problem, the writing style is compromised. The writer has little command of English phraseology, nor apparently did his editor. I wonder if this was perhaps translated (badly) from another language? I also detected several fundamental errors in the treatment of technical analysis. Avoid this one, there are so many other books availalbe from genuine experts who know the subject and write with authority."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Technical Analysis Course","review":"I ordered this book on July 30. On Aug 12 I was told \\"It's in the mail\\". On Aug 19 got e-mail order cancelled------no explanation. Not happy cost me 3 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is only a beginner's course in Technical Analysis","review":"This book is for those who only want to learn the basic concepts of technical analysis. The types of charts and concepts used in technical analysis were all only briefly described. You will need to learn a lot more about technical analysis than what is in this book if you want to use it to buy and sell stocks successfully. Thus, this book is way overpriced for the information it provides.The quality of the charts in the book is only fair and should have been better organized. Most of the time, the charts are at least two pages away from the text that explains them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start","review":"This book is a great place to start if you know nothing about technical analysis. It is very well organized, and the quizzes help to reinforce the lessons of the text. Meyers starts with basic chart construction and the types of charts, moves through reversal and consolidation patterns, gaps, trendlines and channels, and support and resistance before taking on any computed indicators. Next he moves through moving averages, relative strength, and volume indicators, and finally oscillators. He then digresses to cover point-and-figure charting and candlesticks before concluding the book with a discussion of market and sentiment indicators. Once this material is mastered, the more detailed discussions of Murphy or Edwards and Magee will make a lot more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Errors and Misconceptions","review":"I have read many books on the subject, and I'm not sure this author has a grasp of the concepts. It reads as though it was pasted together from magazine articles, and there is very little to tie the disparate thoughts together. The author seems confused, as there are frequent contradictions, more than once in the same chapter. If you are only going to read one book on this subject, pick one where the author has a command of the topic; this one will leave you as befuddled as the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Organized Jumble of Techniques","review":"This book was assigned reading for a college-level investing course; now I understand why the professor drives an old car and teaches this class instead of making money in the market. In all my years of schooling, I've never encountered something so poorly assembled. I have unearthed a few useful concepts, but they are largely buried in an pile of tired market cliches and chart after chart of dated 1980s investing patterns.There are many other books on the topic (you can do a search on \\"technical analysis\\" right on this Amazon site) that are both current and accurate. I keep a lot of my textbooks after finishing a course, I find them to be useful references. This one will go immediately to the used section of the campus bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Review","review":"Jeanne Cotter's music is very beautiful, inspiring, and introspective.

I have to admit, changing the air filter in this car is a pain in the butt. Thankfully I'm set for another 25K miles. When cleaning and re-oiling the filter, I will be picking up the aresol version of the oil, as I hear it takes 1/4 of the time to re-oil versus the drip type of K&N oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great air filter!","review":"K & N makes a great product. Worth the money. I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"K&N - No measurable gains","review":"The product fit perfectly and was easy to install in the factory casing. However, for costing almost 4 times as much as a standard paper filter from Fram I would expect to at least think I was getting any performance gains. There is absolutely no gains in gas mileage, and it sure doesn't feel like there are performance gains in acceleration. At least it is re-usable, provided I buy the cleaning oil at around ten dollars a bottle. Come to mention it, when that time comes I will be in about 50 dollars and could have replaced a paper filter five times. . . Value? maybe if you plan on keeping your car for the full million mile warranty the K&N filter comes with. My advice, stick with the paper filters or go with a cold air intake. No sense in hoping this product will benefit you in any manner performance wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"MR","review":"I order this product and it did worked in my Mazda 3, con't even sent it back.

I will always use K&N in my cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"FITS PERFECTLY","review":"I purchased this air filter for my 2007 Mazda 3 Hatchback. Fits perfectly, installs in minutes (there are videos on Youtube to help). Nice knowing the filter can be washed and reused.I cannot attest to any added performance, as the car seems to run the same; however, I am anxious to see if it improves my gas mileage as others have stated.If you are interested in a washable, reusable filter I would recommend this, but if you are looking for added performance, you may want to purchase a regular OEM filter and save some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only reality show worth watching","review":"I truly hate reality shows. I truly hate celebrity gossip. But I also truly love Kathy Griffin. She is such a brilliant comedian. Honest, cutting, incredibly funny. Her only competition for best standup act of our times is Chris Rock. Grffin can rattle on about Clay Aiken, Whitney Houston, or the many other entertainment news figures I find 100% uninteresting, and I laugh until I can't breath. The D-List show has been Must See TV for me since it debuted. And I'm in a demographic that is not considered her strong suit.

She pretends to be under 20, talking about Justin Bieber and the teenyboppers as if it is her age and it is hip to do soKathy Griffin's voice is nasally and her laugh is horsey and everything about her screams absolute desperation.

I bought this DVD the day it came out on store shelves and this is one of those rare DVD's which I watch quite a lot, most of the DVD's in my collection get very little use.

I left fantasy, but this series brought me back!!","review":"One of the best fantay novels I've read in a long time. Engrossing, original, and at times fun. It slighted toward a historical romance with the sexual unnuendoes but the roundness of the characters and the high magical elements makes this a trilogy not to be missed. i hope to read works as original and refreshing as this in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely excellent book!","review":"This was a mastery of writing, without a doubt. Tarr's style is so clear, yet very descriptive at the same time. And the story is absolutely enthralling. I read this entire volume in 3 days! The stories are nicely connected, and she focues more on the interrelationships of the characters than on just plain old magery and fighting. I thought the series was over when I finished this book, but thankfully there are 2 more to go! I'm just starting Spear of heaven now :-) If you love fantasy, you'll love this book - without a doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I really loved this book. A three part story that leads you on a wild ride of adventure and intrigue.

Yawn.","review":"I read The Hall of the Mountain King back in 1988, and I jotted down my impressions of the novel at that time. The male characters in this novel were very effeminate, and I don't think that's what the author intended. Rather, I got the impression that the author just wasn't skilled in showing how males express deep friendships toward each other.The plot concerns a youth who's the scion of a sun god. He comes to accept his inheritance of his grandfather's kingdom, but first he has to defeat his uncle. The boy has mind control powers and is a quick swordsman, so he kicks butt through most of the book. However, halfway through the book we find out he's only 15 years old! Suspension of disbelief is shattered at that point.Save your money.

Could have been a perfect album without weak tracks, \\"Montego Bay Spleen\\" and \\"What You Think About...\\" which in my opinion are just average. Nonetheless, the album is great with the now classic \\"Rose Rouge\\", \\"Pont des Arts\\", and \\"La Goutte d'Or\\" topping out as my favorites.

The album is great. I'ts good jazz with a good uptempo beat to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy for any true music lover","review":"This is one of the best all around albums I have ever bought! I'm not normally into \\"dance\\" music, but I like jazz, and this shows a perfect and natural blend of both genres into a very tight mix, smooth flowing sound. I had no idea anyone had thought to incorporate the two sounds together; but upon hearing the first four songs of this album at a music store, I bought it right then and there. The album is solid from start to finish, catchy, but not poppy, and just packed full of a variety of sounds that will have you relaxing with your eyes closed as the music slides over you one minute, and up grooving and dancing the next. It will stick in your head and you won't regret a moment of it! If you don't buy it, you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niiice.","review":"St. Germain do for jazz what Portishead did for the torch song - take a now-marginal, nostalgia-muffled form and update it with glacial modern production, while retaining the potent pleasures of the old form. the first five tracks of 'Tourist' are sheer bliss: the straight, allusive bop rush of 'Rose Rouge'; the Wes Montgomery-strum to a languid trip hop backing of 'Montego Bay Spleen'. 'So Flute' is actually so piano, that instrument extemporising thrillingly; as are the next two - the supposedly trumpet-driven 'Land of...' is usurped by a gorgeous melodic epiphany, while the xylophone reverie of 'Latin Note' bows to the staccato.No album could sustain that level of dreamy excitement, and there is a drop. It's not that the music's bad: 'Sure Thing' is a dirty great blues beast, while 'La Goutte D'Or' is that rare thing, disco-jazz; but the slackening of discipline leads to occasional attention-wandering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"I bought this CD on the recomendation of a friend whose judment I trust. While I like jazz, I especially like it when it grooves. This recording certainly grooves. Things get really moving with \\"So Flute.\\" The groove continues with \\"Land Of\\" which is indicative of many albums that Blue Note has turned out recently. \\"Latin Note\\" is great. It has some wonderful vibes played over a very catchy latin percussion beat. \\"Sure Thing\\" begins with a straight-ahead blues riff but it's not long before a driving bass kicks in setting the mood for a great jam.Take it from me. If you love jazz, blues or a good groove, this recording is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nearly perfect electro-jazzy thing.","review":"I like to imagine sitting in a smoky cafe in France in the future with a half robot band playing in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy nonsense","review":"There is very little originality on this album. Relentlessly copying and abusing old jazz & blues recordings doesn't quite cut it in my view. Why this album gets so much acclaim is beyond me; the samples are almost without exception cheesy and the arrangements boring to the core. There is extremely little musical interest in this album, even considering its purpose (lounging). People who like the sound of old jazz and blues had better buy the original stuff.The only reason I gave this album two stars instead of just one is because of the technical mastery of the producers. They surely know their stuff, but I think they could do much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad.....","review":"This album is very bad. It get's one star for the beginning of \\"so flute\\" and thats about it. I have heard people talk about it as being good acid jazz, but it doesn't deserve that title. I don't know what you would call it (and I don't care either), but all that I know. is that it's a pathetic attempt at creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"There is not a bad track on this. Really funky, jazz tunes upheld by a hypnotic beat that will leave you wanting more. Smooth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the hype.","review":"This CD is a very pleasant surprise. Again and again, Europe shows the way how to fuse Jazz with Cuban with Latin with House...you get the picture. This CD is one of the few that you will find yourself listening to again and again, always discovering new things about it. There is a flood of all things housey-jazzey right now, but Tourist will stay right up there as the CD that deserves the respect, not just the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acid Jazz Lives","review":"Like Most CDs of this type of music I only liked 2 or 3 cuts, still will try out other albums by this group"},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Germain - Tourist","review":"Excellent music.

The first track, Rose Rouge, was what hooked me with its catchy, driving yet not overpowering percussion. Its vocal reminded me of Tracy Chapman, an association I did not consciously make until my wife listened to it. I'm not much of a jazz aficionado so other reviews will probably reveal more about the individual talents of the musicians. I just know that I like the combination they have achieved. This CD will be a welcome addition to the collection we play in the evening while making dinner and relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"more please","review":"I travel the world and spend many hours in music shops.

This is one of the best electronic albums ever, and certainly the greatest of the 90's\\"nu-jazz\\" and chillout trend. Sort of like what \\"Kind of Blue\\" is to jazz, or what \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" or \\"Revolver\\" is to pop music, etc. This is the best of its kind ever created. No other \\"chillout\\" or \\"lounge\\" or \\"nu jazz\\" cd ever matched the brilliance of this release. I would rank this along with Thievery Corporation's \\"Mirror Conspiracy\\", Koop's \\"Waiting for Koop\\", and perhaps the first few \\"Hi-Fidelity Lounge\\" and \\"Private Lounge\\" releases as the best chillout albums ever. If you are a fan of the above-type music or are just interested in hearing some wonderful nu jazz, this is highly recommended. In fact, it is required!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never far from the top of my CD stack","review":"\\"Tourist\\" is one of my favorite CD's ever. I kept it in constant to rotation for nearly a month when I got it. The beats are infectious, the jazz totally swingin', and the playlist full of interesting moods and flavors.

If you like your jazz more groovalicious or your electronic music more jazz-influenced, this is a great album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A SOUND!","review":"I just returned from Siena, Italy, where I walked the cobblestone streets and heard this amazing sound - St. Germain's Tourist. The shopkeeper was knitting on a loom a sweater listening to this music, she could hardly speak English, but spoke the music language very well. I couldn't wait to get home, and found the first \\"disco\\" shop to buy it. Every track gets better than the last. A real groove happening here on this CD. I haven't listened much to anything else since I have been home. I rank this among my top 5 jazz cds (Freddie Hubbard's First Light, is still number one after all these years) Love it. P.S. I did buy a a sweater too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible sounds","review":"this is one of my favorite albums. The blend of jazz and electronic beats is just perfect. If you like atmospheric drum&bass like some of LTJ bukem's albums then you will love this album. I cant get enough of this album.I normally listen to electronica, atmospheric drum&bass, dub, deep house and some jazz. This album puts them all together into one incredible package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody's Jam","review":"Try to be with someone when you first pop Tourist in the CD player because not only will you immediately start rockin' to Rose Rouge and want a dance partner, you'll be anxious to express your excitement over how this work masterfully fuses an assortment of musical flavors. If you appreciate a range that includes jazz, blues, latin, african rhythms, techno and house music, this CD should be at home with you. And even if your home consists of multiple age groups, something rare and phenomenal will likely occur while this CD is on. Since Tourist provides the perfect blend of old and new school, it crosses the generation line and causes everyone to feel the groove. St Germain offers a true musical experience with this project."},{"rating":"2","title":"The french know their music","review":"It is impossible to listen to this album without tapping your feet. The beat gets into your veins just like a fix. This is Ludovic Navarres second effort under the St-Germain pseudonym, and the 5 year hiatus was sure worth the wait. Although not all tracks are as mesmerizing as say the opening track \\"Rose Rouge\\" with it's continual drum \\"solo\\" slowly morphing into a dancefloor house anthem or the incredible \\"So flute\\" which will have you pressing that \\"back\\" button until you get callouses on your index finger; all-in-all, this album is probably the strongest effort in the jazzy techno/house genre alongside the brilliant Amon Tobin.Be hip and get with the now... get this album!

Frist I sawthe video to 'Rose Rouge' and loved it...but what cemented my decisionto buy the cd was the moment I heard 'sure thing' on a german radio station. I immediately recognized John Lee Hooker and wondered what on earth it was. I then discovered shortly thereafter that it was the musical stylings of St. Germain...and I must say I am so pleased about this chance discovery because the cd is utterly brilliant. The cd is influenced by jazz and the blues, but has a very soothing, calming electronic touch to it. I highly recommend this cd and have already ordered St. Germains 'Boulevard'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"just buy it, you wont regret it.. this is one of those cd you can put anywhere, anytime, and you'll just enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of modern mainstream techno's classiest releases","review":"Mainly the reason that this often referenced House/Jazz fusion project continues to be so widely regarded even seven years after release remains the fantastic programming to be found throughout. It seems like such an obvious, simple concept..to mix live experienced studio players and vocalists with the deceptively simple and elegant beats, though Tourist still holds some of the highest standards when mixing these two elements, despite an onslaught of so much lesser inspired, similar themed music. Having hardly dated in what is in electro-years a long time, the graceful and classy take on electronic music has stood the test of time simply for the musical quality ingrained in the extended samples which play front and center to Tourist's sleek backgrounds. Although not all tracks can conjure up the magic that lies in say, track 6, even on autopilot Tourist stands as a high water mark for house-styled electronica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz at its finest","review":"This is one of the best Jazz cd's that I have ever bought.

But reading this book was boring. Really boring. I fell asleep at least twice on every page. Reading became more and more painful with every new page. Finally, I decided to throw the duck with this book! I wonder how all of you liked it that much. And most importantly: Belgarion is even worse.

When using the zoom feature, pictures are extremely fuzzy. The only way to get good pictures is to not use the zoom and take picture outdoors. Now the camera has completely quit working.

My issue is.. the video truly isnt 'BEGINNING' ballet. if it is? for who? I have danced since the age of two and have been an instructor since 1982. This was for a teen daughter of a friend. She wants to stretch, and learn some beginning ballet \\"moves\\".. and may enter a studio at a later time. This is NOT what she needed. :( Its quite misleading. Its more for someone who has firm beginning knowledge of ballet terminology, movements and the muscles started and built for these types of movements they are expecting from the viewer. She needs this video in about 1-2 years.It ended up being quite discouraging for her. She felt she couldnt keep up.. and that is simply not the deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"BALLET exercises on one side ONLY:(","review":"Most of the exercises are only shown on one side ONLY! which makes it harder to pause and do the other side.

Doesn't concentrate on beginner basics. Doesn't give time to repeat a movement. The instruction is too abstract. While this may be useful for someone with experience, it offers very little for those trying to master the simplest beginner movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Like This One","review":"Let me start off by saying that I love Howard's accent. I take classes and also do Ballet videos at home for extra practice. I rented this video from Netflix. I really like how Howard goes over steps and positions in detail. This helps me fine tune a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Resource for the Beginner","review":"My favorite feature is the name of the move you are learning comes up on the screen so you see how it is spelled.

(Granted, they do basic ballet moves, nothing on pointe.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' it!!!!!","review":"Hey I just got this today and loved it! This is exactly what I was looking for in a ballet video. It's basically like having class at home, and even though you do have to make sure to do a few of the exercises on your other leg on your own, it takes two seconds to go back with a DVD player and play the exercise again. It was clear, concise, and perfect for anyone looking to do some barwork at home (especially if you happen to miss class!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"I am taking a beginning ballet class and I thought this dvd would help me practice during the week, I was wrong. Most of the exercises are only shown on one side(so you have to pause to practice the other leg) and they go very fast. I would not suggest buying this if you are a beginner and need real instruction, or are just trying to practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough time to workout the steps!","review":"When I bought this DVD I was hoping that it would be like taking a dance class, as most of the other workout DVD's have been. But no, it was just here's the step, ok lets move on to the next. there was no time to familiarize yourself with the step. it says for beginners, so why would there be so many hard steps at the end.So, you see the step done on the DVD you try it, you work with it for about 60 seconds and then you either have to run up to the DVD player and rewind or just move on to the next step. If you're looking for a ballet class on DVD. this is not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beginner review","review":"I am a true beginner in need of very thorough instruction at a slower pace than this dvd provided. If you have no experience at all with ballet than this dvd may move too quickly and not provide enough detail of each exercise to follow along with the movements. It may be better suited for active beginner's who are already familiar with proper form. I agree with other comments about feeling frustrated when I had to rewind for every movement to do the other side of the body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ballet Class for One Side Only","review":"This is a ridiculous DVD as it only has class ON ONE SIDE OF THE BODY.

Unfortunately it provided no such help. It goes through all the basic steps but does not provide any explanation about things to watch out for or how many times they are going to the exercise. she does some of the exercises on both feet, and some only on one side. I find it very hard to follow and the instruction is terrible. If you want to watch someone do ballet, this is great, but if your trying to follow along, it takes many times of watching before you can follow it. It's not that the steps are hard, they arent, I've danced for 5 years but he doesnt vocalize the class instruction..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Would not recommend this to anyone, boring, the \\"instructor\\" is difficult to listen to and somewhat annoying.

However, their explanations of type concepts at times are very confusing and convoluted. This book can be very difficult to read as a result. It tries to cover too much without giving a solid basis; it is more of an advanced text. The style of writing gets ponderous at points, while at other times is very clear.

Although the book was most informative I was disappointed. I am not sure what I expected but I did not expect to have a headache midway through the book. The book included indepth charts of all differrent types of personalities. Many examples were supplied.The headache was from trying to understand everything. To me the authors should have shared their expertise. The confusion would always come when an explain was followed or precluded with Jung and Brigg's views. I felt overwhelmed with the information. The authors gave their thoughts and had to throw Jung & Brigg's in there too much.I read this on my Sony Reader.

I liked the 3xe because I wanted to hot sync my computer at home (3xe travel cable is only $17 compared with $40 to $50 for Vx) with my computer at work where I used the included cradle (free with purchase). And 3) the bulk of the Vx cases made them as big as the 3xe with included flip lid. And this cradle is $20-$30 on top of the price of the Vx.

As a fan of the O.G chronic I expected more and learned my lesson in buying from suge instead of Dre.. ohhhh and i can confirm that any song having to do with dre or snoop was pulled out of the cd atotal of about 10 songs, leaving this cd with really nothing.Yes tupac, thee greatest rapper ever comes out in this CD, but two songs can't make a CD . He comes out in two songs but only one of them is ok. this Cd delivers a blow to west coastrap but i still wont listen to that weak fluff daddy, jay-zeee and mace , bad boy. As for me i find myself reverting to the classics of West coast rap. In all I was dissapointed terribly . The only reason i made this review is because i feel as if the chronic 2000 ripped me off.

Because Death Row is going broke and they want to trick people into thinking this is Dr. Dre's new album. I heard Snoop and Dre got pulled off this album. If that rumor is tru then this album will definately bad. Also Suge needs to quit hating on C-Murder for \\"When we Ride on our Enemies\\" his dedication to 2Pac before Master P and Big Pokey come up to his jail cell and beat his butt.

I heard Dre's changing his Album name anyway. Suge's chronic 2000 wont sell 2 copys and i also heard that Dre's and Snoop's songs are being pulled so it definetly won't sell worth anything. Dre's gonna win a Grammy For his album. Deathrow you can't copy so why you tryin. You cant put out music that could match up to Dre's beats and you Know this man!!!! Forget about Deathrows version because Deathrow is desperate and i heard they got a snoop soundalike named Topp Dogg but you cant coppy the one and only.You want some real music worth buying get Snoop's new Album and Dre's new Album.

Hmmmm..... get fakes that think they are the original great death row rappers. Enter Tha Realest and Top Dogg. Neither of them are Pac or Snoop, but both sound exactly like them. Tha Realest even looks a lot like Pac (haven't seen Top Dogg). Then Top Dogg decides since he can't write his own rhymes (**he thinks hes Puff too**) he'll just try to copy one of Snoop's songs. Why not? He took everything else. I'm not sayin these rappers don't have skills, maybe they do, but, if you can help it, dont try to sound like legends in tha game is what I say, ok? I can't say that that's not there natural voice, but if it isnt, I got no respect for em. I just wanna know why they didnt throw Guerilla Black in the mix. What the hell?

It became painful to finish and left me with a sense of loss, of my time and money. He even has the audacity to question the integrity of Dr. John Mack and Bud Hopkins. Both of which have dedicated thier lives to the subject while maintaining open minds and objectivity. Alschuler clearly has done neither. He fortifies the argument that our scientific community isn't well along toward better understanding of the nature of the universe but that our scientific community is but a mear toenail removed from the dark ages.Amazon.com's Rob Lightner says that Alschuler tackles the issue of UFOs without dammaging his credibility. How could anyone that relies upon this many assumptions rooted in rudimentary paradigms have credibility?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Blather","review":"Though it is refreshing to see a scientist look into the subject this one produces only useless drivel. His other book on the subject is even worse. Reading them is like talking to someone who never shuts up and never says anything worth knowing. But then of course until one comes and eats my garbage I don't beleive in Black Holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complex but fascinating read","review":"Alschuler's book is a fascinating one, though it might prove a difficult read if you cringed during science class. The most interesting part is that it shows how weird our universe really is, but at the same time showing that this \\"weirdness\\" cannot fully explain the UFO sightings he examines. While his analysis does lean towards the skeptical side of the ledger, he gives the pro-UFO side of things more credence than do a lot of scientists. His use of science fiction stories throughout helps to illustrate his points. I highly recommend this book to science fiction writers as well as people interested in the scientific opinion of the UFO phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"mac keyboard","review":"hate to give a bad review but the space bar is like a teeder toder and unless you hit it in the center it would not work .

I hope he will be more careful in who he allows to play or copy his music. KEM is an artful pianist, it is a distinct sound on his music, no piano solo's or even the sound of a piano on this albums, is a plain put off, I will not recommend this CD nor the second one and also the smooth jazz CD of Motown, what a awfull piece of music.

He's got a motorcycle that he parks defiantly on his green lawn and a funky attitude to go with it. He is the new boy in town. New, rich, dangerous. The complete opposite of Ruby Mcqueen. The quiet girl with a few embarrassing stories to her name.This book is about Ruby letting go of her reputation and embracing her wild, reckless side. It leads her to a small bit of trouble and she finds it's not all it's cracked up to be. Along the way she finds new understanding about why her mother still pines for her no good father and learns from an old couple, what love is.Caletti's style of writing is, \\"Tender and poetic\\" to the T. This book is exploring and unforgettable with a cast of hilarious characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet as Honey","review":"Ruby's always been quiet and shy. She knows it. She embraces it. Thanks in part to her mother, the elderly members of a book group, and a boy - who may break her heart . . . or just might win it - she's about to let go, just a little bit. She does not rebel nor become completely impulsive, but she does learn to be more in control and more decisive.Caletti's sophomore effort has a lot of heart. This is just as enjoyable as her debut novel The Queen of Everything, but with a warmer tale to tell. It will leave you smiling. Highly recommended, especially for fans of That Summer by Sarah Dessen. Honey, Baby, Sweetheart deserves every award it has received, and that in itself is a rarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I was expecting so much more when I started to read this book. But I found it too long and very boring. Ruby whines way too much and drags the whole Travis issue on for far too long. The only reason I stuck with the book was to see how the side story with the Casserole Queens turned out. I recommend reading this only if you like sappy love stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"too drawn out","review":"I just finished this book yesterday and the entire time I was reading I just wanted to get it over with.

I don't think that teenagers will like this book - it's so boring! Okay, the beginning is quite interesting, I liked the story about Ruby getting more and more drawn to no good Travis that was really exciting but after that?? The trip of the old people to California is way too long, it's supposed to be romantic I guess. I didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I was waiting for her next book, and it didn't disappoint. I ran out and got it right away. I'm not sure which one is my favorite!

This is a awesome book that I truly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honey, Baby, Sweetheart","review":"While Honey, Baby, Sweetheart occasionally delivers an adorably quirky phrase here and there, it is ultimately in the same boat as Juno--filled with horrible metaphors that just don't fit in and sound incredibly forced, with the most predictable ending possible. Every page you turn, it's never-ending metaphor after metaphor. If I wanted that, I'd go read Shakespeare. I wrote down a full page of predictions of a piece of paper while reading, and every last one came true. As the end approached and Lillian and Charles reunited, I had written \\"Oh, yay, finally a book that does it right!\\"...only to have my hopes completely crushed by the end. What the heck, Deb Caletti? Can't end a book happily, just *have* to include a death? Horribly disappointing.Rating: 1/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys get mountains, girls get boys","review":"I thought this book was amazing.

It's a great read and chances are you will enjoy it as much as I did :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first","review":"This was even better than her first book The Quuen Of Everything, that I loved. It's also got lots to say, and a plot that keep your turning pages and keeps you up at night. The characters you just love and feel sad when you turn the last page and have to see the end of them. I loved Harold, and Poe, the dog. The old people are especially hilarious and my favorite part is when they are all in the car on their trip.

It is an engaging story and a relief from gigantic ships of the wall slamming each other in set-piece battles.My primary purpose in writing this review is to warn readers away from the Baen/Windhaven version. I have written to both the publisher and printer regarding the numerous read-ability issues this version has. First, the printing itself is too light and is on a nearly-tan paper...resulting in these old eyes needing more light that expected. Second, the binding encroaches upon inside margins.

This book really shouldn't be as good as it is given the events it covers, but Weber as always rises to the occaision. It becomes obvious by the end of the book though that its mostly a vehicle to introduce some Havenite characters other than Theisman we can cheer for. It also begins to de-stupify the Havenite forces making them a bit more of a threat for the next couple books.

Most books I've bought on the subject are really just lists of dinosaurs with a few blurbs and factoids set against some pretty art, while others are heavy on the mechanics of paleontology and talk about things like the strata of rock you find fossils is (which while important info, can be rather boring.) This book has a high level of detail, while not getting boring. For example, I had only a vaugue idea of what cladistics was, and thought it would be boring even if I did, but the essay on the subject was very simple without being condescending.

The new articles are laden with assertions lacking in concrete data, are generally awful in writing quality, and offer a very narrow view of dinosaur science, with alternative viewpoints barely mentioned. These articles' authors are just a few of the editor's friends, not the best and brightest in the field. Together, these new articles destroy the quality of the book, in my opinion.

Also impressive is the 3D effects when using headphones. I had no idea they could sound that good. On the back is a coax and optical digital output. I ran the optical out to my Marantz receiver and after fiddling with the inputs on the receiver I was pumping MP3 files from my computer to my stereo. It sounded just fine to me.

While I don't agree with all the specifics, the areas discussed are vital to consider. The book is also well written.The only real downside to this book is that it assumed the employees' market of 1999-2000 would last forever.

I must admit I find this quite humerus as the rest of the box is well constructed and contains some level of reinforcement to prevent drilling and other access attempts. Too bad this box is of no use to anyone unless they are looking for a storage cabinet that is both heavy and overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touch pad broke - less than a year old","review":"The touch pad lock broke with less than a year of infrequent use on it and all my keys were locked inside of it.

Small enough to hang on the wall and safe enough to keep others out that don't require access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for organization and keeping honest people honest","review":"Good quality, heavier then I thought. I like being able to keep my keys organized. I wanted a pushbutton so I didn't have to worry about another key to open up the lock for the keys!! Easy to install and set the combination. I don't like that the order of the combination makes no difference. I get into the box once or twice a week, sometimes with dirty hands. This leaves 'signs' of which keys I hit. Since the order doesn't matter all a thief would need to do is hit all the keys that are dirty or warn. Also, unless they are 30 individual keys on each hook I don't see how this will fit 30 keys. My spare car keys have the remote door openers on them (like most car keys do). These will only fit on certain hooks that aren't close to the internal mechanisms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock broke with light use!","review":"I bought this safe to keep my garage door opener safe from potential thieves. After about a month of light use, the knob turned but the lock mechanism didn't. All my keys were stuck inside. In a desperate panic I turned and turned the knob and it opened after about 200 turns. I was late for my appointment but at least I had my keys. The box has remained open since. I plan to replace it with a different, keyed, brand available on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better options out there","review":"I was planning to buy this item, but was scared away by the reports of the locking mechanism breaking. I found a much beefier alternative (9 gauge steel) sold by Harbor Freight (model 95041 - \\"Electric Key Box\\") which has a battery-powered electronic keypad and an external key backup, all for about half the price of the GE. I had trouble finding this item on Harbor Freight's website, but it was in stock at their store.

Stick a pry bar in the side and it's open in a matter of minutes. But, this is the option that most people have. However, I just found the Buddy Electric Key Safe Cabinet model 3221-32 that's a bit more expensive, but definately secure. It's built like a safe... a necessity to protect your keys from a determined theif. It's equipped with two bar locks instead of a tiny metal latch. Plus the hinges are concealed. I found the best price on Sam's club website, but it ranged from $100-$200 when I googled it. This GE type of key cabinet built with a metal latch is nothing better than a heavy duty storage cabinet for your keys. I wanted security and storage. Bought the Buddy Key Safe instead. Much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 2 months","review":"As other reviewers have noted -- the lock broke in about 2 months.

Amazon replaced it for me and it broke again about a year later. I opened both locks after they broke and they both broke in the same spot. The whole inside of the lock is plastic and breaks easily. I like the idea of having all the keys in one location and semi safe (yes I broke into mine with a screw driver and hammer also to get my keys out when it broke). I was going to repace the lock again, but the lock cost more than the whole box, so now I'm looking for something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Key box","review":"I am not sure you could get 30 sets of keys in this but it is meant for single keys on a small ring.

Not 5 stars as it is thinner front to back than I anticipated and it makes storing keys with big key chains difficult. Fully customizable combo is good. A good stud sensor is recommended as it is most secure when mounted to a stud. So a stud sensor, a level, a drill and a screw driver are the tools needed.

I enjoyed Name, but thought he made a mistake effectively killing off Drake the way he did.Well, apparently so did Marlowe, because One Endless Hour pastes tens of pages of dialog from Name right into itself to establish the story line, and then imagines that Drake heals and gets away from the authorities to wreak more havoc, much to the reader's delight.Both books are tensely plotted reflecting many details of daily life in mid-century America. The action is hot and the protagonist knows what he wants and how to get it.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This video is obviously a reprint of the original SyberVision video.

As I commenced reading, I thought, \\"ah lots of characters, this is goiing to be a rich plot as the author crafts a tale to blend all these parts together.\\" How wrong I was. Griffin provides details of these new cast members, and then promptly discards most of them. And he is still introducing new characters after 100 pages. And this is part of the reason that there is no rhythem to the book...his interesting plot is strangled by distracting detail and weak plot building technique. I felt as if he was writing a book following the dot-to-dot method, and at the end, he just got bored with it and, realizing that it was time to end it, just tossed in of a few pages of writing to end it. A five star concept that became a one star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read. A real page turner.","review":"Excellent book W.E.B. Griffin is a master story teller. It's just to bad he can never finish a series before going off on a tangent.

The largest problem was the ending. The ending doesn't close the book properly, and the reader is left hanging. Also, the book is anti-climactic. The action didn't seem to rise and fall like it should. There was also no sense of completion-we don't know enough about the plot to understand what exactly we've accomplished by the end of the book. The characters were interesting, but nothing seemed to come together. In summary-only pick this up if you've got nothing better to do. For those interested in the WWII spy thrillers, let me recommend The Unlikely Spy by Daniel Silva. It's much better. If the genre doesn't matter, why don't you pick up anything written by Robert Ludlum instead of this? It's bound to be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage WEB Griffin lore","review":"The book centers on individuals comprising OSS and is a continuum on the theme of Wild Bill Donovan and the exploits of the OSS.

It is obvious that Harold Robbins had jotted down some notes and ideas and someone with no talent whatsoever had tried to make it into a novel. It is fairly clear to distinguish some of the passages that are Robbins' and then there are those that he would be ashamed to even look at. There is actually a part where the same sentence is repeated, with two words changed, on the next page.

If I had help and could completely remove ladder from side, no big deal, but when fully extended with the wings on, it does make the top heavy, tending to drag against the surface. So the feet remaining on is critical to prevent damaging siding.But it does fit on easily and works to hold ladder away from house.

Generation X was really just posing as Punk, The Boomtown Rats and The Only Ones were both more than just Punk bands, and Eddie and the Hot Rods preceded Punk, it's more or less Pub Rock. Regardless, the songs are all quite good, and the usual suspects all turn in great performances as well.It should be noted that both of the Sex Pistols songs are demo tracks. This may sound like a problem but it really doesn't matter much, since they recorded a ton of tracks for both the songs and they're both about as good as the final takes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is commercial crap","review":"These tunes must have been tagged from the old Liberty Library.

The author assumes that the reader is already familar with how to make a web page, and that's where the problem begins. I do not know how to begin making a web page, and being a student, I have to learn fast for classes. So, when the author began in areas that I am unfamiliar with, I was very confused. I decided to go ahead and keep the book for reference though. I did purchase the book Dreamweaver 2 H.O.T.

My child needs to be swaddled super-tight in order to sleep. We use the swaddlers with the velcro fastners pretty religiously because if he manages to squeeze out a hand or kick out a leg in his sleep, he will wake up crying. So he really has to be wrapped. This blanket in my opinion is overpriced and does not do a good job of keeping baby wrapped up. He managed to kick his feet out every single time we wrapped him in it. Maybe we are using it wrong but we can't see any other way to keep his legs inside. And it's kind of awkward having to wrap the top portion around the baby's torso. Overall, just not really worth the money. We are sticking with the swaddlers by Kiddopotamus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Swaddling","review":"My baby loved being swaddled, but this blanket was another story.

I love everything about this book, it is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good learning book","review":"It's the best learning book I have ever read. I can't really nothing that BUY IT if you want to learn C.Greg have a good humour, and it's help me. I just cant stop read like a good book. There are a lot of small notes, and these are funny to read.If you a totally new programmer you can buy this book. I start from the scratch, and if you already can program other languages, buy this book and read the first 5-6 chapters fast and then the good part comes.I only have one small problem with the book. It is written for Windows people. The compilers the mention is only compilers to windows (MS C compiler, Borland C etc..), nothing about the linux compiler gcc. But thats no problem. You can use all sourcecodes from the book with gcc also.So buy it now. I hope he will write to the end of his life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for quick read, but not the best","review":"I read through this book twice, and although it provides some good examples for beginners, it does so in a very brief manner. Get this book if you are looking for a quick read (larger font, nice pictures, etc.).If you are looking to gain a better understanding of C, even if you are a beginniner (like myself), go out and get C Primer Plus, which is filled with tons of complete examples, challenge questions, and challenge programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely imprecise","review":"I am surprised that this book has gotten the good reviews that it has. This book's title should read \\"ABSOLUTE! beginner's guide to C\\". The book assumes that you not only have no knowledge of computers, but also assumes that you have no knowledge whatsoever. I found the bad puns and stupid jokes quite distracting and I don't recommend this book to anyone who wants to become a serious programmer. A couple of the references to functions are incorrect, and several of the snippets of code will not compile if thrown into a program. I'm very disappointed in this book and in the author and editor(s). Some of these mistakes would have been caught by a half-competent C programmer. I recommend reading \\"The C Programming Language\\" by Dennis Ritchie. If you don't want to walk away from a book with a smaller IQ then when you started, stay away from this book....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for beginners","review":"I am learning C programming in a CS50x course of the MIT and this is one of the lectures recommended and it is very well explained all the examples, I recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific starting point for C","review":"I must say, this is one terrific book. From knowing no C at all, I read it once, and with the knowledge I acquired (plus a small amount of internet sources) was able to write a C program which I used in a competition and won a medal!!!! I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Author That Knows The Meaning Of Beginner","review":"This book, is by far, the best book on beginning C that I have read. The Author's ease in explaning the C language clearly shows that he has a complete command of the language.The Author has hit that rare combination of how far to go into a subject without losing the reader. One could, AND SHOULD, pick up this book and finish it with relative ease.In the book, the author's other books are listed. I am very excited about learning other topics from this author. If his books are remotely like this book, I have all the confidence that I will be able to tackle it.I cannot stress enough, the ability of this author to name, explain and demonstrate without missing a beat. This book should be the jumping off point for all those who aspire to be a c or c++ programmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty weak... if you know any c at all don't buy this -- absolute beginner indeed","review":"this book is designed for the absolute beginner to learn some c, it covers basic programming concepts as well...if you know any c you don't need this at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I read it and it took me no where. Still stuck in that cave if you know what I'm saying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This book does not worth [the price]. It's very long and has very basic c stuff. The whole book could be written in 10 pages. I recommend the C book by Brian Kernighan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent book. Everything is covered from type assignment, all the way up to pointers and structure elements. I would recommend this book to any beginner that is looking to start programming in the C language. The only downfall (and this has nothing to do with the book) is that C is not object oriented which you will see as you progress with your programming skills. So just a suggestion if you don't NEED to use C. Go with C++."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super great beginners C book - super!","review":"I really love greg perry's books. They are always down to earth. This guy can teach stuff that is hard to grasp into something very simple. I have 2 books buy him and am going thru them now. I love these books.This books is not for advanced programmers, but is for beginners for sure and even semi intermediates.Grep Perry programming books are always a first choice for me. I know I am not going to get the academicbable you get from some super geeks. Even though I like hard concepts you dont have to make it more hard by speaking like a geek. Greg perry rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best C Programming book for me to learn!","review":"I have read many books about C Programming and the more I read,the more I get confusing.Until I read this book everything is so clear.It's the best book for C Programming beginners that I highly recommend to you.

This book is recommended reading for those \\"less comfortable\\" with programming. It helped me finish my first programming assignments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read","review":"This book by Greg Perry is clear and straightforward. I think it provides a good foundation for anyone who wants to learn the C language. However, the book needs to offer more exercises so that the reader can develop some of the skills necessary to write programs. Also, some advice regarding how to obtain a compiler so that the readers may test the programs they write is also a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to C Programming 2nd Edition","review":"Just as it says: A beginners guide. Some stuff a pro may have forgotten and need to refresh with also. But takes you by the hand. Examples, problem solving and gets you up and going. I've programmed for years, but it was refreshing to find some new tricks for the old dogs in this book. Put it on your shelf and you'll use it for reference from time to time. Just keep in mind, its a beginner book and one of the easiest learning books I have seen in a while. If you are advanced in C, then you may not need it, but I bought it as a reference and refresher course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best programming book I've seen","review":"First, I'm not a programmer, but a mere hobbyist who has desired to learn a real programming language (i.e. other than BASIC or HTML) for a long time. I've attempted several books in the past with no success, because they lost my attention one may or another--they were boring, too advanced, or otherwise poorly written.Greg's book is none of those. It's fairly short (less than 400 pp), with small chapters each covering a new topic in C. The book somehow manages to keep your attention and is fairly entertaining. I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking to really understand programming. No, C is not frequently used by most programmers these days, but most popular languages are based on C, so this is a good primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro into C programming","review":"I'm only about half way through this book so far it's been a great book to learn the basics of C programming. The author does a great job of breaking down the information into manageable chucks. I always seemed to get bogged down by other C books because of the great level of detail but this book gives the basic information required to get a 'handle' on C programming and from there, the reader can take it further if he/she chooses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"I was looking for an overview of the significance of symbols in religion, metaphysics, etc. and I found it here. This was an excellent resource. So many symbols point to the same themes.

Flamin' Groovies, Nerves, Artful Dodger...terrific! But the long lost nugget of this CD is Chris Stamey & the dbs' \\"Summer Sun\\". Released as an indie single, it was backed with what I deem the most influential indie pop song of the era, \\"I Thought You Wanted To Know\\". Reminiscent of Big Star, this little masterpiece is available only on Vol. II of the American Power Pop series, \\"Shake It Up\\", which has been sadly deleted from Rhino's catalog. The #1 best power pop collection of all time, \\"Vol. II\\" deserves to see the light of day again. I myself would give just about anything to find a copy...can anybody out there help me out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive flakiness","review":"I don't know if this is the same thing that Barefoot sold me for a lot more ($65) as the \\"Original\\" eco bat, but all of the latex stuff has worn off in places after only 40 uses.

I'm all for biodegradable materials instead of plastics, but not if it doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barefoot Yoga Mat is excellent.","review":"Excellent choice for a yoga mat. No toxic smells emanating from this mat and provides a secure hold to the floor during my Heated Power Yoga Class.

I'm from Cleveland and love it and also have a soft spot for old houses.But this book was 'a miss' for me. First, there were too many times the author wandered off for pages and pages of monologues about the meaning of home, the literary aspects of home and while I am a college graduate, these bored me to no end.The history of Cleveland itself was interesting enough, if overlong. But the two biggest disappointments to me were the fact that almost none of the renovations were done by the homeowners, save painting and minor demolition. And the details of the renovations were not given.Secondly, from the very first page, almost, the author describes the house as 'creepy' and 'dark' and 'having a bad feeling'. They argue when inside, their daughter hates the place, and yet they STILL buy it. This made me loose respect for the author right off the bat.This book is bound for Goodwill, as I will never read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old House Woes","review":"As a native Clevelander, this book about an old house right around the corner from where I went to college really hit home (no pun intended). I enjoyed reading about the history of Cleveland and the venerable neighborhood where the Ruhlman family live, and sympathized with them as they undertook a massive home remodeling. A good mix of history, house and family issues. Definitely would recommend this one, along with the author's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!!!","review":"When I bought thid cd , I was thinking I'd find some good psychedelic metal, like The Blue Cheer or Frijid Pink, but I soon find that it is trash!

I love it even with Raday going a little crazy, but with the flashbacks to his childhood and his Uncle Jack you start to see why he is the way he is. So far I have all but season 6 and will be going for that one soon. I have had some mini marathons of Psych with my collection. It has not gotten old yet, so probably will not be a set that I ever trade in."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"love this show!!! every episode make me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen them. Dule HIll is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psych - Enjoyable","review":"We like the interplay among the characters.

Both James Roday and Dule Hill are wonderfully expressive and make a fun pair to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psyche Season 1","review":"Um, gee, yes it is a great product. Why else would I have purchased it? I am looking forward to purchasing the rest of the Psyche DVD set in the future.

It is a very good book to remind us how not to \\"lose it\\" as parents with a touch of self-awareness practice. A must-read for all parents. And the bonus is that the book is easy to read, short and message is clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read, very helpful","review":"I love this book and go back to it often when I find myself having a lot of conflict with my son. The message is simple enough that it's easy to remember and implement- if you find yourself struggling with your kids, take a look inside yourself and see what could be contributing to it on your end. Fix that, and most of the time the problem melts away. It's not the solution for every problem, but I can definitely say that whenever I find myself really getting into it with my son, if I take I step back I can see I'm tired, hungry, or burnt out.A must read for anyone who's interested in compassionate, gentle parenting.I took off one star for the goofy font. Makes it harder to read. I don't think anyone over the age of 12 should publish things in handwriting-style fonts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relics","review":"I would recommend this cd for all Pink Floyd fans, and anyone thas just getting into Pink Floyd.I feel as if this is a collectors cd because it has \\" relics\\"on it from different Floyd era's.I think anyone would be satified with ordering this cd.

I have intermittently studied Arabic and taught Arabic to American Muslim students over the past 15 years. I have yet to find an Arabic Grammar to match Kapliwatzky's at any price. My only complaint is that sometimes he gets TOO detailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taming the Wild","review":"Cassie's stepfather Dino is famous. The world knows him as a talented violinist. Cassie knows him as an unpredictable and violent man. As the story progresses, he nears the brink of self-destruction. You can almost hear the walls shake and see Cassie cringe when Dino raises his voice. Meanwhile, Cassie becomes involved with Ian, another violin virtuoso - and a student of Dino's.While there are plenty of books out there about abusive significant others, there are few - especially those shelved in teen fiction - that confront mental illness or the dynamics of stepfamilies head-on. This book has both. It is honest and unflinching.Deb Caletti imbues all of her stories with realistic sensibility and captivating characters. Make sure that you read not only Wild Roses but her other novels as well. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine story of romance and mental illness evolves","review":"Deb Caletti's Wild Roses tells of a teen living with a volatile, bullying stepfather who to the world is a famous violinist and composer. His preparation for a comeback concert brings him to the edge of sanity: as Cassie tries to hide his increasing instability from the public, she becomes more afraid - until Dino's first student, a brilliant young violinist - arrives on the scene to introduce love into the confused mix. A fine story of romance and mental illness evolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I've never read a DC book before, and I bought this one based on a blurb on another author's site. Much of the writing is excellent. I love YA authors that push the YA boundaries into higher levels. This definitely does that. The characters were distinct, the dialog good ( the foul language peppered thru out wasn't needed ) and she went out of her way to avoid many cliches. It dragged a little in spots where I thought the heroine talked unnecessarily and I skimmed. Overall, a sophsticated read for a more mature YA audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I thought this book was well written and easy to relate to (except for the part about her mom marrying a famous person). The only problem with it is that it got kind of boring at times. Antother slite problem is that I don't think Ian had enough of a character. He was just a nice, talented person. But other than that I liked it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie and Goodie","review":"I guess this book has been around since the late 80's, but it's new to me! My kids and I are on #12 of the 30 playdough possibilities. Cinnamon Dough has been my daughter's favorite, while Shampoo Dough is my son's. I like plain old salt/flour playdough with color added. This book has all the recipies you will ever need for doughs, and other squishy modeling compounds. We haven't tried any plaster of Paris projects yet, but we will! I think we will try the one that you do at the beach -- making some kind of sand casting."},{"rating":"2","title":"more kinds of dough than one could ever imagine","review":"This book has clays and doughs made from every imaginable ingredient (dryer lint!!).

Good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must book for APS.NET developers","review":"This book distinguishes itself from other ASP.NET books in that1. It categorizes its instruction to the ASP.NET, which helps me to have a clear understanding on each subject such as ASP.NET server controls, configuration files, caching, data access.2. It provides many easy-to-implement examples to let me to have a hands-on experience on the subject I am dealing with.3.

It covers most technologies found in 3D packages and shows when and where to apply certain techniques. There are no tutorials, but by the same token it is not geared to be a tutorial book.

Upon reading it, however, I found the writing to be somewhat amateurish and while I do like the soft style of the illustrations, the characters appear emotionless and don't convey any real sense of action. My son thought it was \\"just okay\\", but whenever I ask him if he wants me to read it, he says no. He usually thinks potty humor is pretty funny. He loves \\"Walter the Farting Dog\\" and \\"Captain Underpants\\", but \\"Flight of the Dodo\\" was not a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny tale!","review":"I just read this book to my 5 year old twins, who had it recommended to them by their school librarian. We all enjoyed it immensely (although be forewarned there is a lot of poo humor and poo-related illustrations!) I thought the pictures were quite well-done: the birds are modernist but full of personality. I liked this as much as \\"Diary of a Worm\\", also a favorite of our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown Scores Direct Hit with Kids Humor","review":"If you can't enjoy a little potty humor now and again, well, poo on you! I recently watched this book read to a crowd of kids ages 3-7 who were bent over with the giggles. Many of them had never been pooped on by a bird, but they were imagining the humiliation and ick factor with a great deal of glee. Underneath the humor is a well delivered message that revenge is not sweet--but cooperation is. The illustrations are FABULOUS! I cannot wait to see what Peter Brown drops on us next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"As an entering law student, I was looking for a substantive prep book ... and some advice on how to get through my first year. This book offered important but rather skeletal comments (\\"review your notes often\\" \\"read the assignments before class\\" \\"manage your stress levels and eat properly\\" etc). Also, the in-class note taking and case briefing concentrated on handwritten methods, despite the proliferation of laptops (and a 2001 copywright date). However this book did not take a \\"One L\\" approach of frightening the reader. After reading it I DO feel more prepared and confident than I previously did-- if nothing else than for the opportunity to develop my own case briefing style and to begin to familiarize myself with law school reading.It's a quick read; but I think that I will combine it with another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Planet Law School","review":"This book is pure fluff. It gives nebulous advice than anyone who graduated from high school should know, \\"prepare for class, read your notes...\\" The book to read about law school is Planet Law School.Planet Law School actually devotes a chapter about the author of Barron's how to Succeed in Law School (HTSILS).

What I wanted to add is a warning to those with older eyes: This book is printed in tiny 6 point type."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars","review":"This book was always exciting. I did find the inner turmoil of both characters a little monotonous after a while though. He lusted after her so many times but then changed his mind because he must hate her. She did the same. Every second page was how his blood was on fire or hers was on fire. He blamed her for his son's death and then two seconds later didn't. I found myself reading the same lines over and over again but in different chapters. It was still a good book but definitely not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is by far the best book I've ever read!!!","review":"I like to read historical romance books were women aren't always meek and defensless.

I love the cover. I love that the heroine is a strong, warrior who can hold her own. My only problem with the novel is that she (again, A WARRIOR) goes \\"to the kitchens!!!\\" Ugh!Still, the love story is strong. The characters have depth and are well-developed. The author certainly took the time to research the time period...always a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was Awful!","review":"The story line in this book was so convoluted and implausible that you have trouble imagining the main protaganists acting so out of character. Reyen seems to have multiple personalities and acts out of character much of the time. The story has more perils than than could be humanly possible and it runs on. Some dialog and scenes are well done, but again, so out of character for a female warrior. I had trouble finishing this book and finally did, but with a real appreciation that it was finally over. It seems drawn out and overly contrived. I don't understand the rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooo slowwwwwww........","review":"Ok. I'm not even close to half-way on the book and I want to stop. This is supposed to be a romantic love story. Holy crap!!! I really don't feel the love, really.

It is a well constructed key cabinet, with a very solid feel to it. There are several attachment options, but we chose to just surface mount it to a wall (over studs) since it looks pretty nice. It would have been nice if the actual key hooks were just a little larger to accommodate bulky key ring items like my spare car keys which have a big key fob to lock/unlock doors, raise the rear hatch, turn on the alarm system, etc. But all in all, we are very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Little Key Box","review":"Heavier gauge steel than I expected, very sturdy, hooks are a bit small but easily holds a normal key ring. Mounted it with one set of screws in a stud and the other two with wall anchors, feels real solid. Could someone get in it if they wanted? Sure but this does what its made to do; it holds all my spares in one place and provides enough security to be a deterrent for normal smash & grabs. Even better if you are creative with its placement. Besides, who really wants my keys?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Case And Good Value For The Money With A Tiny Issue","review":"Great basic key organizer. Solid construction and looks great mounted on the wall. If 5 stars is considered perfect I can't say it is as the numbered adhesive strips used to label each row peeled right off within hours after installation. But it's not really an inconvenience as it's still simple to organize using the numbered key tags that come with it. So please don't let this deter you from purchasing. I would still buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Install---Great for Organizing","review":"This unit proved to be the perfect unit to organize all the keys I had to keep track of. It was very easy to install---the hooks were perfectly space to accomodate the seemingly myriad number of keys I had to keep track of and they are easy to organzie and then locate. It didn't handle \\"car keys\\" that well as those are almost too large for the unit---they can work if you are willing to dedicate two \\"spaces\\" for them but that takes up a lot of room and thus I chose not to store my extra car keys in the security box. The box was attractive, releatively small---and it's appearnace was fine for installing in a public place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice item, but forget about getting a spare key...","review":"The box itself is nice, but when I had lost one of the keys and went down to several home improvement stores and two locksmiths, I found the key blank is not available.

Even in 1979 wasn't the tale of the put-upon orphan old? The harridan who cleans too much? The snide, hypocritical \\"adoptive\\" uncle? ,The characters do not ring true. I can find no reason for the brother to abandon the other, and (as in so many orphan books) can see no reason they turn out to be nice people when raised by cliches of nastiness.If you like Tale of Despereaux, another tale wherein mindless, contrived suffering is romanticized, you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song of Suburbia Sparkles","review":"Bouchier's short essays on suburban life hit just the right note. The topics are ones with which we are all familiar - sights encountered while we walk, American holidays, garage sales, sports, vacations and lawn care - to name a few. What keeps us reading is the author's fresh obsverations on cultural events and routines that suburbanites take for granted. Bouchier's writing resonates with dry humor. These well-tuned pieces are entertaining and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Songs","review":"Once again in an effort to be humourous about the foibles of America, an author has dragged out the tired and predictable. It's not that this work isn't occasionaly amusing, it's simply that the writing is stale and formulaic. Perhaps it's a function of his radio persona, writing to fill a certain time slot, but each essay has precisely the same rhythm and pace. It's like repetitively humming the same tune; it's tiresome at best. As for substance, Bill Bryson and many others got there first in contemporary times, and Mr. Bouchier is certainly no H.L. Mencken. The former is a pale imitation of the latter with respect to incisive observation and is vastly Mencken's inferior regarding the bon mot. I'd borrow this and other works of the author's from the library; I certainly don't recommend owning them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Home Should Have One!","review":"The most surreal, risque, astounding and wonderful pieces of Animation you could ever hope to find - including Betty's first appearance as a dog - these are absolute treasures.On top of that, the picture quality is so sharp you can't believe you're watching cartoons made in 1929."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Betty Boop","review":"This video shows the early years of the cartoon, but Volume 2 is by far the best out of the 8 volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting no chapter concept","review":"I found this book really good.

The manner in which he has woven and threaded words to create this soul wrenching story is more than captivating, it is an artistry! I couldn't put In The Half Light down once I began reading. It is truly one of the best novels I've ever read. It will take you on a journey that will remain with you always."},{"rating":"1","title":"chaotic and schizophrenic","review":"This type of writing exhausts me. Maybe for folks who read a chapter or two per day, or an occasional book on a plane, but if you are a hardcore reader you may find this story nauseating and lurching, as the character, a boy I'd like to like, tells his tale in long rambling sentences to mimic (I guess) the thought processes of how the author thinks a schizophrenic thinks. Maybe it is poetic; maybe it is brilliant. All I know is that there are very few books I don't think I can make it through the second half of the book...I'll update if I manage to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pictures, Not Enough Information, Worth Your Time","review":"This book would more appropriately be titled as a photo history.The pictures are great! The author's text and captions almost assume you already know the history of the series and are often repetitive. The word \\"dominated\\" is used three times in the second paragraph of the book and after about the forth time one does get tired of being reminded that there was no drivers championship before 1972.That said, this would be a three star book. What takes it up a notch are the quotes from the drivers and other series participants that are included on most pages. I attended Trans Am races in 1970 & 1971 and was an avid fan of the series. The quotes add a nice perspective and bring new material to light."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many photos-not technical enough","review":"This is a great book if all you want to do is look at the body type and nothing underneath the sheetmetal.

They are enjoyable and not too strenuous if you are already walking on a regular basis. I use my DVD when the weather outdoors is so nasty that I don't want to walk.

The routines are easy and fun to do and I've found them to be a remarkable way to lose weight and tone my body. I've tried so many diet and exercise programs, but this one is the first that has really shown results and it's something I can stick with. It's now part of my daily routine. Of course, you have to watch your diet too, but the program has been so successful for me that it has given me a reason to stick to a healthy diet as well. I like having 3 choices of routines too, since some days are more hectic than others and I don't always feel like doing the 2 or 3 mile programs.

I ordered the 3 volume set with the weights from Amazon and have only tried the 1st one - the 1 mile twice but I love it and can do it!!! I am not discouraged. It is very pleasant to watch and do. I can do these at home, with very little space involved, and very little coordination involved also for a beginner like me. I just love it. The input on Amazon was exactly correct. I am so glad I researched it on Amazon. In addition, I have tried exercises from books and after doing them, I felt like I was hurting myself.

The weighted balls really help. Went from 1 to 2 miles in 1 week. The 2 mile is a great work out you can finish in 30 minutes in the comfort of your own home. Still having trouble completing the 3 Mile but the 2 Mile is providing great results. No one has to see what a clutz you are. Works upper body, middle, waist and thighs, and gives you cardio to boot.

I wasn't impressed with the workout at all. #1 tape is for beginners so I didn't even try it. #2 was the High Calorie Burn. The steps were boring and she didn't do counts of 8, as she usually does. It just seemed like this dvd was thrown together. The banter between the exercisers was awful and distracting. The music wasn't loud enough and Leslie looked horrible.

Where some scorpions get into, people spill some .... all over the floor and the scorpions get bigger, all of this movie was computerized, the scorpions don't look like scorpions, so I give you all these reasons to not rent, no, to even stare at the cover of \\"Tail Sting\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain AWFUL!","review":"To sum up the plot - a bunch of passengers on an airplane get attacked by giant size scorpions which were the results of genetic experimentation. How they got on board? Well, duh...they were regular size at first and then just suddenly grew when their containers are knocked over during the trip! There was nothing scary about the film. The creatures looked so obviously fake...like out of a 50s movie. There weren't any surprises. Even the writing is just predictable and boring. And, I didn't feel compassion towards any of the characters...everything about the film is just a waste. I'm glad I only rented it.

The book then contains pages to place the cards, three per side. The pages remind me of a cheap photo album quality, but they appear to do the job.The cards themselves seem of average thickness, once again similar to a business card, and have words at the top that instruct the guest to write a wedding day wish for the couple, in a nice silver font.It might be easier display the book near the cards, laid out on a table. Then have a small basket for the guests to place the cards after they have written a message. This might reduce the risk of a tear to the book, and enable more people to write in a shorter amount of time.It is a creative idea to use rather than just a regular guest book, and gives people a chance to be more personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute and Useful","review":"I bought this item for my sister's bridal shower. It turned out to be perfect as it allowed guests the time to write their own personal note to her, rather than just sign their name.

Well recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic, Full Harmonies,","review":"It's kind of a light power pop, but there are different styles on the album also. Of course it resembles Jellyfish, Queen, Beach Boys (only more progressive), Guess Who \\"undone\\", Beatles \\"honeypie\\" and \\"I'm only sleeping\\" to name a few. Some of the lyrics are a little too silly and sappy (dragonfly), but if you think of it as a Monty Python moment, you have to love those ones also. You can tell he was having fun with the lyrics and was being sarcastic or overly intoxicated on emotion to a degree. Sandman has just amazing harmonies. What You Don't Know About the Girl should be a staple in everyone's memory like any other 'classic' song. Loser needs to be redone by a rock band like Green Day. It is a fantastic, clever song. Some of the other songs like Till We Meet Again is a little like Karen and Richard Carpenter. I like melodic music. I listen to all types of music, even good rap (which is very rare). But no one has produced anything like this for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, bad voice","review":"I have been a Jellyfish fan for quite some time and was really excited about this album. I really wish i would have listened to it before purchacing though. I agree with a previous review in that the music is great but I just cant get past Roger's voice and cheesy lyrics. I listened to it once and was instantly dissapointed. He really should have recruited Andy for the vocals. No one sings like him.

The first part of the video is all about dinosaurs and relatives of the dinosaurs that are around today - reptiles and birds. The second part is about bugs, bats, vultures, and other \\"creepy\\" creatures. The dinosaur footage is old and a bit cheesy, and adults will find the video silly, but our 3 1/2 year olds love this video and ask to watch it every day. There is a lot of scientific information in the video as you'd expect from National Geographic. It is narrated by Dudley Moore. The older video footage is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining","review":"I watched this video with my two sons, ages 6 and 13, and we all loved it!

Not only does it cover some of their favorite topics- Dinosaurs, bugs, spiders and snakes - but it also includes very interesting, factual and detailed information. And, it makes it fun! Parents will find this interesting as well. It would be a good idea to watch it WITH younger children as some kids may be disturbed by the more graphic/scary dinosaur scenes. Dudley Moore is great as the narrator, and we are planning to get more of National Geographic's Really Wild Animals videos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Dinosaur Roars and Creepy Animals","review":"It was a good video. I liked the parts where they tried to make the animals scary, especially the bats. Spin used a funny hahaha voice to try to sound creepy. But it turns out that bats aren't so scary, after all.Spin does some funny awards for dinosaurs, too.I would give this video five stars, except I couldn't believe that a duckbill whacked a T-Rex with his tail and won a battle. But I liked the rest of the movie very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double-edged sword","review":"From an adult's perspective: worst movie ever. Almost unbearable to watch.However, my kid likes it.

Mild highlights are \\"Blue Moon Over Brooklyn\\" whose intent is sweet and heartfelt but is ruined by hideous rhyming (?) couplets such as 'he started crying/said mom was dying' and the grasping at straws remake of \\"Beth\\" that has a nice stripped back acoustic treatment (see poolside Phantom of the Park) but non of the sincere emotion of the original cut.

It isn't. It was my stupid mistake because I was looking at \\"Other things that SX10 buyers buy,\\" this lens cap was one of them. But it's for the extension lens.It's not fair to give it one star, but when it was first offered, it was completely misleading. Since so many had complained about the fact that there's no tether from the lens cap to the camera, I assumed that it was a replacement lens cap. It isn't, and I guess that's enough said.I'm still looking for a replacement, btw. It's obvious to me that I'm going to lose the original.

A complaint on the S5 is that the lens cap falls off too easily, but that is a safety precaution to not damage the lens if the camera is powered up and forgetting the cap is still on. With the LAH-DC20 adapter in place the camera is extended past the lens when powered on so a much more secure cap can be put on. This is the cap for that job! Be sure to get a stick-on style lens leash to attach to this cap, because it does not come with provision for a strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits perfectly!","review":"I was amazed at the ease of use of this lens cap.

It snaps on, stays in place, and is easily removed by pinching the two buttons on either side.If you have a Canon G1X and use any filters with it, you'll need this -- the lens cap that comes with the camera does not fit the 58mm filters required by that model. This works well with a filter and filter adapter attached to the camera.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a little expensive considering that it's just plastic, probably because it his the Canon logo on it. Also, it does not include a tether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect lens cap for a back-up lens!!","review":"I was recently given an extra lens for my Canon 40D. I was not, however given a lens cap for it. After letting it ride around in my camera bag for about a week, I decided that I better protect this new gift. So I checked out Amazon (as I always do) and found this lens cap for roughly the same price as the cheapo ones.

This is the kit lens that comes with the Rebel T1i and it is labeled 58 mm. Like other reviewers have noted, the cap falls off with the slightest tap. It seems that the 2 side tabs that apply the pressure to the lens rim do not quite expand far enough out to fully grip. This was surprising since I thought buying a Canon branded cap would assure me a tight fit.I ended up removing and modifying the inner tension ring of the cap so the tabs would expand further out.

(I highly recommend the Voyage of the Beagle by Darwin, for example.) Publishing a whole volume of Ledyard is really overkill, and misstates his importance as a writer and historian. While the 20-page account of Cook's murder and the, er, unpalatable aftermath of his death is riveting, the rest of Ledyard's journal is dull. The private letters that make up the latter half of the book have little of interest to the general reader.

It doesn't show up in your network folder and is totally invisible to your network computers, depending solely on it's on software. Besides that negative, it is not that fast. I have a gigabit adapter on my computer, a gigabit switch, and a gigabit router and it took 2 days (really, 2 days) to transfer around 300mb to it. I wanted it to put songs and movies on it and let everyone in my home with a computer use it when they wanted. It's just not up to it.

Sure, she starts out as being a bit of a brat, but her character grows and matures throughout the series into a wonderfully strong, independent and competent person. This is still one of my favorite sci-fi collections. The concept of Ballybran Crystal and a job as a \\"cutter\\" was just so inspired. When I was younger I SO wanted to go to Ballybran."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lure of Crystal...","review":"My first encounter with Anne McCaffrey may very well be the best. \\"Crystal Singer\\" is an engrossing book, with a very headstrong and admirable female character. By the time her new direction in life is setup and put into motion, I was totally entranced with the book and simply could not put it down. The characters, both male and female, are well fleshed out, and her rise from a rejected opera student to a full fledged crystal singer is a fascinating journey to embark on. The premise for the book - singing and cutting crystal - is unusual and well presented. There is a definite otherworldly flavor to the book as it has a strong sci fi theme that does not assault the reader with too much techno babble, thus its an enjoyable book for the diehards and the casual alike. As the first of a trilogy, its delightful, but also stands alone well with its satisfying conclusion. Highly recommended, but with a word of warning, its nearly impossible to break away from the lure of crystal."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book in the World","review":"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. Believe me. Crystal Singer is filled with an anti-climatic plot, one dimensional characters, and predictability. Killashandra has no personality - she just is because McCaffrey willed her to be - and neither do any of the other putrid characters that step across the stage in this book. The plot has a beginning...but no middle...and no end. McCaffrey attempts some climax - in the Crystal Ranges, the installion of Crystal - but the story is just so predictable (of course we ALL know she's going to become a Crystal Singer. That's what ALWAYS happens in this type of plot) that any attempt at writing something exciting or worthwhile or even profound falls short of even McCaffrey (and she certainly is an excellent writer, don't get me wrong. But her dragon books are better)All in all, this book is a labor to get through, and not a worthwhile read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag! Glech!","review":"I'll admit right now that I went about reading this book the wrong way. First off, I learned the plot from a sanitized comic-book version when I was 12. Then I read _Kilshandra_, a book I considered ridiculous, but fun to read. Only then did I start in on _The_Crystal_Singers_. I didn't finish.Not only was the science vague and nonsensical-- forgiveable for storytellers-- but the characters reacted like badly-sculpted high-school automatons in a soap opera. Kilshandra's characterization was ludicrous as the perfect heroine, and everyone else just acted silly and stupid. Bad, bad, bad.

I can really feel what Killashandra is feeling as I read the story, it almost comes alive in my mind the way the author breathes life into her characters. The male characters as well as the female characters are given equal roles in Anne McCaffrey's books and \\"Crystal Singer\\" is no exception!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Killashandra, book 1","review":"Killashandra Ree doesn't know what she's getting herself into.

Maybe the product has changed since it last got reviewed by the May 2006 reviewer, but mine came with the Toslink adapter. Not sure what to do with it though, didn't need it. The monster cable plugged right into the stock XBOX 360 adapter. The Toslink adapter that is included is probably required if you bought the other Monster XBOX 360 Component cable set. Not sure.Anyway, if you want to plug a digital cable into the stock xbox 360 adapter and into a music system, this'll probably do the trick.The price is great too. A regular 4' fibre optic cable is retailing for $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extortion","review":"I bought the Monster component cable to replace the stock cable that came with the 360. The stock cable has a toslink out on the cable. The Monster brand has a proprietary connection instead of a toslink(1/8th mini jack). So if you want digital audio(and you do if you sprung for the Monster component cable), you are REQUIRED you to buy their optical cable in order to get the mini jack to toslink convertor.Needless to say, that is low, and yet typical of the overrated/overpriced Monster brand. Since these are the only high end A/V cables for the 360, and do make a difference, it's worth it, but beware of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xbox 360 Monster Cable Fiber Optic Cable","review":"This is a required purchase if you bought the Monster Cable VGA cable or component cable for the 360 and you want digital audio. They have a custom jack on the side of their component or VGA cable that requires an adapter unlike the Microsoft ones that have a standard Toslink jack. Buying their optical cable is only way to buy the adapter. Fortunately the prices are reasonable and for the price of a standard cable you get the adapter jack for free. Basically its a way for them to make more money off of you because there really is not a necessity for this. Its rumored that the older adapter that comes with Toslink cable for the original Xbox also works with this jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who edits this stuff?","review":"I've read all of the RDI books, and this has to be the worst.

As a native Portlander, it's so much fun to find books set in our quirky little city. Lisa Cach does a great job describing Portland. At one point she describes a fountain in a mall downtown and I knew exactly what fountain she was talking about(I've been to it many times) and it really made me feel like part of the story. Even if you don't live in Portland, I think you'll enjoy this story. My one complaint was that it was a little predictable and I could have continued reading about how Hannah and Scott turned out.

Now, if you're in the mood for a good thriller in the same vein, try David Hackworth's The Price Of Honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it and terrible product","review":"I knew I wasn't getting real gold or silver, but I didn't expect for the gold extenders to turn black after only 2 days of wear!Save yourself the trouble and spend the money to get a good quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"too big!","review":"These are great for making necklaces longer but they are thick and really doesn't look right with finer chains that I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"unless you buy it for a similar chain in design and size...very noticeable","review":"chains are large and when you put on the extender it does move around and you have to always adjust it moving it in the back.

I realize the set cost next to nothing but \\"you get what you pay for\\" holds true once again. The clasps had no springs in them. No way to keep them closed. The first - and only - time I tried to use one, the necklace fell off two times before I could leave the house. The company refunded my money with no problem, but they did manage to get in a dig at my attitude. I was told that \\"we have sold hundreds of these sets to satisfied customers\\", so, in essence, what's wrong with me? I just don't like to get ripped off. I found a local jeweler who made extenders for me - at a cost of about $10 each, and am much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks fake poor craftsmanship","review":"I bought 2 sets after reading other's review. Yes, they arrived timely. The yellow gold looks fake 24K and the silver is tarnish black, also the craftsmanship is poor. When I spoke to the customer service she said the extenders was not to be use with real gold but rather costume jewelry. To return I would loose out on Shipping both ways and the 15% restocking fee. I bought an extender in the mall at one of those earring/costume jewelry store for $5.99 that looks and is made much better, goes perfectly with my white gold chain. Chalk this up to a learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"This works well!","review":"These necklace and bracelet extentions work well and are very reasonably priced.

These were to flimsy and they weren't a close enough match."},{"rating":"1","title":"For costume jewelry only","review":"I think these extenders are just OK, considering the price point. I've had them for a little less than a week now & have been using the 4\\" gold extender almost daily. The \\"gold\\" turned a very dark brass color after approximately 2 days of use. Also, these are quite large chains. They're a lot bigger than your average pendant chain so if your necklace gets turned around on your neck, the extender will be very obvious. I took a picture to show the discoloration & size, but this particular product or vendor doesn't seem to allow for customers to share their photos. Red flag.I like the size options included in this set, but you'll have to wear these with your hair down or a collared shirt to hide the discoloration and/or large size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted.","review":"After going to a local shop with no luck on finding and extender.

I put the 2\\" (gold) extension on and it looked great, but an hour later I felt my neck and the necklace was gone! Thankfully I ended up finding it, but when I looked at it closely I could see that the clasp on the extender didn't close fully and the eye of the necklace chain slipped off the extender. I would rather wear the necklaces too short than risk losing them all together again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color didn't last a week!","review":"I wore one of the gold-tone extenders for less than one week before it turned orange, then black from tarnish. I soaked it in some jewelry cleaner for about 3 minutes, which didn't really help. Then I put it in my ultrasonic cleaner for about 90 seconds, and ALL of the gold color came off, revealing the copper & steel links beneath. I haven't tried any of the silver colored ones yet, but I'd expect the same outcome.Don't waste your money. Cheap ain't worth it if they don't even last one week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice extenders","review":"This set of necklace/bracelet extenders have done the job for me. I have purchased several necklaces but they all came with chains about 3 - 6 inches too short for how I wanted to wear them with my different tops. With three different lengths, I am able to change the length of my necklaces to fit each top. This is a nice set."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of those dreams you can't remember when you wake up","review":"For every one Elephant 6 band that is good, there are two that give the collective a bad name. Elf Power fits into the latter category.A lot is made of the \\"new psychedelic renaissance,\\" with Elephant 6 leading the way. But this stuff wouldn't even pass muster for '60s b-sides, let alone start any sort of musical renaissance. The instrumentation is psychedelic cuteness in the worst way, the lead singer can't sing worth a nickel (and seems to hit the same darn note in just about every song), and the band can't write catchy melodies to save their lives either. This band also takes \\"tweeness\\" farther than any band I've heard since The Three O'Clock -- and I thought the lead guy in THAT band sounded like a little girl.This is one elf-powered offering you can do without, take my word for it. Check out the Olivia Tremor Control, Green Pajamas, Lilys, or even the Essex Green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Elephant 6 I love","review":"I am a slavish devotee to the Elephant 6 Collective, but I may have to rethink that after listening to this release of Elf Power's. Maybe I didn't give it the time it needed to grow on me, but I can honestly say this album grated on me more than any album I have listened to this year (and I listen to a lot). It was just too sparse. Most of the tracks seemed to lack a melodic center. And the words just bounced off of me. For my money, you would be much better off with Olivia Tremor Control, The Apples in Stereo, or Beulah. Even the Red King is to be preferred to this one.I know people have rated this album off the charts, but I just have to say that it really does not do it for me. Let this be a voice of warning and/or dissent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album will get you beat up at school!","review":"I saw them live in New Orleans. They were awful. They opened for Wilco, what an embarassment for the Chicago natives. I lived in Athens just long enough to realize that this is the sort of poser music that only Athens can produce. I almost fell into the trap of thinking these guys were worth a crap until it dawned on me - this is the type of music that will get you beat up in school. // The tracks on this album are whiney boy pop rock, aspiring for something which I don't really seem to know...I don't think they do either - so, \\"hey! lets call it ART!!! They'll be sure to buy it then...\\" - Don't get caught wasting your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock at its finest","review":"Although its place in the genre of 'rock' is questionable, A Dream in Sound, along with The Winter is Coming and When The Red King Comes, is undoubtedly among the finest albums made recently, or ever. Combining skillful yet subtle instrumentals with enticing vocals, Elf Power is modern music at its best. I cannot speak highly enough about the album or the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another psychedelic rock classic by the famed elephant 6 band!","review":"Elf Power is one of the best indie rock groups around. If you don't believe me, listen to this album, \\"Creatures\\" and \\"Walking With The Beggar Boys\\". The lyrics may not be very interesting in the long run (though they are indeed very catchy and memorable which helps if you wish to sing along), but boy is it entertaining! Every song on this album has great instrumentation and is extremely fun. Andrew Rieger's vocals are, once again, very soothing and dreamy (though it varies - \\"Creatures\\" is way more dreamy sounding than this one). Every person I've played these two albums for ended up has humming or singing the choruses right after. If you're a music collector or even just a fan of rock music do yourself a favor and buy this album.Highlights include:the whole album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to be introduced to Mr. Ranglin!!","review":"Well, for me this was an introduction to Ernest Ranglin's music. I first heard the cut \\"Nyah\\" on satellite radio, and felt I had to know more. I soon copped this album, and was not disappointed. The majority of the mixes are found to be pleasant, and stays in fine tune with calypso and island jazz. I was an immediate fan from the first track, and started searching for more albums. Unfortunately, I found it hard to find Ernest's other albums in the local stores other than Surfin', but the music is worth checking for. For one who enjoys this style, I recommend Ernest's version of Bob Marley tunes as well. A legend I regret finding so late."},{"rating":"2","title":"The life of a true warrior, on and off the battlefield","review":"Hack loved the Army and loved his country, and this comes through every page and word in this lengthy autobiography. There is so much information contained in the over 800 pages, spaning the life on an Infantryman from the Merchant Marine in the final stages of WWII until his retirement after his last Vietnam tour in 1971, that probably everybody will find something to like and/or dislike. He chose to tell his story in detail and with a clear aim, and he succeeded. If you serve(ed) in the Armed Forces, this book is a required reading and will give you plenty of material to think about. If you never wore a uniform, a few things might not be readily understandable but you will still have an interesting story to read (maybe skipping a few pages here and there) - highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of an American Warrior who fought through two wars.","review":"A extremely moving story of a man that fought his way through two wars.

He seemingly holds back nothing. Parts drag...post war duty in Germany...but that's Army life. It's not as on the edge as his recollections of combat, but that's the way it was.His writings on Korea alone make this a must read.But it keeps going, giving you his evolving perspective on what was and wasn't happening in Vietnam. He calls a spade a spade.There is a little overlap (not much), but I would read this first, then Steel My Soldier's Hearts. Then, look at his webpage and Soldiers for the Truth. He's squarely on the side of the dogface soldier for whom few speak for fear of their career. If I could chose the man to lead my Sons into war, it would be Hack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best combat narrative by a real warrior","review":"Colonel Hackworth's book is the best account I have ever read of a soldier's life experiences with vivid descriptions of what it is like to be in combat.

The description does not imply this at all!!! The mat does not provide a relief from fatigue, as well as not being an adequate truck bed protector. We were looking for a solid mat as sold by many other companies. I made the mistake of just reading the description rather than enlarging the picture. When I purchase items on Amazon I have never had to research the item in depth. The description has always been accurate. I learned a lesson this time and will enlarge all pictures and go the website of the company that handles the item.The company refunded the cost of the item, but refused to send me a return label for the merchandise. So the shipping and handling I originally paid for the mat was not refunded. Now I have an item I paid $16.10 for and it will not work for the purpose I bought it for.Thank you,A lesson to be learned"},{"rating":"1","title":"No excuse for this CD","review":"This CD is a blatant attempt to capitlize on archived music, with absolutely no regard for quality. The sound is horrible, and the CD includes the shorter 45 rpm mix of \\"Crimson & Clover\\" rather than the album mix. Imagine putting a portable AM radio in your CD player and you'll have an idea how bad this CD sounds.

It offers EVERY Top 40 hit that Tommy James and the Shondells charted with from 1966's \\"Hanky Panky\\" to Tommy's solo hit \\"Draggin' The Line\\" from 1972. And yes, unlike some fake copycats available, EVERY track on this CD are all the original recordings that TJ's fans have come to know and love. There is no excess \\"filler\\" or \\"fluff\\" on this disc, and you get nothing but Tommy's best. The only flaw with this excellent set is that \\"Crimson and Clover\\" is the shortened 45 rpm version (3:30) instead of the full length 6 minute album version. Still a can't miss CD if you love that late 1960's music like I do. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One half the music, one channel extremely quiet","review":"I had the cassette years ago and the stereo and sound separation was excellent for that format. This CD production was copied wrong resulting in one channel being so soft you can hardly hear the second Guitarist playing some solos and back-ups. If you like music the way it is suppose to sound and get frustrated hearing a great song missing half the instruments, don't torture yourself and buy this CD. I played the cut \\"Crimson and Clover\\" once, heard all the errors in the mixing and flipped the CD out the window, it was more enjoyable watching cars run over it than hearing the poor quality it had. Spare yourself and find a better version than this piece of slip-shod product. lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album.","review":"Excellent album. I have the Anthology on tape, and bought this CD over that CD to save a little money. It has everything I really love. Never knew there was a longer album version of Crimson & Clover, as this is the only one I've ever heard.

Every moment is a hook, and there isn't a clinker in the bunch. The production and musicianship are as good as any music from that era. Slick? Yes, and that's a good thing. Commercial?

Why do people find it neccesarry to ruin good songs. Remakes are terrible. The guy on \\"You Rock My World\\" gave me a laugh though. Michael's laugh on the track is very sexy but this guy? Come on. He sounded like a creepy old man. And at the begining of \\"They don't really care about us\\", the girls who remade it sound like total preps who have no idea how serious descrimaination is.

After listening to about 5 of the tracks in complete, I was dissatisfied. In 'Dangerous', Michael speaks in a slow and sleak voice. Yet the singer covering the song rushes through the spoken part, leaving ten second gaps between the the next phrase. Every song on this album, with the exception of 'Human Nature', puts shame to the King of Pop. Most of these songs sound like the Vocal Guides to a MJ karaoke cassette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh What Fun!","review":"Have had these before and bought this for my ne\`phew for his 1st week at dentistry.

And, that you can't have great humor writing without great writing, but there's plenty of mediocre writing in this book, like too many cutesy parenthetical asides.There are some interesting points here and there, but the price of a used copy will be more in line with the book's value."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Write Funny ... it's good, and funny","review":"The book is a collection of opinions about humorous writing by several well published humor authors. It's good reading, and darned interesting (my favorite was a transcript of a discussion of comedic writing, by 5 authors).The funniest part of the book is the contrast.

To give an instance, he clearly says that if we use the recent form which does not include the .h extension for instance in case of the header file - stdio , then it has to be accompanied by the statement: 'using namespace std' (in this case) or we have precede all identifiers defined inside the library with the keyword 'std' followed by :: or else the compiler would give an error.This is because all recent header files are members of a namespace 'std'. This was just an example that shows that the author has made VC++ accessible to people from a non programming background and I appreciate the effort that he has taken."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite","review":"I have always loved this book and am so glad that it became available for the kindle.

However, this scenario makes for a wonderfully angst-filled romance, for those readers who enjoy tortured lovers! Joseph is endearing and a classical \\"good man\\" and is therefore easy to fall in love with. Winn is slightly more difficult to support, in my mind, but still inspires sympathy.

And when I do expose Rory Gallagher's catolog to the great unwashed, I am always asked, \\"Why wasn't Rory Gallagher popular here in the states?\\" I don't have the exact answer but it may have something to do with Rory not being a pop act the way Clapton was. Clapton was great at playing the blues but most of Clapton's successes were pop songs. Rory never went near the pop idiom; pure stripped-down blues rock. Same with Robin Trower.

This book comes along quietly and just makes an amazing place to be, which is something so many books of poems (that seem to be so much more about admiring what the poet has read, can do, knows, has experienced, etc.) don't do nowadays.

However, it is rare that you can find a good read about games and this book fits that criteria. It is also interesting to read a book where you think you know how to play the game, but then realize that there is a level WAY beyond your play (at least mine), and can appreciate it.While the SCRABBLE parts of the book are great, if you're not into that, you can still read it for the interesting people and the insight into competition and what drives them to more-or-less dedicate their lives to something most everyone thinks of as a coffee table game."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I really, really wanted to like this book and actually gave two copies as presents before I'd even read it myself. Sadly though, I'm still slogging through it and it is tough going. Though I'm not even in the realms of the blue-hairs, I do love Scrabble and thought I'd be interested in the in-and-outs but am finding his style of writing tedious and annoying at best. I like when he talks about other players or the history of the game but find myself falling asleep when he talks about his tournament games and attempts to memorize words. I'd recommend this book only for those so obsessed with the game that they'd care enough to know all the four letter possibilities and why SATINE is such a perfect word. For the rest of you (us), use what free-time you have to just enjoy the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for Scrabble lover - Great book for anyone","review":"I'm 25, and I can count the number of books I've read since High School on one hand.

To say \\"I was let down\\" would probably make understatement of the year. The dismal world of Soul Reaver is more like an empty exploration game than an RPG or action game. The monsters are mundane, the hero is dull and one-sided and the ending (or lack thereof) is the worst pile of snot I've ever had the displeasure of getting from hard hours invested in a video game.

You go through a big bare strip of land!), there are no swords, maces, or axes, just primitive spears that you grab off walls! Everything you kill is killed the same way: Impaling. In Blood Omen, you can make your victims explode, implode, drain their blood, cast a spell to make them kill each other, etc. And it's lack of direction is annoying. Normally, I love challenges, but this is rediculus!

I just do not recommend this game, unless you love to deal with bugs! Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the big change?","review":"The first Legacy of Kain game was the best game I have played, ever. Soul Reaver seems to take on the characteristics of every other game available. It's a weak version of the lamest games out there. In comparison with the Blood Omen, I'm sorry, I wasted my money.

Amazing","review":"ok, I have to be honest. This game totally rocked. The graphics were surprisingly impressive and the combatives that you use, (Such weaponry as the soul reaver, Kain Reaver, Ariel reaver, Fire Reaver, Etc) is impressive and totally sucks you in. There are two reasons that I gave this game 4 stars instead of five stars: It can be very hard due to the puzzles and lack of direction, and plus it can be boring after a while because the enemies get pretty redundant after the first couple of levels. On the other hand, this game is worth buying. I enjoyed exploring the dark, scary, gut wrenching and yet unique world of Nosgoth, and I am hoping to get Blood Omen 1. Either way, this game is fun.

It takes the lush, evocative adventure engine of Eidos' Tomb Raider series, and pours it into an entirely new mold - one filled with foreboding shadows, haunting cries, delerious nightmare dreamscapes, and sinister abandon. If you're into vampires, this is your magnum opus. The graphics are incredible, the control is clean, the plot is elaborate and compelling, and the \\"two worlds\\" duality is ingenious. This game is amazing! The problems are few, but major - (1) Although somewhat free-wheeling, the game is still quite linear, and it's not always clear what to do next. Expect to spend a lot of time wandering, marvelling at the gothic beauty around you. (2) The game craps out in the middle of the story! What a blatant \\"buy the sequel\\" sell-out.

Ludwig Weber sings with his usual superior musicianship, and Windgassen shines - it's refreshing to hear just how beautifully he could sing apart from The Ring and Tristan. Varnay is a bit cautious, but her final scene at the operas finale when she cuts loose from the back of the stage is absolutely hair-raising...I get goosebumbs just thinking about it!

But the single most overriding theme that came out time and time again is the whining: I wanna be a good medic; I wanna be respected; I wanna be a hero; I keep making mistakes. Most people that have a conscience do want these things, but those with a clue just suck it up and keep working and working to improve. Along with that is the ability to admit mistakes and work on them, not whining and crying about them. The other issue that came out is the sense that he doesn't see patients as people, just as an opportunity to show off how great he can be and improve his image. If you see the book in the library, or the bookstore leaf through it, it may have other elements that appeal to you. I am disappointed in the money I spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read","review":"The book is fun to read and has given me insight into my brother's career as a paramedic.

I definitely enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about what paramedics do.

The breakdown of these important tools needed for any woman to succeed into 12 strategies was masterful in that it provided the reader with a guideline of steps to follow.I particularly enjoyed reading about strategy 7 called, Marketing: Brand You. This particular strategy focuses on knowing your value and more importantly shows you how to make those around you realize your value. This chapter literally lays out all the necessary tools to market yourself whether it be for a promotion, a new job, or any other career move.Another thing I love aobut the book is the great examples it gives for every strategy. It is extremely helpful to see how each of these 12 strategies can be successfully put into action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Stickers!","review":"The book arrived great, my daughter seems excited about them.

Do not expect to talking politics or philosophy with this book, as it is simply written to give us some time off. There is some funny word choices and conversations on ocassion but nothing too much to distract from the story.The story feels as though it was written some time ago. After a quick check, I find it was originally published in 1973, and I think that the writing style shows some age to it. But... I was going to give this only 3 stars, but it was a good time waster that did not require too much thinking.

John McDermott could have recorded it during the intermission of a hockey game or his lunch break. The liner notes have all of the verses for each anthem, but McDermott only chooses to sing one verse of each. He is in good voice, but the backup group sounds like a bass, trumpet and electric guitar. Surely this type of music deserves the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and not a garage band. The best cuts are America the Beautiful and Auld Lang Syne. This is the shortest full priced CD I've seen since I started collecting in 1985. I cannot recommend this unless you are a John McDermott groupie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pepper Pad 3 -- too hot to handle","review":"In the few days that I had the Pepper Pad 3, I enjoyed it. However, as it neared the end of a battery charge, and in the early part of the recharging cycle, the area of the case under the right hand on the back (presumably the area over the battery?) became literally too hot to touch. Obviously, the interior heat must have been considerably higher.This greatly distressed me, because it was uncomfortable, because I began to fear that the battery might explode (in light of recent stories in the tech news), and because that much heat can't possibly bode well for the longevity of a solid-state electronic device. I returned it.If not for the heat problem, the only complaint I would have had was somewhat short battery life. I would have given it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Format the Problem Not the Content","review":"I love the Book of Virtues. I have the print edition and have read many a story to my grandchildren when they stay the night. I bought the Kindle version (not cheap) expecting to do the same, but my version lacks a table of contents! Maybe the download was incomplete or hasn't synced - not sure who to contact on this - as it seems implausible that with 100's of poems and stories, there is no way to find them or navigate to them. I don't even know where to begin other than to go page to page. I read another review where someone mentioned there was a table of contents at the topic level, but I didn't even see that in my Go To menu. I'm hoping this is user error on my part, but if not, I wouldn't recommend the Kindle version.

Many of the works are butchered. Sometimes not even the original title is included and it seems that authors are missing from several as well. He even butchers Aesops fables -- guess he doesn't want to overtax young minds with the full versions in all their splendor. Of course, many of the selections are classics, but what he's edited out leaves me not only cold but disgusted. If your kids internallize some of the slop used to demonstate these virtues, it will be hard to erase a number of pernitious misconceptions later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly Dull","review":"How many of you found sermons vastly entertaining as children? Do you think they'd be more entertaining if in the confines of a book? Victorianate horror(such as the previously mentioned ill fated door slammer poem), prattling on about the often obscure, abstracted moral of the story, do not an interesting book make.Often, the book makes a joke of itself, droning on about *serious* morals drawn from *silly* stories. I gave this book two stars because Bennette obviously put some amount of effort into this book, and I believe that deserves some merrit, sadly, there is not much else in this book that I can congradulate him on."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need more virtues in the world today!","review":"This book makes a wonderful gift as it entails all the simplistic virtues that life holds using stories, poems and quotes.

We often look to mystics of the east - which is all well and dandy - but we have here true american/english stories that teach just as well. In fact, being western may make it just that much more powerful. Get this book for your kids and read to them nightly and as you read keep your ears open b/c the lessons of this book are for the young and old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea didn't come out too well","review":"Celebrating virtue is a good thing. Compiling stories in praise of them is also good. Bennett's approach though leaves alot to be desired, labeling many things virtues on which others might disagree (cleanliness is on par with honesty??). A better job of editing and selecting stories would have made this well-meaning project much more enjoyable.I am a bit confused by other reviewers' comments that Bennett pushes a conservative ideology here. His right-wing views are well-known but don't come across in the book. I am a liberal but found nothing \\"conservative\\" about his selections. Bennett specifically states at the start that good, moral people can be liberal or conservative, which I thought was very virtuous of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Counter to some of the Negative Reviews","review":"[...] This book is good for people.

This author was widely reported in the news media to be a compulsive gambler, even by the conservative Weekly Standard.To redeem himself, William Bennett should review his book to include moral lessons on gambling, using himself as case study. He can then truly earn the respect he may deserve for the boldness to lecture the public on the subject of morality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Oldfield Turning Point","review":"One great piece...

What the book is, is a manuscript showing you the technical aspects of the basics, the science of Karate if you will.This is somthing highly overlooked and in most parts of the world, lost. You can not become a good Karateka without mastery of the basics. Here the author teaches you what you have missed due to constent watering down of techniques as it is passed from master to student throughout the generations.Basics to Okinawan masters, secrets to us.Until now that is. keep in mind, this book as with all Okinawan Karate books is not designed for sport as much as it is (was) designed for combat.Time to review your basics and get them right with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Okinwan Karate!","review":"Hello for the most part this book depicts Arakaki's personal techniques as he uses them for his K-1 type of fighting.

I still travel there several times a year and after 30years of doing this im by far no expert in anything. But I think the information should be in a Sabaki or K-1 manual instead of an Okinawa Karate book. Also he severly hyperextends his elbows in MANY of his techniques which is a NO NO whatever someone studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusion!","review":"This is possibly one of th worst books I have ever seen on Karate. Its an absolute mess and mish mash of ideas. The Author tries to present Okinawan karate in japanese Budo context??? instead of trying to find reasonable answers to problems he has jammed various things together to create an ugly hybrid. The techniques shown are more related to full contact kickingboxing than Okinawan karate. There is no relation between the fighting techniques and the kata.

Dr. Sue apparently would like to ignore the changes and continue to rehash the old steretypical behaviors of white Americans at their worst. All of his examples of prejudicial thinking and discriminatory actions are about whites mistreating minorities. He paints a picture of social work being run by uptight white middle class do-gooders who hold their clients to their own ethnocentric standards.

Looks ok, and you would think that a phone would be so ubiquitous that it would be hard to get wrong, but man, this thing is wrong. The sound is terrible, tons of background static.

Plus, the included phone cord is way to short, pretty much meaning you can't stand up with it if it is on your desk, you must remain seated in order to keep the phone from being jerked up into the air with you.

A phone is virtually useless if I can't receive calls when I need to!

It portrays accurately what that war quickly became. 1/3 was the first Marine combat unit in Vietnam in March 1965. This unit set the standards for this war.

The approach is quite deliberate at times, but it allows the music to unfold in a way that reveals hidden depths of expression, due in large part to Serge Baudo's careful direction. A recent recording of these concertos by Stephen Hough, for example, seems barnstorming and merely flashy by comparison.All in all, the pairing of Ciccolini and Baudo is a fine choice for a complete set of these piano concertos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!!!","review":"Do not use this product unless you enjoy frustration and want to ruin your project.

The remote would beep intermittently while in the cradle due to poor electrical contact. The first battery lasted less than 6 months and the second battery lasted less than 3 months. Replacement batteries are around $35-$40. The LCD started to fade in less than 1 year.The software is poor and always wants to connect to the RF Extender prior to programming the remote.

I bought the 890 because I placed my components in a closet and needed a RF remote. I was very excited and anticipated this remote working smoothly. The problem I had was scrolling through the guide or recorded list on my Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300HD. Whenever I pressed the arrow once, it actually scrolled twice. It worked fine whenever I pointed the remote directly at the unit, but this was not reasonable since the unit was in a closet. After spending a day on the phone with support, they sent me another remote/extender - and I had the same problem. I finally bought the x10 Powermid and it works great with the remote sending a RF signal into the closet. Therefore, my recommendation would be to buy the Harmony 880 remote and the x10 Powermid. I love these remotes, but the RF extender needs a little more work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and easy to use!","review":"I've been using this remote control for about two months now. It is so simple and easy to set up (Just hook it up to your computer via USB and follow the easy-to-use Wizards.. Voila!) and the best part of all: It works! It has replaced a total of FIVE remote controls now (TV, DVD, Receiver, iPod, and Cable Box) and can still handle more.This remote comes with an optional-to-use device that uses radio frequencies versus infrared, so you can close the doors to your entertainment center/cabinet and still use the remote-perfectly! My setup has the TV on top on a cabinet-style stand, so the TV is always in view, and the electronic devices are all safely/neatly inside. I only have to open the doors when I'm putting in a DVD!This gets my absolute highest recommendation. If you don't need the radio frequency device, you can get the 880 model. It's cheaper but works otherwise exactly the same.Walt D in LV"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech lives up to its name","review":"We bought a new high def TV, DVD player, and receiver/amp 18 months ago.

Month or so later it started freezing. Had to remove the batteries to reboot. Started to get annoying.4. Month or so later it started to respond slow when you took it off of the charger. 30 sec or so of no use. That's a long time when you want to watch some TV.5. THE LAST STRAW!

I have to depress it harder than the other buttons.The IR Blaster is controlling 4 items in a closet 15'-20' away and works like a champ.My only general complaint is that the contour and slick surface makes one-handed operation difficult for the upper buttons.

Then it is the most archaic interface on a product today, once installed, the activity button doesnt work. If you press POWER, it brings you to activity. Woops. Most important button to the remote doesnt work. My last one broke in a year, no replacement. Before that, the battery didnt fit right so I had to jerry rig with plastic to get it to charge.

I don't know if I just had a defective product or what, but when it was left overnight in it's charging cradle it would be locked up in the morning and the only way to \\"reboot\\" was to remove the battery. I have returned the device and purchased a Mastercontrol RFS200 made by Universal Remote Control and found this to be a much better product. It's easy to program because it doesn't connect to a computer for programing like the Logitech does.In addition, I had to contact Logitech support a couple times for programming support, and they were very helpful, but when I contacted them on the locking up problem they said I needed to be bumped up to their 2nd level of support who would contact me within 24 hours.

The wireless RF extender is not wireless at all it has like 8 wires that need to be attached to each one of the components, so if you want to control other rooms you have to buy more \\"wireless extenders\\" to control all your house as they advertise.4. And the most annoying thing is that every time you need to update your system or add new components or activities, you have to unplug your \\"wireless extender(s)\\" because it needs to be updated too, even though you are updating just IR signals.All in all is a great remote after you have it working; you can get rid of all those remotes you can collect now a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money with poor support","review":"It would not recognize any of my equipment.

Logitech continues to provide support (new devices and software upgrades).Cons:1. Setup can be lengthy and if you add anything new, you must update again -- both the remote and the extender.2. Every few weeks, it will not charge. Wiping the contacts in the cradle and on the device itself with a damp cloth fixes it for me.

Logitech has replaced my unit 4 times for the exact same issue: it just stops charging. I received the 5th unit in mid-June and it is already dead from the same issue. Logitech has finally decided to not replace it again, and instead offered me 50% a new remote.

My old universal remote you had to start with everything off. The help menu is great, don't be afraid to use it. My cable company has a new cable box coming soon, so I haven't done all the fine tuning yet, but basic functions are working well.

I tried for 2 hours to get it going (had to reinstall new software version as old one sent with the product froze) and multiple calls to Logitech support. I had entered a listing for a DVD player that couldn't be found and it froze. Logitech support said I would have to start all over again. So it still isn't working."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY FOR TIVO!!!","review":"Bought this product to use with brand new Vizio LCD TV, brand new Samsung DVD surround sound system and 2-yr old Hughes DirecTV Tivo box. Each time I turn the system on at least one or more of the the components don't turn on or turn on to the wrong setting causing me to have to use the help menu every time (which works 90% of the time and takes more time than getting up and turning on each component manually). Most of the buttons on the remote are way to small. Clicking the fast forward buttons for Tivo slows forwarding down as opposed to using the same process on the original Tivo remote.Bottom line is that I now have 4 remotes on my coffee table and only use 3 of them.PS. I would advise looking for a better device even if you don't use Tivo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"The install process went fine on my Mac running OS X 10.4.6. I encountered some not-unexpected problems with my H-P television because I had recently updated its firmware. A (fairly lengthy) call to the excellent Logitech support center took care of everything.My Harmony is controlling 6 devices, all from different manufacturers, none of whom designed their product to be used this way. I don't think it's reasonable to expect seamless ease in these circumstances. I figured setup would consume an afternoon, and there would be a couple of small issues left for later fiddling. That's about the way it worked out.This product is for users who are somewhat geeky. If you've ever wasted an hour building a custom macro in Word, you'll probably like the Harmony 890. If you get angry when Word converts (c) to the copyright symbol, you need a different remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ready for Prime Time","review":"I ended up returning the Harmony 890 for a refund. It almost did everything I needed, but it could not do one critical task that made it useless. What it could not do was select the proper video inputs on my Samsung DLP bigscreen. So, I still had to do this manually (using the Samsung remote -- thus defeating the purpose of buying a universal programmable remote).An email to Logitech asking for help elicited no response. None. I was pretty surprised. I am fairly technical and I could see in the program listing of internal commands that the unit was sending out the wrong command. But, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to go in and change it. So, I emailed support. And, never heard anything back.I had high hopes for this product. I rarely return products -- usually I can get them to do want what I want. But, in this case, I gave up and just returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"890 Packaging misleading","review":"I have devices located in different rooms (TV in one room, mini-system in another etc.) and I was looking for a remote that could control these devices independent of each other. If you look at the packaging of the 890, it clearly shows an activity bar called Living Room Activities and an Activity called Change Room. The 890 is NOT capable of setting up devices/activities by room. According to Logitech technical support, if you want to do this, you will need the 890 Pro, not the 890.With the 890, you can tell it to leave other devices on when selecting an activity, but this means if you select the Watch DVD activity and then later select the Watch TV activity, it will leave the DVD player on. Logitech's recommendation is to then push the Device button, then select DVD and then select Off. As I stated in the heading, the packaging is misleading. It shows features (grouping activities by room, changing rooms) the 890 is not capable of doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Harmony about it","review":"Great idea, poor follow through.

Programing takes some trial and error, but the basic functions work out of the box. Nice to have the web page update for the commands on my equipment, no need to find product codes and etc. The trial and error part comes in when you create activity functions, like listen to satalite music via theater sound system and pre-tune to jazz.

If you find this difficult, well I am sorry to say but there is no help for you, I just think some people just love to complain. If you are tired of using multiple remotes, these logitech remotes do the trick. Ok you can't control your whole life on it.

There are a hundred tiny buttons of which 3 never worked at all and another 4 were sticky. Fortunantly, the ones that never worked were for special tasks that I rarely used. Once programmed, it worked OK, but the small buttons make it very hard to select specific channels.

I was almost concluding this is just one more nice hardware with a poor software and then I found out that the one the buttons (the right direction one) just doesn't work for any of my devices (TV, DVD and Xbox).I'm returning it and will give it a second shot - perhaps I was just unlucky and a new device will be ok.

After the LCD still did not work, Logitech replaced it. Good job Logitech, you stand behind your products, steadily improve them and provide a good deal of support.

It is very difficult to set-up. We eventually had to call customer support. After about a 30 minute wait on hold, we finally spoke to a company rep who did solve our problem. But shortly afterwards the navigation controls that are supposed to work with our Comcast cable box stopped working. We called the support line and after holding for 30 minutes and after listening to a recorded message informing us how valuable they know our time is, a rep finally picked up the call only to inform us that the number listed on the web site was not the correct one for Harmony. We were transferred to the Harmony division and after holding for an additional 15 minutes were told that their computer was down and they could not help us. This is not a joke. This is exactly how it happened. The device is not inexpensive, but it feels cheaply constructed and it is very difficult to use. Strongly NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I have have had three of these remotes, and they are worthless.

Any time I have called for actual support on the other two it was non-existent.

I thought all the bad reviews were written by novices who are not that computer literate. I was wrong.I spent half a day cycling through various upgrades with one of the buggiest softwares I have seen in twenty years. The key issue is to upgrade the firmware of the wireless extender first. The software that comes with it gets you hung up.

So they were completely unhelpful. I then emailed Logitech. Got a response 3 days later. Was helpful. Finally got the remote to work. But found a few more glitches.

I chose this one on the recommendation of the guy I bought my tv from. Easy set-up and non-frustration factor are important to me (one of the technically average). Set-up was very easy by downloading updates first, reading the directions and inputting with your computer. I experienced some components not switching on and off at first, but by pushing the help button on the remote and following the screen directions, the remote corrected these problems and I haven't had a problem since. Here's an aside... My technically astute neighbor and his whiz electrician buddy both purchased one after using this remote. (They both are loving it too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great support, lousy documentation","review":"The Logitech 890 remote is a great product. The remote works best if used thru Logitech's activity based commands. You can also customize the remote if you want to spend the time to program additional commands where you need them. The documentation on customizing is lousy and needs to be written to show what this product really is capable of doing. Yes, the buttons are small but are illuminated so that you can read them. Response thru the RF extender is superb. I should note you should keep the RF extender handy until you finish customizing since you need to update it along with the remote every time you change something. Finally, customer support is excellent especially since they speak English and are sincerely determined to make your problem disappear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Setup!","review":"The setup was extremely simplified. I can appreciate Logitech programming the remote and the IR blaster for me and relieving me of the pain. I have the following equipment located in an electronics closet.

When it doesn't, expect a phone call to tech support. In my experience, This product works great most of the time but looses a conection with the RF extender and can be difficult to get back. The software is a bit confusing and could be easier to use. Every change or upgrade to the remote requires you to also disconnect the RF extender from your components and connect it to the computer as well as the remote. Battery life could be better.

Then, when I connected to internet to update the firmware, the LCD screen went blank and has been blank ever since. Coincidence? IMHO, Logitech has abandoned the 890 Pro and would like us to replace it with one of their newer products...how long will they support those products? Their customer service has offerred me a 50% off coupon on another remote...so, since I spent $400 on the first, and now $200 if I take their offer, I'll have $600 invested in a remote that Logitech can make obsolete at any time they choose.

They did offer a 50% discount off their retail price, which resulted with just a few dollars less than a normally discounted price. This of course forces you to purchase the new unit, charging base, and extender even though only the remote was unusable.When I did have it, it worked ok, but seemed to have trouble charging correctly. It would go in and out of charge on the charging base, beeping each time it did. It was something I just put up with.Anyway, I used it for a little less than a year until I changed my audio/video hardware.

It's one of those things you would need to mess with for a couple of 8 hour days to get everything timed and working right. I never called Tech Support, I just sent it back and gave up.

I can however mention Logitech's abysmal customer service. My 7 month old Harmony got a cracked LCD (not sure how, I grabbed it from the cradle one morning and it was messed up). After contacting Logitech, they told me that they don't do repairs, but would sell me a new remote for 50% off their list price (which is $250) - plus shipping. Which net's out to the same price I'd pay here at Amazon (within 4 dollars). I found that pretty snarky. I'd have gladly paid for a repair if they don't think it's a defective LCD, but to tell me I just need to buy a new one was a little cavalier.

What I found is that I had to tweak most of my devices using my original remotes from the devices. I have Yamaha products and they always have problems with other remotes. It took a while to get everything to work but now works great. I use the remote to control devices that are inside of a cabinet using the RF extender and at the same time can control my tv using the IR feature.

After an hour of trying to figure it out i called Harmony tech support. Their guy couldn't get the 890 to take input from either my computer or the sony remote, so referred me to their level 2 support. After waiting a half hour for someone to pick up i was disconnected. I emailed tech support, but after 5 days i hadn't heard from them. That's all the hassle i'm willing to put up with, so sent the unit back to Amazon.Amazon, of course, is great about it all - quick response, no hassle, full credit.

I'm about to buy a new remote now. Do not buy this unless you've figured out that Logitech has fixed this hardware issue.Update: Note that I was able to \\"fix\\" the remote by opening it again and putting small drops of hot glue on the button points that don't respond.

The repeater system works quite well and will make it possible for you to hide your equipment.A major drawback is that advanced programming is out of the question. Logitech uses a web based program and they have made up your mind on how the device is to be programmed. What I mean is since it was designed to be so easy to use they have made it impossible to correct mistakes in their programming. Simply put the software used to program this remote effectivley reduces the device to a good $80 universal remote with a $80 IR repeater system.Great Job...

In addition, they then told me that if the fix did not work (which it didn't), that the only recourse would be to get a new remote, which they would give me a 50% off any remote on their website.So basically if you have a problem with your remote, you will pay for technical service and will probably have to get a new remote.

Svetlanov and his USSR State Symphony played with somewhat a greater sonority whereas Kondrashin and the Moscow Philharmonic has more of the balance and the transparency in their performance. With Tchaikovky's Third Orchestral Suite of 1883, both conductors were successful in painting the sentimental, passionate, optimistic sides of Russia's greatest composer after the 1870s. The performances were consistantly well-played and nothing but pride and admiration were apparent, especially in listening to the Kondrashin's recording.

Well, maybe yours will, but don't invest money that you may lose.Did I just find a bad one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fryer.","review":"This fryer works great and holds the temperature well. It is a shallower fryer than some. Deep enough to handle everything but large game hens or larger food. Being shallow and wide gives it a significant advantage. It creates a larger surface area within the basket for food to cook. This allows for more items to be cooked at once when you need a little space between each item!Immersion heaters do use a bit more oil volume but that added volume also leads to a more stable cooking temperature over time. As a result, the fryer seems to hold temperature well and cycles back to temperature relatively quickly.1800 watts is a lot of heating power. The fryer will draw around 15 amps of current! If you have an older house, you will need to plug it into a circuit that has nothing else connected to it. If you need to run power from somewhere else in your house -- I prefer to fry outdoors -- you will need a heavy duty extension cord.

Not all the tracks are tight, however: \\"Tooth and Nail\\" doesn't seem to be going beyond sort of typical spy-funk (the dark groove of \\"Slave One\\" with its sample from Smoke City's \\"Devil Mood\\" is much better), and \\"The Woodsman and the Wolf\\" has more mediocre M.C.ing. \\"The G# Spot\\" and \\"Neon Tetra\\" help redeem those tracks, but also suffer a bit from aimless, freeform drift.

I made six coasters and only used a few ounces of the product, I have plenty left to make more for Christmas gifts! It did have to set pretty much overnight, but the resulting glossy finish was amazing. Everyone thought I'd had the coasters made professionally somewhere.

Do not overly concern yourself with spreading it evenly, as the product is self leveling. I did take the advice of another reviewer about alleviating air bubbles utilizing a straw. Also, make sure that you apply in a dust free/lint free area as the product is very sticky. I also love the fact that the product has absolutely no odor. The thick, high gloss finish hardens to the touch within 24 hrs. and is ready to utilize in 72.

Super effective.Will buy from again, when my 14 pairs wear out one day in the far future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Addicted To Earplugs","review":"I've worn earplugs every night for the past five years. I've tried all different kinds. These, by far, are the best.Most earplugs, once they're in your ears just right, do a pretty decent job of cutting out sound. However, I've had difficulty getting that perfect fit with lots of other earplugs (including Hearos Ultimate Softness). Other earplugs seem to \\"kind of\\" fit, but unless I waste a lot of time adjusting them, they never form a good seal in my ears and therefore don't block out sound very well.Not the case with these earplugs. They conform to my ears perfectly, first try, every time.Disclaimer: Your experiences will probably vary according to your own ear shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be labeled extra large!","review":"These things are huge. Every time I tried to use them, they'd work their way right out, no matter how much I squished them. I finally started cutting them in half the long way and then folding them over. That works pretty well, at least makes them usable. I bought them because they were a good price. The orange ones I've bought in the past didn't work their way out of my ears, so I'll probably buy those next time.Now I understand why another reviewer complained about these coming out of their ears. I thought maybe they just didn't know how to use them properly. Now I know--they're BIG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, great at this value","review":"I originally bought it for air-travel quietness. It definitely served that; but didn't make all-quiet though.for other times, like for sound sleep, it's almost perfect.Con:Plugs are not reusable, 2 times tops. it picks dirt from ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused Tinnitus","review":"I now have severe inner ear damage thanks to these earplugs. I would caution anybody using earplugs to sleep to be careful. I usually sleep on my right side, so I believe these earplugs were pushing up against my right ear and caused some inner ear damage. Now, I get this constant ringing in my ear which my doctor diagnosed as tinnitus and there's no cure for this condition. :(So please, take care of your ears and be aware when using these earplugs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well but cotton in your ears...doesn't work","review":"They don't stay in my ears and as I'm typing this with them barely in my ears I can hear myself typing on my MacBook Pro.... I was hoping to block out noise completely.....this product does not do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Stay In My Ears","review":"I have not been able to find earplugs that will stay in my ears. Is it because women's ears are smaller? Get them inserted then out they pop if I move. A waste of money and very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your Money!","review":"I bought these based off of some reviews I read and I have to say I am dissapointed. I'm a very light sleeper and was hoping that it could help drown some of light noises my neighbor produces late at night. Boy, was I wrong. It did absolutely nothing! I could hear so clearly that it was almost like I had nothing at all in my ears. Plus, they don't fit well at all, so when you try to fit them in your ear, they fit for a second and then stretch back to its regular size. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I order a lot of things from Amazon, and this is one of the few items that really disappointed me. The earplugs simply did not muffle sound nearly to the extent that I had hoped.

I have tried many others, but these ones work the best for me. The most important thing is to roll them into a skinny tube and while lifting the top of your ear up with one hand, put the hearo way in and allow it to expand, then let go of your ear. My husband snores so these really help drown out the noise. I change them out about twice a week because I think fresh ones work the best. The only problem I have had, is when I don't take the time to insert them properly and they work their way out of my ear in the middle of the night. They are still in, but not as effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching story","review":"Other than some profanity at the end, the movie was great.

But, I have it now, and I enjoyed watching it very much and I am sure it will be a favorite to watch again and again.I love the scenery, the setting was Colorado, I don't know where it was filmed, but it sure made me think of some of the places I have visited in Colorado.The actors were wonderful, Ann Margaret, especially.I recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Not the best torch, but it got the job done and we were happy with its proformance.

The full set of additional Notes are not included in many other free public editions.Warning: this Kasidah contains a carefully considered critique of world religious thought, from the time before the Egyptians to approximately 1880."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily Readings for meditation - Hazeldon","review":"It is a great book and did buy it for people I work with in prison to help them.

The only thing this game has going for it is it is a rumble pack game which is fun. I think they put all of their development money into liscensing the Nascar logo and driver names."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best albums you've never heard","review":"I would hardly ever give anything five stars, but considering the number of times I've listened to this album (I got a speeding ticket because of it! Isn't that high praise?) I think it deserves such a rating. Moa's voice is not for everybody- many have and will find it annoyingly nasal. I love it, but then, I'm a fan of odd and unusual voices. Her music is a bit like Bjork in spirit, but in no other respect. It's truly a kind of electronic torch-song jazz (with touches of disco and pop). She's got more wit and verve than the rest of the dreamy electronic crowd (Morcheeba, Portishead, etc.). \\"Universal\\" is great pop; why it's not on the radio is a mystery to me. Those reviewers who have found it repetitious need to spend more time listening to what pop radio does play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moa introduces the ultimate combination.....","review":"In \\"Universal\\", Moa introduces her jazz/cabaret style vocals, along with smooth electronic grooves to create an unusual, almost Bjork-like comparison. Her lyrics are concise and to the point, and each song is clearly a new adventure. Moa's voice includes the traditional jazz vibrato combined with otherworldy tones most likely originated from her home in Iceland. \\"Joy and Pain\\" and \\"Can't Forget You\\" are wonderful techno grooves that contrast to the almost familiar disco feel of \\"Raining in my Heart\\". A definite buy for all music interests-a little something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is a nightingale singing the blues on a trip-hop record","review":"I actually bought this album at a 2nd hand CD store, and out of all the albums I've ever bought used without listening to. Moa- Universal has been the best purchase I have made. Moa's voice cannot be described in one word, she is a symphony of all that is deep, lost and strong. Her voice is of a nightingale singing the blues on a trip-hop record. The songs are divided into those that are solemn and upbeat. They are original and moving, almost comparible to Portishead meets Bjork meets Tricky meets Lamb meets Etta James. Though I personally enjoyed her slower in rythym songs... \\"Memory Cloud\\", \\"Tenderly\\" and \\"Forever\\", her up-beat songs such as \\"Toy\\" and \\"Joy & Pain\\" are quite wonderful. This is a great cd if you are one who appreciates strong, melancholy vocals. I just wish she'd do a damn concert in Los Angeles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Bjork","review":"Her music sounds a lot like Bjork but Moa definitely has her own twists. She has more lyrics and she isn't as techno as Bjork. I love her deep and melodic voice. SHe doesn't just sing about love or her lost of it, she sings about life, and interesting \\"virtual affair\\" (#11) which I think are cyber affairs and in that case, she kicks even more buttz. Love the first song too! ps she's not radio quality because she's better than \\"pop\\". She'll last a long time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz singing over a sampling driven music.","review":"Moa is a new singer. Her voice echos the later days Billie, well suited for cabaret songs. the music is techno and, particulary the remix of Raining in my heart, is an updated or rather upgrated disco. Is thrilling ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"moa!","review":"To bad Mtv sucks these day or moa would be more popular. Moa's elfish voice sounds so cool alongside some increadible drum n bass beats. Bjork and her should work together sometime! Anyway this album is wonderful get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moa","review":"This is a wonderful debut, all done almost completly solo. Moa's Voice sounds much like Beth Gibbons of Portishead, The beats best relate Massive Attack, and a couple of (Jamiroquai) sounds. Her voice is wonderful, hinting jazzy tunes, and quite sensual. I really liked this album. Every new trip-hopper brings something new to the scene, Moa made a wonderful Jazz contribution. The samples are very catchy and this is the music that defines good dance music at its peak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it used for under a dollar. May I have my money back?","review":"Blech. Worst. Voice. Ever. I probably paid about 50 cents for this CD used, and I regret the purchase. One of the few times Amazon's recommendations fell flat. For better music, look at Portishead's Dummy album, or Esthero's Breath From Another, or Morcheeba's Big Calm. Steer clear of Moa. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"Be advised, for those of you who may have never heard Moa before, that this Icelandic lady has an extremely annoying voice...so annoying that this CD almost sounds comical, like a bad joke. The only ear-opener is track 3: \\"Memory Cloud\\", a smooth dance groove. But be warned: HER VOICE. The stuff nightmares are made of."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason you haven't heard of this.............","review":"This cd is bad bad bad. Moa doesn't sound like any of the much better groups that some reviewers have compared her to. Bad voice, bad song writing, bad melodies. Just because she won the annual Miss Iceland Uma Thurman look alike contest doesn't mean she can or should sing.... we get enough of that here in The States on commercial radio. Let the price of her used cd's be your guide... 57 cents?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Key Chain","review":"I purchased this key chain a while back from Amazon and LOVE IT. I generally break my key chains in a short time but this one has withstood the abuse. The leather is sturdy, as are the stitches and buckle. I was concerned that it would be too masculine but found that it compliments any leather bag. The price is right too, which means theses key chains will be put in stockings this holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality Product","review":"I am ordering a second one today for my son in black. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and workmanship that went into this product. It is sturdy and really appears to be hand-stiched Italian leather. I have used it for a little over 3 weeks and am defintely not sorry that I did not balk at the price for a key chain. This is definitely worth the price. Red is one of my favorite colors and this is a \\"rich\\" red. I expect this to be a long-lasting article."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy lil key chain","review":"I ordered mine in Red, which was a great choice-- perfect rich, red color-- easy to spot in a purse or on a counter. Thick leather, substantial weight, size. I thought it might be much thinner, smaller than it is. I added another ring to mine. It's a very nice product. Baby boy in our family chews and drools on mine and I thought it would ruin the leather or stain it-- but, it has a great finish.The black leather would make a nice gift for a man. I'd order it again.I purchased about 8 or 9 items at the same time and my key chain showed up first. They shipped it out immediately. Nice company to do business with."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW STARTER, BUT DECENT SECOND HALF! 2 1/2 STARS!","review":"'Death Valley' is a little frustrating at first becasue we all know what this film is about, but the makers of this film want to bore us to death before getting on with the show! Once it gets there it's a pretty good survial horror tale with some fairly realistic reactions. The cast is pretty good for this type of stuff, but the slow first half really takes this one down a notch. I've seen worse, but I've seen a lot better too. It's worth a look on cable or a cheap rental for a few thrills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie OK - Poor quality film transfer","review":"I really wanted to see this film as I was on the set for one day. The content of the film is good; an interesting horror film. The one bad thing is that when the film producers transfered it from film to DVD, they did not correct the color, nor had the DOP there when they did it. the DOP certainly would not have let it go to DVD the way it was done. So much of the film is almost too black to really enjoy it. There are times when the actors faces seemed like they had some neon lights on them-black with odd green patches. Bumper's face was almost impossible to see in close-ups. You could not really see the facial expressions in a lot of the scenes so you could not really get a feel for what they were going through. For me it was a waste of money just buying the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll do anything, just please, please stop this DVD!!!!!!!!!","review":"This has to be one of the worst examples of body art/modification DVD's I've ever fast-forwarded through, I tried several times painfully to give it a 2nd, 3rd, 4th & 5th chance, but theres no hope.The host of this supposed tattoo \\"extravaganza\\" failed to grab all of the intresting looking people with real work passing behind her while interviewing her little girl friends, & repetitively saying, right on, right on, right on,through every single interview."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect role model for kids","review":"my goddaughter loves Danica and the wonder years series. her grades have all gone up, she wants to shine like danica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"I have went to a few yoga classes and have a few yoga dvd's.

She has a lyrical quality that is sometimes lost in the heavy rock material. There is also more variety. This very talented writer and performer is on her way. She announced with a clear and courageous voice \\"Estoy Aqui\\" in the first track of her first major album. Now it is time for the world to know that Shakira esta aqui and taking no prisoners.Even if you don't know a word of Spanish, listen to her, she has much to say.Gene Ralph"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best of Shakira - MTV Unplugged","review":"The album Shakira Unplugged was released in february 29th and Shakira made of this record the best of her entire carreer... Better than its precursors, this one is focused basically in Donde Están Los Ladrones album with all the songs fully reviewed and \\"unplugged\\", which made a new view for the last album. The only thing I missed was the other songs of the older album of her, Pies Delcalzos. The only song reviewed in this CD was Estoy Aquí... (but this won't make you dislike the album... I'm sure of it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a remake of ¿Dónde están...?","review":"I'm not giving this cd 2 stars because of the music, the songs are JUST GREAT... the only problem is that this album is a live remake of her previous \\"¿Dónde están los ladrones?\\" -which I would rate with 5 stars- except for 1 track from \\"Pies descalzos\\". She should have used this opportunity to create something new, to give new life to her first 2 albums (only known in Colombia), to make a cover... she just made a different version of her last album and that's not fair. She's AMAZING, but she's kind of lazy... by now, all the tracks have been great as singles, and we don't have any new material.

There are certain techniques that a singer uses with acoustic albums, and unfortunately, maybe because of lack of experience, this album is poorly produced. The purpose of an Unplugged album is to provide the listener with an acoustic version of a song that is slightly different of the prior version. I felt that she tried hard to produce an identical version of her hits. In Ciega Sordomuda, Shakira very creatively brings in a Mariachi Band, unfortunately the end result is a version of the song that seemed off sync, and sounded as if they were singing for the first time together. To produce an acoustic album takes certain expertise, and Emilio Estefan Jr. does a poor job as a producer to advise the singer about her performance. The end result is that Shakira, a young women with incredible singing talent, seems like a poor acoustic performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to hard to be everything to everbody","review":"She has so many influences in her music it makes you wonder if she has some type of indentity crises going. She mixes Latin, reggae, and tries to throw in Pop and Rock for flavour. Her music is marginal at best. Maybe she should stick with what she's good at and quit trying to be a wanna be everything. The music industry is so concernced with faces now days, real women mucisians are getting overlooked while the media machine oils its jaws with peroxide and silicone and we feed it with our money.

She sings 11 song. 10 of this song are from her album \\"Donde estan los ladrones\\" and the other one is from \\"Pies descalzos\\". What?, who can understand this when \\"Pies descalzos\\" gave her the oportunity to be where she is and brought her several hits (some of them bigger than the ones from \\"Donde estas los ladrones\\").

The only thing I really liked was the ability it gave you to plan out your mission and make personal changes as well as equipment changes. However the actual gamepley was awful. The scenery was too plain and first person view mode made it difficult to play.

The graphics are comparable to an N64 game, and the unfluid motion of the terrorists is like a playstation game.

This is for any level of players. It features 27 training missions; 16 unique missions, plus eagle watch missions and speacial forces action. Rainbow 6 is very similar to the Half-Life game. It pumps you up and makes your heart beats faster as if you are the player itself. If you failed one mission and have to repeat again, the enemies are not where you think you were last kill. It shifts around and there are no two same missions alike. If you are into first player action type game, you have got to pick this up. You will be playing this everyday for at least a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow 6 for Sega Dreamcast","review":"I went to blockbuster on my Birthday and I saw rainbow 6 for the sega dreamcast.

It had no enhanced graphics on it. The game is at max 64-bit graphics. Dont buy this game it was fun for the pc but not for dreamcast. To top it all of the controls sucked too. Dont buy this game, It's definitly not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS GAME!","review":"All I can say is after waiting eight months for the game to come out, it's only single player.

The ability to plan out your attacks and specify the team members is awesome. The wide variety of weapons and suits allows for different experiences every mission. The controls are a bit complicated and hard to learn, but with enough practice, it becomes easy. Unlike most other shoot-em-up games (Which, Rainbow goes far beyond), one shot kills. However, the low difficutly of the shooting makes up for that as your enemies dont notice you unless youre right in their face. There isnt a consistent storyline, but the missions are varied and allow for different kinds of fun. whether it be putting 20 holes in one man with a machine gun or blowing 3 guys up with a grenade. Rainbow offers a great deal of fun and is a challenging game full of adventure and strategy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz....","review":"Am I supposed to get excited when I play this game?

Ever since the advent of DVD I've been hoping to replace my Dark Side VHS concert tape with a DVD version (as you might imagine, the VHS is worn out!). I was so counting on this to be that DVD. I agree with many others that this was a disappointing disc in that regard. The sleeve really is cryptic and while it says \\"An in-depth look at...\\" I think we are all just conditioned now to believe these in-depth looks are extras, not the main course. I'm sure I'll watch this again and I'll share it with some friends (so they don't fall victim as I did) but how hard would it have been (or be) to put the concert footage on along with the documentary?

This album sucks big time. Not a single intact musical piece on the whole disc. Only chit chat and boring interviews. All the previous positive reviews are misleading.

What a rip off!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment in a way...","review":"For some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced, one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy. Unfortunately it is not the case. The album is more for FLOYD'S fans who are eager to have all the small details.Well, personaly I don't care that much about these details, all I want is the true staff, for that I would recommend to those who are hesitating, don't buy this DVD, buy the CD...or wait for the true Dark Side of the Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big waste of time and money","review":"When I got a DVD player my wife and I agreed that since we don't watch movies repeatedly, we would only purchase DVDs that we could enjoy without sitting in front of the screen. Like DVDs of concerts or music videos. She bought me this one because I told her how much I liked the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and wished I had a copy. Man is this a disappointment.This is not \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\", it is a documentary styled sleeping aid about the album, if you can imaging that. It is a collection of talking heads telling way too much about their internal realities with a couple of bars of the songs thrown in. I doubt anyone other than the speakers and a few music historians care two beans about what they have to say. If you want to hear the music, buy the CD, because there isn't any music on this DVD that's worth hearing. This DVD should have a warning label that it is not intended for recreational use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD... it's Floyd! (and also to the guy in Rossville)","review":"This DVD is great, especially if you missed the airing on VH1. Come on guys, $15 for a documentary of Pink Floyd's Dark Side on DVD? How can you criticize the content for that price?And to mvetzel from Rossville, who thinks he saw a performance of Dark Side at the Winterland during some 69-70 \\"Dark Side\\" tour (lol)... they didn't even tour the U.S. in 1969! They did their 3rd and 4th U.S. tours in '70, and their 5th tour (Meddle) in 1971. They played the Winterland on October 15th, which is the only place you could've seen them \\"testing the waters\\" with some Dark Side stuff. Before that, they hadn't played the Winterland since 1967. Their first full performance of Dark Side occurred on January 20th, 1972 at the Dome in Brighton, England.Sorry to burst your bubble dude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I consider myself a dedicated Pink Floyd fan, so when they release new items like remastered CDs and DVDs, I buy them. It almost seems as if they know that fans like myself will buy the DVD solely because it says Pink Floyd in the cover. This DVD was rather bland compared to the others like; The Wall, or even Roger Waters and Dave Gilmour in concert. However, I did enjoy the VH-1 program, but it was rather short. Also, the bonus features are only material that was cut out of the original program...boring. They can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unauthorized Interview Compilation","review":"This 55 minute documentary was produced without consent of the band, its management, or their record company. Because of this, it is ALL interview and contains no background music nor live clips (contractual reasons I assume).The bulk of this tape is comprised of large chunks of a wonderful documentary (Omnibus, BBC) aired in November of 1994. The other bits and pieces are of varying quality giving this tape more of a bootleg feel.If you're a Floyd fan you'll find something of interest here and there, but if you can, track down the Omnibus special. It's widely available in most bootleg circles and is FAR superior to this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful as you might feel cheated","review":"There's no one complete song on this album.

This is a \\"Making Of\\"type DVD with interviews and track overlays. This is moreof a History lesson than anything else. In my opinon, thisDVD \\"Stinks on Ice\\". I saw them live at Winterland inSan Francisco, Ca. back in 69-70 for the Dark Side tour. This is added inresponse to it didn't come out until 1973. Have you everheard of \\"testing the waters\\" to see how it will bereceived. The Moody Blues first album sucked bad (Bye ByeBlackbird)I am allowed to have an opinon, if you agree or notI don't care.

They are good, but that all they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing, in depth and brilliant","review":"If you're a Floyd fan or just an interested music fan, this documentary is phenominal.

For these reviewers that put down this DVD by saying \\"Phoey, no live stuff!\\" I usually read the package before I buy something. Since you can't do that with Amazon or other online stores, these reviews are great. No where did it say this was a live concert. The \\"Classic Album\\" series has been around for some time now so if you don't want to chance your hard earned 15 bucks (yikes, haha)on something, maybe it's worth finding out what you are getting!Other great \\"Classic Album\\" DVD's are \\"The Who- Who's Next\\", \\"Elton John- Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Fleetwood Mac- Rumors\\" just to name a few.

It's widely available in most bootleg circles and is FAR superior to this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Tidbits","review":"Anyone even vaguely interested in Pink Floyd will find a lot of wonderful tidbits in this behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of Dark Side. It's loaded with anecdotes ranging from how Pink Floyd worked around the technological limitations of the time to where many of the musical and lyrical inspirations were derived. (The segment concerning the vocal improv in Great Gig in the Sky is particularly impressive as are the bits where Alan Parsons isolates segments of the mix so that the listener can hear the structures of the songs and the craftsmanship behind them.)It's also nice to see/hear the current band members riffing through portions of their work although I would have preferred that the time had been devoted to more of the archival materials. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. Way better than you think it is.","review":"I clicked this on Netflix yesterday just to see what it was and, like other reviewers, expected it to be nothing special (probably because of the \\"classic albums\\" moniker). In fact, it was an incredibly well-done documentary, with thoughtful contemporary interviews with each of the band members, plus Alan Parsons, Storm Thorgensen and others involved in the album. For musicians it is fascinating to hear them talk about how the tracks were developed and to see them, all these years later, reconstruct the music we've come to know so well. This is essential for any Floyd fan, but also highly recommended for anyone who appreciates the music creation process."},{"rating":"2","title":"batcall","review":"The Beatles opened the doors for rock'n roll, but Pink Floyd went from an RnB band to Progressive rock.

They go into some of the mechanics and inspirations for the album. My personal feeling is that the bonus materials are better than the main portion. Dave's, Roger's and Rick's brief solo sessions are very moving. I sure hope more solo material of this nature comes forth in the future. Great stuff!!

Through his death she is able to truly appreciate all the small pleasures of life, because you truly cannot know what happiness is until you have experienced sadness. Elizabeth Berg creates a character you really care about, and in the process really makes you think about your own life, the importance of friendships and kindness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely read","review":"This does not purport to be \\"deep\\" literature and it is not -- it is just a fictional story, too sweet and perfect for reality, about the year after a beloved husband dies. But it is full of lovely surprises: funny jokes, good stories, and some real wisdom. I loved best the focus on small things, and on enjoying them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been an Elizabeth Berg fan in the past, and so I was disappointed in her latest \\"Year of Pleasures.\\" I felt it was rather clumsily written; the dialogue of the characters often did not ring true (especially in the case of the middle school age character--it seemed as though she was trying to mimic the rhythms of how she has observed kids nowadays conversing, but at a great distance). Also, really skilled writing should (in my opinion) almost force the writer to come to the point of view of the character. Well, I did feel for Betta in the beginning, but my liking for her soon wore thin. Maybe because her relationship with her husband as described in the book sounded cloying and annoying; couples who completely shut out the world to the exclusion of all others simply are irritating to everyone around them! Being aware of this annoyance the whole way through kept me from being really drawn into the story. It just didn't come alive for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unrealistic","review":"I have read \\"Open House\\" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home? They must have been laughing at her behind her back! There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters","review":"Beautifully written. Great characters. My only complaint is the ending seemed a little rushed and difficult to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony baloney!","review":"I have loved all of Elizabeth Berg's books until this one. Usually her main characters are very realistic - including their faults, their disappointments, their shortcomings. However, the characters in this book are so phony that it is simply impossible to relate to them at all.Guess what? No one's husband is as perfect as this one. Such a human being simply does not exist. No one's marriage is as flawless as this one. Relationships all have ups and downs. No one's friends are as unchanging as these. After years and years of no contacts they just pick up right where they left all - ALL of them??? I don't think so. No one's life is as seemless as this one. A brownstone in Beacon Hill, romantic vacations, early retirements. Give me a break.It was all just too good to be true. It's downright corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Resemblance to Reality","review":"I kept hoping that Elizabeth Berg's latest novel, \\"The Year of Pleasures\\" would start to get realistic, but alas, it never does. The plot is simply the year of grieving that protagonist, Betta does for her oh-so-perfect husband, John, and their oh-so-perfect marriage after he oh-so-perfectly dies. Yawn and Yech. Only in fiction, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I have loved many of Elizabeth Berg's writings. But the saccharin sweet PERFECT relationship Betta had with her husband was really too much. And the tidy little $1.9 million dollars she had that enabled her to buy a prime rib for Benny just made me queasy. Women like to read about characters they can relate to.........not a fantasy life where the main character isn't worried about money, or children, or exhaustion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I couldn't stop listening to this audio CD the way you can't look away from a car crash. Morbid curiosity. My eyes hurt from rolling so often at this jellyfish of a main character.Betta is supposed to be portrayed as a fragile widow, but she just ends up looking incredibly self-absorbed and weak, weak, weak. I can't reconcile her weeping over the perfect husband every five minutes with her late-night behavior with Tom Bartlett. It just wasn't believable.Elizabeth Berg has created such real characters, such as Samantha from \\"Open House\\" and Myra from \\"Never Change.\\" Their lives were believable, funny, and wistful at the same time. I can't understand how Betta Nolan was created by the same author.The character of her husband was so non-believable that I don't know where to start. \\"Welcome to Tuesday, Betta\\"?????And P.S., many women living in small factory towns in the Midwest can ill-afford cashmere robes, fountain pens, silk pajamas and bird's nests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloying","review":"I've read a few of Berg's books before, and was not unpleased by what I had read. The books passed the time and were pleasant, easy reads. Perhaps I've reached the saturation point with this one. I found it dreadful. Its puffiness and insipidness gave me a headache. Nothing in it 'rang true'. Really..yikes..I just put it down<unfinished, admittedly> and feel as though I ate far too much cotton-candy, or watched too many bunnies frolicking in sunny fields,with an occcasion cloud for dramatic effect. I get the feeling that Ms. Berg feels she OUGHT to 'take pleasure in lttle things', but really doesn't. The writing about raspberries in cream, etc is so formish as in : 'this is what I would write if I were a wealthy widow moved by raspberries in cream'. Skip it. Try one of her other books. This is a sugary nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"We learned in high school not to dump friends for boyfriends!","review":"Ms Berg writes very well. I admit I put the book down half way through. Too much reminiscing. The author could have gotten her message across on how special the deceased was in the first 40 pages. Betta (main character) and her husband were joined at the hip, forsaking all others. Perhaps it's a lesson for all women. Keep your friends. I thought we all learned that lesson in high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I loved this book! I've been disappointed by some of Berg's recent books, still believing her first few were the best....Joy School, Durable Goods, etc. But some of her phrasing and descriptions in this book are just breathtakingly beautiful. Of course, some of it is unrealistic, but it's a novel!! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasures indeed!","review":"This book was so descriptive I couldn't put it down. I felt right at home. I loved and could feel how she was feeling about her husband and her loss. I don't agree with others. They weren't perfect. She says that when she talks about the gondola ride. I think living without all the drama is the way to go. I loved all the characters. They were deep and this book was very fulfulling. I noticed she used her baking to keep her going at times. This book makes you think about growing older and to take every day as if it is your last. Benny got pushed to the side at the end. He just kind of disappeared.Also I think this book screams a sequel, maybe a little further down the road with Lorraine and Tom, Benny a little older etc. I thank the author for this treasured book and look forward to more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" WHAT'S UP MS.

This one, however, is so unrealistic, so phony and so easy to see where the story is leading. An idyllic marriage, a perfect little town, ideal new neighbors and acquaintances, friends who rush to the aid of the new widow even though she has ignored them for 30 years, and so on. Too treacly by far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.

But the last 2 CDs were maudlin and awful; I finally turned the player off when the heroine began screaming at a college friend. Most novels start well but can't sustain the middle. Berg got further than that and then lost it. Maybe she could have saved the novel by writing 25% less. But those first pages--very, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bittersweet!","review":"This book is the latest by Elizabeth Berg, I have always liked her books, so I didn't even read what it was about. I loved this book it is the bittersweet story of Betta Nolan a 55 year old new widow who is on the path to discover new things about herself following the untimely death of her beloved husband. This book discribed in detail the depth of her grief and her ultimate road to \\"recovery\\" with a cast of great characters in small town America. I hated to see the story end, and this is one of the few books I would read again right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the substance?","review":"I've read some of Ms. Berg's other books and enjoyed them - I am sorry to say this one was a real disappointment - the premise is interesting and I thought the book got off to a good start but the author could not sustain the tempo - about 2/3 of the way through, it seemed as if the author had realized she only wanted the book to be a certain length, and so she'd better be about getting it done - so no sooner than are a host of characters introduced then the story is over - it never was very clear what the pleasures were - the book turned out to be a trite treatment of the topic - I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Formula Plot","review":"I agree with the review entitled \\"Cloying.\\" This is a formula plot about a woman left alone in mid-life who goes to a new town and lives happily ever after. Anne Tyler has done it much better. Everything falls into place too perfectly to be interesting. She buys an old house and moves in quickly - no 30-day wait for closing? No inspection problems? Her life is perfect.For a fresh take on the older woman left alone in mid-life, read Porter Shreve's \\"Drives Like a Dream.\\" You won't recognize any familiar plot elements in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I absolutely love all of her previous novels. Seems like she may be out of fresh material though. This was so much like her old stuff except for the disturbingly unrealistic situations and relationships. The story became so contrived and sloppy at the end I could envision it as a made for TV movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Unrealistic! Not like her other books at all!","review":"I found this story line to be interesting - a woman starting over after the death of her beloved husband. While there are some great analogies in the book, overall it is a huge disappointment! It is hard to believe that relationships from college are just picked up where they left off while all her friends admit that she just exited their lives years ago! It would have been more realistic if time was taken to renew the relationships. Plus, the other characters in the book seemed a bit unreal as well. If only life was that sugary...I am an optimistic person, but this story just seemed to good to be true. It is a shame because I usually love this author's work. It does not portray the real feelings felt by a widow. I have a friend who felt very alone after her husband died. This book makes the relationships and reconnections seem all to easy thereby losing the meaning of a \\"pleasurable\\" life rebuilt after a strong love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't measure up to her other books","review":"I have to say I was disappointed with this latest book. I have enjoyed most of the author's past books but this one was so unrealistic. Looking at some of the unfavorable reviews, I have to agree with these folks.The revived friendships from thirty years ago - oh please!Sell your home and buy a new one with 1.6 million to spare!Open up a shop in small town within a couple of months of your husband's death. (what are the statistics on the survival rate of these types of shops?)All these very friendly people - it would have been more realistic if at least a few were like the mean old lady she purchased her home from.The radio in the attic - stupid. What?? did an invalid climb into her attic sometime before she moved and plug a radio in to come on in the middle of the night only???It goes on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning but goes downhill","review":"I was very annoyed by the end of this book. While it started out interesting and I really liked the character of Betta, about halfway through the book when she moves into the dumpy house with the guy she meets in a coffee shop I lost interest.

It can be used for coffee as well, as the mesh is so very fine. I drink yerba mate, which often has a lot of almost powder in it, and it does not get through this mesh. I bought this item merely as a little something to bring my total high enough for free shipping, but this is the best tea filter I have ever seen. It has a lid to keep the tea hot while steeping, little 'ears' so it fits in most cup widths. And it is extra deep, deeper than the ones I have used before, which makes infusing more efficient. Very nicely made."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great product!","review":"I ordered a couple of these large size infusers, though I worried that they might be too big for my mug. Glad I was wrong. The size is perfect for my oversized mugs(16 oz. or larger), but it's a tight fit for my 8 oz. Corningware cups from the '90s. Since I need more caffeine than that in the morning, I don't find it to be a problem.The mesh is terrific. None of my Earl Grey leaves end up in my morning cup of tea. And the lid is nice for resting the basket on after brewing.These are much easier to use than other tea infusers I've had. The inexpensive tea ball that screws together always fell open, leaving a mushy leafy mess in my cup. And the scissor style infusers, though easier to fit in a mug, usually end up with leaves in the edge that end up in the bottom of my mug.I'll be ordering a few more as gifts for the other tea drinkers in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but can be bought cheaper!","review":"The best infuser I've ever used. It's made in Germany, and you can always trust German quality. It's a bit pricey on amazon though: I recently purchased two more of these babies from specialteas.com at under $6 a piece. You have to pay $2.99 for shipment there, but if you order teas from there anyway (as I occasionally do - along with adagio.com these are the best places to get high quality tea; they are cheaper and much better quality than Teavana), you will not pay anything extra for shipping the infuser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest Way to Drink Loose Tea","review":"I have always shied away from loose tea because of the hassle and mess. With these brewing baskets, it is just as easy as using a tea bag. The cover which helps with the brewing acts like a \\"saucer\\" when you put it under the basket and catches all of the drips.

I can have whatever kind of coffee I want, can't say enough good things about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"Its lovely for a cheaper version of the gold filters... Its a little tall for a standard mug (just be careful to not over pour) and otherwise works well. It cleans and rinses easily, and the little cap helps keep everything warm, while I forget that my tea is brewing -- and the cap keeps me from mussing up my desk when I finally remember that I have tea, and need to deal with the wet tea leaves.It works well for coffee -- I've been using chock fulla nuts, which is a medium grind -- it leaves a bit of sludge at the bottom, but in some countries that is a delicacy.I kinda wish the little handles were a bit longer for other wider cups, but I will survive, or it will sit on the bottom of the vessel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finum Brewing Basket - Good, but could be better","review":"I was looking for an infuser that could brew fine leaves since the infuser I received has mesh which is too large for the leaves. The brewing basket is perfect for brewing a cup or small pot of fine, loose tea (the basket weave ensures that event the smallest of leaves do not fall through). However, there are 2 improvements that would make the basket much more useful for brewing a large pot of tea (or iced tea in a pitcher). Most importantly, the top does not screw on or attach in some way, so that if the basket were to float in the pitcher or pot, the top would come off. Also, it would be nice to have a chain on top so you could attach the basket to the rim of the pot for easy removal (assuming of course that the top would stay on the basket which it does not).Other than that, this is a quality item which should satisfy most users."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for coffee","review":"If you use a coffee press this basket works great as a final filter; also works great to brew coffee--simply put ground coffee in the basket, place coffee filled basket in cup and pour in boiling water, let grounds bloom, remove basket and enjoy a perfect cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 1 use","review":"I wanted to love it so badly, but after 1 use, it somehow developed a puncture wound in the side, allowing tea leaves to escape.

Now I have to send it back, where I will probably be charged half the price in restocking fees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best idea;does not fit as advertized","review":"I just purchased this brewing basket with a tea pot. The tea pot is large. I like to make a pot of tea and have at least six cups. I only got this infuser because it was recommended on the item page as suitable for the large pot. It is way too small. It will not rest on the brim of the teapot's lip. It falls to the bottom of the pot requiring a major extraction to get it out. I only kept it because the retuning process is such a hassle. I am disappointed and unhappy. It should not be urged on customer since it fails to fit large teapots."},{"rating":"1","title":"tea basket","review":"tea basket is OK lid does not stay on to have a lid is pointless to say the least. but as for the basket it works great but I needed a lid to stay attached this one does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This item is of such poor quality that I doubt that it will last much more than a month or two.

However I prefer to make pots of tea .The basket tilts over in the tea pot as well as in a stove top pot. There is no top and the tea can not be secured in the basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid does not attach to basket!","review":"I was surprised that the lid does not actually attach to the basket. It doesn't screw on, snap in - nothing. I guess the design is for tea pots that are not taller than the infuser. I dropped mine into my pitcher of hot water - thinking - maybe it floats? Nope - sank right to the bottom, and emptied all my tea leaves everywhere. Now I'm back to shopping for a large tea ball that actually closes.Update 09/2011: Now that I have more experience with brewing large pots of tea, I still think this basket is a poor design. This is designed to hold enough tea to brew a pitcher's worth, but it is not designed to easily sit in a pitcher. The Finum bags may not allow full expansion of the leaves, but they are certainly easier to handle.As for the folks who needed to insult me in your comments - congratulations, that must have made you feel very smart and good about yourselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for a tea lover!","review":"This is so much easier to use than a tea ball!

I'm glad I did - even the large could be larger and still fit. It is fine for anything except the daintiest tea cups. The tea quality is as good as the leaves you're using. I've just invested in some great loose leaf tea, and have no problems with any debri in my cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best brewing baskets","review":"These in my opinion are the best brewing baskets for loose tea. The very tiny mesh doesn't let the small particles escape but because the top and bottom are mesh allows plenty of flow. It's also very easy to clean as you just turn over and dump out, not like these Stick shaped ones that are a pain and just fall apart. Plus you don't have to worry about a ball or stick opening up in your cup as it just hangs on the top of the cup. I usually buy the medium and accidentally bought the large this time but it will be better for my extra large mugs from Crate & Barrel. The gold plating also really makes a difference in flavor as there is no metallic flavor which I am very sensitive to from other baskets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice large size","review":"We use this for brewing ice tea, holds about 10 or 12 tablespoons of tea leaves. The weave is nice and tight so the tea leaves don't escape. I really like the fact that I can put it in the dishwasher when needed.Cons: No lid or cap (the black plastic disc is a drip tray not a lid that fastens securely). This would get five stars if it had a lid and stainless steel chain so I could use it like a huge tea or herb infuser and hang it in the pitcher of hot water. As it is now I fill it with tea leaves, place it in the brewing container, and poor water over the leaves until the water is about 3/4 the way up the basket. If I put too much water in, the basket floats then flips over dumping loose leaf tea into the water (defeats the purpose of the basket at that point)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, a little too wide for my application.","review":"I bought this to use with my teapot. The handles on it are a little too wide for the top of my teapot, but nothing that a little modification won't fix.

I don't know the truth of that, but because of that review, I bought this at half the cost of the MugMate. I used it on a backpacking trip to Glacier National Park for coffee only, and it was incredible. I wish it came with a hard cup to protect the filter while traveling, and that the cap clamped on tight. To protect it in a backpack, we simply used the box it came in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same as MSR Mugmate for half the price.","review":"This product is perfect for great coffee while backpacking or camping. It fits in my insulated mug and probably just about any other one perfectly so i just put my coffee grounds in and pour hot water over them until full. It is also long enough that you can let it steep for some time, I usually do about 5 minutes or so. Other suggestions for it would be tea of coarse, especially an immune booster for serious winter hiking, also, I filter water through it because i don't have a backpacking purifier. It takes most of the large particles out of the water and then you just add iodine tablets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect way to make tea","review":"This infuser is really great.

Looks well made and it's easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes great coffee; bigger than I thought, though","review":"I was very happy with the performance of this filter. It brewed a nice cup of coffee and was easy to clean. I like it better than a coffee press because you can lift out the grounds without having a lot of debris left in your cup. With a press, you have to pour the coffee into another container or it will get too strong and bitter. This is a great little filter to have for camping or at the office.I had hoped this would fit down into a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle, but it doesn't. I ordered the REI H2jO for that purpose. You can pour really hot water into Nalgene bottles without worrying, so they can be a good container for brewing tea or coffee.If you want to choose between the medium and large filter, I would go with medium. Unless you want to brew a large pot for multiple people to drink from at once, the medium filter is probably sufficient. You can steep fresh cup after fresh cup as you want them and with little fuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic tea infuser","review":"I use it to brew my loose leaf high grade green tea and it lets all the flavour (and flavanoids!) through without even the tiniest of leaves. Made in Germany sturdiness and quality. It was well worth my 3+ months of searching for the perfect tea infuser without spending a bundle.

I prefer larger mugs and this will fit them perfectly. Extra fine so the bits wont get through when steeping.

I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite tea filter","review":"This is a great tea filter. I have been using a nylon mesh filter from the Republic of Tea (which I do like), but this is better for two reasons. First, the openings in the Finum filter are finer. With the RoT filter, I always get tea leaves stuck in the openings and need to rub with my fingers to get them out. With the Finum filter, I never get any tea stuck. The used leaves rinse easily from the filter. Second, the small rim on the RoT filter allows it to fit only a few smallish mugs. The wider tabs on this Finum filter (I bought the medium size) allow me to use this with a wide range of mug sizes. Just make sure you wash this filter thoroughly before its first use (as the instructions say), because there must have been some oily substance used in the manufacturing process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to steep my tea!","review":"I'd never used one of these until I started work at my current job. They had a few in the office. It makes SUCH a difference for steeping loose leaf teas, I bought two for my home and tossed the others I'd been using.

This filter works great for brewing a single cup of coffee. Once I accidentally purchased fine ground coffee and worried that the grounds would go through the filter, but no problems! I use this in both cups and mugs but never found that it was a problem that the filter doesn't completely fill the mug, it only takes 2 or 3 minutes to brew, not enough time for the beverage to cool off, and I just use the lid to set the filter in after I'm done so I don't have a wet spot on my counter.I have also found that it is more economical to buy loose leaf tea instead of tea bags and use this filter instead of the bags. This also gives me the option of mixing different varieties of tea if I so choose.I have used one of these filters almost everyday for about 2 years and it is still in perfect condition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the medium.","review":"Very easy to use, no issues to clean or use to make up to 4 cups at a time in a chinese teapot. The medium should work in about all situation unless you have some gigantic worlds best dad mug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I use the medium strainer for a small teapot (2 - 3 cup sized pot). The fit is a little tight, but it works great. Fits plenty of tea leaves for that size pot. When top is placed on strainer I can even pour a partial cup while tea is still brewing. Once tea is at desired strength I put tea pot top back on and use the strainer top for the used tea leaves - perfect! I have bought many tea strainers, and this one is one of the sturdiest. Recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy!","review":"If you like leaf tea, this is easier than using a \\"tea ball\\" and far less wasteful than making up individual bags. You just add your tea, hang the basket over the rim of your mug and fill with hot water. Steep for an appropriate amount of time and remove. Easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the righ thing!!!","review":"This device is of the right size and can be used for tea or coffee without having to brew the whole pot. Very convenient to make and to clean. Save me plenty of time and money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I drink more tea because of this.","review":"This is the best way to drink loose leaf tea I've tried. There's plenty of room for the leaves to expand, it filters really well and the lid acts as a drop tray so you don't drip any tea on the floor. One complaint is that the lid doesn't snap into place. It's not much of a problem when you're using it but when your storing it, it can get separated."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing","review":"I've been brewing loose leaf tea for a while now, and I have to say this is the coolest infuser I've come across. I'm probably just reiterating what others have said, but here it goes:- It sits nicely in a variety of sized mugs- You don't burn your hands when removing it (there are two plastic handles on either side)- The holes are very small so tea leaves never fall through them (I love to brew rooibos tea, which has very fine leaves and I'd always end up drinking them with my tea)- The lid covers the basket while you're infusing and can be set on the countertop to hold the basket and excess water that drips out when you remove it- It cleans very easily- Looks like it will hold up for quite some time- Tea tastes great!I plan on getting the larger one now for use with tea pots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Rx","review":"Like most Spektrum/JR receivers this one delivers what it promises.

I've had enough of the lightskin, straight hair bashing. Let it go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Church Folk was an enjoyable read. The characters were realistic and engaging. Theophillis was an example of what a minister should be while others seemed to be going crazy around him.The only missing element is that I didn't feel the story had a lesson as most Christian fiction does. I think Christian fiction should uplift and inspire while this only entertains.However it entertains extremely well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I Essie?","review":"This book was given to me by a co-worker, and it has been a \\"pager-turner\\" since day 1!

This one was worth the wait.Annette"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Reading","review":"I liked this book because it shows the weaknesses that even good pastors face, but this book portrays pastors as human and not above reproach. However, the main characters in the book lacked Character, in my opinion, because of some of the choices they made and the way they chose to handle certain situations. I feel that the sexual aspects of the book I could have done without. Being that it was supposed to be christian fiction the sexual parts were totally unexpected and uncalled for--It would have been a good story without it. If not for the sexual parts, I would have rated this book at 5 start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read and Highly Entertaining....!!!","review":"Wow, was I shocked at how quickly this book caught and held my interest. Ms. Bowen did a wonderful job with this book ... creating very believeable characters and events.I am still tryin to pronounce Theophilus name though....LOLI enjoyed the relationship Theo and Essie eventually evoled into. I also thought Ms. Bowen showed a very REALISTIC sides of Christianity. Not only for Theo but as a church group.This does make you shake your head of the goings on in our church world and with CHURCH FOLK.I believe that you will enjoy this book.

She said it was a good book so I decided to pick it up. Boy..was I not pleased!! Others have already commented on the absurdities throughout the book. I agree with whomever said that the long statements thrownout while the preacher is speaking is true. There are never statements said longer than \\"Amen\\" and \\"That's right\\"..but mini-monologues while a preacher is tryin to preach..NEVER.I don't know..the book had a good storyline..but you could tell this is the author's first book.

This wasn't a full of action book, but I did have to see it through to the end to see what happens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Encouraging!!!","review":"The politics of church is the backdrop for this action-packed saga which reveals the real men behind the clergy collars. Some are good people who have experienced bad things, while others are bad people who position others to be bad for their own personal benefits. The most unlikely and unexpected things happen as this story unfolds, and a developing romance between the up and coming Reverend Theophilus Simmons and a bold young lady named Essie ties it all together. Family connections lend support to generational strongholds as a small group works diligently to effect change. As the struggle between good and evil continues, this story shows us that to be on the side of right requires sacrifice, and that evil rarely looks beyond the realm of self. Thank you, Michele, for encouraging and reminding us to stay on the side called right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"culture","review":"One way to learn about the culture of a people is to read fiction about their culture. I work with inner city children, and have been driving through their neighborhoods for years. On every other block there is a church. I have met many pastors.

It has so much balance in that it not only shares the struggles, but also the triumphs. I also like how the author masterfully talks about love and being sensual within the confines of marriage. We are all human, and all deserved to be loved and appreciated. At several points in this book I was laughing, crying, or on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next.

Just how busy the devil can be. Not just with what we call church folk but the leaders of the church too . We got a chance to meet some of the fine preachers and bishops of the Gospel United Church. A first hand look at the corruption that went on. Rev. Marcel Brown, Rev. Sonny Washington, and even Bishop Otis Carrather surprised me. It certainly proved that a Man is a Man. Even if he is a preacher, or a bishop. Can they not control themselves? There were some indiscretions and corruption going on at that Conference.

I unscrewed the top, thinking it probably had a safety seal, and that was what prevented it from leaking. However, there was no safety seal.She was so disappointed. We both thought it did not smell strongly of Apple Pectin, the pleasant fragrance remembered. According to her it lathered up fairly well, but didn't feel clean, so she rinsed that out and used more to lather again. Then it felt as if she had used Prell or something that really stripped the hair squeeky clean, and she knew she would absolutly have to put a conditioner on her hair.

Sure, it WILL record...but not in any useful manner.There is no internal tuner. What this means is that you have to provide a line in from your tv or another source like a cable box. It does not, as most VCRs do, take a coaxial cable.To record, you have to set the tv to the channel you want. You can't change the channel on the tv, or the vcr will record the new channel instead.Also, there's no timer in the VCR. So you literally have to be standing there ready to hit RECORD when the show starts.The whole reason I have a VCR so I don't HAVE to be there when the show is on.I immediately boxed it back up, and it's going back.

However, the vhs side is barely adequate because it doesn't see the hifi tracks at all, so what you hear is an attenuated mono audio track, when one is available, and absolutely none of the hifi stereo audio that may exist on the vhs recording.

I bought it new and have used it several times for both. DVDs seem to play fine but so far it's almost ruined two VHS tapes. They play fine too, but when I hit stop the tape would get tangled up inside the player. I had to take the plastic cover off the top to untangle the tape and get the cassettes out. Luckily the tape in each case was only left with wrinkles in certain spots that distort the picture and sound, but it could easily have been torn. A new VHS player is not supposed to do that, needless to say. I don't think this is just a defect in my player because it doesn't do this to all tapes, its only been older ones (which, although old, were in perfect condition and did not have that problem in other VHS players).

We have enjoyed many of the books by Jean Fritz, especially those written about Colonial and Revolutionary America, but this one should not be included in that list.Ms. Fritz has an apparent personal dislike for certain groups of people and makes her dislike abundantly clear throughout the work. Unfortunately, this bigoted approach leaves such a bad taste in the reader's mouth that the entire story becomes unpalatable. The worst result of this approach is that Ms. Fritz has decided to rewrite history based on her own personal opinion instead of actual fact. This is a NON-FICTION book, so by inserting fiction into the equation, she has destroyed the trust that a reader should have in an author.All in all, I was sadly disappointed and will definitely question reading more of this author's work in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous but inaccurate","review":"The inaccuracies which plague this book are many. The author has allowed a vitriolic personal bias against Christianity to take the place of historical accuracy. In addition to the stunning inaccuracies, the venomous, contemptuous tone of every reference to the Christian faith is problematic. In this day of tolerance, it is surprising that anyone would allow their personal prejudices to be so visible and so hateful, especially in a book for children! In a book which is supposedly based upon history, it is surprising that anyone would print out-and-out lies such as are found in this book. Why did I give it two stars? Because the text, when it is not too busy attacking the author's imaginary archenemy, is refreshing and useful. It is humorous, winsomely written, and fun. The illustrations are great, too. It's sad that the author's personal biases have marred this otherwise fine work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Jean Fritz?","review":"I rely on Jean Fritz -- I like her style from little-kid biographies (And then what happened, Paul Revere?) to big-kid biographies (Why Not, Lafayeete? or Where Do You Think You're Going, Christopher Columbus?)I was tremendously excited to read this book, but what a disappointment. Jean Fritz often has an undertone of irony in her books (which we applaud *and* enjoy), but this book is sarcasm-unleashed.The tone of the book is unpleasantly snarky. It is inappropriate for my kids... I wanted an instructive and entertaining book, not a soliloquy founded on Jean Fritz's simmering hostility to Western civilization. Only the excellent illustrations save it from a one-star rating.Instead of this book, try Marc Aronson's book \\"The World Made New.\\"The World Made New: Why the Age of Exploration Happened and How It Changed the World (Timelines of American History)"},{"rating":"1","title":"hatred, not history","review":"How, in these PC days, did this book ever get published? The constant bashing of Christians isn't just offensive, it's factually incorrect in so many ways. The author belittles the great of accomplishes of many who were motivated by faith, and in general is utterly scornful of her subjects.It's one thing to present the negative truths of history, slavery really did happen, but quite another to present it in its most brutal and ugly forms IN A CHILDREN'S BOOK.The writer clearly has personal problems dealing with those of the Christian faith, be they living or dead, and treats her reads with a patronizing scorn as well as her subjects. I'm glad I read this before my son saw it - I try to teach him to look at BOTH sides of a story, something the author fails to do in her rush to condemn the great explorers of history. I call them great not for their treatment of human beings, but for the way they pushed human knowledge far beyond its previous boundaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I read through it before reading it to my children!","review":"I picked this book up last week at a homeschool convention. My oldest son is very interested in history and learning about the explorers. We have enjoyed books by this author before, so I felt like it was a good buy. I can't believe how blatantly anti-Christian the author is in this book. She makes Christians sound like the wart of the world! She makes it sound like the world progressed in knowledge and achievements in spite of Christianity. Although I am no history expert, some of her statements just didn't sit well with me, and I would really question whether what she wrote is fact or just her ignorant, prejudiced opinion. I will never purchase another book by her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homeschoolers beware","review":"I have never come across such blatant hostility towards Christianity - and in a children's book to boot!

Contrary to what you may have heard, the programming logic is very straightforward, and is of the 'stack-based' variety. In other words, whatever variable that you have at the top of the current stack is live and is used by other stack-top parameters. And there are keyboard shortcuts to move you from stack to stack.

I suppose the same people who get off on elaborate dungeons and dragons fantasies played over months and years would enjoy this. I did not. It is over-complicated, trite and sometimes positively obnoxious in its desire to be cute. If Hofstadter's desire was to write a nonfiction \\"Finnegan's Wake,\\" he's succeeded, but without the artistic accomplishment, only the chaos.

Maybe I am not extremely eligible to comment on the portions dealing with Escher and Bach, respectively (I have no appetite for Escher. I like chamber music of Bach and somtimes play his keyboard music but my performance level is, of course, that of amateur.)But I must say the part dealing with Gödel's Theorem of Incompleteness is *complete garbage*. I am convinced anyone with a degree of mathematics will agree with me: for those who have no background in mathematics, I assure you that Gödel's theorem concerns a problem in \\"formal logic\\" and has nothing to do with human-cogno-something.If this book were meant to be a cult literature, that would be okay: I don't care anyway.But if this is meant to be an entertainment for people with no scientific background, I rate this alchemy or pseudo-science at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy thinks he's so clever","review":"Yeah - this is an interesting read, and well worth picking up. The content is naturally very complicated, centering on self-referencing systems and other mathematical mind-twisters, and I think the author's pompous approach of playing with those notions in his presentation of the ideas does less to illustrate the points than it does to confuse readers. If you have the patience to sit through a conversation with a serious mathematician with a penchat for puns, you'll gain some interesting new perspective from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work for me","review":"I found this book to be too distracted to be good science, too unpersuasive to be good philosophy, too cute to be good math, and too annoying to be good poetry.

Hofstadter","review":"If you want to learn about the author, Douglas R. Hofstadter, and to marvel about how talented and witty he is, this is a very decent book.However, if you want to understand the connection between recursion and consciousness, about what Godel, Escher and Bach have to do with it, and about how the human mind is like a computer, this book is nearly unreadable.The author really has a habit of writing in length about himself, usually in a way only remotely connected to anything relevant to you, the reader. I found myself constantly reading things that really don't interest me much about the author, only to get to the main point, which could otherwise have been stated in one eighth as much text.I have stopped reading half-way through the book.

What a complete waste of time! It feels like Hofstadter is, over the course of 832 pages, mistaking pedagogical correctness (good) with masturbatory technical pedantry (bad). Just read a decent 160-page book on Godel's work (example:Gödel's Proof) and be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitist, Confused, Show-off","review":"The Emperor is naked!The author has tried to 'show-off' his knowledge of various subjects.He could have still done it - but with less words.The people who want to to rate this book high are trying to belong to a group who think they are intelligent.One of these elitist should at least try writing an abridged version.A verbose waste of time, as you follow the author in an endless loop as he chases his tail around.And finally...I believe that if someone cannot be precise and concise about what they are saying, they themselves don't have a clue.If that is the case, then we must be idiots to be listening to their rhetoric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy it; don't dissect it!","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer Michael J Edelman who pointed out that most of the *serious* reviewers here misunderstand the point of the book. GEB is a thoughtful exercise in logical reasoning that proceeds, with frequent refreshment breaks along the way, to demonstrate not only how an impressive degree of complexity can arise from a compact basis of simple premises and directions, but also how the process can be driven by self-reference (recursion). The most profound outcomes of this process are ultimately the ordered universe, life and consciousness, although these may not be explicitly stated as such in the text. Anyone familiar with Conway's Game of Life, or tesselation automata (tiling the plane), will appreciate the analogies. Critical readers may not agree completely with the author's logical or philosophical bent, but will enjoy the mind-stretching exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money (and time)","review":"A complete waste of money. Though the book contains some interesting ideas, it is very, very, very wordy. Everything is explained ve-e-ery slowly and repeated a few times. But when the narration approaches a really interesting point, the author switches to a different topic, leaving the interesting point for later. If the book were 1/10 of its size, it might be a good recreational reading. However, in its current form, it is extremely boring, nearly unbearable.Could not read it past a couple of chapters, though tried several times. Trying to skip a few chapters did not help: it is dead boring all the way to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"literary style demonstrates book's themes","review":"a cursory glance at a random passage of godel, escher, and bach, will likely appear to be jabberwocky, with its unapologetic, evolving vocabulary and sparkles of inside jokes based on such, this is ironic, because the right arm of this book is recursion, which implies that the whole is implied by each part, far from while reading, one most certainly must read godel, escher, and bach in its sequential order, too funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"I gave it to my professor","review":"I was in awe of the book when I read it.

I did not find it the masterpiece that it is touted to be. The explication of the Incompleteness Theorems, unlike Gödel's paper, is very mystifying. Most of the reviewers, while awarding many stars to this book, admit their own mystification, and, surprisingly, cite this as rationale for the book's depth! If you really want to understand the Incompleteness phenomenon in arithmetic, and how it is tied to recursive axiomatizability, look elsewhere. Most textbooks on mathematical logic are better, and less pendantic.On the other hand, I did not dislike the book. It reminds one of the kind of discourse that occurs when the acid is mellow and infused with some speed. Interesting, but without many ramifications for real life. And there are many, many other books of greater charm and import, that will never come close to obtaining the Pulitzer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book influenced my personality","review":"I was 16 when this book first came out. I read bits and pieces of it constantly from that time until I finally read the whole book from beginning to end when I was 37. By then I had read the whole book several times over, but never sequentially. Many of my personality traits can be traced back to this book: a love of Lewis Carroll, my career as a computer programmer, my interest in robotics and artificial intelligence, and several Bach CD's in my collection (including the Musical Offering). I love this book. I'll leave it next to my son's bed when he's old enough to start understanding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a book","review":"A truly wonderful book: beautifully written, engaging, stimulating, and extremely original. I have read and reread it many, many times, and each time I have had new insights and appreciations; it so exquisite in detail. The only (potential) flaw is that it is not for everyone, since the beauty of the book is not revealed superficially. A tour-de-force not easy to emulate, even in a generation, even to its own author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godel's theorem, recursive music, art, AI!","review":"Before I start: this isn't a book, it's a commitment. I liked Bach's music, Escher, math and what I'd seen of computer science before I started reading, and even then it was a long, long read. Not out of boredom, but because my brain is finite and mortal and couldn't absorb more than a chapter in one sitting (if it even succeeded in that).More than being a commitment, GEB is a work of art. Not just the music and numerous Eschers, but the writing. The dialogues between Achilles and the Tortoise were a riot even as I reread every line, struggling to keep up with the pace Hofstadter demands. And be warned, it's no slow pace, either. But it's worth every page, whether or not you agree to the conclusions he leads you to.My only caveat is: find some nice quiet summer when you'll be able to give GEB the attention it deserves and requires, or you'll find yourself putting it away for half a year until you do have time, as I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life, no really.","review":"This is the most important book of my life.

The subject matter discussed is as broad as it is thought-provoking. The dialogues are intricate, humorous, and insightful. Don't buy this book if you expect light reading. Some sections took me hours to read, and even longer to fully grasp. Hofstadter is able to explain complex concepts with such simplicity and style that even a semi-moron such as myself can understand them.

A wonderfull book. But some of the comments I've read above miss the point of the book because... well, perhaps they haven't read OTHER books that might help. For example, critics of GEB without reading \\"The Selfish Gene\\" (by Dawkins) should not be taken in account. For, if \\"functionalim\\" doesn't specifie necessary and sufficient conditions for reference, melt it with Darwinism, and you'll have it. Beside that, GEB has alloud me to really understand Damásio's books, \\"Descartes's Error\\" and \\"The felling of what happens\\", his latest. Read them and you'll see that Damasio's construct of the mind is a very godelian one - or better, a Hofstadterian one.

It's difficult to imagine anyone reading this masterpiece and not becoming entranced by the beauty of science, the science of beauty, the Zen of illogic, the logic of Zen, and the mystical threads that weave together the life of even the most rational of skeptics. This is one of my favorite books of all time.

The paperback editions were passed on to others who got alot out of them.

The first thing I noticed was that the volume on my radiohad to be increased to unusual levels. After a week of fiddling withdifferent frequency locations to attempt to find a clear signal, I hadfinally settled on a band that I thought would work. My first trip out of town disabused of this idea as the constant fizzing and static made listening impossible. After another week of meticulously going throughthe entire FM frequency spectrum (and another out of town excursion), I decided I had had enough and went and bought a wired connector that plays through the cassette port. The wired component only cost a thirdof what the Maximo cost and works flawlessly. The Maximo unit can still be used as a charger for the Sansa player while on trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works.........","review":"I am not sure how well though.I bought this as an after thought for my MP3 player.

Here is what I have experienced. First, it worked right out of the box. Second, when I spent less than 10 minutes going through the various frequencies, I was able to find several available stations that had a negligible amount of noise. I am very pleased with my choice. To those critics that complain about the background noise, I am old enough to remember tape hiss from cassettes, and the background noise can be reduced to about what was there on cassette tapes with dolby (or less). When I consider road noise and sound of the engine, I can't hear anything but my music. If you want less, get a different radio with a direct input from your MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Great product.

It is easy to use and allows for instant upgrade to MP3 in my car. The downsides? There is always some level of static or other noise audible during quiet music. I don't notice it during loud music and the audio quality seems pretty good given my crappy little car stereo. The device is set on an unused radio channel. My 40 minute commute is through the suburbs. Under the circumstances, I was not expecting interference with the audio signal between the device and the radio. Second, the channel display on the transmitter is not visible when plugged into the lighter outlet. I have to bend way down to see it and cannot make adjustments while driving. Lastly, the device is bulky and interferes with the cup holder in my Honda Civic. If I had to do it over again, I would try another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximo MP3 Charger/Transmitter","review":"It works great for me! The only hard part is finding a radio frequency that's not being used in major metropolitan areas.

Overall the unit works well. I live north of Boston and find that FM 88.5 works well for me in terms of interference. My only gripe (and this is probably either my lack of knowledge or a Sansa limitation) is that when my e280 powers up, it comes up at 50% volume. I can't adjust the volume with this unit connected so I plug in ear phones to adjust the volume all of the way up and then connect the unit. This is a pain. I believe I have the latest e280 firmware so I am not sure what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"The maximo fm transmitter works very well and charges as your sansa is playing. The price was a bit high, but I used mine on a fishing boat in Alaska all summer last year and had no interference issues.

I would purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"a whole lot of hassle","review":"Has good quality sound when there is no interference. I found it a bit annoying to use. It doesn't go below 88.1- or at least I couldn't get mine to go lower. All the unused frequencies are in the lower ranges so it was hard to find one that wasn't used- the ones I were able to use would only work for a while and then would have static. It is hard to fiddle with while driving- the buttons are small and the thing that displays your frequency is hard to see when the sun is shining.

Loved the quirky title, loved the beginning. Thoroughly enjoyed the first few chapters. But gradually, I lost interest. Such an unpleasant group of people - nobody to care about. The same conversations or jokes repeated over and over. So many lists: what was growing in the garden, lying on the floor. It became tedious. The reviews applaud this as a comic novel, and there are parts that are amusing, but it's very much black humor rather than the laugh out loud and read-excerpts-aloud-to-your-husband kind.I know this book has been extremely popular and nominated for numerous awards which puts me very much in the minority but I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and sincere","review":"I have recommended this book to so many people. It is a great story of family life and it just made me laugh so many times!The slavic-type background references, the cultural and language situations will just warm your heart!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of many levels","review":"Having discussed it with several people who have read this book I am even more convinced that it works at several different levels. The first is the British-style comedy, the second is the old man's magnum opus on the history of tractors and the third is the past and continuing impact of the events in the former Soviet Union over the last century on all the main characters. This is seen from a Ukrainian perspective (with slavic dark humour), where Ukraine was not only the founding location of 'Rus' but later the bread basket of the Csarist and Soviet 'Russian' empires. These three levels run in and out of one another, just like real life and that is probably why several people have read the book at least twice. Those critics who have seen it primarily as a sexual farce make the mistake of not reading deeper. The beauty of the prose should lead them to do this, but it is such a page turner that I can understand why they might miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange family saga","review":"I didn't really enjoy this book.

Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at all funny","review":"I wonder why this book is such a success.

It isn't a totally uninteresting story but would have been better published as a short story. The blurb from The Times on the book's jacket said \\"Extremely funny\\" but my guess is the complete quote was \\"With this premise, this book should be extremely funny, but it isn't.\\" It was mildly interesting but you could tell it was a first book as the writing was rather clumsy and she repeated herself a lot.I do believe the author's attempt to draw an allegory about Russia and the USSR versus the capitalist west was clever but she just didn't pull it off sufficiently to satisfy.Perhaps my reading of this book suffered most because it followed a reading of Saturday by Ian McEwan, a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong; this book had it's moments but there just weren't enough of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to force my self to finish...","review":"I had heard only praise for this book. I started with high hopes, but after about the second chapter I already hated it.For me, perhaps the most annoying thing about the writing, is the authors usage of explanatory details in parentheses. She uses them a lot, way way too much. It becomes annoying and stupid when the same joke about a big breasted Ukrainian or how someone pronounces English appears every other page in parenthesesAs for the book allegedly being funny, I don't think I laughed once. The jokes are childish.In the end, I have no idea how this book has won so much praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and entertaining","review":"I read two books from this author; A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian and Two Caravans. I recommend them both. Thoroughly enjoyable. I liked the characters, the writing was entertaining, some parts truly funny and other parts hard and sad as real life is. I even learned a few things about migrant workers; a nice surprise or by-product of reading Two Caravans, I wasn't expecting that. Don't make my mistake though, I didn't realize that Strawberry Fields and Two Caravans are the same book but with different titles. Oh well now I have 2 copies.

Yes, it was farcsical at times and the viagra jokes were getting a bit tired. Valentina is a huge stereotypical 'type'(in joke here)but great fun in lots of ways.The excerpts from Nicolai's Tractor book became a bit dull, but the historical references to the war, Stalin and the labour camps were insightful and thought provoking.Deviating from the main story of crass,coniving refugee trying to take advantage of a poor crazy old man, I was drawn to the 'family' story and particualrly the relationship between the two sisters and their relationship with their father. The irony is that without the greedy 'slut' divorcee the sisters would still be on non-speaking terms and their father would be dying of loneliness.I would acutally like to give this 4 1/2 stars as 4 doesnt seem enought, yet 5 doesnt allow for the odd flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete eye opener !","review":"When someone reccomended the book to me , I thought it would probably not be of any help considering I've purchsed several cars and thought I pretty much thought I had the idea of the whole thing....But Pique's book opens new ideas that I had never even thought of as being a rip off ...the book is definitley worth buying , considering you will learn soo many new things in a clear , light hearted manner !

I thought it was well-written and had plenty of real history woven in. I thought it was interesting that I had actually walked on some of the same streets that her characters were on--only about 100 years later! The story line was good--about the only thing that bothered me--not much--but some, was that it seemed like Kit was constantly quoting scripture or God's message. I realize that is an important trait to her, but it seemed like she based her relationships on that fact alone. That meant that I wasn't able to get as in touch with her as I have been able to connect with other of Tracie Peterson's characters (Grace in the Yukon stories, for example).All in all, I liked this story--especially the character of John Barrymore. Just another real history facet thrown in, but he supplied a much needed comic relief to the story.I highly recommend this book, but make sure you read her \\"Yukon\\" stories as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen Angel","review":"Usually Bethany House books are gentle, mildly inspirational novels. Alas, Ms. Peterson and Mr. Bell decide to ruin a nice little costume murder mystery, on the lines of the Goldy Bear series, by injecting a great deal of illogical religious bigotry that actually interferes with the story. The flashbacks to evil nuns and similar nonsense are sheer bad writing.By the way, it is impossible to have a character whose real name is Kathleen Shannon. She might as well be called Kathleen Mississippi! Shannon is the name of a river, and related to a Celtic deity. It has never been a family name, though it has sometimes been taken as an alias.

This is one of those cases.- Not deep enough. Laptop wants to flop off the back when I tilt my screen too far back.- Strangely, it kept making my WinXP laptop blue screen. So either there's a short in the wiring (yikes!), the USB cable is hitting some of the wrong contacts in the USB port (yikes again!), or the thing is trying to pull too much power from the USB port. So either shoddy manufacturing, shoddy supplied parts or shoddy product design.Also, if your lappy has front-facing audio ports, this cooler has a front lip that will prevent you from being able to use them.As a work-around, I had the front of my laptop sitting up on top of the front lip of the cooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but not to its full capabilities","review":"Pro:-Looks good-Decent fans-Extra USB port-On/Off buttonCons:-Weak fans (could be stronger)-Too big for 12-in (I realize that this one was for 15-17 in, but this was the only one available)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this from Amazon a few months ago, hoping to lower my temp.

The cooling fans on the NotePal are located at the rear of the product, and the hottest part of my laptop is typically in the front. The fan placement doesn't alleviate this heat build up. So, i have to put my laptop on it backwards to allow for the fans to cool the hot spots.Aside from this, the product does prevent my laptop from overheating and shutting down, which it used to do after more than 2 hours of use (and the inside of the laptop was indeed totally clean and to spec!). I recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it if your notebook is disposable","review":"I bought this for my son's Dell notebook.

The fans are definitely very very quiet, but I think the reason why they're so quiet is because they blow so little air out from the fans. The air that's being blown out is equivalent to someone gently blowing through their mouth. The made the air output absolutely negligible, and so the heat on my Macbook Pro is still very hot. I didn't notice a drop in temperature at all. The aluminum cooler actually started heating up as well.This cooler did not work for me.

However, it remains on when the computer is turned off, unless you push the button to turn it off. My other one turns itself off when the laptop is turned off.

It is also heavy. Especially when combined with my PC. Picture me trying to sit and hold my PC, this cooler, and do a balancing act to hold it all together without dropping the whole thing. It will keep your computer running cool. But the reason I bought it was to keep my leg from burning up while holding my laptop in my lap. The 2 fans are relatively quiet and are supposed to be good for 30,000 hours. It comes with a USB cable and needs no other power source. If you only use your laptop on a desktop then this might be good enough but lap use is precarious at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid product","review":"I bought this as a gift for a family member's Toshiba 17\\" widescreen notebook, and it fit perfectly. The fans didn't quite hit the right spots, but it was good enough.

I highly recommend this product and hope all experiences are as positive as mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product...not perfect","review":"This laptop cooler does a good job overall. It is wide enough and provides a stable platform. The fans are virtually silent due to the low rpm's. However, this is also the cooler's biggest shortcoming. The fans just don't provide much airflow. This product would be much better if it had multiple speeds. It does provide decent cooling, and for most people will be enough to provide the relief they are looking for. Another caveat, if you are planning to move this cooler around much, it is quite heavy and most people will find it cumbersome. The cooler is well-built and works as advertized. It just falls short of being a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Yourself a favor - Don't get it","review":"I've owned one now for less than a month and one of the fans is screaming like a banshee. It's so annoying that I've turned them off. Not only that, but even during it's flash of marginally meaningful existence, it didn't do much in the way of keeping my Dell E1505 Inspirion cool.Not at all worth the price. I don't know if any of the othe cooling pads are any better, but I strongly urge you to look at other brands and then if you still can't find something, do without."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been waiting for a book like this","review":"As a western buddhist, I have been intrigued about how Buddhism works with or teaches us how to understand our pruriant desires. However, aside from Tantra, there is a very limited amount of Buddhist material concerning how the mind deals with sexuality and our desires. Mark Epstein has done an amazing job in bringing these two areas together. The book uses the Buddha's Four Noble Truths as a vehicle to explain in detail how our desires and cravings become toxic to our relationships, and the ways to end this pattern. Written from a therapuetic and spiritual point of view, the book is neither dogmatic, nor self-help. As a lazy reader, I know when I found an enoyable book and an easy read when I spend more time reading than usual. This book fits the bill as easy to read, chock full of important insights, and truly a gift. I hope there will be a workbook of exercises or meditations that will follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A daring contradiction of Buddhist anti-life teachings","review":"I am a meditation teacher (since 1968), and I am really enjoying this book. It is brave of Mark to go against the doctrine of Buddhists to complain bitterly and mindlessly against desire. I find his writing enriching, for he is speaking as a meditator, a lover, a father, an analyst, and a wonderer - someone who is willing to just LOOK at what is going on. And opening to desire makes meditation juicier and more electrifying.Since the late 60's, most of my friends have been Buddhists or Yogis, and in the early 70's I noticed how deadened many of them were becoming, as they worked inwardly to kill their desires. You can watch over the years as meditators lose vitality as they cultivate a detached, dissociated, suspicious attitude toward the flow of life. Then they become fascinated by and dependent upon authoritarian \\"masters\\" to tell them what to do.Lorin Roche, author of Meditation Secrets for Women and Meditation 24/7."},{"rating":"1","title":"An uncritical support of the excesses of the Chinese Government's Oppressive Actions","review":"Epstein either omits mention of devastating events such as the Great Leap Forward or excuses the government's actions such as the Tiananmen Massacre.

Lily Bard is my 3rd CH series that I've gotten addicted to. This is book 4 in the series and it's been my least favorite. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't the most exciting. It was reflection time for Lily as she is making a transition in her life. At times I felt like I was just reading Lily's reflection on the mystery or how she related events going on around her back to her own life. There wasn't enough dialogue between other supporting characters in my opinion. And for those readers who are familiar with Charlain's work know that she likes lots of characters. Sometimes I have a hard time keeping up with who is who. I'm looking forward to the fifth and final installment in the series. If you are into Lily, definitely check out Harper Connelly series and of course I recommend Sookie Stackhouse to everyone I know.

Not easy to lift and my son has hated it since the day we took him home from the hospital! I agree with the other person who wrote that they curse every time they use it. It is very difficult to latch and the BELTS TWIST ALL THE TIME!!! It is just a pain in the butt. I think I used the \\"travel system\\" option twice because that was a freakin pain too. Very disapointed and hope that others look for other safe car seats and next time I will read the reviews!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HEAVY!","review":"This car seat has great, user friendly features. It has an easy to use base with easy to use LATCH system. The strap adjustment is very easy - you just use a slider to move them up or down. The only bad part (besides how ridiculously expensive it is!) is that it is like carrying a boat anchor around (without your child in the seat!). Try a Chicco instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Car seat Peg Perego","review":"Great Seat. Weight is not an issue for me. Very well made and I like the orange and brown. Fabric is easy to clean. The handle fits well and is a good balance point for carrying. Seat snaps into base easily. It seems a little large to me but I do not have much to compare it to. Price was good as it was on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't look safe to me at all","review":"I thought this seat was a great buy because it was reinforced for safety and the straps didn't need to be taken out to be adjusted as baby grew. I love my pliko stroller but this seat is awful. It sits so upright that my newborns neck looked like it was snapped, I couldn't bare to see her in that position. Luckily a friend of mine had an older model that has a similar cradle design to that of the Graco carriers. It also fits in my base and stroller. Now that my daughter is almost 9 months old I thought surely she would do fine in this seat because she can hold her head up so I tried it again. As soon as she fell asleep she looked as though she was falling out of the seat with her head flopped forward. Very disappointed and wish I could return this. I will be sending the pictures of my baby practically falling out of this seat to Peg Perego."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased carseat months before baby was born and only used it a couple of times during her first 2 months. The seams started coming apart during the first couple of months of use. When I called customer service to request a new cover they told me that I'd have send my receipt of purchase and pictures of the defective product. I was not inclined to put together a package proving the defect in my newborn sleep deprived state and therefore decided to keep the poor product. Just a couple of months later the pieces that hold the hood on popped out.Between the shoddy craftsmanship and difficult customer service, I'd go to another brand of travel system next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Chicco Keyfit instead","review":"I am 5'10\\" and very strong--no shrinking violet here--but even I had a hard time carrying this around.

I have since bought a Chicco Keyfit and have been very pleased. It is the safest on the market and about half the price. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret this purchase with every use","review":"I bought this car seat thinking that it was the absolute safest thing out there and was thus willing to overlook its ridiculous weight. Now, it seems that Consumer Reports has other options (the Chicco KeyFit 30) that have the same (if not better) safety rating and MUCH better overall score (not to mention $100 cheaper...)My #1 complaint is that the belt is really hard to use...especially with a squirmy child who is not very happy about being strapped in...it takes forever to get the snaps into place. I seriously curse it every time.My baby is 12mo now and about 23 lbs and she's getting too big for it (her feet have to almost straddle the seat!)...but she is pretty tall...We're ready for a convertible seat now.I may keep this one around as a spare for the next kid, but would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money for a single magazine column!","review":"Since when do magazines sell single columns online (with no printing cost) for what is a large fraction of the cost of the entire magazine.

The selection leave a lot to be desired. Their atempts at the fusion of many styles leaves the album slow and plodding - not the exciting and inspiring choices of the past.This album qualifies as MUZAK. The truly redeeming performances on the album are the compositions by Scott Tennant. They are bright and fun to listen to. Andrew York's \\"The Lotus Eaters\\" is also a nice easy listening piece. The rest are rather plaintive and boring. They have gotten away from their roots and foundation, that which made them famous and endeared them to many, myself included.

While these are still very good, they simply don't make up for the rest of the disc of what is essentially easy listening guitar music. York drifts all too easily into New Age, and the longer pieces, which I thought would reveal intricacies over time, seem to go on forever, but go nowhere. There is no passion or emotion in this music. Even the tune Farewell, which is a lovely haunting piece, seems a bit cold when compared to the Assad's version. After two cd's worth of this stuff, here's one former fan who hopes they head into more substantial, though not necessarily well-trodden territory.

However, when reading this book it is important for the reader to understand that Anzulovic is exploring the Serb side of events, and what lead the Serbs to commit the atrocities they committed during the 1990s.

One which essentially blames all the Balkans troubles on the Serbs. In that classic Balkan style, he simply omits any reference to Croatian crimes and builds a simplistic and at times, erroneous case against Serbs. The fact that the entire Serbian community was eradicated by Croatia in 1995 - a full 50 years after Nazi Croatia tried to do in in WWII, is avoided. Anzulovic chooses to ignore the details and simply parrots Zagrebs party propganda line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear perspective","review":"Mr. Anzulovic is clearly attempting to present a Croatian view of the Serbs. Is this bad? Not necessarily, as long as the reader understands the specific viewpoint of any author. He attempts to examine Serbian intellectual thought, folk music and myth-making against a larger European intellectual and literary scene. This is at best a partial success as the author has predetermined his conclusions and is writing to prove baleful influence on Serb behavior over the centuries.I must note that, despite other reviewer's comments, Anzulovic does show occasional flashes of impartiality, by inclusion of more than one set of numbers for people killed at Jasenovac. Is this an impartial book? NO!Is this the perspective of one of the participants in the recent insane Balkan Wars? Yes.

The novel begins when Swede is 70 and gradually works its way back to the time of the bombing, and then forward to 5 years after the bombing. This narrative form allows the reader to experience all of Swede's emotions.

Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Not Even Finish It!!","review":"There are few books that I do not finish. This was one. When it takes pages and pages and pages to say something that could have been said in a paragraph (and even then, perhaps it wasn't worth saying), well that just doesn't cut it for me. This book dragged unbelievably, and it seemed to jump all over the place. I agree with someone else who said that Roth just kept writing like a very long (and unedited) stream of thought.

So, \\"pastoral\\" is referring to a simple, idyllic life. I gather then that Roth is trying to show a contradiction of the view of American life as simple and idyllic. I get it, but why was the book so uninteresting. Maybe the contradiction was not strong enough. I believe the problem stems from the fact that the story really doesn't have a plot, so we are rolling around where there is no real conflict point or destination to our reading. If I got the point in a simple dictionary search and that point was not expanded by the story then all I needed from this book was the cover.

I gave 2 stars because the writing is excellent and if you like literary rambling then you may well enjoy. I read to be entertained , this did not entertain me. The author indulges in long diversions and it can take pages after pages just to add one thought to the story. It has lots of reviews so no point in my rehashing the plot - and in the interests of brevity I will keep this succinct.

By page 150, you'll have a headache. I liked The Plot Against America a lot, and came to American Pastoral curious and highly receptive. But I'm sorry, this novel, after opening promisingly, came thudding to a near halt. (Reviewer PS, June 28. 2005, on this point, is required reading.) My wife needed to revive me with smelling salts about a third of the way through, and I promised her I'd give the book up despite a masochistic compulsion to complete it.

Whoever it is, the real author or the persona, the guy keeps dragging me in to hear his agonized, self-involved, masturbatory whining, book after book after book.\\"American Pastoral\\" purports to be a step away from all that. Roth's alter ego, Zuckerman, makes his entrance, and then relinquishes the stage to yet another Jewish main man from Newark, but one who, believe it or not, is a star athlete with blond hair, known to one and all as \\"Swede.\\" But, wouldn't you know it, you can't take the neighborhood from the boy. Although punctuated by by a string of gratuitous crises, \\"American Pastoral\\" is basically one long whine.The maddening fact remains that Roth is a fine writer.

We have to sift through many ideas and counter ideas but never learn what happens! Who was Rita Cohen? He goes on and on about her- yet we stay mistified. What happens to Merry? Does she die of starvation? Does she go to jail? We don't know. What about his life after Dawn? The plot is very thin and the commentary about american life is very thick. I didn't disagree with any of his ideas but instead thought, \\"so what\\"? In this story it seemed that the problems of the United States caused the problems of the hero. Not believable. Here is what we come away with: Mr. Roth is very bitter about the United States. Voila. Dull!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Pastoral","review":"American Pastoral was an American delight. While I am getting accustomed to sloshing around in my reading boots to Philip Roth's extravagant use of language, I I become enticed by the way he slices the \\"onion\\" of the character by peeling, slicing, chopping, reconstituting, mashing, and then doing it all over again and again.It helps that I was born and brought up in a similar neighborhood in Boston and at a similar time period. t is easy to relate to his environment. However, I think that if I were not Jewish I would be overwhelmed by his descriptive powers and extraordinary use of language. Instead of my practice of skimming over pages to locate the plot lines, I luxuriated in the prose page after page. I read this novel after reading I Was A Communist and Nemesis. It may be easier to read Roth if you immerse yourself in his style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous book that asks questions about life.","review":"This book approachs a major question about relationships that happens to be framed in post-war suburban New Jersey. Having grown up in that area during that time improves my understanding and appreciation of the depth of understanding Roth illustrates. What is it that makes a child abhor the seemingly perfect life of her parents and their values? Why are the child's values, undoubtedly taught by the parents at some level, violently opposed to those of her teacher parents? Why couldn't Swede take a stand about anything?

It is very well-written, and has one of literature's best-developed main characters: the \\"Swede\\" Levov. At the beginning, he is a one-dimensional hero to the narrator. As the book continues, the layers of the Swede's complex life are stripped away, and the narrator sees him as a man, and so do we. It's heart-wrenching and realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Redundant Torture","review":"I've always been slightly sceptical about Philip Roth, but now I am outright repulsed by him. Every book he writes reiterates the same old cliched themes, and \\"American Pastoral\\" does this with particularly annoying aplomb.

If you need to read a Roth, try Henry instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Successful guy made miserable by his daughter","review":"Title of my review says it all. Not engaging in the least. Realistic?

To me it started quite badly, too much dialog by a person not really connected to the plot.Then it kicks off properly after about 80 pages or so and focuses on the main character the Swede.Some of the insights into the Swede were interesting but there are loose ends and long generally dull sections particularly towards the end.It is one big post mortem really, even within the context of the story, the story itself is imaginary. Just a bit of nothing really.It kinda of is worth reading, the psychology is very detailed, and some times I felt like I was reading a new level of novel. But overall to me it didn't quite do it.I guess it was just too subtle for me... or was it 'silk so fine human eyes cannot see it...'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy Pulitzer.

That bored me ... a LOT. And even the interesting writing style did not manage to make the read pleasurable to me.What seems to be a particularity of Roth's style from what I recall of my reading The Human Stain and that The San Fransisco Chronicle describes as \\"At once expansive and painstakingly detailed\\"... is exactly what I did not like in the novel and made my reading of it \\"painstakingly\\" achieved.

The repetitive nonsense hammered over and over never is justified by any resolution. Why start the book with Zuckerman only to drop him?

Are we to believe that he recovers and starts a new (normal) family. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Pastoral","review":"I am wading through this book because a book group to which I belong will be discussing it. The book is overly long and tedious, but you can't skip sections because you never know when a sentence or two will come along that finally moves the story forward. When Roth gets back to the story, rather than getting bogged down in details about the decline of Newark, about manufacturing gloves, and other side issues, the story is quite gripping and very upsetting. It it based on real events, but engenders little sympathy for the participants in the riots of the 60's & 70's and their families.I think he had enough naterial for a long short story or perhaps a novelette, but insisted on stretching it out over 423 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both redundant and repetitive","review":"I didn't think a book so thing could repeat itself so many, many (many) times.

To all of those readers, I think if you read it again with a more open mind, you'll find you missed the point. What Roth is saying is that *nothing* is as simple or as comprehendable as it originally seems. Not the Swede, who's life initially seems so perfect, and who as a man seems so good from Zuckerman's outside perspective; not his wife, who was a beauty contestant, and wary of the title and all that came with it, and not Merry, who is neither a monster nor the beautiful little girl of Swede's dreams.Similarly, the novel is none of those trite categories you might initially want it to be, but much much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition: Almost Unreadable","review":"I'm an author and an acolyte for e-books.

It's a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"I hated this book! The book was bogged down with boring details that did not add to the story (ie: multiple pages on how to make leather gloves).

The sentences were unnecessarily packed--often 10 and 12 lines long--and the 2- and 3-page wanderings between lines of dialog were maddening. I had the feeling I was following someone who didn't really know where he was going or why. The book club I go to gave it 9 thumbs down and only 1 thumbs up. I read Portnoy's Complaint when it first came out years ago and didn't like it either, and this current book reminded me of it despite the almost 30 intervening years. It was my book club's consensus that this would be our last Roth selection. I am dumbfounded as to how a book like this could win a Pulitzer Prize. What do they use for criteria?

First read of Philip Roth and I think he is a great writer, lots of brillant description, background and life.However the 3 main protagonists, Swede, Dawn & Merry are so flat that they are hardly 2 dimenisonal. If they were ment to be ciphers for the American experiance of the 60's and 70's....it fails to engage or make me identify with it or them.All 3 remained unreal, even Swede's rage near the end left me unmoved or concerned.There are attempts at \\"magic realism\\" in this book, but, I couldn't engage in it.As a descriptive writter he seems over welming in his ability and will go down as America's Dickens or Hardy.A prize winner? no I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for the book PLUS 1 MORE FOR THE Narrator!!!","review":"The joy of listening to the unabridged version of the audiobook is hearing the elegant Jewish language slang used by Mr. Silver.

Indeed, the plot details are so few and far between, the story of Swede Levov could probably be told in a short story. But Roth, who apparently despises indentation, enjoys rambling endlessly about ... well, everything. Granted, Roth has a gift for prose, so his ramblings are more often then not well-written and carefully researched. But, they are ramblings nontheless, and one is always impatiently trying to slog one's way through this two-page long paragraph in order to get to some PLOT. This is a novel of emotion and inner pain, which Roth is effective in capturing. 400 pages of pain is a bit much, though, especially when nothing is happening. My favorite line in the novel: Merry, the daughter, when asked to write about what life really means, is able to summarize her thoughts in a single line. \\"Life is the short period of time in which we are alive.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbing and stimulating book.","review":"Phillip Roth again shows intellect,skill and honesty in this book.The conflicts,betrayals and cruelties are disturbing but ring mostly true.The spirit and courage,along with the patches of humour-mostly black,depicted are inspiring.

I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good. But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tiresome Read","review":"This book was quite impossible for me to finish. I found the writing unbelievably self-indulgent, muddy and abstruse. In a vain effort to be poetic, Philip Roth's style becomes overblown and ego-centric. Many times he expresses a thought in 3 or 4 pages that could have been articulated in a couple of paragraphs. It's like scratching an itch on your right ear with your left hand. I grew up in a neighborhood similar to his setting so I appreciated this but there wasn't enough clarity or dramatic reality to make me continue reading.

I figured the DVD would be better with the original videos of songs I really like, but I forgot that the Deftones' videos aren't that great. Take \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" for instance.

Was nice that when I emptied it I could just fold or roll it up and keep it easily in my pocket.

The actual Platypus bag is made of decent material but without a sturdy cap its worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be perfect for our trip to Disney","review":"To be honest with you, I have not used the bottle yet. I purchased it to take with us on our trip to Disney this summer. I thought it would be great to just fill at the water fountain and add drink packets.

Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly BAD Writing","review":"This was my first read of anything by the alleged great Sidney Sheldon - and I was shocked at how poorly it was written. The entire time I was reading it, I felt like the author was racing to slap the words on a page and get it over with. This was especially true of the dialogue. It is laughingly, pathetically BAD. There is nothing about it that feels or sounds like how people actually talk to each other! It had a forced, rushed quality to it, like maybe the golf links were calling to the writer and he couldn't wait to get this assignment over and done with. The plot was predictable and trite and quite honestly, I'm amazed I stuck with this book until the end. I guess I kept hoping that it would improve - I mean, after all, the late great Sidney Sheldon's name is on it, right? But sadly no - no improvement ever came. It leaves me to wonder if he indeed had anything to do with its actual creation. I will be hard-pressed to want to ever read anything by him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"sidney is slipping","review":"A quick read but no real surprises. I was amazed at the number of errors which got by e.g a ship does not get under \\"weigh\\", it's \\"underway\\". He also confused Back Bay with Beacon Hill - no Bostonian would make such an error.

Besides \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\", this is one of Sidney Sheldon's more forgettable creations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too exhausted!!!","review":"Having read all Sheldon's novels, this latest one from him is the worst. It totally lacks the twists and turns that would catch a reader in a spell. It;s not character-driven and the plot is so laughable; one cannot believe that Sheldon wrote it.

There are so many errors that made me wander if the book had been edited at all! Also, I believe that the author should've spent an extra 50-100 pages to better develop characters and settings. Nevertheless, I did enjoy reading the book with its many twists & turns. Mr. Sheldon seems to be a very talanted story teller who just needs a better editor. This was my first Sidney Sheldon book, and it would have been the last except that based on the good reviews that I've read here on Amazon , I'm willing to give his \\"Master of the Game\\" or \\"Rage of Angles\\" a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift to a Friend","review":"This was a gift to one of the \\"girls\\" we meet with monthly.

I purchased the cookbook shortly after tasting a soup she brought to another function and have never regretted it. I've owned this book for 2 years now and LOVE it. In fact, every person who has tasted one of the dishes from this book has gone out and bought it right after (even non-vegetarians). It's the wonderful combination of fresh ingredients and herbs that makes it. You can not fail with the recipes in this book. I have bought this book as gifts for close friends who always thank me afterwards. I could not live without the recipes in this book. I particularly like the Rustic Bread Salad, the lotusland linguine and the tofu chocolate (vegan) cheesecake. I have many cookbooks on my shelves, but this is the one I turn to first.

Having been a vegetarian for over a decade I already have plenty of vegetarian cookbooks on my shelf but this one quickly has become my favorite. I have made at least 15 items out of the book. The recipes are innovative and combine flavors in a way that really appeals to my family and me. Some of the recipes do take longer, especially those that require that one makes a \\"mother sauce\\" or two before hand but I have yet to make a single thing that we didn't really like. Many recipes have an Asian or Southwestern influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Different","review":"This is one of my favorite cookbooks!! I love the fusion behind many of their recipes. I also hold any cookbook in high regard when it emphasizes making most everything from scratch...even tortillas!!!! This cookbook has a great section just for basics that will start any cook off to a good start.A few points, however, that not all of the recipes I think are to the correct amounts. I do not mind this so much as it only takes a bit of \\"tinkering\\". Also, for those who do not live in an area where you have access to an excellent natural foods market, you might be limited on a few of the recipes. I still, however, think it is worth it to have this cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome delights!","review":"By far, this is the best cookbook I have ever come across.

Moreover, I liked a few of the recipes, such as the Mac n Cheese and the Monk's Curry, but I'm considerably less enthusiastic about the rest of the recipes that I've tried from Rebar. Most of them take very long to prepare and cook, and many of them first require preparation of a condiment or sauce. The results are somewhat blah for the most part. I've never made anything bad per se, but the time and money I put into the recipes is not worth the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad but true","review":"How excited was I?Finally a vegetarian cookbook that was not all granola hippy-dippy food, styled for the 70's veggie.Something cool, interesting, elegant, using new ingredients, new approaches, fusion style cuisine....Alas, this book has absolutely not lived up to my expectations.I am a pretty good cook; I generally don't fail in the kitchen, this was absolutely not the case with this cookbook.The recipes sound great but don't turn out; the amounts of ingredients are weird, and don't match up (i.e. so much pasta, so little veggie, or so much dressing so little salad)I am thoroughly disappointed, to the point where I will return the book and opt for yet another hippy dippy granola vegetarian cook book with recipes that actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"long complicated recipes","review":"I got this cookbook off a referral from a friend.

For people looking to understand leadership from the human side, \\"Leadership Is An Art\\" is one of the required readings I would suggest that you start with. It is based on the ethics/morals and philosopy of most types of leadership. I have used this book in teaching leadership courses at the university level as it is based on inquiry and insights while requiring the reader to form his/her own conclusions. This book applies to all types of leadership - from business to social and family settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quick Read","review":"Max Depree does a great job of fulfilling the purpose for which he wrote \\"Leadership is an Art\\". His how-to, self help book is grounded on a solid foundation of leadership philosophy.

I highly recommend it.Also recommended: A book that is not at all one of the many books in competition with \\"Leadership is an Art\\" that you should go on to read is Norman Thomas Remick's \\"West Point: Thomas Jefferson: Character Leadership Education\\" for an education on the philosophical foundations of Max Depree's \\"Leadership is an Art\\" that everyone can understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Really good book.

What De Pree writes as \\"authoritative\\" leadership concepts, I see as nothing more than common sense. Perhaps I have been blessed to work in a company that touts similar values and beliefs or perhaps I am just a person that already believes that it is the diversity of people that is what makes a company successful. But I found dredging through De Pree's long lists of leadership principles exhaustive and frustrating. I didn't find this book revolutionary (which is how he seems to write it) or even particularly interesting. \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" is a FAR more compelling leadership read...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This book was useless.

If your looking for any concrete information on what makes a good leader look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"\\"Leadership is an Art\\" is double-spaced, large type and only 148 pages long and yet it is so thin on content that it still feels like the author is struggling to fill the pages. The five pages of the introduction cover basically everything the author has to say while the rest of the book is filled with redundant anecdotes and pointless religious musing. The few actual points the author does make seem so common sense to me (treat the people who work for you with respect, what a concept) that it actually kind of disturbs me that so many people seem to find his ideas revolutionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book from a great leader","review":"The book is interesting.

When I purchased this book, I waited for night to come so I can snuggle up in my cozy bed and read some inspiring stories that will help me increase my faith. The second story was disappointing. I thought \\"hey that's okay... just one bad story... I'll give the next one a chance.\\" Story after story, I became more disappointed yet still giving this book a chance.

The Concertos are enjoyable and Miss Hahn plays them very well. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Georgia on my mind","review":"I had a hard time getting through this one, especially the Barber. They say some Classical music takes getting used to. I think that's an excuse for bad composers to proliferate their high school quality doodlings. (My first exposure to the WTC was instantaneous joy, for a not example.) Not only is this number hard to digest, but the unfelt mechanistic imprudence radiating from your speakers will have you disgusted that a permanent recording of it was mass produced. Of course, thus goes the entertainment industry. Although Hilary is proud of her first commissioned work, I find the Barber in the quintessential vein of prime time television saga themes. Maybe she'll sign it over to Hollywood in the years to come. Personally, I heard of some recent developments in a Russian robotics lab where they were playing Bach with an actual bow to millisecond accuracy. Sign me up for one of those. Hilary is already getting old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD","review":"I have had this CD for about a year now and it is has never really gone into the rack as it is on high rotation ; the Barber is beautiful , the Meyer breathtaking and up there with Vaughan-Williams lark ascending IMHO.Other reviewers have written more eloquently, but I thought I would write this little review as a celebration of my appreciation of this CD. It has given me exquisite pleasure many times, it keeps giving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern masterpieces","review":"This CD is a marvel of beautiful music played beautifully. Hilary Hahn plays both the Barber and Meyer violin concertos perfectly. She must be recognized as the very best young violinist recording today. Barber's concerto is melodic and very relaxing through the first two movements and the third movement is exciting and most appropriate. The Meyer concerto is even better--sweetly touching and gentle, and Hilary Hahn plays it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting composition (the Meyer) \\"Typical\\" Hahn Brilliance","review":"I've listened to the Meyer so often I haven't found time for the Barber.The Edgar Meyer concerto is inspired. I can't get the themes out of my head and don't want to. Hahn's performance is awesome as usual. I find it hard to listen to other violinists after listening to a Hahn recording of the the same piece. I hope the world will appreciate the geniuses this generation has given us in Hilary Hahn and Edgar Meyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as Joshua Bell's Barber","review":"There is no doubt in the fact that Hilary Hahn is something extraordinary when it comes to technique and sound quality. However, even though Joshua Bell's tone might be descrbed as somehwat lusher, it still has that recognizable human voice, of which its being imperfect, makes it perfect. Although i found the CD to be absoulutley amusing, i still don't see the \\"soul\\" coming out from Hahn as i do in Bell. I was also rather dissapointed by the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, of which its size did not provide the robustness and brute force required for such a pieace like the Barber."},{"rating":"2","title":"hahn - unaffected beauty","review":"hilary hahn and the very fine saint paul chamber orchestra have produced a disc of beautiful, unaffected music. the barber concerto, already a popular piece, is given a fresh and expansive treatment that carries the music far beyond its curious, anecdote-rich origins. the meyer - although here hahn seems less confident somehow - is put on the map by an attractive first recording that will encourage many imitators. hahn will add to her following with this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl can play.... REALLY BEAUTIFUL!","review":"Hilary Hahn's virtuostic, expressive playing like no other young violinist performer today. This is a fantastic disc, definitely worth getting.

Really quite beautiful, in a very lyrical kind of a way. Great sound recording as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisite must-have recording","review":"This is my first CD review on Amazon but I had to recommend this album as one of the most beautiful I have ever listened to. [My musical tastes run from medieval plainchant to show music.] Hilary Hahn has incredible talent - I have followed her career ever since hearing an NPR interview when she was 13. Her violin playing becomes more lovely with each recording (this is no. 3). The two works on this CD are lyrical, evocative and very American. The Meyer, in particular, has themes of folk melodies and is reminiscent of Copland. Meyer wrote this piece for Hilary Hahn and the work and her playing are stunning. This is a recording to listen to over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a pain","review":"the paint came on five colors. not red, blue, yellow, and white; but orange, green, yellow, blue, and white. ever try to make red out of orange? impossible with these paints.speaking of impossible. the paints came in REALLY small plastic tupperware-style containers that were attached in sets of four - orange, green, yellow, and blue. one, i had to use my teeth to open them - which was a risky proposition considering that the paint does NOT wash off. two, there was about 1/1,000th of an ounce of paint in each container, which required me to open them all so that my sons would have enough of each.overall, a project that should have been fun with my kids was only because my kids are so cool. we should've done something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"as it goes","review":"I'd give it 5 except I was drunk and thought I was getting the game for a steal hahahahahahaha"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's...fine.","review":"This product is pretty inconvenient.

And if you choose not to use the complicated annoying little hooks, the back is constantly rolling down creating squeezed back fat that probably looks less flattering than not wearing the bodysuit at all. On the positive side, the material is very sleek and smooth under clothes, and smooths the tummy and thighs pretty well.

The outstanding feature, IMHO, is the fact that you can attach it to your own bra.

I have been wearing much less expensive \\"models\\" of this type of shapewear and the Spanx model is definitely the most comfortable. I reserve it for times when I don't want anything to show through and the Spanx Slim cognito definitely does its job. I was skeptical of the strap arrangement, but it works very well although one definitely needs to allow a little more than the usual amount of time to get dressed when wearing the Slim cognito. I believe that Spanx shapers are a little too pricey for what they deliver, but they deliver results that no other shapers I've tried do. I would recommend this product and I would definitely buy one again, should I need another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too special","review":"This item was just so-so compared to other slimming undergarments.

It bunches and slides at the top, even with the straps. And I found out the hard way that even when it seems like the gaping crotch ought to provide enough space for peeing - even while holding it open - well it didn't. Resulting in an unfortunate disrobing and cleaning in the restroom. And an uncomfortably wet, gross day at the office. I tossed mine out because I was so angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had been wanting SPANX for so long. Today, I finally got my order. What a disappointment! The waist is not meant for the average-height woman (I'm 5' 4'-1/2\\"). Because it is too long, it has a definite crease in the back and rolls down. The straps that attach the shaper to a bra don't keep the shaper up; they draw the bra down! I cannot recommend this product and wish I could rate this under 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't really work","review":"This sounded like an ideal product because I could use it with my own bra. However, like some of the other reviewers said, it's not so easy to get on, the straps are stupid, but if you don't use them, the suit rolls down and hurts, and don't even think about going to the bathroom! It works, but like all my Spanx, it doesn't really live up to the claims because it rolls up, it rolls down, and i'm always adjusting something.Still, I must admit I haven't found anything that slims me down so well...but there must be something else out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"a modern torture device","review":"I wish I could get my money back.

It literally took me 1/2 an hour to get it hooked to my bra, some how manage to get the bra AND the spanx on, then I had to spend even more time untwisting the connectors, refastening them over and over because they kept coming loose, I had to wrap the front connector around my bra like 4 times because it's way too long.Once I did manage to get the thing on correctly, and shimmy into my clothes, I found that I could not breathe and the top of it sat right on my ribs wear my chest expands to breathe. I was actually in pain because of the way the band sat on my ribcage. Breathing was extremely difficult and I literally took it off in the car on the way to a party and tossed it out the window.

I wore them for the first time Sat. night. I followed the online directions for the size I would need. My first thought was that these were too small. I pulled and tugged and stuffed myself in though. I must say my dress looked better. However, I could hardly breathe. I thought I'd get used to it. However, in the car on the way to the restaurant, I made my husband turn around and go home so I could get them off. Sitting, I think, pushed everything up into my ribcage. I actually got them off in the car and immediately felt the blood returning to circulation. I could literally feel it. Anyway, woke up the next day with a soreness under my ribcage. At first I didn't know why. I went to the doc on Monday for a checkup and mentioned the sore rib. He said I bruised that area and should use ice and nuprin. NEVER again.

I would recommend this for anyone looking for a quality cooking burner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior product","review":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.I did a careful review of similar products before making this purchase and I'm glad I did. This unit is excellent! I had previously been using one of those old style, coil-type burner hot plates, which sucked. The Waring is superb for control, each numbered setting on the dials actually makes an incremental temperature adjustment. The green light that comes on when it reaches that heat level is helpful, and the one-large, one-small burner feature is very useful when cooking more than one item.Of course, it is electric, so you have to learn to adjust to the lag times both heating up, and especially, cooling down, as the unit stays quite hot for a long time after turning it off. Nevertheless, this cooktop has created a truly functional kitchen for my small apartment.In summary: a highly functional, well made, attractive unit, well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best AC cooker!!!","review":"Works great, heat very hot for a AC.

I have a glass-top stove, and canning is not recommended on glass-top stoves since 212F can't be maintained. Instead these sites recommend portable gas or electric burners. I decided to try this electric burner, but it is definitely NOT powerful enough for canning.It took my 16-quart canner two hours to reach a weak boil. When I was finally able to add 7 (pre-warmed) quart jars, the temperature in the canner plunged and never returned to a boil. It made for a long, frustrating night and I ended up having to freeze 7 quarts of vegetables.I later contacted the USDA's National Center for Home Food Preservation after my little disaster, and they informed me that despite the claims out there, there is currently no electric burner recommended for home canning.I wish a portable burner for canning existed, but believe me when I tell you, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"likely the best quality you'll find","review":"solid, quality knobs, looks good, and gives you the best heat rating for a 110 volt counter top model.

In the beginning the DB60 Portable D. Burner, did burn up a bit. But then again the manuel said that would happen for the first 30 so min. After that, it was great!! We used it the second day we got it and it cooked like magic.

A worthless warranty in my mind.I also have had to bring water to boiling in my coffee pot then transfer it to the burner. If you don't do this it is much worse than waiting for a watched pot to boil... it is infuriating!But because all else out there looks not so hot either, I purchased another one.

This one seemed ideal because of the strong reviews and the fact that it had two burners. After having used it several times, I returned for one big reason: THE SMALLER BURNER IS USELESS and a waste of money.I plan to buy a single burner version of this, because I found the large burner perfectly suitable for portable cooking, it can get very hot and can accomplish the cooking I need to do.Meanwhile, the smaller burner, even put at it's highest setting, won't even get water to simmer. Honestly, you're better off buying two single burners if you really need two. I will buy a burner from the Waring Pro brand because, as I've said, the main burner does exactly what it needs to do, but this \\"double burner\\" seems great in theory but is not worth spending the extra cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great burner.","review":"After trying other burners, I took a chance on this one and I love it! It heats up right away and you can dial in the temperature. Other ones would cool off (and stop cooking several minutes) before it would kick back on. This one maintains the heat more evenly. It is a little heavy, but that shows it is made well, and won't move around. The 'solid' burner is larger than most others, and you don't have the gaps like the coil style. (No food can drop into the burner.) Easy to clean. I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this one. Don't waste your time and money on other cheaper ones.

The heat is either very hot, or not so hot. There is no in between.I Bought this on February 3, 2010. In the beginning of 2011 I started noticing that the light would not go on when I turned the knob to the on position - meaning no heat. Shortly after the heat would stop while cooking unless I applied downward pressure to the knob. Now it is October 29, 2011 and it won't turn on at all.I spent the extra money on this, because I thought I was getting quality. Instead I got a burner which lasts as long as $15.00-$20.00 Proctor Silex or Premium burner.Save your cash and go with a cheap burner which will last you a year or two.
