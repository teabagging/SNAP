I found it difficult to follow her train of thought in explaining why a 175 year old murder had any relevance at all to the person who kills the archeologist in charge of the digs at Monticello. That person must have been exceedingly appalled at finding out their family tree is the result of Miscegenation -- and that with a slave of Thomas Jefferson. Next, I suppose, Rita will be trying to justify a forced apology by Whites to Blacks for slavery (something which none of us living today have any control over what-so-ever 136 years after it ended in this country). There are some points in the dialogue throughout the novel in which Rita was simply lecturing the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Lilian Jackson Braun","review":"I started the Mrs. Murphy books because they were advertised as being like the Lilian Jackson Braun books.

Stick to the Cat Who's..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mickey Finns anyone?","review":"The closest Rita will ever get to emulating \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" is in the title of this book. The similarities end there. Anyone can write about the illicit drug trade, a subject Rita should have had the good sense to stay away from. She added nothing to the discussion worth reading. And she still doesn't know what she is talking about when it comes to law enforcemnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder at Monticello","review":"The home of Thomas Jefferson provides the perfect setting for mysterious murders, both past and present. The past murder comes to light when an archaeological dig unearths the remains of a man buried in Monticello's slave quarters. Postmistress Harry Harristeen and her blue-blood friends begin investigating the murder, and in doing so, they place their own lives in danger. Of course, Harry's cat, Mrs. Murphy, and corgi, Tee Tucker, are instrumental in solving the case. As a result of the investigation, some current murders also occur. As usual, author Brown provides a good read, this time enhanced by some interesting background information on our third president and his famous home, Monticello."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good account of the \\"Jack the Ripper\\" crimes","review":"Hinton provides a good account of the famous series of murders in London, 1888, the environment in which they occurred, the police officers who investigated them, the victims and the evidence. No one was ever convicted of the crimes and Hinton does a good job explaining the difficulties Scotland Yard faced. Notably, he brings his own background in law enforcement to the table.He reviews the major suspects and proposes a new one, George Hutchinson, a witness whose testimony to the police was odd, to say the least.Recommended to anyone new to the subject, or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"The first star is for an interesting background on the Irish language. The second star is for the web addresses included in the book, which took me to some useful sites on Irish language. But that's all it gets - as a book to learn a language from it is not well written, especially for beginners. It doesn't give you all the vocabulary you need and assumes a lot of knowledge of grammatical terminology - nor are the exercises particularly good. I came away with the impression that Irish would be way too hard for me to learn because of its extremely complex grammar, which I'm sure was not the author's intent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a baby monitor to buy","review":"This monitor comes in different names but is made by the same manufacturer. Also beware that the newer version that has the greater pan and tilt capability isn't any better. This might be useful as a security monitor if it doesn't leave an a/c outlet for more than an hour and if it sits on a desk that's higher than your body. Issues I found: 1. When I turned on my microwave the speaker screeched and the monitor was unusable. 2. If the monitor was on a table and you walked toward it (within a few feet) the display would go out and the audio would give you a buzzing noise. 3. The pan and tilt feature barely worked- Monitor was downstairs and the camera's upstairs. Less than 60 ft. I had to go upstairs to get them to work. (I don't have wireless or a 2.4 GHz phone) 4. The volume control was extremely touchy. It went from 0 to loud with barely a touch. I liked the concept but the product needs some tweaking for it to be a baby monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This looks great but you cannot get out of the bedroom before the static starts.

Not even close. You do have to experiment a bit with placement of the receiver and camera to get the best reception but once you do it is very clear...even in the dark. Better night vision than the Bebe Sounds unit by far. We have one receiver upstairs and one receiver down stairs. Bought this at the locals Sams Club for $99. You cannot buy the cameras separately anymore but at $99 for the receiver and camera combo it's a better deal anyhow. Only draw back I found is that the scan feature is useless unless you have all 3 camera's hooked up. There is no way to get the receiver to scan only 2 channels... otherwise it works great for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serene","review":"It was just what I was looking for--sweet and serene and will be used while guests are arriving at a wedding in the Spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Relaxing With Nature!","review":"This has the sound of beautiful music and songbirds that can make you sit down and relax.

Normally I love Time Travel books based in Scotland (I'm Scottish and live in Scotland). But, unfortunately I am rapidly going off this book. I don't really know what is wrong with it, it's not grabbing my attention as some other books have. I have no feeling for the characters in any shape or form. For all I care 'they could go and hing themselves from the nearest lamp-post'. One thing that has really annoyed me is that Claire Cross has tried to be clever and have the hero coming forward in time and therefore change history. The Scots lost Bannockburn, Robert the Bruce is branded as a thief and scoundrel and England (which she insists on calling Britain!!) lords over Scotland. HEY! Maybe that's why I don't like the book!!No, to be honest this could have been an excellent story, but to me it is wasted by an author who doesn't have the talent for this type of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wasted plot...","review":"I have just recently started reading this style of novel and have read some really great ones and I was so excited when I bought this one. However, I reached a point where I could barely read through this one. The story line has so much potential, the hero is great but the heroine!The heroine is as thick as cold grits,childish, churlish,clumsy,petty, unfair.... to the point of being so annoying I couldn't stand her dialogue.I wish someone else could use the exact same story line and put in a woman with a character I can admire.. some backbone and decency and the dialogue of a grown woman not some simpering dialogue that would annoy even a 12 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start but a beautiful ending","review":"I took a while to get into this story but when I did I was so glad I persevered.

Herta Payson provided me with answers to questions that I didn't even know I had, while subtly encouraging me to reclaim my roles as woman, sister, daughter, and healer. I found it fascinating to read other women's accounts of experiences I share as well as read of those unfamiliar to me. I have always shied away from more mystical interpretations of woman in society because I have found them inapplicable to my life and times. The Dragon's Eye manages to capture spirit in a tangible way through Payson's concise examples, beautiful narration, and stunning insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ten for all women!","review":"This book touches to the core of being a women. Secret's deep within are honored, blessed and spoken with a tenderness that is awesome.

I noticed lot of errors in the quiz part of the book. I sent the errors to the author, who never replied back. I also sent the questions to BFQ software who made the quiz cd.

When I read about author I got already suspicious. The absence of any DBA experience shows too obvious in the book itself. May be he just thought 'it would be cool to write book about something, why not Oracle'. In the book there are Clinton and God, which is fine, but how it helps to get DBA OCP. One of the worst Oracle book I have read, and there are some really bad. I don't even know, can I trust now that questions on CD are from the real tests"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who edited this thing?","review":"I have 8 years of Oracle experience and have completed all the certifications since v7.3. I have been waiting for a book to help prepare for the 9i upgrade exam so I was happy to finally get this book. I'm halfway through reading it and have found more errors than I have fingers to count. I'm no editor so the errors I have found are blatant and it makes me nervous as to how many subtle errors there are that I missed and thereby got misinformation. The content seems ok but it is annoying to know you spent money for a book that has information you cannot trust. Wait for the next publishing, maybe the errors will be cleared up by then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good preparation for the ORACLE9i new features exam","review":"Yesterday I passed the test with 49 of 56 correct questions at least partly thanks to this book. Together with the test questions from selftestsoftware and the ORACLE documentation you should be able to pass the test.I found that this book covers all of the topic that I found in my exam. However sometimes it misses some minor details that might be needed in the exam (1 of the 7 questions that I answered wrongly was such a case). I you are aiming for a perfect score in the exam this is not the book but I think a perfect score in a test that you only need to pass should not be the goal of test preparation...I will use (and already used) this book as a reference for my work with ORACLE9i new features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, especially when compared to previous OCP exam guides","review":"I am sorry I waited the extra two months for this book to be published. I am an OCP DBA on 7.3 and above, and have always used the Oracle Press books as a major source for my studying. Previous books were written by Jason Couchman and were quite good. This book is not. I have only completed 2 of the 6 chapters so far, but have found numerous mistakes, and chapter study questions with incorrect answers! Unfortunately I no longer trust this book to prepare me for the exam- in fact I am tempted not to finish it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, but not enough for exam!!","review":"Its not a bad book, easy reading, good structure. Has nice CD-rom testing software.But let me tell you.. its not nearly detailed enough. I just took the OCP 9i and you need to cover way more material than is covered in this book. I'd say 50% of the exam is in this book, so that is not very good coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this book proof read?","review":"So many mistakes - the exam questions and answers contradict what is in the chapters, and Oracle documentation completely.It is a shame the publisher / author hasn't released a corrections bulletin.I've but lots of corrections in mine - I'm temped to ask for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"OCP Oracle9i Database: New Features for Administrators","review":"Absolutely,no good for an only source material to pass the test.

Probably can be used as reference.Regards :-|."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book, but not for exam preparation","review":"This book covers almost everything new in Oracle9i, but it doesn't focus on exam, it covers details, but not to the point. For general readings, this book is fine, I won't expect to rely on this to pass Oracle9i upgrade exam. I was disappointed when I received it and viewed the contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful presentation. Lots of mistakes.","review":"I hate reading this book - boring.Lots of mistakes in the text and in the software.Test software is awful - multiple choice questions often have single choice controls.

You will also need to refer to Oracle manuals and really practise on Oracle 9i to get the concepts right and pass the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the ExamCram","review":"Who proofed this book? Certainly not Oracle! I have been an Oracle DBA for 17 years and have never quite seen anything like this. It is filled with half-baked information, followed by contradictory exam questions.When compared to the ExamCram book for the 8i New Features, it pales by comparison. I had to check every topic against metalink and documentation sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to get through Exam.","review":"This book is good to get through the exam provided that one isalready having enough knowledge and experience. I got my 9i Certificate recently while relying 90% on this book. I have the following observations about the book:1: It covers all the exam objective.2: The book is purely written to take exam , and not for in depth knowledge.3: Self test software has a lot of wrong answers.4: Practice exams in the book are fairly simple and straightforward that is not the case in Real Exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and Confusing Book","review":"The book may cover all the topics required for the exam. That is the only quality of this book.It is full of errors, confusing and sometimes contradictory explanations. It seems to have been written by someone who is unfamiliar with Oracle, and just blindly compiled material from different sources.I had to check every topic by referring to other documents and manuals.In the beginning, you can learn that the book is dedicated \\"To God for infinite blessing\\". Ironic, isn't it?I have more than ten years experience in Oracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I passed--barely","review":"While the book does an adequate job of covering the new features, there were many errors in the chapter quizzes, practice exams and on the CDROM quizzes. I wouldn't recommend buying the book if I had to do it over again. I would read the new features summary in the Oracle Documentation set and browse the checklist for the exam (from the Oracle Ed website). Overall, the best preparation I had was by attending some new features sessions at the IOUG conference in April. I passed, but probably could have passed as well without this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but can not count on it entirely","review":"It is a nicely structured book for Oracle9i DBA upgrade exam. The author tries to cover all the topics but lacks the depth. You have no choice other than to refer other documentations from Oracle in addition to get a better score in the exam.Of course, everybody I saw on the reviews were pessimistic about the book. I would consider this book as a better support for the exam. All I insist is to peruse every page of this book. Of course, It does have some grammatical and syntatical errors. I just overlooked them all instead of writing a letter to the author to inform of all those dopy mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and lack of detail","review":"Poor book with many mistakes. lack of broad and detail regarding the test. I dont understand Oracle Press even allowed it be puplished. I just took 1z0-030 exam and failed as I trusted this book too much. when I saw exma on the screen, I knew I would fail for this right away. I had never fail for any Oracle exms once. I did this time. I felf I was cheated by this book. I suggest your all don't trust this book and nor buy it for your expensive test unless you really want to throw your money away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Millicent","review":"Millicent is your basic clueless but likeable brainiac. Don't be put off by the first chapter and Millicent's writing in Latin. It just goes to show how different her humor is.I also like the idea of two other books about her friends, Stanford and Emily. I haven't read them yet but want to see what their point of view of Millicent is.In the interest of full disclosure (and so you can see where I'm coming from) I have to say I am a grandmother and an English tutor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Millicent Min, Girl Genius","review":"This is a wonderful book. It is candid, well written, and definitely worth the while of any preteen girl. What could easily be a simple book relying on cliches becomes an exciting, complex examination of \\"The Girl Who Knew Too Much.\\"All the characters are believable except Millicent, but she is supposed to be unbelievable. Besides, Millicent is the only really lovable character.Some of the plot points are stretched, but overall Millicent Min makes an excellent read. I'd love to see this turned into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to buy Forms A, B, and C","review":"I love this series -- it's straightforward and easy to teach in portions rather than having to go sequentially through the book as you do with other workbooks. However, I was ding-dong enough to buy all three forms -- A, B, and C. If you read the footnotes at the beginning of B and C, you'll note the instructions/content/topics are the same in all three Forms -- the only thing that changes are the exercises. For my purposes in a high school English classroom, only one Form would have been fine since I could have created my own additional exercises as needed.The information covers basic parts of speech through essay writing and includes remedial through advanced types of exercises and topics. I particularly like the possessives and contractions as well as the doubling-before-suffix lessons. I can't say the information is rare, but it's nice to have it all in one handy reference that's genuinely full of practical instruction and lacks unnecessary narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reference.","review":"This book was recommended by my ENG 101 Instructor and is great for everyday reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was delivered fast.","review":"I was surprised how fast I recieved it.

However, I give it a low grade only because I was looking for more information on the spiritual elements of her heart-wrenching story. So by that measure, my expectations were not met. I can only say that the whole of her story -- the factual and spiritual -- as told in her book will live with me forever. Very powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diary of Immaculee","review":"I read the book Left to Tell (which was tremendous), and ordered this video right away when I saw that it was available. It is excellent also, both as a companion piece to the book or on its own. Immaculee's story is emotional and wrenching as it portrays an unbelievable tragedy.

It made me think quite a bit about camels, salt, the desert, and how you wipe your bottom with sand while out on a caravan."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adventure for YOU","review":"I discovered this book at my local library and read it nonstop in one day. I ordered the paperback from Amazon (which promptly arrived) because the book fits my definition of a keeper.This is a compelling, haunting travel narrative. The author takes you with him on his desert adventure, sharing his experience through his vivid personal account. The photos with chapter heads and the centerpiece of stunning color photos are a bonus--it's his writing that swept me along. Afterward I found myself recalling the spellbinding experience, many years ago, of seeing LAWRENCE OF ARABIA on the big screen. I saw that movie as many times as I could on the big screen, and I'll be rereading MEN OF SALT, too, whenever I want to return to the Sahara."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow your dreams!!","review":"Michael Benanav's gift is to write so powerfully and descriptively that you take the journey with him.

I bought the \\"Used-mint\\" copyholder from \\"rom1616.\\" When I got it, the box was collapsing, there was no packing inside, and knobs and nuts and parts were lying in the bottom of the box. The pivoting arm and base were cracked in several places. The weights in the bottom of the base were loose and partially hanging out of the bottom as though it had been dropped. I couldn't get any of the parts to tighten up as the screws had been stripped out. The sliding ruler was missing completely (one of the parts I truly needed). When I tried to stand it up, the copy tray and rotational arm flopped forward exposing the multiple cracks in the plastic where the base and arm join.

If you have read his(Paul William's) non-fictional account of India in his stupendous travelogue \\"Empire of the Soul\\", you would find many uncanny resemblences. That trip to Afghanistan and the descriptions of sorrounding areas, St. Xavier's miraculous preservation and even the general description of Bombay. Not to take anything away from Gregory David's fine novel, but the other Roberts(Paul William's) is outstanding in his description of India. He combines history, philosophy and travel into a gripping personal account that is far more scholarly without being pretentious. Try to get hold of that other book and see for yourselves the fresh insight that you would automatically get from \\"Shantaram\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Read in the Past Few Years","review":"I can't remember the last time that I read a story so compelling and visual that it was impossible to put down for all 900+ pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shantaram","review":"This book is great.

The only reason I'm not giving this book a five is that it almost seems like two different books - part one being warm, filled with completely real characters in a vibrant setting, and 'believable' (though the events are still extraordinary). Lin, the main character, comes across as tortured but humble. Part two, however, is much darker, the characters begin to blur together, and Lin starts so sound something like an action hero, and is somewhat less likeable for it.Despite those small issues, it's definitely a book I would recommend to almost anyone, except those who really dislike violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better the second time around!","review":"I loved this book and was swept away by the main character, Linbaba. I appreciate the expanse of a life well-lived and this story points to such a life through vivid images and wonderfully fluid prose--with many instances that leapt from the page and touched my heart and mind. I was sad when the book ended and so enamored of the story and the use of words, that I immediately read it again--this time highlighting those passages that truly touched me. It's a keeper and one that I would not hesitate to highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Shantaram is a rare book indeed. It is based on the life of Lin - the author - and tells the tale of his escape from prison, his new life in the slums of India, his involvement with the mob, and his adventures as a soldier in afganistan. It is a huge book, but will go by fast as the story is all engrossing. Lin meets many people people in his travels, some wonderful and magical, others dark and dangerous. He tries to atone for his past life, but fate has a way of following people seeking retribution. No matter how hard a person tries to atone, the devil is there to lead you astray. Read this book and discover the powerful story that leads an ex-con to earn the name Shantaram. You will become purified and will love life more than ever.Relic113"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"At last. A life lived largely. A Jack London life. A book that takes on the big gun questions and answers (or lack thereof). No glorificaton of domestic boredom and the long winded whine of its consequences. This story blew me away.

As one of the other reviewers said, 900 pages is off-putting - until you read the first one. It's a terrific story and I'm recommending it to all my friends.That said, I feel it falls short of great writing because of its poor editing. There is simply too much of the same stuff over-and-over. I swear I almost put it down due to the inumerable repetative descriptions of everybody's eye color - including a dancing bear's!The story itself is compelling, the characters come to life and the city feels real.

If even half of what happened in the book is true - it's simply amazing. Mr. Roberts makes us care about all of the characters, and despite the multitude, most are three dimensional.

Precious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book came highly recommended and the back cover and first few sentences of the story hooked me, but for me, it did not hold up. I could find no discernible plot. It jumped from one \\"remembrance\\" to another. It also seemed like a philosophy book thrown in. It became a little laughable how almost every referral to Carla started with one of her wise sayings. Toward the beginning of the book, I enjoyed reading about an entirely different culture, but those insights drifted off and never really returned. After about 500 pages, I looked longingly at the unread books on my bookshelf. I had to keep going with Shantaram, however. because I picked it for our Book Club. I hope I'm not tossed out after our next get together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad to be finished reading this pointless book","review":"My sister raved that Shantaram was the BEST book that she had ever read. So, I excitedly bought the book and started reading. Was there something I just didn't get? It took me about 2 years of picking up and putting down the book, and thank goodness, I finally finished it tonight! I persevered because I hoped the book would get better, and then more recently it became a good practice book for my speed reading.Lots of pointless stories that barely tie together by an author who is in desperate need of a good editor to stop the rambling on for 935 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Pseudo-philosophical and ultraviolent, laughable and extremely poorly written, I couldn't stop shaking my head while reading Shantaram. As an autobiography, the author is extremely conceited, and he paints a ridiculous portrait of Lin, the leading man: part Commando warrior, part junkie, part saint.... As for the writing, the imagery is histerically bad, you'll be groaning not-stop every time you read a description of Karla's beauty. I could go on and on: what about the contrived quotes that the author sprinkles the book with (\\"as Karla/Didier/... once said, bla bla bla ...\\"). What a pity I don't have the book with me right now to give some examples... And the philosophy is just pages and pages of tedious pretense that the author pounds our head with.I am baffled by the positive reviews this novel has received.

The main character, Lin, an escaped armed robber, is discovering his soul in Bombay's slums and the village of his guide, Prabu.

Maybe it's not there at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story but a bit cheesy","review":"I am somewhat ambivalent about this book. I share some of the concerns of other reviewers; the writing is obvious, even cheesy on occasion, and the story seems self-serving. I put the book down a few times but the story is so compelling I picked it up again and read on. The best thing about this book--and I grant that this is genuine skill on the writer's part--is that the story appears to unfold effortlessly. The narrative is crystal clear and compelling and makes for considerable reading pleasure. The other plus is that the author's exploits offer a glimpse of a world few of us would have the chance, or courage, to enter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I read about 100 books each year, mostly historical fiction. Shantaram is up there with the best I have ever read. It takes an amazing author to sustain my interest for 900 pages. Roberts did it easily. Once I got to page 600 I dreaded the impending ending because I knew that anything else I read next would pale by comparison. While I have no desire to go to India Roberts took me there and let me smell, feel and touch the sub-continent. This is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book gets 5 stars, Kindle version gets 1 star","review":"The Kindle version of this book needs some serious editing. The book must have been scanned then OCR'ed because there are typos on almost every page, some pages have many. This is usually only irritating, but occasionally I have to reread a sentence several times to parse out where the periods or other punctuation should be. It's especially irritating that one of the main characters of the book is named Karla and this can come up as Karia, Kar1a, Kar|a, or who knows how many other variations. These problems really interrupt the flow and joy of reading this book. It's a really bad version.The exact same problems appear on both the dedicated Kindle reader and the iPhone Kindle application so I don't think it's a download problem.The book itself is spectacular and I highly recommend it for all the reasons given in the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Piece of GARBAGE!!","review":"The first section or so of this book was somewhat engaging. But then it all went downhill rapidly. I got really really tired of the author portraying himself as a martyr and a hero. He wrote as if he was God's gift to India. All he is, is a petty crook and writing and selling this ridiculous book is yet another way for him to extract money from anyone foolish enough to buy the book. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT support this criminal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oversized, but worth the read.","review":"\\"Shantaram\\" is oversized in every sense - it's too long, the prose is too purple, it contains too many incidents, it reaches for but doesn't attain cosmic importance, and all its characters are giants. And then, finally, it's undersized in that the ending falls flat, because the title character's redemption is telescoped from page one. But, with all that, it's pretty much a good read because Gregory David Roberts knows, loves, and can write about Bombay specifically, and India in general, and takes us places in India's heart we'd never get to on our own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story worth telling - by someone else","review":"I can't deny that Mr Roberts has a story to tell. I just wish it had been written by someone else, someone whose prose style isn't so flowery and cliche-ridden. I can't believe the praise that has been heaped on this book. Have these people ever read a truly well-written novel ? Roberts never uses one word when he can use ten. Everything is described in a cloying, 6th form way, all the characters are one-dimensional. I found it plain unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"The author's criminal background in itself doesn't concern me, but the extremely poor writing in Shantaram (and web site! and author's fan mail! and philosophical pointers!) strikes me as a successful con job. There is not a single believable character, no depth or complexity in the author's observations, and the narrator's voice wears very thin very quickly. Reading literature is always an option, though: try Vikram Chandra, for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massive ego, corny philosophy and bad prose","review":"It started out strong. Fascinating seeing the Bombay slums from the narrator's perspective. After lots of fights in which he kicks ass and self-congratulatory talk about his connection with the Indian common people, I started to feel a parallel with Mark Salzman's Iron and Silk. Both Roberts and Salzman are foreign guys with big chips on their shoulders who have an over-fondness for fighting, think of themselves as impressively brave in the face of physical hardship and bond in a semi-homoerotic way with their fellow gangsters or martial arts experts. All of this comes with a big dollop of corny philosophy and lots of cliche metaphors and bad prose. Give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-important drivel","review":"How this book has such high reviews, I have no idea.Some of the cheesiest lines I've ever read. Anytime his love interest entered the novel, I'd sigh and prepare myself for another paragraph of kindergarten love poem lines about her eyes as green as the ocean, etc.The only reason I got to the end was because I figured there had to be a reason everyone loves this book so much. Nope. 1000 pg waste of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"an incredibly spiritual book","review":"I read this book after I'd gone to India with TellusArt. It's an incredibly spiritual book, which you wouldn't know by the cover text. I would have picked it up sooner had I known. I love the awareness, the insight, as he makes one choice after another, that indeed it is a choice, and it comes with consequences. The tale is riveting, a well told tale, that keeps you reading the whole way through. It's an incredibly thick book but well worth the time it takes to plow through it.I don't know if everything is true, but who cares, the story fascinates in many many ways. I found answers to many things we'd wondered about during our trip. Mumbai and India is an experience that seeps deep into your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Shantaram, surprised me!

She liked so well that when she got to the last page, she started all over again. What seems to impress readers is the lyrical prose that has people swooning over descriptions that do little to move the story along. The author must have written the story and then gone back and put in as many philosophical phrases he could think of. It's a tap dance. He should write poetry.

Even though some of it was a bit rough, there was humor and a sense of really seeing a part of India that Westerners don't often encounter. After a while the story darkened but I was still interested.

It is a novel that has the feel of a travelogue and the tone of an autobiography and it will pull you in and not let you go until you have read the last word. Shantaram is marvelous and even though it is in excess of 900 pages, you will reach the end of it wishing that you could still go on.If you like India, Bombay, travel, personal trials and tribulations or just one cracking good story then Shantaram is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone!","review":"This is the best book I've ever read in my entire life.

I found it boring at times and was unable to get into it. It was \\"interesting\\" but did not grab me.May give it another go, but struggled.There are better books around I believe.

Second to (and some cases even suprassing)the real experience, this book brings India to life before your very eyes. The writting is brilliant, concise and yet philosophical at the same time. India and its many different people come to life, as does the energy and excitement of crime and being a fugitive that the hero is. But more than this, this books does a respectable job of trying to answer (or atleast ponder) life's toughest questions. The most powerful part of this book is showing the amount of despair the human soul can survive. It gives you hope and sadness at the same time, it opens your eyes and lets you indulge all your physical and emotional senses in a life full of meaning, pain and most of all survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This 900+ page tome is a remarkable read.

I won't say that I read Shantaram, but that I experienced it. Simply put, I love this book.

If you're thinking about buying the book, then you should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrociously-written, self-aggrandizing garbage","review":"My god. What an incredible load of drivel this is. Though there is room in the world for large stories largely told, Gregory David Roberts' self-aggrandazing pseudo-autobiography teems with ludicrously bad prose, characters so flat I'd like to use them to keep water off my bathroom floor, dimwitted philosophy, and self-love. I quite literally had to stop reading from embarassment at the sex scenes (\\"my body was her chariot and she rode me into the sun\\"? ye gods), and repeatedly found myself saying, \\"No, actually\\", at Roberts' increasingly idiotic turns of simile and metaphor even outside that context.Absolute drek."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly excellent book, original and with something to say","review":"This is one of those rare books that you will remember having read for a long time. There are many things to say about it, but to cut it short, it brought back to me what it was like to be in Bombay, what it was like to be a romantic, and be in love, and what it was like to know that philosophy is for everybody, not just for an intellectual elite. The most important thing about this book is that it engages with all the big questions in an authentic way. It is also a very good read, without too many concessions to clichés. Finally, the book has one specific lesson for us to ponder: the worst evil is not in the world of crime, but in the institutionalised prison and police jail.The hero, in fact, may be a criminal of sorts.Many thanks for this book. It joins books by Sandor Marai, William Faulkner, Dashiell Hammett, and a few others in my very special list of novels that reminded me of (or taugut me) something important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, with life messages that give you pause","review":"First off I have to say that Shantaram is a bit of a guy's book - like Herman Hesse's Siddhartha. I am female, and not generally a fan of the genre. That being said I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Shantaram. Mr. Roberts can certainly write - but he also made me think. There were several chapter endings that I bookmarked as I knew that I wanted to go back to them and read the \\"punchline\\" again. Absolutely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, who has aboslutely disparate reading preferences. I've read all of Ayn Rand, loved Peter Benchley as a kid, and went through my existential stage, reading Sartre, Camus, Kierkegaard & Nietzsche. I prefer non-fiction these days, 1776 and others around the Revolutionary war being my latest love. So with her love of Harry Potter, I immediately recoiled at her recomendation... but not having a book at the time and quite a bit of travel upcoming, I gave it a shot, and I continue to thank her for it. This book is great. The story is fantastic and artfully written. I'm sure some will pan him for the writing style, but those people should not take themselves so seriously. The book is an absolute joy to read, and impossible to put down. The story is at times heartwarming and heartwrenching, and entertaining throughout. GET THE BOOK! You will definitely not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"shantaram","review":"A self promotional novel by a drug addict/criminal. This 920 page novel befits the authors oversized ego. After some consideration I think the novel was not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Command of Language, But Not Persuasive Enough","review":"The author's command over the language and his writing is nothing short of phenomenal. He doesn't pull any punches describing the abysmal and deplorable conditions in the Indian prison system & his description of their escape from the Australian prison is suspenseful and compelling.Crisp editing of the voluminous material would have gone a long way making this a more appealing read.Also, it was very hard to empathize with the numerous characters since none of them lead remotely \\"normal\\" lives. I believe that the book does not, in spite of all those pages upon pages of writing, succeed in making the reader get past the initial distaste or prejudices towards characters who resort to questionable livelihoods or lifestyles prone to failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all. Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying. I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc. Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad indicator","review":"What a let down! After reading all the positive reviews and hearing all the talk about what a great masterpiece this book is it took me precisely seventeen pages of tortured reading to set this book aside.While the place setting is mildly intriguing the terrible prose quickly diminished any interest that was briefly picqued. Rather than having been written by an escaped convict holed up in a seedy hotel room smoking dope, it struck me as having been written by a below average college freshman holed up in a dormroom smoking dope.Whoever wrote the blurb on the cover deserves more credit.All I can say is that it strikes me as a sad indicator of what proves to be popular reading and which elicits such widespread adulation, if that is to be believed. I will say though that this \\"tome\\" is sufficiently hefty to act as fine doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased.","review":"I received the audio cd set in a timely fashion.

With 933 pages of fine print I usually avoid this type of book because of poor eye sight. I devoured the story with a magnifying glass and it is very well written and easy to follow. The story is quite factual yet written as a novel. While the main character is quite a villain one can't help being on his side all of the way. Wonderful entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Saga","review":"You cannot put this book down once you start it. What a page turner! The author has amazing insight into government, politicians, criminals, the justice system, and society in general. One of the best books I have read in a decade.

I wish that it had incorporated more about his re-incarceration, release, and travel back to Mumbai.JB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...Highly recommended read.","review":"Well worth the time it takes to read 900+ pages.

A view of life not many live. Do read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a journey!","review":"I listened to this book on audio and loved it so much I purchased a hard copy for my library.

I wonder if there will be a part two?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have EVER read....","review":"\\"Shantaram\\" is a cross between \\"A Fine Balance\\", \\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"A Million Little Pieces\\", and \\"The Godfather\\" if you can believe that. Not wanting to spoil any details, the book chronicles the journey of a heroine addict, who escapes from an Australian prison and finds himself in India. While it is a daunting 900+ pages, the author's love affair with India, is breathtaking. I started reading this book years ago, and although I adored it, I put it down halfway through. When I finally came back to it, it was with renewed vigor. I have spent the last two years reading nothing but the \\"classics\\", and cannot help but think this is the only book I have read from the modern era that I can comfortably say, will be a classic piece of literature for generations to follow...it is honestly that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shantaram - A man must love his bear.","review":"A novel full of beauty and pain.

A must read story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books you'll ever read!","review":"In a world of fast-food reading, this one is a true, rare delicacy. The full 933 pages makes you work for it. But if after 13 years and 3 re-writes, the author still manages to put it on paper and write a book this size, there's something he wants to say. You'll be greatly rewarded reading this book! From the moment I read the opening paragraph I was hooked. He takes you places most of us will never see and shares his intimtimate stories of love, loss, and friendship and through his dark tales of drug addiction, violence, and organized crime. Through it all, he connects with his readers and gives them one tremendous, thrilling story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book brought me back to the India I visited and loved.

The imagery and language are just beautiful in all the descriptions of the vast city, and the whole vast subcontinent. The Indian characters are all worth getting to know. The foreign characters, not so much. This is a tale of people I wouldn't normally want to read about - criminals, drug addicts, shady tourist types, and so forth; and it gets much more violent as it goes along.I could have done without all the violence, but the images of India have lingered on. All in all it was worth the read, for that. An inexpensive way to take an insider's tour of a very exotic place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shantaram Review","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Baddabang!","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend. It was only the first 300 pages because she was enjoying it so much, she tore it in half so her husband could get started reading while she finished it. I got so engrossed in the first half, I did an online search on Amazon.com to find an intact copy. I was excited and into the characters, the days could not go by fast enough for me. My used issue arrived in excellent condition, and the adventures in Bombay continued. I must tell you that Gregory Roberts does an exceptional job of capturing Bombay. The character development is good as are his accents and idioms. My disappointment in this book comes toward the end when the main character travels out of India. Without giving away the story line, let me just share that there is a good deal of death and gruesome scenes described. Not for the faint of heart. I understand that Roberts has written a sequel. I just may have to revisit Bombay again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shantaram","review":"This sums up my opinion: THE best book I have ever read! Wonderfully narrated with descriptions that place the reader right there amidst all the action. Makes me want to visit Mumbai and all the places mentioned in the book.

I think only a mini series can do justice to this story and not a 2hr movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"In serious need of an editor","review":"I listened to the 43 hour CD version of this book.

Gregory Roberts speaks to the humanity in all of us with his exquisite writing. He honors us with a depth of wisdom about the intricacies of relationships. He reveals his knowledge through stories of love, loss, friendship, betrayal and patriotism. I laughed. I cried. His characters were in my head long after I finished reading his deeply meaningful book. I am recommending it to social workers, counselors, educators, psychologists and anyone in the health professions. We find ourselves in his words. I emailed Oprah and told her to put this book on her list and to hurry. It is a must read. Instead of flowers, I am now giving this book as my gift. Gregory's beautiful words linger with grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been half as long","review":"I started out loving this book, some of the prose was amazing and I marked some passages for later use. After page 150, my \\"I like this\\" marks fell sharply away and then disappeared after page 385 ... but the story continued, and continued, and continued. Because the beginning was so good, I tried to finish but gave up around page 426 feeling angry. It is almost as if someone else stepped in to finish the book - perhaps the author had a contract to get to 1,000 pages rather than stop at 500???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Horrific","review":"The best book I've read since Corelli's Mandolin, and before that, A Soldier of the Great War.

Your life is not complete until you read this enchanting story, which is sure to captivate your heart and mind.

The writer 'Australia's Most Wanted Man' becomes a fugitive in Bombay after escaping from an Australian prison. At various times he is a slum dweller, where he establishes a free medical clinic for slum dwellers and then he is seduced into the Bombay Mafia. Although a criminal he is blessed with an unusual integrity and loyalty towards people he likes and trusts. Gregory Roberts writes brilliantly and takes his readers on this amazing trip with him. My only criticism is that the story is too large for one book - both physically and mentally. I would prefer it to be at least a trilogy so that parts could be absorbed before rushing off into the next round of experiences, adventures and shattering tragedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!!","review":"This is the best book ever.

It covered humour and romance and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Moving","review":"It doesn't get much better that Shantaram. After being intigued by the author's life story on the flap of the book, I decided it was worth a try. Gregory exceeded every expectation I had and amazed me with his gift for storytelling, attention to detail, and ability to make the reader think. Every chapter entertained as well as educated. His ability to recognize and describe peoples' character in a way the reader can readily identify with and decide to love or hate is extraordinary.Not only does he give an entertaining and insightful view of the Indian people, culture, and the situation in Mumbai during the 80's, he also weaves in his and others' philosophies about anything and everything. Whether you agree or not with him or his charaters, you are moved to at least consider and reflect on what you believe and accept.Give Shantaram a chance and you will be so enthralled for 900+ pages that you won't want it to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, spellbinding, Love and Adventure story.","review":"This is the most fascinating story I have ever read.

This is an adventure story, a story about redemption, a story of love found and love lost, it's a journey through the heart of Mumbai and the heart of a man. It's about everything that makes a good read. While reading this, I had the same feeling that I had as a child when I heard those magical words \\"once upon a time in a faraway land\\" and settled in for a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"For entertainment purposes, the book hits the mark","review":"This is the second largest novel I have ever read, but I was not bored. I still remember most of it even if I read it a year ago. The book vividly describes the living conditions of the people in the slums of Bombay and the underground criminal culture. I can't say the book sheds a good light on the city of Bombay but the human element is highlighted and you see goodness in the common people, especially in the slums. Sometimes the stories sounded too simplistic and sometimes they were too dramatized like a movie, but it looks like that was the intent of the author. I am glad this was mostly fiction. Had it been a true biography, my review would have been different, but for entertainment purposes, the book hits the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern India as you never knew it!","review":"Move over chicken tikka masala, this is fiery hot lamb vindaloo! Amazing epic of modern India in bold masterful strokes, Gregory Roberts pours molten passion and painful reality into his writing that makes this a most readable and enjoyable book. Fast paced yet deeply philosophical, this is Herman Wouk meets Eckhart Tolle. The pain, the sounds, the smells, the love and yes the dance fairly jumps at you from this book. More than just a great read, this is definitely a personal library piece! I rarely hope to come across two books in a year that would make me gush, this definitely is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shantaram is spellbinding!","review":"The book immediately drew me in!

The descriptions were cheesy, cliched, and unbelievably mango-breasty: \\"eyes the color of the desert before a rainstorm\\"... come on, that's terrible!The stories about the slums, the prison, and the passport laundering were interesting, if you could get through the orientalist prose and suffer through his pathetically overwrought passages about Karla, her green eyes, her quick half-smile, and whatnot.This book should have been a Bollywood movie. It had all the absurd constructs of Bollywood fantasies - the elusive love interest, guns and violence, a hard, lonely hero, the comic low-class Indian side-kick, and the evil gangsters and patriarchal wise men.And if it had been a movie, at least it would have been over sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Tour of India","review":"This book has hands down the best first chapter I have ever read. I was immediatley sucked in.The story takes you through an amazing journey through the Indian slums to the Afghani desert.

(by Great Artists of Our Time), which my family has played at every Christmas Day since the mid 1960's and contains great tracks by Davis (above one and Jingle Bells), Diahann Carroll, Anna Maria Alberghetti, Doris Day, Dinah Shore, Andy Williams, Danny Kaye, Andre Kostelanetz, Maurice Chevalier etc. I don't think the Goodyear series is available on CD (pity as some great music) but in the meantime, buy this CD and join the Rat Pack, for some fun but mellow and skilled songstering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I love this music CD.

However, it is simply a compilation of solo recordings with a couple of \\"bonus tracks\\" from TV specials tacked on at the end.Fans of Dino and Sammy may think this is great, and it IS very good, but for those who purchase the title primarily for the Sinatra cuts, beware! All of Frank's solo tunes are available on the lesser-priced \\"A Jolly Christmas From FS.\\" \\"Jolly\\" is in my estimation the best Christmas album of all time. If you want an overview by all 3, definitely check the \\"rat pack\\" x-mas album out.

The voices of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and Dean Martin really shine on these tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great selection of songs by three music legends","review":"This CD is perfect for that family gathering for everyone to sing along to. All three singing Rat Pack members are here, but Sammy gets short shifted by having only three songs on this CD. The two Italians, Frank and Dino, get eight songs each and duet on two. They couldn't find more songs by Sammy? His \\"Christmas All Over The World\\" was a song I never heard before that sounds terrific.Other than that, this is a great CD to have in your Christmas collection. Three pros who excel in expressing the joy of the holiday season. Frank's \\"Mistletoe and Holly\\" and Dino's \\"Peace on Earth/Silent Night\\" medley are rare cuts that add to this CD. With Peter Lawford and recently Joey Bishop passing away, the Rat Pack are all in Heaven now. But they can smile down and know that people can still enjoy them during the holidays. Pass the hot chocolate with marshmallows and spike up the eggnog a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rat-tastic!","review":"This collection of holiday songs is fantastic addition to anyone's holiday music mix.It should be noted though that the featured \\"Rat Pack\\" is in actuality only Frank Sanatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. Only these three artists are featured singing, with the exception of at least one song from a live performance where a few other fellow rat-packers are in attendance.That technicality aside, it is an incredible assemblage of seasonal songs sung by the creme de la creme of big band swing.

There are several - 2002, 2007, and 2010. The 2007 version is a second release of the 2002 version, with 21 songs. I particularly enjoy It's a Marshmallow World, recorded live. The 2010 version drops 5 songs, including an awesome rendition of Baby It's Cold Outside. I have the 2007 version and find it lovely, uplifting, and refreshing.

It does exactly what we bought it for - automating a broom and dustpan operation. The patio and sidewalks around our house have a pretty but highly textured surface that has been a challenge to keep tidy. It gets power washed a few times a year, but day-to-day requires intensive sweeping to pick up trapped dust, leaves, dropped flower petals, etc. The K50 now does it quickly and efficiently. The basket is large enough to hold plenty of debris. I thought the 20 minute battery life might be a limitation, but so far it hasn't been a problem. The only negative is I can't sweep early in the morning - though the little motor is quiet, the hard plastic wheels are really noisy on the rough surface and we don't want to disturb the neighbors."},{"rating":"1","title":"No easier than a regular vacuum","review":"I had hoped that this would bridge the gap between my dust buster (not much suction; have to bend over to vacuum) and my regular vacuum cleaner (big and heavy, stuffed in a closet).

At the same time, \\"Eli\\" is a great story about one man following Jesus and learning what justice and mercy truly are."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Modern-Day Christ","review":"Eli is definitely one of Bill Meyer's best books! In Eli, the story of Jesus Christ comes alive with a modern-day twist. Set in the United States, the book follows the missionary journey of Eli (Jesus) starting from his birth in a humble motel laundry room to his arrest in a city park. Conrad Davis, the main character, follows Eli and is struck by his unique character. Any reader, Christian or non-Christian will be touched by this book. For non-Christians, this book answers the question \\"How can Jesus apply to me if he lived 2000 years ago?\\" For Christians, this book will definitely make you think and remember the story of Christ over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work - challenges the reader","review":"This is one of Myers' better works. It really challenges you to think about what your response might have been if Jesus had not come until today. The story is very quick paced and keeps your attention the entire time. It's one of those books that really makes you feel emotionally involved in the story. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening, high concept fiction","review":"Bill Myer's ELI made me reconsider some of my own preconceptions of Jesus Christ and his earthly ministry. I think we often keep the historical Jesus at a safe distance, therefore it was mind-boggling to think of him entering a pornographer's house, approaching a skinhead's camp, and calling a motley crew of disciples! Bill Myers deserves many enthusiastic kudos for daring to bring the Gospel into the twenty-first century. This book is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eli","review":"This one of the best books I have heard. Bill Myers is excellent writer. Eli is sensational. Couldn't quit listening.

Other than the unconvincing ending, the book was quite good, and Gracie finally got some a share of the adventure! If there's one thing you can count on, Anne Perry always has some interesting development in her characters' personal lives, no matter what the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was great.

Like the nice but really boring guy next door. Likewise, I think Arquette underplayed her role in this to better match his.The real scientist this story is about was a much more interesting and passionate man, as I'm certain was his wife.

I hope that I will never ever ever see that movie again! All movies have their own trick and as it goes on, it gets worse. I think that showing that is wrong because it tries to make kids think that it's okay, but it's not. Most parents would let their kids watch it but not our family. I think that all of my friends families would not want them to watch that either.

It sounds like a defect to me.Also, changing channels on the TV tuner takes 2.5 seconds to go from channel 2 to channel 3. That makes surfing the channels impossible, and makes the need for storing your favorites necessary (but storing to memory doesn't work, so I am out of luck).Picture quality is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work!","review":"I purchased this product for my boyfriend for Christmas.

All I know is if the sound and picture is good and both are great on this t.v. for the price. I've had my set for only about a month and have not experienced any noise problems yet (got my fingers crossed). However, I did have to return the 1st set I purchased. After having it for only 5 days, it developed a line down the screen. Samsung customer service was very helpful, but I ended up taking it back to the store and exchanging it for another one.

While it's a wonderful tv if you can't hear the whistling coming from the it (which is why I gave this tv two stars instead of one), the whistling is enough to make me say it was DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE.It's fantastic to watch for the first 20 minutes to a half hour, but then the high-pitched whistling becomes unbearable until you shut the tv off. You can hear it from other rooms too, in my house anyway, so walking away won't help either.I'm grateful to others who have posted their problem on here because I will be calling Samsung as soon as I post this review to *hopefully* get it repaired free of charge because of the defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"loussy hissing","review":"My set has the hissing/buzzing problem.

Many of the other manufacturers that I compared before making this purchase had too much glare and washed out colors. Sound quality could be better, but I'm glad they put the focus on picture quality since you can always use external speakers. Lastly, the unit does give off moderate heat through the louvers at the top rear. If you are going to have this in a picture frame on a wall or a tight fitting entertainment center, I would do some additional research regarding required ventilation and temperature tolerances.

Until that point my fingers were crossed as everything else about the TV was great. Picture quality, the many features, and even the speakers were great. It is absolutely breathtaking with HD content. As soon as the audio cut out a few times, it was back to the store and not with another Samsung given their horrible record of customer service. It was still within my return period, so I didn't want to hesitate given the similar problems faced by so many others.If you have the patience to deal with Samsung or other places for repairs, then I would say keep it. I personally think that it is ridiculous to need to have a 14 day old, $1000 TV repaired. Too bad, because everything else about the set is great.

At the very least, it should have had some colorful photographs showing some of the beautiful sights and capturing some of the excitement of Miami Beach.

Each chapter is unrelated to the others. Badian is simply taking issues that he wants to clarify and works on them, with no regards to actual chronology. Greek themes (Alexander the Great) and Roman themes (Sulla) are intermixed. Therefore you pick and choose which chapter and when to read it. I bought it for the chapters on Greek history: Antiochos and Alexander the Great, and other Macedonian issues. Badian is one of these scholars that stresses the fact that the ancient Greeks did not accept the Macedonians as their kin, and he is correct on that in most respects, politically at least though not necessarily culturally (the religion, mythology and language tied the southern Greeks to the Macedonians as much as politics and different economic systems separated them).

It doesn't have cell phone electronics, so instead of holding it like a phone or trying to use it like a speakerphone, it takes a little practice to speak with it in a way that makes it work well (slowing down and giving it's little microphone a chance to send out a loud & clear signal).Our 3rd-grader loves it because he can check in as he roams around the neighborhood.

So, you have to remember to come back and remove them after a couple of hours.If anything the range is less than the cheap set we bought years ago at a sporting goods chain. That cheapie was rated for two miles and better in every way than this supposedly high-quality Motorola. We could leave those on all day without worrying about killing the battery.The cheapie had the clip built in.

I doubted a four hundred page book was necessary about the life of this opera singer, but by the time I finished the story, I wanted two hundred more pages of information. This book is well written, researched and informational. I thought I knew who Sibyl Sanderson was - a one operatic hit soprano (THIAS) who coasted through a singing career under the lustfilled eyes of composer Jules Massenet. How wrong I was! I couldn't put this book down once I got into the story. It's as much about the life of Massenet as it is Sanderson. The author captures the period perfectly. He takes you on Sibyl's path of self destruction to the point where you want to shout out \\"be careful!\\" Beautifully written. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad, don't finance this kind of cruelty.","review":"Cheap terrible and cruel video. I hastily ordered it thinking it was a wildlife video.

The key fact of understanding the relationship between the two systems, and thus who actually ended up on the Mission (versus staying the the Native villages) is missing from the book -- with the authors clearly showing their political correct bias. Read it for the data, not the conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a historical text","review":"I admit, that the authors show careful research and a good deal of work.

It is a beautiful book. At first glance, it's the book itself that catches your eye... illustrations and photography throughout give you glimpses into the real life voyage. They are artfully done and a joy to look at. But this is the ONE cruising book I have read that is actually beautifully written. Beth Leonard's descriptions of both the internal journey and the external scenery transcend the usual log book drivel that make up most cruising books out there. She is a truly talented writer and story teller. I lapped up each chapter and dog eared many beautiful passages worth saving and passing on to others. If you want to learn about sailing and how it can change your life, this is for you. But the beautiful writing, captivating story telling, and effective pictures make this a fabulous read for sailors and non-sailors alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Good Grass","review":"These guys sing and play some of the best bluegrass today.

All the shooting positions are covered in detail, tips on leading a target, effective cover, sight alignment-sight picture,breathing,clearing a malfunction, and more are covered in this video.

The \\"dim\\" setting is only marginally dimmer than the bright setting.My solution was to drape a small piece of loosely woven cloth over the face of the clock (like a cut out from a t-shirt).

No matter the time of day you can clearly see the time display. I'm not sure why some reviews state that the display is too bright in a dark room. I have mine set on low and it is not a problem. I've had to buy some rubber sticky pads to keep the clock from sliding when you touch the control buttons. The bottom of the clock tends to move easily when handling the clock. I've also noticed with some reviews that the clock does not stay in the desired viewing angle position. I'm referring to the adjustable viewing angle of the clock where it is adjustable from 0-90 degrees. Perhaps those people have a defective model. I've been able to adjust it to any angle and it stays in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best clock ever!","review":"This clock is just right for me.

The CTO 8500 is perfect for those dishes. I seldom use my conventional oven (the one that comes w/the stove), but instead use the CTO 8500, because it can handle both small and bigger jobs, from warming up bread at breakfast, to baking a coffee cake for mid afternoon, and a lasagna for dinner.

Don't forget Pearl Bailey who is very funny and of course the great Sammy Davis Jr. - he played that role with energy and talent. I am now 59 years old and I am still waiting. This movie is wonderful. Let's be fair to the public and release this movie.One of the best musicals ever released.

I was not disappointed. Mr. Jenkins creates a character of such faith, you will wish you knew her. Standing firm, she never wavers in any circumstance life throws at her. Just be sure you read this book with a box of kleenex at your side. You'll need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story of a female Job","review":"I read this book expecting to find Mr. Jenkins' superior fiction, but instead was disapointed. I found Elisabeth to be unlikeable and fake in spite of her inspiring aim to let her life be an example of obedience. Her trials and tribulations are so frequent that they cease to affect the reader's emotions at all and begin to bore. In the Left Behind series, Mr. Jenkins manages to instill the characters with hope and joy in spite of horrible times. In Though None Go With Me, Mr. Jenkins manages to make bitterness and depression the prevailing theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Years after reading, the book still moves me","review":"I read this book almost two years ago, but I still recall even the smallest of details. It's all about the glory of God, and His faithfulness, and the sweet heart of Elisabeth. I smiled, I laughed, I cried.. I sobbed. I began reading the book at night, and didn't go to sleep until 5 a.m. I just couldn't put it down. After, I finished it, I began loaning it to people. Within a week, three of my friends had read it.When I bought the book, I thought to myself, \\"can a male author effectivly write a book from a female's perspective?\\" I was a bit skeptical, but Jenkins dispells my doubt. His writing is amazing. I realted soo much to Elisabeth, and after reading it, I just wanted to live my life more and more for God.If you are slightly considering this book, buy it!! It is well, well worth it. It is definitely my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving!","review":"Shame on anyone who walked away from this book unchanged! I found myself crying and laughing out loud. It made me and still makes me press on toward the goal of the upward call in Christ Jesus! Every christian woman with prodigal children and tragedy should read this book. The point (which obviously some of the readers giving it less than 4 stars missed) is that even if you must walk with Jesus seemingly alone for what ever reason, you must continue to walk with Him trusting Him and clinging to Him. Our reward is not here its in Heaven. My grandfather died (when i was 4) before he saw anyone in his family saved and 19 years later the first (me) was saved. Imagine if he would have thrown in the towel. His motto and mine is \\"Though None Go With Me Yet I WILL Follow\\". Thank you Mr. Jenkins for writing this heartfelt life changing (for me anyway) novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic","review":"The Christian life is not necessarily the \\"easy\\" life. The main character's faith in God is strengthened through trials. What trial is too great if it brings you closer to God and conforms you into the image of Jesus Christ?

Elizabeth seems too good to be true. Her life, from a child to adult is filled with problems none of us would ever experience. Her dedication to the Lord is amazing and leads her to do things to \\"walk the walk\\". Sometimes she seems almost \\"holier than thou\\" but it is refreshing to read about someone keeping their commitments and promises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Read","review":"Unfortunately, I did not find this book inspiring or entertaining as others have. I loved the Left Behind series and was excited to read another book by this author. Very disappointed. The character development was fine but the reading at times was tedious due to lack of chapter breaks and the never ending tragedy without a balance of peace. A lifetime of tradegy was the theme of the book. I felt that some of the assumptions were not theologically accurate. The ending did not seem plausible and did not redeem the storyline. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing.","review":"As an avid reader of Christian books, I thought this book would be inspirational. It turned out to be one of the most depressing books I've ever read. The heroine of the story turns out to be far more loving and faithful than God is! Though God is faithless throughout the story, she remains faithful! A bit of a turn-around on scripture, I'd say! Readers, if you want to read some wonderful inspirational sagas about God's faithfulness during hard times, read Francine Rivers' writings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Inspirational","review":"This book has been an inspiration to me and my walk with Christ. It has inspired me to want to dig deeper in the Bible and to want to get to know Him so much more. Elisabeth demonstrates how we are to depend upon God in all our struggles. Yes, at times she didn't, but she always looked to Him to see what He was teaching her through every trial in her life. He is our strong-hold and she had to depend on Him and trust Him. Her commitment was just amazing and we should all strive to be molded like Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though None Go With Me","review":"This is quite possible THE best book I have ever read. I chose to read this book because I enjoy the Left Behind series which Jerry Jenkins co-authors. Dare I say I like it better than Left Behind?

This book opened up our minds and caused us to think in new directions. One of Sweet's pleas is for Christians to get De-churched. To get outside our normal view and begin to evaluate why we do what we do. The culture today thinks that the church is an unloving, boycotting machine that is out to destroy their way of life. If we are so arrogant to think that we can fit them into the box that we have labeled \\"church\\", then we will be swept away by the coming tsunami. I highly recommend this book for anyone in ministry because it acts as such a mind trigger, stimulating your thoughts and ideas and forcing you to be creative about your plans from ministry in the next century. Postmodernism may be a somewhat new concept for many of you in ministry, but it's time to learn.

Every page has every item labeled in a variety of situations and places: home, the kitchen, the living room, the laundry room, school, the grocery store, an ice cream parlor, and so forth. It also introduces the basic parts of the body, color theory and counting.Richard Scarry's books often times contain a running gag of some sort. In Cars and Trucks and Things That Go, readers are asked to find Gold Bug on every page. In this book, readers can follow Mr. Fumble as he tries to catch his windblown hat.The question of where's Mr. Fumble's hat and the often times surreal things depicted and labeled are what make these books so much fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big book!","review":"This is a LARGE book, like 12 x 14 inches.

I'm sure that it would seem rather acerbic to those who control the discourse on culture and identity but every once in a while a book comes along and gives voice to the perspective of the \\"other.\\" Those of us who have seen their karma, their food, their noserings, their clothes and their cultural, religious and national symbols reinvented, recycled and resignified will appreciate this book as an attempt to point out the folly of such doings. For westerners, this is like looking in a mirror that does not lie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like, wow, man!","review":"I really loved this book. Sick of the psychobabble approach to the search for meaning indulged in by western hippies and dilettantes? Then this is the book for you. If you remain sceptically detached, then Mehta's bull's-excrement detector will appeal to you. In a world where 'altenatives' are equally as brand-labelled as major corporate product, Mehta turns the heat on the dipsomaniacs and freaks who are so successfully sucked in by the tricksters and con merchants in the great supermarket of 'religious experiences' that India (her country) offers.The book is witty and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, as well as a cautionary tale for those who might be flirting with the cults (who probably wouldn't listen anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Ms. Mehta is undoubtedly the best Indian author alive!I dothink the person who wrote the two sentence review probably does not know the meaning of 'trash'. 'Trash' is the heaps and heaps of books that get published every year in the US and somehow make it to the NY Times best seller list just beacuse Oprah thinks it is a good book or because it can be made into a tv movie.This book is a classic. Her use of the language is extra-ordinary. She touches on the most 'Indian' of values with a great sense of humor and almost trivialises them. She makes you really think about issues that matter and drove(still drive) thousands of Westerners to India. She has also done a great job of contrasting the Eastern and Western view of life, death and everything spiritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"spirituality for the modern consumer","review":"There's a great abundance and variety of spirituality or holistic health in India. Each permutation requires at least one guru. Karma Cola takes you on a tour of this.Why are so many westerners so eager for some doses of Eastern philosophy? Probably because they already know how disappointed they are with western religions. It helps that Christianity, a strange middle eastern religion, wiped out so many strains of western philosophy.Why did this happen in the 1960s? The young adults of the 1960s were a new type of american. The first generation born and raised as \\"Consumers\\". Trained from an early age to want to drive cars, be cowboys or soldiers, and watch a lot of television shows about cowboys, soldiers, and super heroes.India became a new frontier. There were no cowboys or jet fighter pilots or machine gunning positions open. But it was a good place to go to be surrounded by new ideas and monstrous poverty. You could be some kind of wizard or sage in India."},{"rating":"2","title":"KARMA COLA IS AN AMAZINGLY WELL WRITTEN BOOK","review":"Gita Mehta has a real knack for using an economy of words.

This is an excellent book - you should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Light Hearted and Quirky Look at Mankind's Search for Enlightenment","review":"The is an entertaining tongue -in-cheek look at the spiritual tourism business in India. The people in the book come from all walks of life and from a myriad of western countries but they all share the desire to transcend their mundane existence and hope that Indian mysticism will provide them the vehicle to do it. As one would imagine as long as the money is flowing there is an endless supply of Indian \\"holy men\\" and gurus willing to provide this enlightenment and hilarity ensure. These stories are both entertaining and a little sad and leave the reader wondering who is the exploited and who is doing the exploiting.

In fact it is often spiritual Westerners who meet Indian materialists, who make fun and take advantage of them! Too many in the West think of India as if it were still living in the times of the Veda, which it most certainy is not!On p. 101 she sums it up well: \\"for us [in India] eternal life is death ... no more being born again to endure life again to die again. Yet people come in ever-increasing numbers to India to be born again with the conviction that it their rebirth they will learn to live.\\"Easy travel and cheap communication is perhaps making East and West switch their roles in our global minds?

I was looking for an intense workout with basic, tough exercises without all the outdated music and staged performances. That it is, but it is important to know that there are segments of dips, chin-ups and pull-ups that you cannot do unless you have the bars. Also, these take up lots of time because you're waiting for all the guys to do their reps, one person at a time. Unless you have the equipment, you're just standing there wondering what to do. Also, there is too much time between each set of exercises and my heart rate would fall too much. Not a steady workout at all.

The story Briar Rose combines the fairy tale sleeping beauty with the worrifying story of the Holocaust. The grandmother in the story (Gemma), tells the story of sleeping beauty to her three grandchildren named Sylvia, Shanna, and Becca. When Gemma dies, Becca, youngest of the three, promises to her grandmother before she died that she would look for the sleeping beauty. Not really sure what her grandmother meant on her death bed, Becca goes in search of her grandmothers death in a camp in Poland. There Becca finds a man named Josef who tells Becca the story of her grandmothers trials and tribulations as a jewish person living back during the Holocaust. Becca realizes her roots and just what Gemma went through before she died. The author Jane Yolen did a great job twinning together such opposites.

The story have become more interesting from chapter 9 and on, but the chapters before that seems like it would take forever to read through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislike","review":"I thought that Briar Rose was a semi-fair book. What made the book interesting to me was, the book was very similar to the children's story Sleeping Beauty. I also liked how every odd chapter would reminisce to when Becca and her sisters were little girls and their grnadmother would tell them the story of Briar Rose. In my opinion, the book began to drag in the middle. I lost interest in the book from chapters 18-22. When I first began the book, I would have recommended it to others. Since I have now finished the book, i don't think I would recommend it. The tone was very dull, sad, and dreary. It remained that way throughout the rest of the book. This caused the book to ge very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing novel!!","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites!! An absolutely heart-wrenching (at times) but wonderful story!!

It's a very moving tale and one that is wonderfully told.I would suggest this to parents looking to spark an interest in reading in their kids.

It was an interesting story of a girl named Rebecca Berlin and her \\"Gemma.\\" Her Gemma had told the story of Briar Rose many times, to her and her two older sisters. They all enjoyed the story but it seems to be that Rebecca enjoyed it the most. The reason I say this is because she is the one who stayed with her Gemma till the end.

To me it is just plain boring. First I thought the book was going to be allright because of the review on the back of the book but after a while I just just got bored of it. I know most people probably won't agree with me but to me it's true. The reason why the book \\"briar Rose\\" is because of such the big words she used in the book where if you want to know what it means you have to look the word up in the dictionary.

The story was very interesting and I had a hard time putting the book down, wanting to figure out Gemma's secrets. However, the style of writing wasn't very good - she tried too hard at being an adult writer and it wasn't a very good attempt. The sentences were choppy and her descriptions were not very descriptive. I totally liked the comparison between Sleeping Beauty and the Holocaust. But the coincedences weren't very good - Becca \\"just happened\\" to run into the guy who saved Gemma's life; she \\"just happened\\" to meet the guy who was in the picture with Gemma.

When I started reading it, I thought the first few chapters were boring, but when it got to the part where the main character, Becca, have gotten to the place her grandmother's track seem to lay, the book became a page turner.

Just another extrapolation on the atrocities of man. When you see the book, it does look very nice, short and sweet, with a fanciful cover and a fanciful name. I would also decribe the story as fanciful, too; something contrived to make use of the Holocost. It's like a bad Titanic novel spin off. Not as bad though. It was laborious getting through the book, but luckily due to it's fanciful lengh (200+ pages), it was over soon. Add to that a few fanciful touches of political correctness and you get a nice, fanciful take on the Holocost.

I found it at reduced price marked House / Garage in the Electronica section and thought I was getting a bargain. But its not house or garage either or any form of electronica for that matter. Its some sort of Brazilian carnival music, and not very good Brazilian carnival music at that. Call it bossa nova for want of a better name but don't expect it to be of the quality of people who actually specialize in bossa nova. This CD is really really bad. The fact that it was at reduced price should have given me a clue. Its the one CD I regret buying.

Sebald is quite possibly the most significant German writer today. At least this is so for the English-speaking world. Because his novels travel well, they work well in English, and his authorial mode works well in the context of English and American literature.

He will, I think, go far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Sebald but skip this one!","review":"I read this right after a great time reading RINGS OF SATURN. Before that I got AUSTERLITZ from the library and loved it.So this one was a major disappointment coming after his other two.The only thing that saved it from an F or D grade(one star) was his chapter at the beginning on Stendahl(spelling?) who was really named something like Byre...French, experiences with women and Napoleon. I had read THE RED AND THE BLACK(Al Gore's favorite book)and found that book interesting but not enjoyable.Anyway,VERTIGO just never got through to me after the first chapter.

It took me several days to read the first hundred pages but after that I read the rest of the book in two days. This is a nice departure from the Spenser novels, with none of the characters seeming like the Spenser characters, so it has a flavor all its own.In his dedecation Parker says this story is about fathers and sons and while this is true it is about so much more.

Parker is very different than his Spenser, Jesse Stone, and Sunny Randall novels. Those tend to be shorter, wittier, high-action mysteries, while this one focuses more on characters and relationships. For me, the plot and the characters were interesting enough to keep me reading, and by the second half, I was completely hooked and found myself unable to put the book down. I did find the dialog pretty forced and unnatural at times, and the characters' personalities and histories felt a bit cookie-cutter, but I enjoyed it in spite of these criticisms."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Had To Give Up On This Book And Made It Part Of All My Yesterdays!","review":"I usually like Parker's books,and particularly when he deviates from his Spenser books.

What multi-function digital watch doesn't have a countdown timer? It's what I use frequently to see when I need to go back to put quarters in the meter, to take a 15 minute nap, or to check on the roast.Con: button placement is awkward. For a right hander, the upper right button should be where your index finger naturally falls, when you have your thumb resting on the lower left button for switching modes.However, upper right button is just a cosmetic protrusion for aesthetics, and you're supposed to use the bottom right with your index finger for most \\"setting\\" functions.

Having all of these features displayed at once (24 hour, 12 hour, day, date and second hand) is just very convenient. I liked it so much that I bought another in case something happens to my first.

My previous one had the strap break after 3 years of abuse in nursing.

Based upon the content of this book, published by the Regnery Ministry of Information, it is clear to any objective American that Ann Coulter belongs in a psychiatric ward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coulter Vs. the Left","review":"It is interesting to read the bad reviews of Ann's books. They all have one thing in common: they say the book is full of lies, yet they do not expose a single one!And I have one advice: read the book and see who is telling the truth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right","review":"Ms Coulter is a credit to the conservative right. Those subscribing to the conservative right must certainly embrace this work and this author. After all, she employs the same logic as those who fill the ranks of this ideology: Promote belief over facts and empirical evidence, and engage in non-stop rhetoric so that listening is ultimately impossible. As a person who leans to the left, I am so very happy that this author is embraced by the right. I must admit that I read only the first 100 pages of this book--my stomach could not possibly tolerate any more. I am anxiously awaiting winter to see if I can find an acceptable use for this book--I hope my fireplace can digest the pages better than I could. Thus, if one has money to \\"burn\\" I strongly suggest this book for cold winter nights with the lights out."},{"rating":"1","title":"did you see her on the Today show talking about this book?","review":"I don't even need to read this book because, in a 5 minute interview, Katie Couric pointed out 4 or 5 blatant lies. Ann Coulter became very defensive and was clearly embarrassed. Why would someone write a book knowing that it's contents are false?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, not facts","review":"If you are a conservative, then you will love this book. No, not because it proves why conservatism is better than liberalism through factual evidence and debate-lik nature, but because her outrageous lies will only support your already built-in bias against liberals.Btw: Liberal - favoring progress and reform in social institutions and fullest practicable liberty of individual action.Do you see anything wrong with that? I dont, but conservatives use this term as if it's meant to diss someone.So if you would like to reinforce your bias with more conservative lies and distortion of truth, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Coulter is demonstrably insane","review":"This book is riddled with inaccuracies, faulty logic and poorly researched \\"facts\\". For instance, she claims that \\"Newsweek\\" magazine's Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas \\"is the son of Norman Thomas, a four-time Socialist candidate for president. Had the author done a reasonable amount of research she would have discovered that Norman Thomas actually ran six times. Not to mention the fact that he is NOT the father of Evan Thomas. This book, like her other works are brimming with this kind of crud punctuated by her characteristic vitriol. It represents the worst kind of journalism and ranks right up there with various books concerning UFO's, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster (i.e., bunk from cover to cover), but without the entertainment value. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough documentation to take the left to court","review":"Everything she writes appears to be backed up with a reference. Go to the back and see the impressive 36 pages of notes. She makes the same points repeatedly. But each time with different characters involved. It might seem like she's beating a dead horse with regard to a given point that is being made, but Ann Coulter is doing this because like a thorough lawyer she's trying to identify every last guilty liberal out there. That has to be kept in mind when you are reading otherwise the scope of the book might appear to be too narrow relative to the size of the research and writing effort involved.If anyone tells you that the media does not have left wing/liberal bias just read one or two pages from this book and you will have proved to them how wrong they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"...from a republican","review":"Probably one of the sloppiest and most unintelligent books I have ever read...if you're looking for a laugh (not with her but at her), then pick this one up. This book was enough to make me ashamed of my own party."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Surprises","review":"This is a typical book of its sort...in other words, if you're a conservative reading it, you'll love it. If you're a liberal reading it, you'll hate it. Ms. Coulter decides to eschew any sort of reasonable even-handedness, and resorts to right-wing demagoguery throughout the book. It reads like a slightly less dopey version of Rush Limbaugh, and makes you wonder if anyone is interested in examining both sides of an issue anymore. Oh, wait, the liberal side is argued EVERYWHERE ELSE, so we need books like these. Sorry. Forgot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm......Sophistry.","review":"This is a set of pre-fabricated thoughts for people who believe that spouting this stuff makes them look intelligent. The ironic thing is that *they* are the ones most likely to lose jobs, money, and security because of this kind of book...what *else* is the reason for such propaganda? It makes those most likely to be hurt by the positions accept (even support) the very arguments that they wouldn't consent to if they really understood what was being said."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not good enough to serve as a coaster","review":"\\"The real value of Slander . . . is not in the jokes or devastating exposés of liberal politicians and their allies, but the serious and scholarly study of just how entrenched the media prejudice is against anyone whose politics are even faintly conservative.\\"-New York SunThe above quote has to be a joke. It has to be, because it's absolutely a lie. So is most of the book. I didn't see one single fact in this book. It was all lies. Ann Coulter is a liar, and judging from this book, may well be mentally ill. She manipulates her audience and obviously thinks her readers are stupid. The \\"facts\\" she uses are misquotes at the very least. Her \\"research\\" is lazy, if you want to be kind, or downright malicious if you want to be honest. I will never read another word she says. It's frightening that anyone would read what she has to say and believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slanderer writing about slanderers?","review":"For people like Ann Coulter who claim that liberals are somehow more harmful to America than even Al Quaeda, she sure knows how to make a big disgrace of herself and her attempts to write about \\"Slander\\" are nothing more than trying to slander people she personally hates only to backfire and contradict the very title she's against.

Miss Coulter's arguements number one don't add up and number two turn into rants of anti-liberal propaganda. In giving many examples she forgets to show the Republican side that is sometime just as bad as Democrats. While neither side of the political parties is right or wrong her agruements that Democrats are always wrong are just plain nuts...."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this twit get a book deal?","review":"This is a great example of having a conclusion and trying to find anecdotes to support it. If you already agree with her premise, then you'll find quite a few things to shout \\"amen\\" about.Write style is reminiscent of early \\"Weekly Reader\\", appropriate for the target audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A heap of trite nonesense","review":"Her epigrammatically styled rambling might be compared to the great American thinker/writer, Emerson, minus his genius, scope, voice, logic, style and depth. However, it seems apparent that she wrote this dribble for the marginally intelligent portion of this country (You know who you are... the quite ones in the corner, not asking the questions but relying on \\"faith\\" and flags). Her brand of patriotism sounds like a lot of circumscription to me, or the death-throws of the notion of white male superiority (as ordained by God and scripture), or knee-jerk, reactionary thinkers who would rather lob bombs than drop their jingoist stances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be in the Fiction section","review":"Highly unbiased, poorly researched, right-wing fiction.

What a long way we have come since then, when people like her would have been routinely committed to the nearest psychiatric facility!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I don't fit a potitical classification ... but this is just plain drivel. Convoluted, mean, bizarre thinking. I worry about our country after reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare us","review":"Hey lady, instead of wasting your time attacking Liberals, (because that's all you seem to know how to do) why don't you tell me something good that you so called \\"conservatives\\" are doing for our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Belief","review":"Ann Coulter's book \\"Slander\\"is just about the worst written diatribe I have ever seen. It's a wonder even the most conservative of publishing companies gave it a second look. The book is filled with hypocrisy and a writing style incongruent with that of a 12 year old. I have to question the intelligence of any person who takes this woman seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's being the hater based on thoughts now","review":"Coulter criticizes liberals for hating america, and for being based on lies -- but that seems to be all this book is about. Talk about exploiting the facts and making up some to show hatered again a large part of America. And who hates America -- those who fight for the benefit of it's people and the rights intrisic to that (aka liberals) or those warmongerers who just want to kill anyone who looks or thinks differently than they do(Ann Coulter). I happen to be extremely offended by this book based on the fact that it was full of lies -- and no, liberals don't hate america, they don't hate conservatives, they just happen to voice their opinion on policies that they oppose. But according to Ann Coulter the correct thing to do is shut up and go along with whatever the government says. Blind Patriots. Talk about Nazi-ism!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slander - An Eye Opener","review":"It was with great joy that I read Slander. Ann Coulter has nicely shown how the left wing media distorts and slants stories making a mockery of their profession and personal integrity. The left wing media slanting and stress on so called Republican gaffs while not giving the same visibility to leftist miscues is very obvious.Her writings reflects what I always suspected but not having Ann Coulters command of the English language could never express myself in her terms. Ann Coulter has made me a believer. I am a very pro Ann Coulter fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book by a bad person","review":"I try to keep an open mind. I'll admit that I got this book from the library as I was pretty sure I wasn't going to want to keep it. Boy, was I right. Coulter seems to want to do nothing but take the standard hate-mongering of people like Limbaugh and Hannity and break through the glass ceiling so she can share their space as one of the few (if only) women spreading hatred at the same rate and degree. I'm not going to waste my time citing specifics, as I should in a review, but the entire book is nothing but a hate-filled piece of junk, plain and simple. If you're a hate-filled person who wants to read something that'll make you feel better about your hatred of others, then read this book. Otherwise, don't waste your time (as I unfortunately did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid Hogwash","review":"Worse than a female Rush Limbaugh, more vicious than a cornered rat, not powerful at all, Ms. Coulter seems to be little more than a bandwagon jumper who will find shortly that the bandwagon now is horseless. The premise of the book got my attention and got me to read it. However, lest there be any confusion, the title of the book is not reflective of the contents which are little more than the collective ramblings of a pre-modern maniac depressive. There is some clarity to her thought process in stark contrast to the drug induced largely incoherent ramblings of Mt. Limbaugh. Bottom line - read the book if you want to try to comprehend the otherise incomprehenisble but try to borrow it so Ms. Coulter is not financially rewarded for her bigotry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased? I think so","review":"Let me flat out say that I am a liberal and a Democrat. I decided to read this book to learn about the conservative side of the story. From page one, I lost my temper. Everything she said stretched the truth and used illogical statements to get to the conclusion that it is the liberals fault for everything wrong in America. This is the same lady who said that liberals are the only ones to call other people names and be negative. This is the same lady who defends George W. Bush's intelligence. For any conservative, go ahead and read this slander (because that is what the book is) because you will enjoy it. Any liberal who wishes to learn a true represenation of the right wing would want to try another book. I suggest \\"Bias\\" by Bernard Goldberg, which though is biased as well, does a much better job than Ann Coulter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for laughs!","review":"I had a great time reading through this - er - slander. It's particularly effective as a comic relief in these days when people like Coulter actually hold power. In fact, I've read excerpts from this book at a party to everyone's delight. One star taken off since some good old boys (and girls) seem to mistake it for their Bible. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fact Checking","review":"This book certainly has an emotional appeal. By comparing people with liberal ideology to terrorists Ann appeals to her base of support. It is full of inflammatory remarks that might insight rage in you, if you are already very conservative.The problem is, a lot of the book isn't true. I'm not sure why she did so little fact checking, but it makes the book nothing more than a propaganda piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coulter is spot on !","review":"Let's face it. If your not of a conservative mind set you probably won't like this book. I'm a conservative. And I LOVED this book. Coulter's style is enormously entertaining AND illuminating. After your finished with this book go out and get Treason - also a great book. I just love her bare fisted take no prisoners approach. No milquetoast she!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Malicious.","review":"I've in the past donated a lot of books to the Library. However this piece of trash will get donated to the incinerator. This right wing egotist doesn't know the first thing about writing a book. The title of this book should pertain to her and only her. The reason is simple. If you ever saw her on tv or on radio talk shows being interviewed by one-sided hosts, she finds fault with then slanders everything about whatever topic discuss. Senator Joe McCarthy would loved to come up from the grave and give her a swift kick in the A$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann is right on","review":"The book was accurate and that is why the losing liberals hate it. The can call anyone anything but when the facts are represented they get childish and personal such as Al Franken's \\"Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot, \\" and George Clooneys remarks about Charlton Heston's tragic disease. The Libs call names but it is ignored by the media. This book calls them out on such infantilism."},{"rating":"1","title":"The literary equivalent of \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\"","review":"Ann Coulter is a joke as a journalist and commentator. This book is even worse than her last. I don't know why I keep reading her silly books -- I guess I keep expecting something, ANYTHING, of value, and I haven't found it in any of her books yet. She appears to be completely clueless on TV and her books make her look even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best Jingoist Nazi Blonde Bombshell rhetoric ever","review":"Wow. How frightening. Ann sometimes hints that it isn't necessarily liberals she hates, it's anyone who doesn't fit her description of a perfect American. The perfect American, according to Ann, is a 200+ pound salt of the earth good ol' boy with a handlebar moustache and a Nascar sticker on his pickup truck...and an unfathomable hatred of anything that isn't christian, conservative, or American.Frau Coulter also said us Canadians should be thankful the US \\"allows\\" us to be neighbors. And apparently the only places in Canada she cares for are provinces like Alberta which are well known for, you guessed it, xenophobic blue collar guys with handle bar moustaches and wannabe cowboys. How suprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny","review":"This is mean to be entirly irony and satire right? I mean she can't seriously mean most of the things she says.... right? And shouldn't the Book be Libel since she review mostly written and broadcast work (having it captioned and then broadcast fits the description of libelious) I found it a fun read and a boost to my ego since I'm a poor student and knowing someone who can get by so well with such.... well C grade work makes me feel secure about my own future.Just to make sure you understand, this was read as a book satire, I mean no sane person can read it, look at the facts and sources cited (which btw sometimes proves the counterpoint) and mean it.I recommend you pick up the book if only to mock her at the water-cooler with other adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money and time","review":"Coulter should be paying folks to read this \\"thing.\\" I don't think it deserves to be called a book.

There are some serious conservative writers/commentators; I may disagree with them, but they are worth reading (e.g. William Buckley, William Safire, George Will, etc.), because I may learn something from them.However, there is nothing to learn here, other than, perhaps, the depths of dishonesty of some prominent right wingers, particularly the hateful Ann H. Coulter. What a crackpot she is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Hurts!!","review":"SLANDER is long overdue! To those who don't like Coulter's book, I suggest you can't handle the truth. That the media is biased to the left is a proven fact. That FoxNews and the internet have done wonders to reveal that bias is also a proven fact.

She has issues, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Coulter: Nutcase","review":"Instead of taking the time to research FACTS about \\"liberal\\" lies, Coulter rants and raves like a lunatic, claiming how stupid liberals are.

Ann Coulter gets all this attention because she's a (somewhat) attractive blonde, and not because she's saying anything that makes sense or rings with the smallest semblance of truth or reality.

The main stream media (perhaps excepting Fox) sidestep these issues and news anchors simply villify those who don't conform to their ideas of political correctness.Let's put Hillary Clinton toe to toe with Ann Coulter and let them debate.

Ann knows NOTHING about the average hard-working American and her trying to identify with us was just one big JOKE! (So was this entire book by the way.) All of us average hard-working Americans need to save our money right now, not to line Ann's pockets with our hard-earned cash. Don't buy it--Ann will pop up on TV soon and you can get her \\"message\\" for free. No great revelations (duh, the media is biased about a million things--and they're not liberal anymore anyway.

Coulter's book is WAY over the top, but evidently is finding lots of fans. Sad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring conservative whining","review":"This is a very biased book. For example, she complains about liberal enemies being 'mocked by the liberal media' for their appearance (such as Katherine Harris, Linda Tripp). Fair enough, but doesn't she remember all the remarks about Janet Reno's looks? Even Chelsea Clinton was insulted for her looks.I have no respect for Coulter, she is an extremist. By the way, I'm a moderate but the more I hear about conservatives claiming to know 'the light' I feel more and more that conservatives are morons."},{"rating":"1","title":"April Declared, \\"Clinton Free Month\\" by NAB","review":"Right-wing commentators are being asked during the month of April to go five minutes or more without mentioning Bill Clinton in their \\"Clinton Free Month\\". Said one NAB fficial, \\"Clinton left office three years ago, yet pundits like Hannity, Limbaugh, and Coulter can't go more than five minutes without mentioning his name. It seems a sort of psychological malady. We are doing this for them, to try to ween them off their weird Clinton obsession in the hopes the national dialogue improves a little.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberals need to quit bashing this book...","review":"Ann does come off a little terse, but this is nothing different then what conservative bashers have been doing for years. I don't think Ann is going to make any friends out of Liberals with this book, but it is a good read. One review mentioned that it is Liberals that have made all the great things in this country. I have to say \\"Wake Up\\". Take everyones money and let the govt decide how to spend it. Why not let the people who work for their money keep more of it and let them/us decide what to do with it. The govts. job is not to run our lives and give us what they (govt) think we (the people) need."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Whack!) Is this horse (Whack!) really dead (Whack!) yet?","review":"Coulter's point, exhaustively footnoted and unimaginatively presented, is that conservatives are good and liberals are bad. What would have been more interesting as a 750-word essay was inflated into a 205-page book with 35 pages of footnotes. After 4 pages, you get the point.But her sarcastic speaking style, which plays well on CNN's Crossfire, doesn't quite make the trip in prose. Save yourself some money -- read the liner notes on Amazon.com or at your local bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read of 2002!","review":"Great book! Well written and funny too. Liberals will not enjoyed being uncovered for what they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrite","review":"I tried to be fair and bought this book along with one of Al Franken's. I started to try and read this one but couldn't finish after reading contradiction after contradiction.How can she say that liberals are mean and call everyone who doesn't agree with them names when she does the same thing? She also uses inaccurate generalizations. I'm not particularly political on one side or the other, but Ms. Coutler seems to fling the kind of hate she says liberals use in this hate-fest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"People rant about how funny and clever Ann is, so I decided to be fair ( and balanced) check out one of her books.She's not terribly funny ( she says things for shock value, but after awhile you get kind of numb to that and hope for actual humor, rather then name calling and wishing people dead), she does every mean evil thing she accuses liberals of doing (maybe it's meant to be irony? Is that the funny part?), the wtiting is sloppy and weak on actual facts and researchThere are lots of people out there I don't find funny and/or agree with what they say, but if they have one, I'll cut them slack for not having the other.Ann can't seem to pull off either, so I'm just left scratching my head trying to figure out what the big deal is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fighting Fire With Fire","review":"I have enjoyed Ann Coulter as a commentator on television. For this reason I was disappointed in SLANDER. She reminded me of some of the liberal attack dogs many of us have learned to discount. The author could have done a better job of exposing the liberal media without indulging in so many of her own personal attacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Factual...the liberal media is outed as liars!","review":"She names names. She provides the documentation to support your suspicion. The liberal press is paranoid. They neurotically target Republicans with dull but Orwellian repetition. \\"Stupid\\", \\"mean\\" or \\"scarily weird\\" are the insults the mainstream press repeatedly uses against Republicans from Coolidge through George W. Bush. Liberals, including the one who fantasized about creating the Internet and thought he was the inspiration for \\"Love Story\\", are called \\"almost too smart\\" or \\"cerebral\\". The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Kansas City Star, NBC, ABC, CBS...and more..all guilty as charged. This book is your resource. I couldn't put it down!If you have felt targeted by the media for being a member of the dreaded \\"religious right\\" you will especially enjoy this book. It's time for the media to stop lying about Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reality based","review":"I read this book and it's not clear what the point of it is. It's not reality-based and I'm sorry I can't recommend it. The Constitution is what makes America great and no Ann Coulter, neither you nor your 'followers' can destroy it. If you try to destroy the Constitution, people will fight you. How do you think you can make a fascist regime or a Theocracy out of this great nation?

There, I said it. But I feel compelled to point out that during an appearance on MSNBC, Ms. Coulter had the nerve to blame an injured Vietnam vet (in a wheelchair, no less) that \\"people like [him]\\" are the reason the U.S. lost the Vietnam War.Like I said, I did not read this book. But anyone who takes her venomous hate-mongering to heart should know what kind of a person she really is.I guess I could be considered liberal, but I do acknowledge the existence of intelligent, thoughtful and empathetic conservatives. She ain't one of them, but she's really doing a disservice to those conservatives who actually have sound principles and IQs of more than 15.Why has this country become so polarized? Ask Ms. Coulter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"What do pundits even exsist for? What is their purpose? How does this help anybody?All \\"political\\" boundries aside, this book is a pile of trash. Simple fact checking shows the numerous lies this book is built on. The real question here is, who exactly is she trying to convince? Based on the tone, it most certainly isn't \\"liberals.\\"This book is preaching to the choir in it's worst form. Unengaging prose, nonsensical distorted \\"facts,\\" and an overall grating tone make this book get zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I'd like this book better","review":"I found this book hard to read, as Ann Coulter is so angry that she isn't clear-sighted. Each time I read a few pages I put the book down, as her ire and hateful tone are hard to take in big doses. She makes some good points, but I can't stand the attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a book on liberals that's honest and true","review":"Ann Coulter's new book \\"Slander\\" is totally accurate (check out the plethera of endnotes), honest, and an entertaining read. Finally someone wrote a book that has documented the left's lies point by point. I noticed that there were several 1-star ratings for this book. That's interesting, seeing that it has shot up to Amazon's #1 book. It seems that you ... liberals are complaining to yourselves....everyone else is too busy reading this page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Liberal philosophy= \\"NO ENEMIES ON THE LEFT\\"","review":"Hopefully Ann Coulter will help to lift the scales from many eyes so that those who are blinded by the mainstream medias bias will discover that the liberals philosophy and way of life: \\"NO ENEMIES ON THE LEFT\\" is self destructing----AMERICA WAKE-UP! indeed----the good news is---after the 911 attacks the terrorists HAVE awoken a sleeping giant-------Americans who never got involved and felt it best to keep mum have come out of the closet and are now speaking up------this means hope for a brighter tomorrow for all of us----... you will discover we are NOT alone---for so long mainstream media has convinced us that those of us with traditional values were dinosaurs on the verge of extinction-----Friends----the reverse is true-----MOST Americans STILL believe in whats right--Ann is a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Much True","review":"You'll not knock this off the hot sheet by rating it low.

You can't attack facts or ideas so you just sling the slime and insults and shout down and filibuster any who disagree. Shows the moral bankruptcy of the left.We need more like Ann to show the slanting of media."},{"rating":"1","title":"A conservative who doesn't like the book","review":"For those who say this book should be \\"banned\\" it shows why the book should be published. It should be allowed to stand on it's own merit. To disagree with it is fine, remember part of Ann's job here was to sell books.As a conservative, you'd think I'd jump all over this book. My problem is the presentation style. Coulter jumps all over the place quickly moving from point to point. Reading the book, I felt like I was listening to a ticked off writer who needed somewhere to vent. Passion is one thing, obsession is another.Coulter could have done a much better job of discussing her points. Instead, she stoops to the same old name calling that seems to be so popular in politics now. It sure sells books, but doesn't win points from me. (And yes, the same goes for Franken)."},{"rating":"1","title":"how did she break out of the asylum?","review":"Ann Coulter is scary. She is obviously psychotic.

Complete rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lordy! I just figured out she's serious!","review":"Omigod, I've been friends with liberals for years and never knew how awful they were.

I'm considered to be pretty conservative in my mid-sized Okalhoma town, but I'm not going to have someone lead me to the water and then push my head in.This book is better when you take one thing into consideration; it is little more than Anne's personal opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"The only way to not see all the inaccuracies in this book is to not want to see them.Coulter constantly twists the truth(and often tells flat out lies) to try and get her (flawed) point across.She gives conservatives a bad name.Read this book if you want a good laugh, but for God's sake, don't buy the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try Ann ! You keep spewing that garbage !!!!","review":"If you have read any political books in your life and I personally try to keep my choice selection varied, you would already know the gory and hugely hypocritical lies this lady spews forth for the right. There are countless books out there that factually describe every single aspect of her talking points and discredits nearly every one of them ! Better yet, before you are duped for an idiot by believing this book, first do your research on this woman, like most right wing propaganda puppets, she lives most of her life in utter hypocrisy from the statements she makes !!! Please don't be duped !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave Your Brain at the Door and Call in the Hate!","review":"Ann is obviously dogmatic in her views. She is intent on trashing the liberal threat in every aspect of American life. However, she does this by making some unsubstantiated claims and unfortunate leaps in logic. The gaps in her book become evident in her apparent fear of liberals corrupting the country. She sees phantom liberals hiding in every corner, burning flags on every street, and plotting to resurrect Trotsky in a moments notice. She obviously feels very strongly about her view, and she brings up some good points and issues that need to be discussed, but she reaches conclusions that she doesn't support very well. If you want a book to get you fired up, read it. But it's really just the conservative \\"Stupid White Men\\" by Michael Moore. Both are good political candy in their own ways, but neither makes any lasting impression on the discerning reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb and Intelligent","review":"Also wonderfully sarcastic, bitingly funny, resourceful, exhaustingly researched, so smart, such fast-reading. Ann Coulter is fantastic, and her critics cannot argue with her on the merits, because they would never win, so they end up, as usual, with ad hominem attacks that only prove what she's saying in this book. The book is remarkable and thought-provoking. I'm going to get High Crimes and Misdemeanors instantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm thinking of a five letter word that starts with a \\"B\\"","review":"Pure drivel!

And she never lets up.But no doubt, she's laughing all the way to the bank.Talk about leading a charmed life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Without 'Liberals' Anne would be nothing","review":"I gotta hand it to these type of political writers who make a living 'exposing' the other side of the political spectrum. Most of her insight into the Liberal agenda is her perception and interpretation of events and political ideas she does not particularly care for...SO WHAT! What makes her opinion more high-browed and expert than mine or any other ordinary person? I really don't know.If you like biased reading, then this is the book of the moment. Otherwise, if you're looking for balanced and critical analysis of political ideas (left or right) this is below the standard. Give some extra reading time to Bill Sapphire or Bill Kristol for the conservative bent, and then maybe Bill Moyers for the left."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Work of Fiction","review":"If this was a fiction book, I'd give it five stars, because that's all this book has, lies, right-wing propaganda, and fiction. With an absurd level of well-documented inaccuracies, lies, and venomous invective, All Ann Coulter does is expose herself as a hate-filled hypocrite. Along with her new book, \\"Treason,\\" Ms. Coulter sinks to a new low, and proves herself nothing more than the hate-filled creature she has always been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than zero","review":"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. I believe this is quite possibly the worst book in the history of mankind, and all copies should be burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people need to check their facts","review":"the ONE thing Coulter did in her life which deserves praise, it the one thing ignored in these reviews by conservatives. She WAS THE ONE WHO GOT \\"Stupid White Men\\" published!!! She made the call to the publisher to help Moore get the book to print. Moore's book IS researched and cited from cover to cover. Sadly, Ms. Coulter does not take the time to do the same, and her \\"facts\\" are more tilted that a windmill in Don Quixiote. Her prose reads more like bitter angry prose than a hard core examination of truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Truth???","review":"Ann Coulter wouldn't know the truth if it walked up and slapped her in the face. She takes small tid bits of information and tries to fill in around it. What she can't use to make her point she makes up. If this is who the conservatives are turning to for their views? Then God help us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I love Ann. She's brilliant, insightful, and she sees it all as clearly as I do.

If Ann's an extremist then so am I."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time and money.","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. She is just desperate for attention. Don't bother reading this book. It's so false and full of inaccuracies. I wish there was an option to give it zero starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's a terrific comedian!","review":"No, I don't mean that she's a joke: comedians often make telling points via humor--in fact, those are the funniest lines. Nor do I mean that she is not serious: comedians often are very serious people.What I mean is that she takes accurate research and insights, but then puts them in a way that is just hilarious! (Admittedly, liberals make it easy, but still...)The basic liberal argument comes down to this:1. I'm a good person.2. I believe X.3. You don't believe X.4. Therefore, you are not a good person.For decades, conservatives protested that #4 was mistaken. Now here comes Ann to tell conservatives that this pathetic excuse making is a stupid waste of time. The faulty premiss is #1! Slanderers aren't good people! They are hateful, disgusting people. And oh how the left howled! Since liberalism is mostly moral vanity...Most amusing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Cat Writes Better","review":"Am I supposed to ink stamp this sort of thing just because I don't like liberals?

Coulter does not make a single coherant argument in the entire book. It is packed with slippery slopes. To sum it up, this book is utter trash. If you want to spend money on a political book that has some value, try Noam Chomsky's Understanding Power."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I saw Coutler once on Politically Incorrect and thought she was funny. So I bought this book. It's a rip-off.Why read a whole book you can sum up in one sentence? Coutler's point is that the media is liberal, and liberals are evil. If you already believe this, there's no reason to read it. If you don't, this book won't convince you (Coutler's over-the-top styleand out-of-context \\"evidence\\" makes sure of that).\\"Slander\\" is a waste of time for the same reason as Michael Moore's \\"Stupid White Men\\". Both books discourage actual thinking, and exist only to reinforce the presumed bias of the reader. And both hide behind shock-radio hyperbole and name calling to obscure the fact that nothing of substance is being offered.If you find yourself mouthing \\"ditto\\" while listening to Rush Limbaugh, you might like this book. Otherwise, don't bother. You won't learn anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"A great read! Ignore the previous reviews. They are all left-wingers who hate Ann Coulter. The book shows the depths to which the left wing has sunk. The so-called \\"Liberals\\" actually hate open-minded thinkers. The book also points out how the leftists' arguments are based upon only emotion and a desire to protect their self interests, instead of facts and reason. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Republican Hysteria","review":"Proves over and over she has Karl Rove on speed dial.What a moronic piece of babbling.

My main qualm with this book is that I actually did investigate some of her claims, and found them to be bogus. Fortunately, I borrowed this--OK, I'll be nice--book from my own library and so didn't have to flush any of my hard earned money down the drain. Hope you won't either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love her articles, disappointed in book","review":"I was so excited when Coulter's book arrived and I sat down comfortably to what I felt was going to be a treat of conservative insight into liberal lies. The lies were there, but far too often Ms. Coulter was doing the exact same thing she accused the left of doing, name calling. Her own name calling of the left was childish and detracted greatly from the message, albeit, an important one that she was attempting to make in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Really Deserves NO STARS","review":"Ann Coulter's hateful, infalmmatory broadside is all hype and no substance (kinda like her conservative agenda). She picks alot of fights and throws alot of bombs, but never really makes any coherent arguments aside from her basic (unproven) premise that \\"Liberals are Bad.\\" This book isn't about meaningful public discourse, it's about namecalling, hype, and self-promotion.

I found myself laughing through most of it. Ms. Coulter's views are utterly ridiculous, and her \\"facts\\" present an extremely weak case for a liberal media.

I find her book most childish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation","review":"This book was written simply as a quick money-maker, and has no educational value at all. To say that the media is totally left-winged is idiotic. Turn on any cable news channel and see for yourself: they are all conservative. If you are a right-winged individual who hates Clinton, you may get a few chuckles, but that is about it. I am not left-winged pundit, but I find that she is constantly hypocritical throughout the book, and inconsistent in her reasoning.This woman is known for being loud and abrasive.

Cover your eyes, children!","review":"Notice how every Ann Coulter book has a blatantly anti-liberal subtitle? This is extremely indicative of her narrow, divisive view of politics. Ann Coulter is a ghastly, reptillian creature deservant of every maligning remark she receives.

I was at first turned off by the first couple of chapters, because it seemed as though her diatrabe was nothing more than what liberals do. However, as I read through I began to better understand her style. This is a great book out there for anyone who doesn't believe there is a liberal slant to the news. Of course I doubt that they'd read it. As Ann says, Liberals don't debate the actual issues, they just call you stupid and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about slander...","review":"This is the single greatest literary example of the pot calling the kettle black.Ms. Coulter is betting people will be bowled over by her footnotes. Call her bluff. Go to the library, take this book and look up some of her footnotes. Several of the articles she cites do not say what she says they say. Either she is a liar or she has a severe disability in reading comprehension. Whichever is the case, it certainly calls into question her credibility as a pundit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read in Three Years","review":"Awesome. Spectacular. She nails it. And I love that she dedicates it to the NY Times (which I, too, read daily, w/often the same outrage at their lies) . . check out her recent column...where she rips apart the Times' attack on Ashcroft and the 2nd Amendment . . . and shows that within 400 words, there are at least two times where you have to ask: 1) Is the Times deliberately lying? Or 2) are they ignorant of the actual facts, more ignorant than even your average junior high schooler?You go girl.I wish some of the libs would cite specifics (I don't think they can, and that's why they don't). The only thing you could take issue w/is her tone . . but sometimes moral outrage is appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"The extreme far right's propaganda. Don't wast your $!!!","review":"This book has really hit a new low for the ultra far right Republicans. Ms Coulter has shown that she has the ability to take talk show dribble and try to pass it off as fact. Luckily I did not buy this book. I read it just to get insight after I saw her pathetic showing on the Today show. The book is poorly organized, there is no supporting data for her allegation.

Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"As a conservative thinker myself I wish that I were able to recommend this book. Unfortunately, it is pure and simple trash. Ms. Coulter offers absolutely nothing of substance. Frankly, her inflammatory statements injure the conservative agenda by making us appear unintelligent. Her inability to express herself is actually quite embarrassing. Clearly, she is only seeking to \\"cash-in\\" on her former success in criticizing Bill Clinton. Moreover, her attempts to support her views on television made me cringe with embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here We Go Again . . .","review":"More mud slinging from one party against another.

Ann, quit complaining and do something to improve the country overall. That's what makes an American P:atriotic: putting the best interests of our blessed nation ahead of personal gain.

There are NO black people in New Caanan. It's kind of like Idaho. She doesn't speak for any one else.

Coulter is a shock-jockey in the same vain as Rush Limbaugh. Whenever I hear some of these over the top, all liberals are the scum of the earth garbage, it just seems that she is desperate to have her views, no matter if they are right or wrong, heared. How can you people on the American right have this woman represent your views? I will admit that liberals have made mistakes and will continue to. But take a look in mirror Ann. The American right has make just as may mistakes and taken advantage of the American public as anybody ever has. Maybe you should listen to John Maccain sometime. His views on social issuses I may not always agree on, but does he ever know what is wrong with Politics in US, yet no one wants to listen to him and clean up the dirty politics in Washington certainly not President Bush. And certainly not Ann H. Coulter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written and filled with cold, hard facts.","review":"Coulter displays her brilliant mind in this piece of art that defies the politically correct and berates the media elites and [cuts] the liberal point of view. Leaves the left wing with their mouths open with nothing to do but name-call a little bit more. With a foreword by Rush Limbaugh that does nothing but increase the intellectual value of this masterpiece, everyone should enjoy the proven facts and strong opinions in Slander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Attacks America","review":"In this book,you will witness Ann Coulter's hatred and bigotry as she attacks Liberals,Clinton and women.Yea,you heard me right-Ann attacks her own gender.Ann has decieved America by spreading vicious lies about the things she attacks,and she has made herself and the GOP filthy rich by the money she gets from her America-attacking books.You plop down your hard-earned tax dollars to make the rich richer and the poor poorer by buying Ann's books.Ann has taken it upon herself to destroy what good Liberals do,and to help multiply the damage the right wing does.This is not fun or entertainment-it is just a book of lies,deciet and hatred.Ann abuses the Free Speech Amendment by attacking women,Liberlas and other countries.Perhaps it's time you fans of her opened your eyes and see how Ann is dividing America and attacking God."},{"rating":"1","title":"who would have taken this book seriously?","review":"I can't imagine that even a lot of conservatives would have taken this book seriously if they had actually read it. Coulter sure knows how to find fault but offers the reader no solution out of the so-called mess she cries about. For all the generosity the media has given these lunatics, it's amazing how low they'll stoop to accuse their own generous ones of aiding the other side. If you're going to read it, pour some Pine Sol on it and then her crap will make any sense !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and very unbalanced","review":"I am both a Republican and conservative, but I have no use for this woman's rantings. I may disagree with liberals, but Coulter goes too far when she accuses liberals of being anti-American, unpatriotic, and supporters of Islam (the only religion liberals like, according to Coulter). Are you going to tell me George McGovern, who risked his life as a fighter pilot in WWII, is not patriotic? And are you going to tell me all the Republican war-wimps like Newt Gingrich are? There is hypocrisy on both sides, but Coulter can't see the conservative phonies. We have our share, too, and having a thoughtless spokeswoman does not do credit to the cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Ann Coulter has outdone herself this time with her masterful handling of the subject of Liberal Lies.The book shows what is going on behind the scenes in the Liberal mind and even more importantly exposes the lies we have been fed by the media for the last few decades and how they actually manipulate what is going on in Washington to suit their purposes.Surely this book will enflame liberal readers to strike out at her,for she has uncovered what they have been hiding from the public for so long.An honest observer of what was written has to admit that she has spoken the truth, for the claims are backed up with proof of their validity by numerous footnotes.I would recommend this book for every citizen in the U.S. for it will help them sort out the trash we have been raised on from the Liberal media and make us more informed to make the best decision while in the voting booth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you like Ann, you will love this book. The McCarthiests on the left, wish no one would read this book, as leftist idealism fails time after time. None of the reviewers who negatively reviewed this book has even bothered to open a page of this book. They are just fueled by hatred about views which counter theirs. Their reviews just reaffirm what Ann has written. The left does not desire free speech or have any tolerence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance thy name is Ann","review":"Everyone is a least a tad bit judgemental but for some reason Ann Coulter thinks her judgements are logical. She hates people because they are not exactly like her. That's as ludicrous as me saying I hate people because their eyes are brown. Ann is a strong believer of following the teachings of the bible, but at the same time is hypocritical enough to go against the \\"love thy neighbor\\" part and slam liberals for being uneducated sheep. I can fully understand someone having strong viewpoints about issues that are important to them, but it makes you look like a mindless oaf if you bash everyone that happens to think differently. Funny how the word slander gets used to in the title when Ann seems to be playing an \\"adult\\" version of I know you are but what am I. If you can't appreciate people for who they are (gays, minorities etc.) then you are the one that's truly UnAmerican and I hope you rot on your self righteous throne."},{"rating":"1","title":"What utter crap","review":"I wish there was an option for voting nil stars for a book. I feel like sending her a bill to recover the costs of the book and overseas shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slander Makes a Lot of Noise","review":"The title of this book invites anyone wandering a bookstore to open its pages. The person who does so will find that the text reads much like the title: sensationalist, under-cited prose that leaves the reader imaginging Ms. Coulter shouting as she types. I was searching for a book on conservative politics in order to broaden my political perspectives; I was disappointed in the lack of logic, thought, and depth in this work. \\"Slander\\" is more of a rant than a cogent, informative source of information. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book by Coulter called Slander?","review":"Now that is funny. With all the accuracy of a scud missile, Coulter uses broad generalizations to paint a picture of liberals that is laughable. \\"Liberals hate America.\\" \\"Liberals hate The flag.\\" \\"Liberals hate Christ.\\" \\"Liberals make coats out of dalmation puppies.\\" Blah, blah, blah. What is a liberal you might ask? Well, pretty much anyone who disagrees with Ann Coulter. Now figuring out what Coulter actually believes may be a bit of a challenge. I'm not sure what she really wants because she seems to be opposed to things but isn't in favor of much other than being the current administration's lap dog. Coulter projects to liberals the things that she deep down sees in herself in this book. This book is an interesting psychological study about \\"Narcissist Personality Disorder\\" because Coulter is a classic case (see the definition in DSM IV and decide for yourself). Amazing that she has been able to make a living off her own imbecility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme ignorance","review":"Coulter is a very interesting person. She has written a book based on her opinions and passes them off as truth. This book is very painful to read because the reader is trying to understand politics from a woman who did not see the message or truth in Bowling for Columbine. She, instead refers to Michael Moore not as a filmmaker or author but as \\" college dropout Michael Moore ....ect... This is how she refers to him and to many other people in her novel. She has no respect for others and can't even think abstractly, which is sad considering her education and current employment. She needs to stop this kind of hatred and realize that ignorance will turn off any curious reader with a brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Challenging only if you don't speak English","review":"I can't believe the people that said this book presents a \\"challenging\\" alternative viewpoint! I voted for Bush and am a fairly devout Republican but this is the most idiotic drivel I've heard in my life! Anyone that can be so black and white about politics and believes that all alternative viewpoints are wrong and dangerous (ironic since she is trying to defend the Right from the slander of the Left, then turns around and does the same) is hardly a model American citizen. Ann Coulter is the Michael Moore of the left--a blind, self-absorbed reductionist, who doesn't believe that the word \\"democracy\\" means living with alternative views."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Dare She???","review":"As someone who lost a beloved spouse on September 11th, the question I have is how anyone who considers themself a patriot could wish planes to crash into more New York City buildings, i.e. the New York Times building? That comment took my breath away. More suffering and loss, simply because this so-called author feels that the Times is too liberal and that somehow threatens her? This is simply grotesque and she should be ashamed of herself! I had considered myself a conservative, and even voted for George Bush (sorry!!!) but after reading this piece of DRECK, I will never vote for another conservative ever again. I am still shocked and stunned by her total lack of compassion. Even if it is said satirically, or in humor, it is unnecessary and completely inappropriate. Shame on her! The thought of what she has written makes me physically ill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp, Funny, True","review":"This book is hilarious--read how Carter, Dukakis and Mondale failed on account of being \\"too smart\\"; and how the killers of James Byrd, sentenced to death, were under-punished because they weren't sent to anger management classes. ..., Coulter does not \\"write bad\\". The book is heavily footnoted and supported, but it's a fun read, in the American tradition of puncturing the pompous..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling and timely ...","review":"Well documented expose of the damage the liberal \\"progressives\\" do to US policies. To the point and at times laugh-out-loud funny, this book is to be feared by every elitist, limousine liberal, hypocritical leftist. It's entertaining, well written books such as this that will, one can hope, finally bring to account the liberals and the sycophant media pushing the liberal agenda!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-stop pounding of liberal absurdities.","review":"Ann Coulter delivers one of the most powerful and explosive exposes on the Left's conscious, methodical assault on truth. If you're a conservative, you'll be amazed and outraged at the liberal bias against anything that's even remotely conservative. If you're liberal, hang your head in shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo,Hiss,Boo","review":"For people like Ann Coulter who claim that liberals are somehow more harmful to America than even Al Quaeda, she sure knows how to make a big disgrace of herself and her attempts to write about \\"Slander\\" are nothing more than trying to slander people she personally hates only to backfire and contradict the very title she's against. With people like her, who needs enemies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"SEE! Conservatives are stupid!!!","review":"This book clearly demonstrates why the right is always wrong. Ms. Coulter exemplifies poor research, horrible positions that make the \\"liberals\\" look extremely smart without doing a damn thing. Buying this book is the worst decision you could ever make. Please do not buy books from any right-wing idiot who seems to publish books just to help their idiotic and mediocre careers. She was a horrible lawyer, and even worse writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Coulter Makes Her Case . . .","review":"Coulter makes a strong case that liberals have long given up legitimate debate in favor of name-calling and demonization. At the same time, her return fire is so hot she makes a case for herself as the most gifted polemicist of the last decade. Not even William F. Buckley at his most withering generated the kind of heat Coulter does. It's clear that this book is the glove that slaps a face with every intention of starting a fight. As a conservative frustrated by being constantly compared to Nazi's and racists for opposing things like high taxes, I found myself hoping someone would accept her challenge.The only possible criticism of the book is that Ann stoops the level of her opponents on several occasions by calling them dumb. In fairness to her, she provides the evidence for her charge more often than not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Negative Reviews Prove the Whole Point","review":"Just started reading the book, and have thus far found it to be absolutely brilliant writing. Logged on to Amazon.com to have a look at customer reviews, and what do I find but a bunch of name-calling attacks which trash the book without ever mentioning or refuting a single argument or piece of evidence offered in the book itself. I find this to be absolutely hilarious, since it is exactly this kind of name-calling whining, free of all logic and argument, that the book was written against. I can't believe the negative reviewers have read so much as the introduction, for they are proving the whole thesis, which is already quite well established with numerous examples and excellent rhetorical style by page 15. I'd be laughing harder if it weren't for the fact that my vote in our endangered republic is canceled by folks such as these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Best Seller for your Library","review":"First I want to acknowledge the Liberals who were able to buy the book and read it so quickly. I did notice that none of them critiqued the book, rather they chose to slanderize Ann Coulter (how ironic is that?). Ann's book is extremely intense. Many of the sentences contain so much insight and information they could qualify as paragraphs. Ann applies humor and fact and an abundance of research to illustrate how the Liberal Media has blasted Faith, Family, Freedom for the last quarter of a century. If you enjoyed BIAS, you will enjoy SLANDER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Reading","review":"Any person who reads this book with an open mind will find that Ms. Coulter has pulled the shade up and let the sunshine on liberal attempts at brainwashing. Regardless of what you may say about how Ms. Coulter says what she says, if you don't get into name calling but think and look at facts, you can't come to any other conclusion but that she is correct. One perfect example of the bias she points out is the election night coverage of the major networks immediately calling States for Gore after the polls closed and waiting hours before calling States for Bush. She outlines many, many other such examples. This is an excellent book. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks and Stones","review":"A famous person once said \\"when an argument is lost, all is not hopeless, you can still call the other person vile names.\\" Many of the reviewers of Ms. Coulters book have done exactly that. Rather than critiquing the work honestly, they resort to name calling and labeling. As long as the author is hate-monger, homophobe, blond, Republican and conservative, she can be dismissed. These are the tactics that all liberals automatically and instinctively use to squelch public debate on their outworn, outdated and harmful policies. Read the book for yourself, and decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but.....","review":"First off, I am more so a conservative than a liberal, but I cross over on one or two issues. As you would expect, conservatives are going to love this book, and liberals are going to hate it. Her hardest hitting points have to do with the media's role in the 2000 Presidential election fiasco, and the left wing bias in the media. She puts forth a pretty persuasive argument. Everything she has written is backed up by references, over 700 of them if I remember correctly. On the down side, I would have toned down the name calling(I dont think that helps her), and when she refers to abortion as \\"baby killing\\", I just cringe. I tried to review this book objectively, unlike some of the other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"She talks bad. But she writes worse !","review":"I thought she talked bad. I change my opinion. She writes worse.

Reading her words makes me feel soiled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and researched","review":"Basically, Ann is a nice house, but nobody's home.She's a perfect example of how the standards of what is considered anAmerican \\"intellectual\\" continue to diminish.Overall, the book is poorly written and researched, and not at all insightful.Just a warmed-over helping of the usual angry rant by the privileged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Coulter: Liberal Lies; Blah, Blah, Blah.....","review":"The objective reader should be able to quickly and readily discern that Ms. Coulter is to authors what Jerry Springer is to talk show hosts.

That's America UNFORTUNATELY. She seems very sad though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut and Paste","review":"Well, if Ann actually wrote this little tome, which I doubt, the bile gurgling around inside her must have created an ulcer the size of Connecticut.She likes to brag that her editor cut the book down so much she has enough left over for her next one.I can hardly wait. The floor of the bird cage will be very happy.Oh, well. I guess I should be thankful for small mercies.I'd rather waste my time reading her, than being her."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAHHH!!!","review":"I seriously think that poor Ann was dropped on her head as a baby a few to many times. It is quite ironic that she accuses liberals of slander throughout the entire book, when slander is all that comes out of this woman 24/7!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Coulter, crazy","review":"Ive read several of these reviews where people say all kinds of things about how reliable her sources are, and about how she has 780 footnotes. Unfortunetly, your all wrong. I read the book, and there are 780 ENDNOTES. Not footnotes. theres a big different. The book was also horrible, which is to be expected with such a crazy person.

It nearly killed me but I read it. \\"Slander\\" is an excellent title for this book because that's all Ann Coulter does. There are numerous mistakes and outright proven LIES in this book. And her attacks on liberals are so childish. She tries to sell this idea that the media has a liberal bias and conservatives never get fair treatment even though she's been ALL OVER the \\"liberal media\\" promoting herself! If it wasn't for the \\"liberal media\\" nobody would know who Ann Coulter is! Her tone in this book is full of hate. I wonder how often she says the word \\"liberal\\" with a disgusted face. I'm guessing 805 times a day. She needs to reevaluate her ideals and perhaps try and be nice to people for a change. I wish I could give ZERO stars to this book of hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was surprised how much this didn't vibe with me","review":"I had a difficult time sinking myself into Coulter's world. I picked up this book so that I might be able to give myself a few pointers for arguements against some of my liberal friends. This is just some paper soup to make money, and the information is not very helpful at all. Coulter is like a paranoid conspiracy theorist with an addiction for tradition. The second word in the title says it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her humor is worth the read","review":"This book is even better than Ms. Coulter's newspaper articles (if possible), because she has more time to document and develop her postulations. Her humor is always delightful. Mainstream news people could benefit from this insight. They often ask why the public views them as liberal. Most of her information comes as no suprise to conservatives, but it is gratifying to see it documented in one volume. Conservatives are well represented by Ann Coulter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slander hits Liberals in the face where they need it!","review":"This book was a mastery in telling it like it needs to be told and without all the left slanted distortions our media vomits(with the exception of Fox News)on a daily basis. Ms. Coulter says what needs to be said and exposes just how much lying the liberals do. Anyone with half an ounce of brain mass should be able to decipher this, if not they obviously have drank way to much \\"Clinton Kool-Aid\\" and or are to belligerent to know what is fact and what is not. All you leftists who want a feel good story should consider wasting your money on Hillary Clinton's brainwash bible or anything by Michael Moore and his indoctrination for America Haters. If Ann Coulter is trying to set the record straight with facts and displace the deceit liberals spew then this book is a clarion call to arms for everything the Right stands for! This book is a must read for anyone who wants to know the real truth, nothing less."},{"rating":"1","title":"instantly disposable","review":"This is the latest tirade from the swelling niche of extremist pundits trying to cash in quickly on the naivite and ,dare I say it, slanderous misconceptions of a misinformed public hungry for easy answers and a reinforcement of their dearly held prejudices through faulty data. There are lies, more lies and then there are Ann Coulter's statistics. She has a palpable hatred of anything that doesn't conform to her preposterous worldview where the only solutions to every conundrum are more guns or more Jesus. How long can it be until Ann and her ilk will want to arm Jesus to wipe off her adversaries?. Her illogical rants border on the hysterical and serve one purpose only: to stuff her wallet while prescribing sentiments that were already old and tired 50 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prominent Work","review":"One of the most compelling, well documented pieces of work that depicts the true danger of liberal thinking.

To call attention to herself. To throw together a diatribe so outlandish that it will become an instant best seller (it has!) as soon as it comes to the public's attention.How do you achieve this? It's disarmingly simple.You insult enough people in the media until they invite you onto their shows just so that they can argue with you. Like she just did with Katie Couric, whom she referred to as \\"the affable Eva Braun of morning television\\" (formulated deliberately to start a fight), resulting in the sudden skyrocketing of sales of this worthless book.And she walks away with the money, smug in the knowledge that we're all just sheep, completely under her control.

I shouldn't have expected much from Coulter given her history, but this was an absolute disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful","review":"I read this so-called heavily researched book, and got a lot of great belly laughs at just how poorly written and researched it really is.Coulter says the fact that \\"far right wing'' came up about 10 times more than \\"far left wing'' in the NY Times Nexus search \\"proves'' that it is slanted to the left. Well, guess what? The Washington Times - a paper renowned for its right wing slant - had the same percentage on the same Nexus search.But, of course, Coulter didn't put that in her \\"book.''Coulter said liberals only give us invective instead of argument, but calls Katie Couric the \\"likable Eva Braun of morning TV.'' Yeah, no invective there.If you want a truly good read that exposes (fakes)like Coulter, read David Brock's \\"Blinded by the Right.''

Ann does not lie...she tells it as she sees it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyperbolic, silly, and misinformed","review":"...Ann Coulter comes from the Rush Limbaugh school of conservativism- instead of using facts or numbers to support arguments, make flippant, insulting remarks or simply not allow them to speak. While their ignorance is entertaining, it's sad that so many people turn only to people like them to get their news.This book appears heavy on facts to bolster her arguments, but, when checked for validity, many of the footnotes provide very weak reinforcement or none at all...Regardless of political affiliation, please don't choose a side and then tune in to talking heads who simply spew out rhetoric that panders blatantly to the left or right. Sadly, both sides are so close-minded that they cannot see that both sides are correct, and both sides are wrong. As with most things in life, the best course for our government lies somewhere in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demagoguery in a short skirt","review":"Ann Coulter has written a book that is so filppant with the facts that it loses all credibility. She uses 'uban myths\\" of liberal avarice and sloth to craft an image of liberals as America-hating hippies. The danger of this type of book is that whenever Coulter is pushed on the facts, she always falls back on the fact that it was really written as entertainment and to lighten up. So which is it? Entertainment or fact? Doesn't matter, it fails miserably as either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian?","review":"Every time I read this book I fail to understand where \\"Christianity\\" enters her writing. I also fail to understand where the \\"liberal lies\\" are that the vast majority of Republicans are no longer moderate, intellignet people of the same cut as Eisenhower, Regan or others that I know. This woman is simply seeking to rial people and that sells books. Her writings have nothing to do with what christ teaches. Stay away from those that seek to create problems between christians.

It's all about how hateful and despicable liberals are. Only thing is, the term \\"liberal\\" is never defined. Social liberal? Economic liberal? I don't know what Coulter is referring to, but that's OK, she doesn't know either. She just hates them anyway. If the book were more credible, it would seem bitter and twisted. As it is, it is merely hilarious. A clever effort to meet the needs of those who feed on bile and one which will no doubt sell very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulter practices \\"slander\\"","review":"Coulter is no more than an ultra-partisan attack hack, unlike other neoconservatives, makes no effort to be fair honest or open minded. Just \\"we hate them they are no good punish them\\"- you'd think people like her would stop whining if they are in total control of the government they would shut up and lead... not Coulter... she won't be happy until she can exterminate the loyal opposition. Her other book is \\"Treason\\" - so named because the penalty for treason is death and she dreams of killing Democrats and has often said so. She missed her chance in not being born in fascist Italy (or Germany?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Ann! You just bust me up...","review":"I love reading Ann Coulter's books back-to-back with Al Franken and Michael Moore. I tell ya, this stuff keeps me rollin'. Her conspiracy theories and middle-school disses are perfect in this book! I swear I knew a gal just like her back in south Georgia in sixth grade.But on the point of reviewing, this book is only valuable for its comedy content. Miss Coulter is shallow, sallow, pallid, angry about who-knows-what (and I don't mean politics), and she fabricates her research.

For both sides of the debate, after reading Slander, read Al Franken's book \\"Lies: and the Lying Liars who tell them.\\" Franken sheds light on some discrepencies in Coulter's book, but he nearly succeeds in making Coulter's point for her: That democrats don't write about anything except how the republicans are so bad.

And while I can understand the reaction people have to how the 'liberal' media has glossed over topics big and small on both sides of the political spectrum, this book is an insult to anyone who isnt quite so easily marked by a party line.

Coulter and her cronies spend all their time slamming others without injecting any policy (other than not liking Bill Clinton).

She seems to just blow everything out of proportion--way out of proportion. It seems to be just an outburst of frustration she has felt toward Liberals for a long time.

Although I don't share all of Ann Coulter's positions on the issues, the well-documented facts that she presents in the book lend full credence to her arguments. The book is both a source of fascinating information and of high entertainment. It frequently caused me to spontaneously erupt into fits of laughter (which my wife found somewhat troubling). It so interesting because it brings a long-overdue perspective into the public forum. This perspective that Ann brings to the public forum is that of cold, hard, objectivity, and it is supported with a vast arsenal of factual material. I apologize for using cliche but here goes anyway: while reading the book, I often thought to myself \\"that is so true,\\" and \\"I never thought of it that way.\\" I love the rare book that makes me think such thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"AP Gov't review","review":"Slander sets out to highlight and educate the reader to the mistakes of the Democratic Party. Coulter believes that Democratic Party members, through use of name-calling and childlike behavior, lower themselves to making personal attacks. Interestingly enough, however Coulter herself engages in name-calling, often reusing 'pet names' through out the chapter when describing opponents. She notes quite frequently of her belief that liberals control the media, and therefore they wield a type of magic spell over the majority of ignorant American. Despite her apparent distaste for liberal \\"snobbery\\" she herself comes off as quite condescending. Even into the last paragraphs when she declares \\"...liberals are narrow minded and parochial, incapable of seeing the other fellow's point of view\\". I do not recommend this book, especially for purchase. If you must read it, do yourself a favor and borrow it from a library; the 14.95 can be spent in much more productive ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adds little to political discourse in United States","review":"A poorly written and researched book, \\"Slander\\" attempts to offer reasons why liberal policy and politics are inherently flawed. Coulter makes broad generalizations and stereotypes all liberals while using inconclusive sources to support her own theories. Intrisically, Ann Coulter disregards much of her own rhetoric about liberals being closed to alternative viewpoints by dismissing all liberal viewpoints. The intent of this work is clearly to provide a platform for political pundits that wears the guise of credible work. \\"Slander\\" does little to improve the political discourse in the United States, but effectively injects more divisiveness into the discussion.I would suggest David Frum as an author that more effectively and eloquently articulates the conservative world view."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is something seriously wrong with Ann Coulter","review":"Ann Coulter has pointed many a fingers at liberals who clearly understand that she isn't the exactly \`sane'. I under stand this too, and I'm only 11! I mean, who says \`liberals hate America' while knowing what they are talking about? Slander is a great book, if you would like a laugh. I didn't even read the chapter called \`the joy of arguing with liberals: there stupid!' because already I knew it was total poppycock. This book is good for raving conservative lunatics. For every normal person its good as a dartboard, a coaster, and a poorly made Frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatred in its Purest Form","review":"I've spent a lot of time working up this nine word synopsis of Coulter's book, so don't skip it:\\"I hate everyone who thinks differently than I do.\\"Coulter's final solution--generally implied, occassionally spelled out--is that people she considers inferior need to be economically crippled, removed from society, deported or, when all else fails, executed.She's really quite an intellectual.According to Coulter, disagreeing with her or questioning other conservatives is \\"slander.\\" Coulter argues that disagreeing with her or the politicians she's carrying water for is an attack on America, the Bill of Rights, the Bible, and all other things good and, according to Coulter, there is no penalty too severe for those who have differing opinions.I understand Joseph Stalin thought Coulter was scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book slanders reality","review":"An aptly titled book: This book is filled with slander. If you have ever seen this author on television shows such as Crossfire, you know that she's vicious, overemotional and has virtually no grasp of facts. The book is no different. All shouting and no substance, the usual stuff from the right wingers, who appear to have the world's greatest reserve of moral outrage, usually at government trying to solve a problem for a part of society other than corporations or rich people, or at average people enjoying life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness...So open wide, or if you're smart, avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Republican Whining","review":"I guess if the Republicans didn't have so much to answer for, they wouldn't have to publish this kind of tripe.

That quote alone should tell us something about this woman. Ann Coulter is a glaring hypocrite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Substantiated & Accurate Reporting","review":"Ann Coulter carefully portrayed the liberal biasness that I have personally seen in our news media. Ann successfully backed up her claims of biasness with pages of reference citations, which anyone can verify if they wish. Ann Coulter really looked at the facts and wrote a very effective argument that such liberal bias exists. READ IT!!!

Also, Iraq is not to blame for the September 11 attacks -- that's just another lie the the right-wing would love to have us believe. As for the book, well, having read it once, the only comparison I can draw is to escargot. It's interesting to try it, but once you realize what you're eating, you spit it out and never try it again.

Frustrated writer or frustrated politician? It's no wonder - with written behavior like this - that our children don't stand a chance in the manners arena. I also watched her on Good Morning America with Charlie and was very sorry to call her a woman or an American. Someone her age should have better manners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann's book = garbage!","review":"This book is a blatent display of ignorance. It lacks depth and credibility. Ann needs to do some research and read a few history books. Its easy to blame problems on people who have different opinions than you, rather than putting together a valid argument to support your own ideas and opinions.Thumbs down, Ann."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Too boring to finish. I suppose her fans will like it, and the talking heads who will promote the book will babble about the supposedly hard hitting prose, but for everyone else it is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"SATIRE AND NOT FACTUAL","review":"If this is intended to a be a serious analysis of contemporary politics, then no stars should be awarded. If it is intended as satire which seems to be its aim, then it warrants one star. By no means though is it worth wasting hard-earned money to purchase. If you want to waste money, buy a share of WorldCom or Enron but not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a validating book if you're a member of the choir...","review":"but just a universalizing generalization about liberals to me. i tend to agree with Marx (Groucho that is) that \\"i would never belong to a club that would have me as a member.\\" that goes for liberal or conservative, if you live by that rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann's message is old and tired","review":"Ann Coulter again reinforces that she is out of touch with the reality of daily life. In this instance, she takes on one of her favorite targets - the media. She again rails against her view that it has a bias - what a surprise. She looses sight of the irony that, she too, has a bias that is bitter and lacks positive input knowing that tearing things down sells more books than offering valid alternatives.She belongs in an old folks home where she can spread her venom without hurting anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"hot","review":"Ann Coulter is a fine, fine, fine woman; however, her writing skills are poor, poor, poor! As a \\"flaming\\" Republican I resent her use of sex to sell her book. (This is a typical liberal tactic which I abhor!) It's unfortunate, though she brings up a good issue or two, her desire to be \\"sexy\\" muffles any validity she may have had. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"fellow conservative is sorrowed by this book","review":"I gave it 1 star because I can't give it 0. Ann coulter tries to makes me think I'm a victim, or that we as conservatives are victims of liberalism lefties. This just couldn't be any farther from the truth. Her analogies and language are completely crude and useless (for me). Ann comes off very mean spirited. I'd like to see less spin and a clearer discussion of the differences cons. and libs. have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This sounded like it was going to be a really good, informative book but it was just so silly and unrealistic that it grew dull fast. Like most extremists Ms.Coulter is only able to see things in black and white. You are either an evil conniving unpatriotic liberal or you are a noble and patriotic conservative. Basically the Saturday morning cartoon way of thinking. I enjoy well written and thought out books about both parties. This wasn't that kind of book. There are just too many lies and inconsistencies, it's basically one long diatribe. Very very dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not realize","review":"I had no idea about the relationship between Coulter and Karen Hughes.

She makes broad, sterotypical, statements and then supports them with \\"facts\\" that simply aren't true. She has no credibility, since it is impossible to trust her opinions and her evidence as truthful. Ann Coulter is a perfect example, along with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, etc. that the tongue of the right is that of a snake and they deserve our contempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SheMan Talking Junk!!!","review":"I have no problem with people taking another side to task, but have some class about it. The times when Ann tries to be funny in this, she falls flat on her face and look like the idiot she is. No wonder Republicans are moving away from her. Plus she makes dumb comments...she has been quoted as saying she wants to do away with the Emancipation Proclamation. Now, let me remind you that this was a REPUBLICAN agenda (Lincoln). See how dumb this woman is?!! Anybody who gives this book more than one star need to have their heads examine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be criminalized","review":"Probably one of the sickest, most perverse \\"accounts\\" of alleged liberal media bias. Coulter has the intellectual sophistication and moral integrity of an infant. I say this because those of you who have read Al Franken's new book, \\"Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them\\" know what I'm referring to. Franken manages to use real evidence to rip the credibility of \\"Slander\\" into shreds, showing how Coulter lied throughout most of her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If possible, less than one star","review":"Ann Coulter took time off from haunting houses and eating children to write this piece of horses---.

This books provides clear and irrefutable arguments. I saw one review that shocked me so much, I had to laugh! The reviewer said that the media is CONSERVATIVE! Wow, I guess that review must be a radical socialist who voted for Ralph Nader!The bottom line is that the media is so tilted to the left that any reasonable person is forced to listed to so-called \\"conservative\\" talk radio. Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and others are the only clear, reasonable voices out there.Hatred? The hatred is coming from the Left, not the right. The Left hates traditional families, men, and children. The Left represents self-obsessed radical feminists, militant gays, and anti-American nuts. Reasonable Americans of all races, religions, and gender orientation realize that the Republican party is the closest thing we have these days to the American ideal that our ancestors fought for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Hurts","review":"I love Ann's writing and I hope she keeps up the good work.

Why? BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN GOD FORSAKEN BOOK IS MADE UP! Everything. She lies about EVERYTHING. Even her opinions are fake! If you don't believe me,the book \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\\" disects this book. Apparently,to Coulter, The NY Times didnt have a front page article about Erndharts(SIC?) death untill two days later, when a quick look at that shows it was on the front page right after it happened.

Her insights and wisdom are invaluable for the \\"eighty percent, or whatever it is\\" (Chomsky), that are without the wherewithal and gumption to assess for themselves critically, and with a healthy open mind, actual fact verses fiction and understanding the function of persuasive agenda. It says what a so-called \\"conservative\\" WANTS to hear, no matter how distorted, or invented, the reality.All of coulters books, in hard cover if possible, should be a treasured collection for any library, including this book.Like your bible, this book should be purchased new, and read in a literal sense, (not a liberal one, God no) in that special republican way that will allow translation into your tidy little accommodations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann is U-G-L-Y","review":"Attractive blonde? are you kidding me? shes one of the nastiest looking woman in the mainstream media.

You won't find any insights here, for her intention is not to analyze anything; her job is to fling outlandish insults and baseless claims that will excite the lowest, most simian instincts of her readership. Apparently it's a winning strategy, sales-wise, but it's journalistic junk food full of empty political calories. At least with junk food you just get fat--with Coulter, you get hateful and coarse. Let's ditch this kind of thing and start some real political discourse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your dollars !","review":"More hot air from Ann Coulter and her hired writers and editors! Coulter is obviously on someone's payroll and is clearly promoting someone else's interest. Her loud mouth and annoying voice have been well used to promote a divisive political ideology. She has been ironically launched by the corporate media as a puppet/pundit to serve the corporate agenda.Coulter's book has been well used by the Political boys' club. Her writings are an embarrassment to women everywhere on this planet.It is frightening and saddening to find out that Ann Coulter has become \\"the new American dream\\" !"},{"rating":"1","title":"intellectual dishonesty or infantile subjection to Rushbo?","review":"Coulter engages in the name-calling, fabrications, and character assassination that she maintains is the exclusive realm of liberals. She, like Limbaugh, et al, are bringing political analysis to a new low, trying to appeal to the lowest denominator of our nature. She is the radical republican attack puppy, nipping away and hoping something will hurt, wishing it will sell. Her statement that \\"an attack on America by fanatical Muslims had finally provided liberals with a religion they could respect\\" is just one example of the ridiculous and outrageous statments that make up this book. On an emotional level it may appeal to some people, but this book is a shallow analysis, and I am certain is being read for it's entertainment or \\"Wow!\\" factor. That's what I got out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should give it zero stars","review":"What a moronic, incoherent rant from the extreme right. I bet the liberals were wrong about the civil rights movement, the environmental protection (not saving whales or hug a tree, but getting rid of the asbestos in your walls and the lead in your water), campaign finance reform, reduction of nuclear weapons were all lies in some massive conspiracy against Ms Coulter et. al. Although we should congratulate her for staying true to one of the most American of traditions -- entrepreneurialism, getting that [money] out of your pocket and into hers. Good for her! If someone is stupid enough to buy this book than he/she deserves to be ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important book at a critical time","review":"Although Coulter's tone is often over the top her message is important and timely. This is a dangerous time and we need to hear views from all sides and not just from the PC controlled mass media. Unlike most books that talk about the media she has done her homework and has documented (with footnotes) the distortions that take place. After reading this book you will never hear the news the same way again: the use of name calling rather than discussing the issues is the rule. This was never productive but today it could lead to the loss of life. Buy the book and pass it on to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smart conservative book","review":"Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right by Ann Coulter was not everything I thought it would be. I'd really give it 3-1/2 stars instead of 4. Coulter speaks powerfully about the lack of dialogue between liberals and conservatives, but she blames it entirely on liberals. After reading Michael Savage, I know that the truth is that neither side is very good at listening or debating to the other. Coulter has a deadly wit, and her jabs against some liberals/Democrats are fun to read, but I didn't learn anything here that I hadn't read in other sources. Michelle Malkin's Unhinged gives far more examples of the left's occasional outrageous behavior, but I don't like the constant labelling of liberals as crazy. It's too similar to them labelling conservatives as stupid and refusing to actually discuss any differences of opinion. Coulter is very smart and an enjoyable read; I do look forward to her new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clashing Cymbol","review":"As a conservative, I would have appreciated just the facts without her inane packaging. I too share the belief that liberals should be sidelined. Nonetheless, I would hope that I would have more respect for the reader to make up his own mind and hold my conclusions until the climatic ending. No such luck here. This is the second time I picked up the book as Coulter is important, but having set the book down a second time makes me question her continued importance on the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann is still right about the left","review":"Ann keeps up the good fight in this 'telling' tale of the left's compassion(less) form of debate. Pointing out many instances of lost arguments devolving into name calling. I couldn't recommend this any more strongly to those on the right or left. For those on the right, you're not the only one that notices their lies. For those on the left, you're not fooling anyone anymore, not with Ann keeping score."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vituperative Volcano of Viciousness-And Nothing More","review":"\\"Liberals prefer invective to engagement\\"...that's enough right there to tell you just what a nauseatingly blatant hypocrite Ann Coulter is. And she herself must rely on invective for attention, because logic and reason are infinitely scarce in her case. Adolf Hitler engaged in this same type of vituperative propoganda over fifty years ago, so Ann Coulter doesn't fool me for a second. Actually I think she's absolutely pathetic in every sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes Liberals mad.....GOOD!","review":"This book makes liberals mad. Why? Because it is TRUE! Dennis Goza wrote a rather aweful book review and he stands guilty of the very thing that Ann Coulter accuses Liberals of doing. When a liberal is cornered in a debate and the liberal cannot obviously engage him or herself with rational, logical, facts all they can do is use personal attacks and sarcasm but say nothing to literally counter the claims! Thanks Dennis Goza, your review of the book will surely help to sell more copies! I suppose these same liberals who hate this book actually are ignorant enough to believe Al Gore's statements on the \\"Conservative Media Machine\\"! How insane!

Obviously I did enjoy this book and would strongly recommend to anyone. Read the other reviews of this book and see how many liberals not only bought it, but use the liberal playbook and launch personal attacks at Ann Coulter with their book reviews for writing the truth. I am sure that Ann Coulter will be laughing at the liberals all the way to the bank.... GO ANN !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not offering much new information","review":"This book is fine. It offers data to support its conclusion and the data follow a logical sequence. The problem with the book as I see it, is Ann's overall snide, dare I say mean attitude. She is not as nice and joyfull as Rush Limbaugh, and is more brash than Michael Medved. Nor is she as funny as Larry Elder. The book also wont win converts like BIAS might, but none the less if you are a member f the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, like myself its a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"anything for a buck","review":"Yet another book by an entertainer that's out to make a dollar.

I found Ann Coulter's book to be solidly researched, and heavily footnoted. But that is not of course everything. One can, with a selective reading of the facts make a case for almost anything.I strongly recommend her book as an opinion worth reading.

The GOP has had enough...and the boldness of Coulter to stand up and fight back against the abusive accusations of the liberal mainstream and the press is praiseworthy.

I been watching politics for over 40 years, and ain't ever seen stuff like this.As a conservative, my biggest question: why are people like Ann pushing all the moderate conservatives to the other side? You think that'll win votes? When you pour nonsense like this on the fire...where are we going? The right wing is losing it's integrity. I've always voted Republican, but for the first time, I had a college kid call me a liberal. What's goin on?I ain't voting Democrat, but I ain't voting Republican no more either. I'm through with it.

Her recent TV appearances on Today, Hardball, and Crossfire almost have me convinced of this- maybe Andy really is still alive!

This book is just a rehash of the same old ... spun on television ever night of the week. Republicans and conservatives do not need to sink as low as Ann Coulter goes in this book, which is written in textbook liberal bleeding heart fashion.

The truth is Gore told a reporter he was sitting next to, that he had read in a Tennessee newspaper that Erich Seagal had used he and Tipper as models for Love Story. Love Story author Erich Seagal had been misquoted. He had used both Tommy Lee Jones and Gore as models for Oliver but Tipper was not the model for Jenny. The Love Canal Flap occured when the RNC doctored a quote by Gore, and the media went with the doctored quote. She was wrong about the New York Times not having Dale Earnhardt on the front page the day after his death. They did.

This woman is simply a liar who is disgracefully unable to defend her position against anyone capable of arguing with her.

There's a psychological term for this kind of pathological black/white thinking, wish I could remember what it is. But it is definitely a pathology (that means mental illness for those who don't like multi-syllable words).

A chapter on buffers and protein determination is also included. Although the book provides some examples (in useful detail) of each kind of assay it is NOT a comprehensive overview. The chapters on electrochemical assays and the techniques for enzyme extraction are incomplete due only to the age of the volume (>5 years old).

There's only two minor drawbacks of this compilation; firstly, these songs just aren't as elemental as the work on the first three albums, secondly, the cd begins with the number 1 as voted by the fan club and works its way down the list, thus becoming gradually weaker over the course of the cd.

I had heard of Less Than Jake, but didn't really know any of their songs. I saw them in concert last month, which kicked... I met them after the show and they're pretty cool. I bought their cd and love it to death. The best songs on there are ghosts of you and me, look what happened, and the last bulb has burned out/screws fall out. Worst songs are welcome to the new south and plastic cup politics. Plastic cup is honestly, a waste of their talent; nevertheless, they're good songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD","review":"Pathetic watered down pop music. To think that a band that was once as great as less than jake could produce this garbage. None of the classic less than jake sound is present on \\"Anthem\\", the ska and trumpets are almost no where to be seen, replaced with muted guitars and whiney vocals.Of course Less than Jake is still a great & talented band, and they probably always will be. This record is just trying too hard to sound current, jumping onto the pop punk band wagen.If your into Sum 41, Blink 182, New Found Glory, ect. Pick up this record. If you want to listen to a good Less Than Jake cd pick up Losing streak instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great","review":"Less Than Jakes new album Anthem is another great record from this Florida based ska/punk band. It is 14 tracks of pure genius so I would recomend this cd to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definatly still LTJ, but a little different","review":"OK, this cd is not that different from the old stuff. It is still very poppy. It still has a fair amount of horns in it, you just can hear them because they sound so quiet. It is not completely deprived of that really fast sound with \\"Best Wishes to Your Black Lung.\\" I think if it had to be a single genre I would have to call it Pop Punk more than ska. The sound is a little more produced rather than that raw sound they used to have. If you are a long time less than jake fan you will still like it, but not as much as the old stuff. Even though ive been being a little negative it has a few of their best songs ever on it. The science of selling yourself short, best wishes to your black lung, shes gonna break soon, and plastic cup politics are all awsome songs. Overall, i reccomend this to anyone who like Less Than Jake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit!","review":"some people are trashing this CD because they see it as a \\"failed aatempted for less than jake to become more mainstream punk.\\" That isnt true in my opinion. This CD has more of a punk feel than previous LTJ albums, but it still retians its ska roots and unique florida sound. I highly recommend this to any less than jake fan! It is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry","review":"I feel bad for anyone that bought this Cd. I feel bad for myself. It is a 13 dollars that I will never get back.

I first saw Less Than Jake at the Covered Dish (now closed) in Gainesville in I guess 1996. They have been a favorite band since then. On Anthem, I picked it up as usual with a Less Than Jake CD, not a note heard and they did not disapoint. The whole CD top to bottom is fun, angry and funny. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to get into Less Than Jake or any fan looking to increase the collection. The only thing that did disapoint a little was that one song \\"Look What Happend\\" appeard on their last album also, but the boys more than made up for that by adding a wonderful cover of Cheap Trick's \\"Surrender\\" I purchased this album the day it was released, the cd has left my cd player from time to time, but never for very long. Rock on guys, much love."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a chance","review":"For those of you who are into the ska side of less than jake, you might want to avoid this album all together, but if you like the way borders and boundaries was heading, pick up this disc. It showcases better written music than the past, with more complicated guitar, deeper lyrics, and much better production work. The band wants to show what talent they really have. Don't get me wrong, pezcore and losing streak are always in rotation in my cd changer, but I'm not as big of ska fan as I once was. For those who dig the punk with horns style that less than jake has emerged as recently, go buy this disc. If you want the fast ska.....try another band."},{"rating":"1","title":"just gotta say something","review":"i just kinda noticed that chris sounds... bad. listen to Look What Happened. the first part sounds like chris is about to crack up at any second. now listen to the borders and boundaries version. he sounds like he actually means what he is saying.

Hmmm? has anyone found the standard LTJ w-oh oh oh's? because anthem seems to be missing them... maybe its only temporary, one day they'll find their roots again. this cd has a lot more punk rock fast paced guitar riffs and less than interesting lyrics. the complete ska-ness that LTJ had so much of in Hello Rockview is now almost completely gone. now, the brass section is more like back-up music when they can't find anything else to play. yuk yuk... a few good songs, many bad songs, too many B-sides, yuk yuk too much filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"LTJ Loses their Ska","review":"Being a fan of ska from the Toasters to Reel Big Fish, to Bad manners and Less than Jake, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of horns and two tone fun in this album. The title really says it all, they were going for less ska more anthem. It was a dashing of expectations more than a bad album, though I will probably sell it used to someone later down the road.If you are looking for ska go with LTJ's earlier albums, if you want anthems and Blink 182-esque powerrythms, then go with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johny Quest has a point","review":"I remember buying Hello Rockview (my first, followed by buying others), putting it into my CD player, and just feeling the music inside me. It was amazing. I liked Borders and Boundaries less, though it began to grow on me, and Losing Streak and Pezcore were somewhere in between. This CD is in my eyes an outrage and sullies the good name of the band. There are a few decent songs, though many more songs which make me wonder what happened. If one looks at all the reviews, they notice a trend which puts older LTJ fans tending to dislike Anthem, while newer fans (riding the pop-punk wave? Perhaps) seem to like it a great deal. For older LTJ fans like me, you'll be much happier listening to your old CD's and staying away from this one; not knowing what happened to a very good band."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Definite Let Down","review":"Being a huge less than jake fan and looking forward to owning my 9th or 10th album of theirs, I was greatly let down when I picked up this CD and actually listened to it. Not that the album is bad, mind you, it's just not as good as it could be. The whole album just sounds like a much less catchy version of \\"Borders and Boundries\\" and although there are a few tracks that expand on the ska-punk style of LTJ, there is not enough to make it a great album. I'd be wary of picking this up unless you are a huge less than jake fan who needs to have all their albums (like me) or someone who just got into them at the \\"Hello Rockview\\" or \\"Borders and Boundries\\" phase. This may grow on my and I may completely change my opinion of the album, but for now, I'm just waiting for their EPs to come out and hoping that there's still some life left in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good ol' days...","review":"Remember that time you and your best friend went rollerblading, and fell and skinned your knees, but had the best day ever?

Buy Hello Rockview Instead","review":"First things first: If you want a true taste of what Less Than Jake sounds like (which is to say, good), then go buy Losing Streak or Hello Rockview. This watered-down, poppy, Blink-182 wannabe album will make Less Than Jake fans hurl. If you like Simple Plan, or any of those other crappy, punk-wannabe bands that are complete sellouts, then buy this CD. Less Than Jake has essentially gotten rid of what makes them Less Than Jake. The famous horns (that are essential for great ska), are almost completely absent, replaced by blaring guitars, and no sense of rhythm in the lyrics whatsoever. Plus, they have another band member singing most of the songs, so your going to hear alot of high-pitched voices for a punk band. A few songs will stay in your head for awhile, but for the most part this CD is garbage. Ska fans, STAY AWAY!!!P.S.: I'm not really 1. I'm 13"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ska?","review":"So yeah, I know ska is pretty much dead, but did LTJ really have to cross over?

I hope this isnt the end of them..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Less Than Jake we're talking about","review":"If your truely in love with a band, you must appreciate all of there music. Though Anthem may not be the same as losing streak, or maybe it doesnt have quite as much ska, it is surely a great cd. One way to describe it is \\" borders and boundaries gone right\\". You cant expect the same music over and over again, and thats what makes me love less than jake because they can change, and they can pull it off. Buy this cd. Also the re-done look what happened is very good. The science of selling yourself short is a new ska feel for ltj, but songs like the ghosts of me and you is a new punk feel for them also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never seen such a blatant sell-out","review":"I liked the \\"Losing Streak\\" album, it really wasn't so bad. Less Than Jake have always been a somewhat mediocre band in my opinion, however they have always maintained their integrity... until now. This album is the friggin pits, man. You're better off buying Shania Twain if you want to listen to corporate pop music, and that's an indisputable fact. This band has no business doing what Shania Twain does, it's an ugly embarassment.I don't know if you saw their \\"music video\\" which was heavily promoted during \\"The OC,\\" the new 90210-esque show for teens. It was truly sad, I could barely tell it was the same band. They looked like friggin clowns. I don't know about you, but if I were in a punk band, I would rather die than be shamelessly promoted like a can of friggin soda or a bag of friggin chips. Eat me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No!","review":"After giving this cd a couple run throughs and keeping an open mind about this cd, i came to the conclusion that this cd is horrible. Any one who likes this cd obvisously hasnt heard any of LTJ's older cd's, Losers, kings and the things we dont under stand, Loosing Streak, Pez Core. The only thing good that LTJ has recently put out was the re-release of Pez Core. Dont get me wrong, i still love LTJ, there still my favorite band, but dont waste your money on this cd buy some of their good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"I have been an avid LTJ listener for years and have always believed their music to have an enjoyable and unique quality. . .Now I hear ANTHEM. . .The uniqueness as well as ability to be enjoyed has left their music undoubtfully.First, LTJ's pride and joy used to be their hornsSecond, Their is already an infinite number of pop-punk bands out there, why did LTJ have to become one?I can't continue writing this. . .It is so sad, buy LOSING STREAK if anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Incredible","review":"I wanted to preview this cd before I purchased it, but it turned out to be unnecessary. I was wary of ska, but Less Than Jake's The Anthem is just incredible. It's fun and full of energy. The songs aren't generic punk, but rather interesting songs with a punk feel. I would recommend this cd to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 or 3 good songs in the bunch","review":"the best song on this CD is a cover. That's a bad sign. Not only that, but its only available on the \\"special edition\\" CD, not the normal CD (i think). I was supsicious of it when I looked at who they were on (i was hoping still with Fat) but they had gone to uber-corporate Warner Bros. Unfortunately their sound reflects that. They have effectively killed their horn section. When they do play, they usually are buried under guitars. \\"she's gonna break soon\\" has to be the worst of the bunch. Just annoying. \\"Plastic Cup Politics\\" is the closest they get to manic fun, and even that is shaky. You can see the lyrics coming from miles away, if you heard Hello Rockview, so there's nothing to engage your brain. I bought it for the Tshirt packaged with it. That hasn't let me down yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing what they do best....","review":"The most important thing you need to know first is that this is a good CD. Prior to the disk's release, the band classified the sound of this CD as a mix between Hello Rockview and Borders and Boundries and I totally agree with them. If you're into the lyrics, I think that this album rates as one of their best for thoughtful and cleaver wording in almost every song. My favorite tracks are (2) Ghosts of you and me, (6) Motown never sounded so good, (9) Best wishes to your black lung, (13) Brightest bulb.../Screws fall out. But, I like all of them. The only slight downside I had with the disk was the remix of Look What Happened (track 3,) which was on Borders and Boundaries. It's not that I don't like the new version, but I would have rather seen the space used for a new, unreleased song. This is a great CD and is definately worth the money. If you have never owned a LTJ CD, get Hello Rockview first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics","review":"I'd say this is a very good album, but not their best. It sounds more like their stuff on Pezcore (which I would rate as their best, maybe because it was my intro to the group). This one is much less horn or ska-influenced than the last couple of albums, a bit more on the punk rock side. I've only given it a few listenings, but I'd give it a solid \\"B\\" and it feels like it's going to grow on me more. Another solid disc from LTJ."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible CD, worth buying","review":"The Anthem by Less Than Jake is an album worthy of praise, and deserves four stars out of five.I picked it up expecting some sort of hard metal, or punk. I was too scared to even listen to it for several days, anticipating a horrible CD. I finally gave in and put it in my CD player, I couldn't stop listening to this CD from the moment it started until it was finished. This CD has many great reggae beats mixed with good rock tunes. The Anthem also has many great lyrics in many of the songs, and they are pronounced very clearly by the singers.This album doesn't receive a five star rating from me, because many of the lyrics are repeated several times. This brings down the over-all quality of the song, and of the CD in general. I believe that people who buy this CD will have spent their money wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"nah","review":"this is a good example of a good band gone way wrong. LTJ was my favorite band and will probably remain so, as long as i dont hear anymore of the songs from this cd. They are not ska or punk rock at all, but nothing more than sell outs, johnny quest was right i guess. If you liked the old LTJ, such as pezcore and hello rockview, you dont want this cd. It is nothing like the way they used to be. It could even be called terrible.

When I heard of this current storm coming I decided to at least take it out of the garage. I shovelled for an hour and my neighbor came across the street with his big boy machine to clear the drive where the packed snow is hard to move because of the city plows. The majority of the work done, I plugged in my Toro and made a pass in my back yard. Nice! It worked! The snow was approximately 8\\" deep and I did have to make 2 passes but the Toro threw the snow a good 20 ft and cleaned the snow to the pavement.All this time and my work could've been cut in half over the years.Easy to manuver, lightweight and does the job!

We had several snow storms dumping at least 6 inches of snow at a time. Of course once I got it, we didn't get but 2 inches! It blasted the 2 inches like it was nothing; I didn't get a chance to really test it until this year. 6 inches of snow cleared with no problems! A very nice feature on this unit is the crank'n aim snow chute. Some other models in it's price range only gives you the option to throw the snow straight forward.

When I had 12 inches last year I had showel, and decided to buy a snow thrower for next snow storm. This one is really a great product. I had about 7-8 inches of dry to medium wet snow. What took me 2 Hrs wit showel, with 2 people showelling, took only 30 mins. My drive way which can accomodate 10 cars, my walk ways, all doen in 30-40 mins, and stark clean. I was so impressed. My neighbor uses a bigger gas snow thower. His drive way still looked white after he finished cleaning. My drive way was so clean. The only problem is if it sucked a nice chunk of wet snow, it clogged the chut. I had to clean it a coupel times. It wasnt very effectibf on frozen ice, whihc was mainly the load pushed by the snow ploughs to my side walk. But other wise, this is great. Its a quiet machine compared to gas onces. I would recomend this anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Impression Not Positive","review":"The first time (15 minutes) I used the blower on a 2 inch wet snow fall the belt slipped off....

Toro should had sent me another belt free of charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly poor construction","review":"Toro should be embarrassed to have their name on this thing. Don't let the picture fool you, the case and grips are made of the cheapest plastic imaginable. That's right, the red housing in the picture is cheap plastic, not even good plastic. Grabbing the handle one is met with squeaks of protest by the ill-fitting plastics moving against each other. I cannot say how the thing works; the manufacture is so poor I could not get parts lined up to attach the handle.Let me put it this way--China must have outsourced its construction to some place with lower labor costs; if someone from China were to buy this, they're first reaction would be to ask, \\"who built this piece of junk?\\" Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it if you live in Florida","review":"Whoever designed this never ever assembled one! Fitting the handle is very difficult (too tight) and the screws for the snow-hood don't fit into their slots!Not very strong. Only good for 4-5 inches of snow.

However, I am a senior woman and it required assembly of the handle. I did not have the tools or strength to assemble it and had to take it to a local Toro dealer. They were gracious to do this for a charge. Highly recommend that one also purchases and uses a non stick coating made especially for snowblowers to prevent snow buildup and clogging. Handling of this snowblower was very easy and I highly recommend it for those people who can no longer shovel snow. Also in order for this snowblower to function at its best performance one must start the process of snow removal before the snow is not more than about 6 inches deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after less than an hour.","review":"I purchased the 1800 Power Curve for my husband as a Christmas 2009 gift. After 45 minutes of use on a flat driveway, the unit stopped working. It was taken to a authorized Toro repair shop. They advised that a belt had broken. The snow being thrown when the unit broke was powdery, not wet. While the unit was working it did a good job clearing the snow to bare concrete. The unit has been in the shop for eleven days and they still have not received the belt from Toro. I would not recommend this product till Toro addresses the belt problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKE DOWN ON ME","review":"SO I LIVE IN BOSTON AND WE GOT SNOW!!!

I had a hard time to find right tools to hold one in place, which tightened the other.The primary handle has the switch, very unsafe.

She refused to give details and justsaid she was not authorized to give a permissionon repairing over the phone.

Light, 1-1/2 inch snowfall totally baffled this so-called snow thrower. Snow just spun around, accumulating in the impeller, and never made it to the chute. Even my trick of spraying vegetable oil on the impeller and chute didn't help. My 12\\" Snow Fox purchased on Amazon three winters ago beats the pants off of this modified tin can.

I have to say that I was very disappointed in its robustness and appearance in general. It looks and feels like a cheap plastic toy with an expensive price tag. The plastic impeller (yes, the impeller is plastic) looked like something that would disintegrate into pieces the first time it hit a piece of ice. We decided not to buy one.I give it two stars because we haven't actually used it and so I don't have a basis to give it one star.At the very least, I would advise against buying one of these by mail order or over the Internet (sorry, Amazon) unless you know exactly what you are buying. Find one in a local hardware store (the toro website has MANY dealer listings all over the country) and go look at it first. Then decide if it's worth $300+ to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"End This Fantasy Now!","review":"If your snowblower will not handle the biggest, baddest drift left by the plow, or the worst snowstorm of the winter, it is worthless! Here in Minnesnowcold, where winter is the best 7 months of the year, nothing less than an 8hp, two-stage snowthrower is worth your money. The bad news is you will need to spend $800 to $1200, the good news is it should last 20+ years. A serious snowblower will handle the big jobs (that's why you bought it) and also make short work of those annoyance value snowfalls.

Not a good idea. Obviously a lot of people have had good experiences with it, but at least read the negative reviews in more detail before making up your mind.It seems that a lot of the people who don't like it have had the same problem. The belt won't stay on in even light snow and tightening parts to try and solve the problem on your own seems a little bit like sticking your finger in the hole to stop the dam from bursting. The problem will probably come back or something worse will happen.It sounds like about 1/5 of these are lemons, so if you like those odds, go for it. Just be prepared if you're that unlucky one like I was. It makes shoveling for an hour and a half even more agravating when you thought you weren't going to have to anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"more than 2 inches of snow-don't buy","review":"I am extremely dissapointed with the Toro 1800. I can't believe I paid $300 for this cheap piece of plastic. I only used it 4 or 5 times before the belt broke, and I wasn't even using it in very deep snow. I took it to a Toro repair shop, and they couldn't even fix it because the new belt would just keep falling off. I finally had to trade it in and ended up having to get a higher end machine, and Toro ripped me off on the trade in and didn't even give me full value for the trade in. If you don't ever get more than a couple inches of snow, then this maybe would work okay, but beware, mine broke when I was shoveling probably 3 or 4 inches of snow. I really hope my new Toro snow blower works better, if not, I am going to be done with Toro for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy this equipment.

I tried again, the same thing happen. After many attempts, I gave up, I manually did the drive way for less than 1 hour.

I have to reinstall the belt. The second snow day, the machine lost its power. Upon opening the cover, I saw part of the driving belt is torned and stuck between the wheel and the casing.

I purchased this little snow thrower, and wow, was I amazed! We received a 10\\" snowfall of heavy snow - not the light fluffy kind. I took this little guy out and ran him through the snow. At times I was afraid I would break it because I was putting such a heavy load through it, but it took it and kept on working. This little guy is fantastic! For such a small machine, this thing is a champ! I am totally blown away by its power and ability. While it doesn't have a big steel auger to dig up the hardened snow of tire tracks, I would still suggest it to anyone!

I can do a 100 ft drive with a two car turn around in about 20 min.The only thing I will add, some reviews talk about the plastic wheels. per the instructions the wheels are only to transport the blower. In use you raise up the handle so the front blade of the unit scrapes the snow off the drive. People also say the handle is too low, this is because they are trying to push it with the wheels on the ground in use. Like I said, not the proper way to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great snow blower","review":"I am a first time homebuyer and this is my first winter in Massachusetts as a homeowner. I bought this snow blower over thanksgiving and I think it has already paid for itself. It can easily take care of 1 ft of snow. It is light and also easy to assemble. Electric cord may get entangle.

It is used on a 75X50 foot driveway and sidewalks. It's smooth and blows snow twice as far as our 5hp gas Toro. It goes through snow as high as it's opening and will go through wet snow of about 4-5 inches. The cord can be a pain, but, not the pain of gassing up, oiling and starting a vibrating gas model. Sure it's made of plasic, very tough plastic. Like your car trim or most of every thing else you own. If you wait till the end of winter, you may find it at a nice sale price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"After reading the other reviewers' problems with this, I took their advice and tightened the bolts they suggested.

The snowblower worked fine for one storm, the enxt storm it stopped working. I put the belt back on because it came off and it immediately came off again.After reading the discussion here I found that the large bolt that goes from the right side through the center of the rotor to the pulley on the left side was very loose. This caused the left pulley to be out of alignment with the other pulleys and caused the belt to come off. I ended up having to pull the cover off on the right side of the snowblower and tightening the large bolt that holds the rotor. It was sooo loose that I could turn it by hand.When the snowblower worked, it seemed to work pretty well. It seems to do fine in snow at aobut 8 inches and has trouble with stuff that is deeper. So I recommend going out and blowing often so you don't have a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real time saver","review":"Great time saver, light weight and easy to use.

Stay away from rocks, watch the cord, and make a plan as to the best paths, and this will work it's magic for you. Money well spent.

But if you're trying to do a driveway with a 100' extension think again. I used it once (on the driveway) and it stopped after two 40-foot passes in 3-inch snow. It was still under warranty; the local outdoor power equipment retailer did the needed repairs and there was no more snow that year (speaks well of Toro and Amazon warranties). However, the year after, I tested it and it worked great. Did the required maintenance checks; also great. Snow fell; I plugged it in and spark came out the handle. I spent 5 hours shoveling. I would not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs like a champ","review":"I have owned and used this powerful little trooper for 8 Cleveland winters now and only now have had to easily replace the trigger switch in the handle (for only $10). Oh, if only more products were built like this! Well worth the money.A couple tips: if you don't want to worry about locking it, you can easily unlock it and jimmy the key out, or even take apart the handle easily and remove the locking mechanism altogether. Also, to prevent the extension cord from being pulled out, wind the cord around the loop on the other side of the handle once. Oh, and do yourself a favor and buy a good quality extension cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for an electric","review":"For an electric powered snowblower this machine does a pretty decent job.

It works best on \\"dry\\" snow but will work on \\"wet\\" snow also - it just wont throw it as far.

Right now we have moved 4 feet of snow fluffy and wet in the 25 days we have had the blower. We have a flexible 50 foot cord tied around the handle so that the plug will not fall out of the plug and the rest of the cord is laid to one side as we walk. The cord can be slippery if walked on-so keep it to the side cleared.We keep it inside the house when not in use on top of the cover of a large plastic bin with a towel under it to absorb the water.

I had to wade thru 3 ft of snow by taking it in layers, but it worked well and got the deck cleared in 1/3rd the time it would have taken with shovel. Even tho the snow was heavy, it did well and has done even better with powdery snow. The 30 ft of throw in the ads is pretty accurate. It took a little to work out how best to avoid running over the cord, but once I was trained, the machine did all it was supposed to do. I recommend it highly for snows under 1 ft and for deeper snow if you can manage lifting it and using it to go thru the deeper snow in layers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally very solid","review":"I ordered a Toro 1800 electric before winter started in Wisconsin. We set an all-time record for December snow, so I got plenty of practice with this. The Toro started off working really well, but then the larger belt slipped on about the 4th or 5th time I used it. I called Amazon and they immediately shipped a new one.Since I've received the new one (over a month and about 40\\" of snow), it's been great. I've had no problems. It handled a 13\\" snowfall a few weeks ago. Granted, it takes awhile, and the 1800 isn't super heavy-duty, but it's able to chip away at the huge piles and make pretty good progress. For anything under 8\\", the Toro electric is perfect. I'm able to finish our pretty decent-sized driveway and sidewalk in under 20 minutes.

If you watch the video demo you can see that the wheels are up off the ground. It just seems weird to me.It definitely does throw the snow ... and it's decent in a small snow ... but if it's a small snow it's not that hard to shovel it.During the first winter I had it it stopped working.

Then I smelled burning rubber and the rotor stopped. Opened the side panel to find the belt jumped and started to fray. After I contacted Toro, was told to retension the belt without instruction on how to do so. I did tighten the rotor and purchased new belts from Toro. My wife then used the machine - worked for 7 minutes and the same thing happened. This has been in the shop for the past 2 weeks - I'm eager to see if I'll get a replacement or refund as the snow is piling up this year and shovelling wasn't what I had in mind when I bought this. So far tremendous disappointment in the product and in Toro's customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked three times before breaking","review":"I bought this electric snow blower thinking our driveway wasn't big enough to warrent spending an extra $200 getting a gas one. Now I'm regretting that decision. This product is very poorly put together. In the last year I have only had to use it three times, but the most recent time it completely threw the belt. Now it's as good as useless. I've re-read the Amazon reviews and now I see that several people mention belt issues. I wish I'd put this $300 towards the cost of a well-made gas blower. I strongly urge anyone out there not to make my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Like many who have rated this item poorly, my experience has been that the product virtually never worked. After maybe a couple of pushes at a snowfall of 1-2 inches, the auger refused to turn (despite the motor moving). I've read the comments about a slipped belt, etc., but my problem seems to be that the auger/shaft connection is slipping (i.e., the belt is connecting to the shaft, but the auger is not turning. As a result, the product doesn't move any snow."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife likes it","review":"Since I have traveled a lot my wife asked for an electric snow blower to use while I'm away. She doesn't like dealing with volatile fluids and heavy machinery. The last one we had was a Craftsman that lasted 7 years. This unit is lighter and easier to handle and seems to work as well. The instructions say to tip the unit slightly forward when using. This allows the plastic case to sometimes rub on the pavement. Not sure how long the case will last under these circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro in real life","review":"Works OK but tends to blow up snow rather than directed where the chute is pointing. Makes for a cold experience as compared to a Honda or similar blower. This seems due to the lack of a secondary blower behind the primary scraper/blower. Very light weight, which is a plus, but the weight of the cord can unbalance the blower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, cord annoying, wind a factor","review":"Positive- it works every time, it's inexpensive, and it's durable.Negative- cord gets in the way a LOT; if you're in a windy area, you should probably get something with more power; and, I wish there was a way to rotate the thrower chute without having to bend so far over each time.Overall, good product, works as advertised, and lets me laugh at my neighbors who can't start their gas snowblowers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have had my Toro 1800 power curve for about 5 years and try to convince everyone I know to buy one. I live on Long Island where the average snowfall is 3-6 inches. Not enough to pull out most snowblowers, but the power curve is great. You would think the power cord is annoying, but you get used to it with one use. The advantage of it being so lightweight is that you can move it around very easily. It can't weight more than 30 lbs or so. Even today we had about 1 foot, and the power curve could handle it. Sure, you need to work a little harder, but it's better than shoveling. And although a big snowblower would have been better on days like this, we only get a storm like this every few years. Again, if you live in a place where the snowfalls aren't usually more than 6 inches on average, this is the best product to use. If you live where it snows a lot more, maybe not the best product for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"broken after less than 1 hour of use.. seemed quite powerful while it was running.simply not sturdy enough for the task it's designed for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working After the First Use","review":"I used this on my average size driveway while the snow was just a couple of inches. It worked great the first time I used it, but during a second snow storm, the motor started smoking. I opened the side panel and could see the belt was off its track. I had to take it to an authorized Toro dealer and repair store who contacted the Toro company and informed them that the motor was inoperable. The Toro company decided to send me a new machine which I am supposed to receive sometime in August or September, 2010. We'll see what happens. Overall, I do not feel this snow thrower is reliable and was disappointed with not being able to get any reasonable use out of it. I am probably better off buying a small gas snow thrower for next season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it but get it from a dealer","review":"This was shipped by Amazon \\"collapsed\\" and it was impossible to fit the handle together.

In heavy, wet snow, however, it does struggle. I have found in low temps from 20 degrees and below, the electric power cord will get very brittle, and I had to replace my $40 100' cords every year. This year I bought a Home Depot 100' cord with three portable outlets on a winder that has steel legs which I bolted to a heavy piece of wood to keep it stable and not dragging in the snow. I then purchased an 50' extension cord that is rated to be flexible to minus 50 degress. I keep all my cords in the house so that they stay flexible until I need them. I plug the flexible cord into the portable outlet and it give me 50' of freedom to move without having to lug a 100' cord. It also saves me money if I have to replace the cord, since I only have to buy a 50' extension, and not a 100' extension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I just got finished doing 3 houses with this machine. More than 18 inches of snow. Not only that, I was also able to get through the snow piled up by the plow at the end of the driveway. Because the machine is so light I just picked it up and placed on the top of the plowed in pile. The blower cut through the pile from the top down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I just used this to clear 8.25 inches off my 12 x 30 wood deck. It was light enough to carry from garage, and handled the job easily. Close to the house where the snow was packed from falling off the roof, I had to made two passes. My wife & son did our driveway, and it worked well there also.****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** Edited review, do not buy. This worked in very light duty 2 times. The 3rd time it smelled like something was burning. I let in cool, it ran 5 more min and quit. The local Toro dealer didn't want to service. The next closest dealer has had it since Feb. 2010, 6 mths still not fixed. Toro should have given me a replacement at no charge. Unfortunately I can't remove the stars. It deserves zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Trouble","review":"I wish I could say that the Toro 1800 was the answer to our snow removal problems, but unfortunately I can't. In fact, I can't even see how it works. The throat of the carriage bolts that are supposed to connect the discharge chute to the chute deflector are too big for the holes in the discharge chute. Because of this, it's impossible to tighten the bolts. I contacted Toro about this problem and they sent new bolts that were exactly the same size as the first set. Guess what: Those did't fit either (of course)! So I called the company again. The rep suggested that I remove the discharge chute by loosening the two bolts on the chute that hold it on. There are no bolts on top of the chute. The show thrower is going back to the dealer in the morning. What a waste of time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the Money","review":"This is a very good value for the price. It obviously won't be as good as a full-size gasoline-powered snow blower, but most of us don't really need that. This thrower is light (mine is hanging on a hook on the wall of my garage), maneuverable, starts right up with the touch of a button, doesn't need gas or oil, and does the job well. It cleans right down to the pavement, which is surprising, but it does it. It didn't throw my snow thirty feet, or anywhere close to thirty feet. I guess, to an extent, it depends on what kind of snow you are trying to clear, but I used mine for two different snow falls, and I'd say mine maxed out at around ten feet, but that was all I needed. This makes clearing the driveway sort of like vacuuming. For one of the snows, which was very wet, the chute clogged repeatedly, but I think a full-size gas powered blower would have had the same problem. I am very happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected.","review":"This past week we received around 18 inches of snow. I used this 4 times with zero problems. I have a steep driveway and I had no problem pushing this up and down. I also used it to clear snow from my deck and to clear an area on the lawn for the dog to do it's business. It works very well for clearing large drifts since you can just lift it up and shave off the top of the drift.UPDATE: 5/3/11Still going strong. We had a lot of snow this year and the Toro worked great. I did have to replace the scraper bar @ $12."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLENTY OF POWER TO THROW THE SNOW","review":"I am surprised with the power of this little Giant. We had 8\\" of wet snow couple days ago. I was unsure if this mechine was going to take care of that. Since this was the first time I was going to use the Toro, I made sure that everything was ready to go. I pluged in the cord and squized the handle. Wow!!!!!. What a power. I made a big cut on one side of driveway and worked perpendicular to that. It worked great. Even I was able to remove salted snow plowed by city trucks. Only thing that I did not like about it is the switch which you have to squeeze to keep it runing. After a while it gets though to hold it. I wish there was somekind of lock position on that. Other than that I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Guess I'm One of the Lucky Ones","review":"The phrase 'Some Assembly Required' strikes terror in my heart. But I was able to put this machine together in no time at all. And it worked like a dream from the first try. We had had a 12\\" snow and a few days before that had had a 4\\" snow that hadn't been shoveled and had crusted over. The machine handled it easily and I was done doing about 60' of sidewalk and 40' of double driveway in about half an hour. I have no idea how long the machine will last but I do understand that replacement blades are available locally should I need them.So far it gets my recommendation, admittedly that of a snow-blowing neophyte.Postscript: It's now 24 hours later and we've had another foot of snow, a slow steady snow that never let up, and I've used the snow-thrower two more times (and my son one more time) and it continues working like a charm.

It's junk save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Snowblower","review":"Does pretty good job. I have a medium to small driveway and it takes less than an hour to clear it.

I have moved 8 inches of snow at a time and have also moved the gifts that the snowplows have left. It is fabulous!Amazon sent it as quickly as listed and putting it together was no problem - I did it on my own in 10 minutes.I will have to get a cord holder as the cord does get in my way periodically.

The Toro just cut through the stuff like butter , throwing it an amazing 7-8 feet. I could not believe how well it performed. I have a 5.5 HP Gas Snow blower that I used to do my own driveway ealier. It actually took longer and I felt a bit more strained using it , than I did with the Toro 1800. I wasn't even breathing hard after the using the 1800 .So much so, that I decided to get a 1800 for myself. No messing with gas or oil. The 5.5 HP is really a good backup for the bigger stuff, but the Toro will easily handel 4-5 in. height snow with no problem.

It worked well and it is not recommended for this type of situation.The cord is a problem that I have managed to work out so I still say for the money this little guy is great. Sidewalks would be a breeze for it even though a longer distance.It is light weight and easy to handle at least for someone like me and like me is not saying much at all since I have little strength.I have rated 4 of 5 because of the distance it can throw and the cord but for any widow out there and more especially with arthritis this is the one that should work in most situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONSUMERS BEWARE - TORO IS TEMPORARY!","review":"I purchased the Toro 1800 Power Curve in Nov. 2005. It fit my needs here in the NY area where we do not have many snowstorms. The machine worked OK for 3 seasons. But this past December, it died. I was clearing a path and stopped the machine to change directions. It would not start again. I called the Toro Customer Service toll free number, and listened to the recorded message. In short, Toro tells you that if you are beyond the 2 year warranty (which really is a 6 month warranty since you only use the machine in the winter months), the cost to repair the machine is too expensive and to buy a new one! So Toro is telling you that after 2 years the machine is not worth repairing. A very expensive temporary snow thrower!

Good throw distance and whatnot. My one complaint is that since it is so light it tends to slide sideways pretty easily.The second storm, about 6 inches today, the blade stopped spinning and there was a whirring sound. I took off the side plate (which was bent and not installed properly) and it turns out the drive belt came off. So, I put the drive belt back on, but it will not stay in place anymore. The thrower goes about 5 feet and that's it.I am really confused about why this snow thrower got so many good reviews but mine stunk. Judging by the incorrectly installed side plate and all, I think I may just have gotten a dud. Anyway, I am now soured on this model and will buy a gas thrower.Incidentally, if you do decide to buy this item, Home Depot has a Rigid 100-foot 15 Amp sub zero temp extension cord for $65. It is a pretty good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine hate the cord","review":"The toro snow thrower has worked great for me, but not bullet proof.first use it grabbed the cord (my fault) and had to be totally disasembeled ( a harley tool kit works great) to untangle. a few weeks later found a rock in a snow pile about 2 inchs round and tore a chunk out of the auger, I have not repaired but torro still works great,It does not have enough power for the wet sloppy snow we are currently getting and clogs up alot (still better than a shovel).If I reorderd I would go with the gas model.cheersmike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"As others have expressed, the belt design on this snow thrower is terrible. After 30 total minutes of light usage, the belt was thrown off and shredded to pieces. Toro sent a new belt, which remained on for literally 15 seconds before it was thrown off and also shredded. The belt and pulley design is just terrible - something you'd expect a high school freshman studying engineering to design. The wheel which guides the belt is cheap plastic and contains no guide system to insure belt alignment. Toro customer service ignores questions and complaints in emails and just tells you to go to a dealer. Don't waste your money on this snow thrower - you're much better suited to spend a little bit more on something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I have never had a snow blower before and did not want anything too complicated maintenance-wise(i.e. gas-powered).

This does not seem right, and gives me little confidence in the long-term viability of the product and its design and materials.Too bad, since the idea of an electric thrower is appealing.Re the cord: annoying to have to constantly adjust, but you learn to live with it and navigate a path to avoid too much relocating of the cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value","review":"I purchased this thrower from Home Depot for the same price as Amazon, $240. Within 2 days, we were hit with about 10 inches of snow. The machine did very well, it moved through the snow pretty easily. It was a little tough getting through the bigger drifts, but it still managed. The biggest challenge I had was with the shoot. When moving heavier snow, it tends to wander off course. Further more, the tilt mechanism is pretty flimsy. When putting the machine together, I accidentally stripped the inside of the plastic hinge when tightening down one side of the shoot. I'll probably replace one bolt and replace the nuts with wing nuts, so it's easier to tighten the tilt. All things considered, this is a very powerful little thrower and cleans my drive in short order. It could be better made, but I'm still not dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good snowblower for the money","review":"This snowblower is a great choice for those of us who live in the city areas where we don't have 200 ft driveways to clear.

I had to remove the side cover and re-install the belt twice, which is a pain, and then finally gave up after the belt came off a third time.

The Drive shaft was loose, and the clutch kept disengaging from the plastic thrower. Then, after about 15 minutes, it completely stopped working. I opened the side cover to find out that the belt came off the pulley. Further study revealed that the drive shaft was loose, and the bearing on the pulley never got into its housing in assembly, causing the pulleys not to line up, and the thrower rubbing against its housing.I re-assembled the unit, making sure that the bearing sat properly in its housing, and the drive shaft was tightened. The pulleys DID line up. I did not yet have a chance to use it, waiting for the next storm!I don't know what I would have done if I were not a mechanical engineer, with my own engineering company for over 30 years.

While the snowblower works great, it is awkward to use it due to the power cord. It feels kind of like vacuuming but you don't dare run over the cord!

This would be a GREAT snow blower for sidewalks and even fairly long driveways and would suit my purpose perfectly IF it worked. When I bought it, I read all the reviews and determined that the complaints about throwing the drive belt were a small percentage and I would not have a problem. Was I ever wrong. This is an ideal snow blower if it works. Unfortunately, my experience was a bad one and I returned the blower for a refund. On the bright side, Amazon is great at making things right when the product is bad. I had no trouble getting a credit to my card within 5 days of sending the blower back. Kudos to Amazon.

It threw the wet snow about 10-12 feet or I could do a \\"half pass\\" and it would throw it about 20+ feet. Only downside was having to move the cord out of the way all the time but I'm sure with practice I can improve my path to eliminate this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I have used my snow thrower 3 times now and it has performed better than I expected even on wet snow. Very powerful and efficient. It took me 30 minutes to clear my 60 ft driveway instead of an hour and a half with a shovel. The electric cord gets in the way as you walk away from the house but it is worth not experiencing any more back problem. Also the wheels could certainly be bigger and sturdier but overall I would recommend this product for anybody who does not want to use a gaz snow blower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great snow thrower for the Females","review":"I was given this snow thrower 5 years ago when I moved to upstate NY. Being a female who hates huge power tools, this was perfect. It's true about the neighbors and their huge gas snowblowers. My 75 foot driveway is always the first one cleaned and done. Half of them can't start theirs or the chain broke or it's in the shop.This one is perfect. small enough to pick up and move to where ever you want, small enough for small areas, small enough to hang on the hook when finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice snow blower.","review":"Just had a nasty snowstorm in Iowa, has around 5-6 inches of wet snow, this little machine passed the test. It even did the end of the driveway with some chunks of ice.

My only concern is the scraper which seems a little thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Bought this unit 3 years ago. Broke on its first use. Fixed it; broke again after one use.

I tried it out this weekend on some two-week-old piles of snow sitting around in the nether regions of our driveway after the last big snowfall . . . the stuff that has congealed and is all crusty to walk over . . . stuff you'd never think about shoveling. This puppy ate it up and spit it out with no problems whatsoever. It did not break through the layer of ice that had formed at the bottom of the snow, but you can't expect miracles. I'd give it a \\"5\\" except I think some people would have problems keeping track of the cord. I'll take that over mixing gas and oil and worrying about fouled plugs any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible performance, and fun too!","review":"One hot day in September, I ordered the Toro 1800 Snow Thrower, then prayed for snow. I got my wish, and then some. I had every confidence that it would work well, but it has performed well above my expectations. Once I figured out the length of the electric cord, and how to maneuver around it, clearing the snow from my driveway was easy. Even better, it was fun - and fast.

It sounds like a vacuum cleaner, but it's powerful enough to throw the snow accross my double driveway and into the yard.We had a record 16 inches of snow here in OH last week, and I was able to remove the snow in 2 passes. It isn't really designed for so much snow, so it took 2 hours to do my 40 foot, 2-car, driveway, or about twice as long as it would have taken for under 10 inches of snow.I would have given 5-stars, but the handle and wheels are somewhat flimsy.

She really covered some interesting aspects of his life, especially with his wife.The only thing that brings it down from 5 stars is the incredible use of descriptive adjectives.In almost every paragraph in the book, she uses overly embellished adjectives. This may seem like not a big thing...but interestingly, she rarely, if ever, repeats a single one.Literally must have used every single adjective in the english language in this book. It seems almost humanly impossible to do such a thing. But she did it.That made it a harder read, at least the first 1/4 of the book until you get used to such an overly descriptive way of writing. All in all, a very good book though. Just be prepared, might want to get a dictionary just in case too.I would say to fully enjoy the period you should read Roosevelt and taft right after this one...so much going on with the new imperialism the US decided to take...and the fight for worker's rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"HARD TO TELL","review":"I am taking Source Naturals Methylcobalamin [Vitamin B-12] sublingual tabs in an effort to regenerate damaged peripheral nerves.

In a country whose artists tend to lay the paint on blut and thick, Richter is a notable contrast. He represents, along with Sigmar Polke, the best of a school of European painters who assimilated the American Pop Art scene. Don't expect the blazing cartoon colors of Lichtenstein though, Richter is a painter's painter, who has more depth and soul than Warhol ever could (surely by his own admission). But Richter's subject matter also comes from the mundane: a faded family snapshot, a clipping from a newspaper. Bits of emphemera blown up a hundred times and immortalized in oil paint. Clement Greenberg might abhore Richter's work more than the American Pop Artists: here is grand kitcsh by the hand of a master painter.*note that I speak mostly of Richter's representative work, of which the book mostly focuses on.

And why does Robert Storr have to try so hard to put himself at the center of everything?? I saw the Richter show in SF around 1990, so no, this is NOT \\"the frist American retrospective.\\" And Storr's dismissive (and often really uninformed) treatment of other critics (especially German critic Benjamin Buchloh, who's written on Richter for like, decades) shows what a limited writer and scholar Storr really is.

Then once into the body of the novel itself one has to get past Rita's rather sloppy use of law enforcement terminology and her even sloppier descriptions of law enforcement procedures.Blair Bainbridge is the only three dimensional character in this entire novel and he isn't even mentioned in the \\"Cast of Characters\\" (which is odd considering he is one of the regulars). At least with this novel the crime being committed is a white collar crime. These are the only two things in its favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book with Exciting, Always changing plot","review":"These series of books with Sneaky Pie Brown are always intriguing.

Others might give it a pass by calling it typical as a men's adventure novel, but the Destroyer has never been like any other men's adventure series, and to be typical alone would make it bad by Destroyer standards. But in case you're satisfied with typical rest assured Troubled Waters goes beyond that. The writing is bad even by the loosest men's adventure standards. It is horrific by Destroyer standards. I agree with the reviewer who suggests that series fans have made out the \\"terrible trio\\" of a few years back to be an impossible pinnacle (pardon the pun) to reach. Those books were very bad but so is this one. While it is true that true fans of the Destroyer know that Bamboo Dragon wins any race that doesn't make this turkey any better.

For a standard men's adventure, it was pretty typical stuff: trite plot, shallow characterizations, longer on action than intelligence. It was readable.However, Destoyer fans are used to a bit more. Most of us have read scores of these books, we KNOW who these characters are, what they think, how they interact. This book came across sort of blurred, as if written by someone who didn't quite get it, wasn't comfortable with parody and subtlety. It's not as blatantly bad as the worst ones...This book sort of dumbs it all down, sort of tries to turn this into just another men's adventure series. What do you think?

Told thru the eyes of his 9 year old daughter Mr. Baker takes us thru the amazing imaginary and real world of pre-teen life. In his rambling style he brought back many funny memories of the quirks of the social mannerisms of children. For those who were partially turned off by the sexually explicit Fermata and Vox, this is pure G rated fun. Also, don't forget to check out his recent book of essays \\"Lumber\\", which is a fun read until the last lumbering chapter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2* Too Long For Its Content","review":"Nicholson Baker is a very original writer, and he excels here at writing about a young girl's observations and fantasies in the third person. I thought he succeeded in this. The main problem is the lack of a plot: The myriad observations (divided into 54(!) short excerpts fail to advance a plot, although we do get deeper into Nory's head. It just gets very tedious after awhile.I would recommend this as a book from which to read excerpts, but Baker would have been better to write a shorter book, or to have some semblance of a plot.

Hell, if Salman Rushdie could go from Midnight's Children to Haroun and the Sea of Stories, it seemed like Baker could put together an engaging enough story.However.What I found was the mind, not of a normal or even a creative 9 year old, but of a 9 year old with significant ADHD problems. Reading the story told from her point of view was a lot like being in the mind of someone with serious personality disorders, fragmented, hallucinogenic and otherwise pointless.Having sworn off my old habit of finishing books once I've started them, I put this one aside and called it 'abandoned'.I cannot recommend this book unless you've done a lot of acid and/or enjoy speaking to people that have done a lot of acid and are no longer really 'there'."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2* Too Long For Its Content","review":"Nicholson Baker is a very original writer, and he excels here at writing about a young girl's observations and fantasies in the third person.

I especially enjoyed Nory's struggles to understand and triumph over the mysteries and trials of day to day life, and I appreciated seeing the world through the eyes a child who is creatively gifted, if not a natural-born scholar. However, there were far too many of Nory's made-up stories and fairy tales, which quickly became tedious.

It is awful! You can't find anything in it. If you are lucky enugh to find something label with a sticky label so you can find it again. When you do find what you are looking for it doesn't explain the subjust well enough to use the information. Look up heading and how to use them and see if you can determine which heading to use when. This book is junk and a waste of good money.

The index is terrible, it is impossible to find anything in the index so you are reduced to have 27 tabs sticking out of your APA manual. However, it is your bible when you're writing/editing an APA paper, so you're stuck with it.It is incredibly confusing and frustrating, especially the sections on number rules and citing internet sources. The sample papers could be more detailed.The sections on writing style are actually helpful. I teach an undergraduate writing course where APA style is required and these rules (e.g, conciseness and clarity) are helpful for students.So...in sum: this book sucks, but if you need to use APA style this is the best one you can get. Be prepared to embark on a journey of post-it tabs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much help for writing journal articles, and yet ...","review":"This book is very difficult to use, even for people experienced in writing journal articles and using style sheets.

I don't know the exact address for the website, but its something like apaowl. If you search apa and owl it should come up. I did buy the apa software, but I haven't use it yet.

I relied heavily on Chapter 4, with its extensive list of 95 examples of everything under the sun.I'd advise spending a little more and investing in the spiral bound version.

Obviously, this isn't true for the APA. This publication \\"manual\\" lives up to its name; it requires a lot of manual effort to make sense of it. Poorly organized and hard to use, the only reason it sells is because it's the standard reference for a required format, if people want their articles published, or students want their papers accepted. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless you're required to write in the APA format, in which case you have no choice. This manual alone is a good reason to avoid writing in the field of social science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get another book!","review":"The book is very poorly layed out.

Our instructor told us to annotate our bibliographies. I cannot find anything in this book on annotated bibliographies. So far this book has been literally useless to me as a resource.

I know, this is a review of the book not the style.I found the book poorly organized and hard to use as a reference. If you are required to write in strict APA style you will need this book, but don't expect to garner anything from it quickly. It looks like a manual that has been built up layer upon layer over many versions, instead of planed fresh, start to finish. The guide also often leaves room for varying interpretation.

I'm in the midst of writing my doctoral dissertation and the APA Manual has proved extremely useful for learning the proper way to cite references from various sources (like telephone conversations), use combinations of unusual punctuation (should the comma go inside or outside this parentheses?), and for presenting statistical output and tables.

Unappreciated by her Ivy League cad of a husband (who only married her because he had to), a part-Jewish working class girl goes undercover in Nazi German. The heroine's true worth shines through, and, after the requisite suspense and plot twists, she gets her Prince Charming. This book may not be great literature, but it's a satisfying read.

I purchased this TV for my husband for Christmas, 12/19/04. The TV is in our bedroom and is watched occasionally-not every day. After 13 months, the picture suddenly went black. I have sound but no picture. We took it to an authorized Apex repair shop and they told us it was unrepairable. They can't get parts from Apex and we would need a new LCD screen. Even if we could get the part, the cost would be quite high. For a TV that is watched 8 hours per week-MAXIMUM-and at a cost of over $1000, this TV should not be unrepairable. We are so upset, and feel we have been ripped off. The warranty is only good for 12 months. I urge everyone to NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM APEX. You will waste your money.

There's another book starring a Ballantyne relation that follows this (and the recent \\"Triumph of the Sun\\" an afterthought), but it's dispensible and adds nothing to the arc of these three books.This is a satisfying closer to the saga-- it tells the story of the birth of Rhodesia, and its death. It's a very bloody tale of black against white-- for those who want a good notion of the historical roots of Zimbabwe, these three books can't be beat. Smith is sometimes accused of racism and sexism, but he's telling a story where these issues can't be ignored, and he does a reasonable job of representing both viewpoints, invader and invaded, black and white, winners and losers.

The author's attitude and arrogance is unbelievable at times with comments like \\"if you missed that then you obviously were not paying attention\\" - how distracting and annoying is that?

The title should have been \\"MCSD for those who want to feel like dummies.\\" The atitude of the author is arrogant and degrading to say the least. This might have been tolerable if the material was actually relevant to the exam. But this is not the case. And worse yet, it adds nothing to your knowledge but a cloud of incoherent thoughts and big acronyms (plus the high blood pressure and the urge to assert your IQ of course.)The case studies -- which are the bulk of the 70-100 exam -- are poorly chosen and the solutions are unhelpful. I don't know about you but the phrase \\"If you answered so and so, then you weren't paying attention to much of anything\\" doesn't constitute a good explaination to me. And I could have sworn that that same phrase came about more than 20 times throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst technical book I have seen in a long time","review":"This book fails in a bad way. It needs to analyze the requirements of the reader and then present that solution (a new book). The scenarios are full of errors and editorial shortcomings and lack consistency in their approach. Statements like \\"this answer is obvious\\" help rationalize many answer explanations. The author's whimsical comments are nothing short of irritating and seem only to fill in gaps that could be used to present an erudite exposition of the subject at hand. If you are concerned with learning something besides what might be on the test, books like Instant UML offer a detailed and professional perspective on business analysis and requirements. But any good modeling books will provide the context and basis for analysis through implementation. The only reason this book gets one star is because its glossary is adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transcender - YES - Ezzell - No","review":"I found this book full of errors, weird unrelated opinions, and pretty much useless for 70-100; Transcender is MUCH closer to the test and points you at the right places to get the right info for your questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"nodda","review":"Unfortunately, this book does not prepare you for the exam.

The camera can't seem to align the lens properly - when you push the button to zoom out, it zooms in and then starts to re-zoom. Cycling the camera on and off can help - but its really not acceptable.So, if you're looking for a full featured starter camera, this ones great, just don't count on it lasting very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great camera for the price!","review":"We love our FinePix! We bought it just before our 1st baby was born and she is the most photographed baby ever! The camera is as easy to use as the most simple of 35mm cameras, and the photos that we have shot are excellent, both on the PC and in print.The only complaint is that it can take a little too long for it to be ready to use when we switch it on - mostly because we are trying to snap a baby who stays in the same pose for approximately 2 seconds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very impressive camera at a great price","review":"This camera is really an incredible deal. It has more features for the money that any other camera in its range. Other cameras that are similarly priced lack the 2-megapixel sensor or optical zoom, but the FinePix 2600 has both. It takes very nice pictures and is very easy to use. It comes with a 16MB card that provides more than enough initial storage, and new cards can be purchased up to 128MB. But even the standard card holds a lot - 60 at the default setting, 10 at the highest setting. The optical zoom is a great feature to have, and the movie mode is also very useful. Despite what some specs may read, it has both a macro mode and a self-timer. Overall, this is the best camera to buy in its range, that is, more than a toy but not high-end. It is more than adequate for the casual or amateur photographer. It should serve all your photography needs for quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Flimsy Battery Door [$] to Replace Under Warranty!!!","review":"After three months of moderate use, the metal component that holds down the batteries in the camera snapped off. Without this in place, the battery door cracked (from the inside out) under the pressure of the batteries. After sending the camera to Fuji for repairs, they sent me a bill for [$]! They said it was an impact crack which is not covered under their marginal warranty.I asked the gentleman at the call center if they would have repaired it free of charge, if I had sent it to them when just the metal component had cracked off. He said probably. Since that component breaking off in the first place was to blame for the cracking I am baffled as to why I had to pay a quarter of the original cost of the camera to have it repaired.It was a great camera, with the exception of this design flaw. AND IT IS A DESIGN FLAW, regardless of what the folks at Fuji say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"Wow! This camera is awesome. I just got it yesterday. I love it. Great picture quality, great zoom, great camera. There is a little bit of a delay between the time you press the shutter and when it actually takes the picture, but it's not bad. The movie mode is pretty cool. It might cost more than the beginner wants to pay, but it's worth it.. If you're a beginner, go get this camera. I didn't even read the manual, and within minutes I was taking pictures.Oh, by the way, you might want to get another set of NiMH batteries and a charger, because you sure don't want to use alkaline, eats them like they're nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to love it but now bugs make it unusable!","review":"This was a great camera when I got it 1 1/2 years ago. I loved the size, the movie mode, and most of all the quality of pictures I could get from it. I always got lots of compliments on the quality of the pictures this took. Sure the indoor pictures on the camera were bad without flash but I could live with that because this camera had everything else...until then lens cover sensor malfunctioned. I did not drop the camera or even handle it rough at all (not even a scratch on it). Now everytime I try to take a shot the camera thinks the lens cover is closed and it retracts the lens. You will spend time setting up a shot, get it perfectly zoomed and then bzzzz there goes the lens!

These two items alone save you money. After buying any ditital camera, one must go out and buy a bigger card and boxes of batteries. With this camera, my only purchase will be for a 128mb Smart Card. ... The only reason I don't give this camera a higher rating is because of the software. I think it is weak.

(we keep it at high resolution). Very happy with 8x10 prints. And all web or PC viewing of photos is very good. This is not a top end camera, but for point and shoot, great results! I highly recommend this camera. The software that comes with it is also quite good, I ran it under windows 98 and now windows XP, with no problems, and the batch save and batch resize options are great for bringing 2meg pix down to 50k jpeg's for uploading to the web server.

On top of being 2.0 mega pixels it has a 3x optical zoom--at this price range that is a good combo. The only other thing I would like to add to the many other reviews is the need for the ac adapter and a few extra batteries (it doesn't include the ac adapter and the batteries go quick, but last long enough for general/vacation/etc. picture taking. This camera serves as a good pc-cam as well. I am in a wheelchair (muscular dystrophy) and having limited physical ability, I found this camera to be very easy for me to use. The LCD screen is big and clear enough for me to use the camera without having to make undue strain. I was not disappointed at all in this product. A very good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera!","review":"I selected this camera for a number of reasons (resolution, optical zoom, no proprietary batteries, and a good price) and have been absolutely thrilled with it. It was a snap to learn to use. The software is pretty straightforward and painless to use. The batteries last longer than I would have expected.As with ANY digital camera, invest in rechargable batteries and a charger (Rayovac has a nice 1-hour charger), and a nice big memory card, and you'll be happy as a clam. I know I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best point-and-shoot camera","review":"You can not find any better point-and-shoot cameras than this:- Affordable price- 2 megapix which is more than enough for printing, and the photo quality is really good.- superb features including 3X zooming and PCCAM- One more great thing is that use can even use ALKALINE battery when your Ni-Mh battery runs out(at that mode you can not use the LCD screen, but you can still take photo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Camera for the Money","review":"... this is a very nice camera. It is a nice package, comes with the rechargeable batteries and a charger and 16mb smartcard. This better than most digital cameras esp in this price range. The picture quality is very good, if you have a good quality printer you will get nice prints with this camera. You do have to hold the camera still or many of the pictures will blurr, and pictures taken at night are dark (but most can be repaired with basic picture software). You will probably want to get some additional photo software, since the included software is bare bones. Overall I am enjoying this camera very much and would definetly recommend this camera to my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy!","review":"I love this camera. It's easy to use and good price too. It's charger and battery kit and 16MB card makes it better than competitor's 2M pixel offering.

I have never heard Elvis Presley being referred to as the White Jackie Wilson. Although Jackie and Elvis have often been compared to each other in their looks and style; Jackie Wilson was in a league all by himself and should never be considered on the back of anyone but himself; Mr. Excitement.

Yes it is worlds better than a Sears 8\\" bench saw, but this is a diffent class of saw. I expected a better product. In case you think I am just incomptent in set up. I used to be a tool and die maker and set dies to within .001 of an inch. Maybe I just got a lemmon. Maybe they just need to work on their Quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"The other guy is right, Buy a DELTA","review":"Has this saw now for two years, finally getting around to bad- mouthing this pile. Two nice things about it; heavey duty- cast table, accufence is great. Motor I think is weak. The rest is junk. I cant tell you how many times I've has this saw upside-down parts everywhere trying to get my blade adjustments to work smoothly. Maybe the freight co. dropped it but the blade height adjustment fights me the entire way up and down. I finally took the spiral gear apart and filed the teeth down. That seemed to make it better. If I had to do it all over again I'd buy a DELTA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoken Albanian","review":"Maybe this book is not the worst, but it is far from the best, too.A weak point is that the lessons at the end of each unit have no parallel English texts, unlike the phrases at the beginning. Moreover, not all units are recorder on the tapes. And what is most awful, the quality of some tapes is disgusting. I ordered this item, then replaced it, but the second time it was even worse - absolutely nothing was heard from the first tape. That is why I returned the textbook for the second time.Maybe COLLOQUIAL ALBANIAN represents the Kosovo dialect, but it is better, in this case. I also would recommend the short dialogues from 101 Languages of the World. There is also PILMSEUR ALBANIAN, which I do not know, and only hope it is good.Why did Amazon send me this 2 times, without checking the quality of the tapes?

But when I recieved it. Each song listed only has a verse or two and is part of a 3-4 song blend all crammed into a 4 minute song track. So you really don't get the full enjoyment of the whole song. You only get about a minute of each song. The rendition of danny boy was terrible. The song has a terrible background music you'd find on an electric piano keyboard under cheesey DANCE beat. Seriously a dance beat to Dannyboy? Other than the dannyboy fiasco and the briefness of each song grouped on each track, the music was pretty good, I loved hearing all the songs my grandfather and his brothers would sing, like Moonshiner. But I would prefer to listen to the full version of my favorite pub songs. Not the condensed combinations of one or two versus of several songs crammed into one track on the cd.

The story shows all the naughty things a puppy does and how Widget isn't doing his job to dog sit him. At some points in this story I liked the drawings but for the most part I didn't. Some were creative, sketchy and watercolored well and others were dull. The word 'puppy' appeared atleast two times on every page and became drone after a few pages.

The hero, Rick is a real red-blooded American hero--intelligent, brave, knowledgable, straightforward, and clumsy but endearing in his romancing. Raymond John gives us not only a bird's eye view of Malta, but he contrasts it delightfully and realistically with Missouri through Rick's view of life and recollections. Rick has dropped all in America's heartland to come to his brother's aid who has disappeared as he hunts down a priceless work of art. But the brother was really after something much more mysterious and valuable, something that might have untold power. But Rick suspects what his brother sought is a sham, but a real danger of untold power does threaten a continent of people. The fight scenes are realistic and scary.

We spent alot of time fiddling around at the tree limb to get it the right height, but the ropes seemd to stretch no matter what we did.

My kids love it! The only problem we had is that we hung it from a branch that was probably 9 or 10 feet hight and the rope that they provide is not nearly long enough so we had to add some chain at the top. Would have rather not had to do that. Also the knots near the swing that are supposed to adjust the height of the swing didn't stay tight enough so we had to just raise the ropes and just push the knots all the way down.

Natural radiation that nature exposes us to all the time? Why no. Every bad thing is caused by radiation from bomb testing and reactors. The author claims that these evil technologies cause a long laundry list of evils.His statistics could have just as easily shown that the various problems supposed to be caused by radiation in the past 50 years (WW 2 to now) could have been caused by the increased used of home air conditioners, fast food joints, TV dinners or any host of other things that have entered society in the last 50 years.This book is bogus science.

That battery back-up feature is why I bought this clock. It says it has such a feature on the box, in the Amazon description, and in the customer reviews. HOWEVER - Read the battery door cover, the instructions, and you'll find the battery is for the clock memory only. I tested the unit to be sure. NO ALARM AT ALL WITH POWER FAILURE. Sure the alarm will sound as soon as the power is restored but who knows when that will be. Too me, that renders the clock worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good, stylish -- buttons can be improved","review":"The clock looks cool and the front can serve as a mirror. The dual alarm feature is very useful -- I can set two alarms, one for myself and the other for my wife. You also have choice to set the alarms to either beep or radio.However, the switches on the left side are quite awkward. Whenever I switch them to set alarm or time, my other fingers always accidentally touch the top buttons and active the radio -- sometimes wakes up my wife, not cool :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected.

None of its characters is likable; the plot requires a tortured suspension of disbelief; Dooling misleads the reader with his descriptions of courts and his analysis of legal issues; and, worst of all, is sophomoric in its treatment of sex and sexual issues. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw's review of a symphony he attended, the best chapter in this book is the last -- by then the reader knows the ordeal will soon be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Bad","review":"When I read awful books like this one, I am amazed at how they ever got published in the first place.

Lucky me. Dooling combines a medical novel, a legal thriller, a sex comedy, and a sf novel while providing genuine character development ... and a book-length consideration of the meaning of free will. It's a funny, thoughtful, provocative book and total fun to read.After I finished, I went back and read everything Dooling has written. What a find! This one is my favorite, but the others are terrific, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a black humorist's approach to law, technology and values","review":"I listened to the unabridged audiobook version of Brainstorm and was absolutely intoxicated by the contoversial Judge Stang. Although Joe is the protagonist, Stang was so outrageous and hilarious, I feel complelled to listen to the portions he dominates repeatedly. It is quintessential vengence on a legal system that has long ago subverted moral justice, by an errant judge -- with impunity. His scenarios for torturing attorneys and their overstuffed egos are unbridled. George Guidall's performance on audio sends this character's persona over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea poorly executed","review":"This could have been a terrific book. The plot is exciting, the characters intriguing. It's a shame it is so poorly written. The author has a difficult time with dialogue. All characters speak in the same wise-crack mode as the protagonist. He also has an unpleasant habit of including long discursive passages, the main purpose of which is to expound on his theories of human behavior rather than to advance the plot or develop the characters. And, ouch!, those sex scenes. Clearly not his long suit. Perhaps his editor suggested that he spice things up, and so he pasted these scenes in at the last minute.Perhaps he needs a new editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate, lust, synapses and oral arguments!","review":"Not the Clinton scandal, but Richard Doolings latest journey into the small, dark crevices of the soul and brain. While I didn't enjoy this as much as White Man's Grave, nobody gives one as much information in so entertaining a way as Mr. Dooling. This book is almost like going through your first year of law school without being subjected to the Socratic method. Who would have thought so much was happening in St. Louis, of all places. Sure the main character is kind of a wimp and the ending takes an altogether too nice of a tone, but there are plenty of thrills along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like i liked it","review":"gives me the perfect curve in for my shoulder length bob.

Yes? OK, then - I didn't get it! Couldn't understand the point of it. Maybe cause it seems like these characters couldn't understand the point of living.

This isn't the first one of his I've read - the fact that I can't remember the title should say how much of an impact it made on me. This one started off great, but seemed to get bogged down in flashbacks that (as far as I got) was only just barely associated with the overall story. I liked the twist on the detective's character flaws, but it got old quick and the plot seemed to wander.

The reader is taken on journies that include meeting Osama Bin Laden in South America, a terrorist training camp in the Bekka Valley, an adventure in Beirut, encounters with Chechen's.

The Grateful Dead, the Clash, John Hurt, and dozens of others told a story about the night Stagolee shot Billy in a bar fight. The words may have varied, and the story may have seemed archetypical, but there was something going on here. Cecil Brown has traced the story to its origins: a bar in St. Louis's red light district in 1895, when Lee Shelton gunned down Billy Lyons because Lyons had touched his hat. Brown has done the research and provides interesting insights into urban culture and race relations in a time and place not far removed from slavery. He reviews different variations of the song, looks into the lives of the real-life protagonists, and discusses why the story made such a good source for songs for the next hundred years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and stable enough for even the biggest cats!","review":"When I was looking for a window perch for Michiko, a Maine coon mix who weighs about 17 lbs, I was worried that my window sills were too shallow to hold a perch steady when she would jump up there.

Samsung offered no concessions or discounts on the repair, as the warranty had expired after 12 months.

For the price, the performance and size was great. The downside to this TV is that it fails all too quickly. I now have half of the screen in a black gradient while watching shows. The gradient will come for about 10-20 seconds at a time and then disappear. Samsung is unwilling to address this problem and will do nothing to help you get it fixed without charging just about as much money as the TV originally cost (and now LCD 46 inch TVs are half that price...so do the math there).

Eagle USA delivery service brought the tv into our house, moved the old tv, and removed the new tv from the box for us. Great work by Amazon and Eagle USA! Now we can also see why Consumer Reports rated this LCD television #1 in its reviews. The antiglare screen on the Samsung LNT4661F works beautifully in our bright family room. No reflections on the screen makes the enjoyment all the better during daytime. We also love how the tv stand turns, so you can easily move the direction of the tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased but sad about price guarantee from Vann's","review":"We got this set on 11/22 -- and we do love it. It is awesome and you will love it. The only problem is that we ordered it from Vann's -- twice they did not answer questions based on the shipment; and the price dropped $350 within 22 days of ordering and they would not honor the price guarantee like Amazon does for 30 days, only 15 -- they would not even give me what the difference was at 15 days.I was very disappointed in their customer service and will never order through Vann's again. Amazon has honored this price guarantee in 30 days. Live and Learn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I used the web and consumer reports to decide on what to purchase. The tv is totally awesome. My husband is ecstatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Great TV, Great job Amazon!!!!!","review":"After researching and researching big screen TVs, switching from model to model, I finally decided on this one. What tipped me over the edge was the fact that Consumer Reports Magazine rated it #1 LCD and the fact that Amazons price was so good. Amazon gave me a delivery estimate of December 14th, I received it on December 9th, only 5 days after I ordered it. Eagle delivery company brought it in the house, unpacked it, waited till he saw the picture, and then took all the trash with him. Plus it was on a Sunday, so I didn't even have to take off work!! TV is really beautiful, I hooked it up to an upconvert DVD player and popped in Lord of the Rings, it was like i was in the Tv. I can't wait to get Hi Def service from Direct TV!! I buy alot of stuff from Amazon but this was probably the biggest item and they still out performed my expectations. Great Price, Great TV, Great job Amazon!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture","review":"This is a great television. The picture is bright and clear, it has many different connections for whatever cables you have, and the menu clearly walks you through your options. The blacks are rich not to forget how attractive and stylish the tv itself also is. My only concern is the sound quality. I'm getting a humming sound when the tv is turned up past 22 but it might be my Charter supplied audio cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this","review":"The no glare screen is perfect if you have a lot of light in your room. This TV has a great picture and the sound is so so, but I've got mine hooked up to surround sound so it doesn\\"t really matter. I know of two other people with exactly the same TV and they also love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great deal","review":"After shopping this product at Best Buy and Circuit City, bought it from Amazon and saved over 30%. Better yet, Amazon's price included delivery and unboxing in my home.Oh yeah, the TV is really nice too! Looks fabulous right out of the box and auto programs the existing HD broadcasts on Comcast's system (although the Channel Numbers aren't the same as when using their DVR).Absolutely no regrets with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"46\\" lcd","review":"picture is great and features are very nice. complicated inputs are limited for video. my sony has more video inputs than this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome TV So Far","review":"I ordered this TV last week and picked it up over the weekend at the shipping facility. So far it is amazing. The picture quality, brightness, and contrast ratio are outstanding. Standard def. TV looks fine...HD TV looks nearly as good as some HD and Blu Ray DVDs I've seen. Normal DVDs look great as well. My XBox 360 is stunning on this set. So far no ghosting or any other kind of distortion, even on fast moving games like Gears of War or Rainbow Six Vegas. The menu system for the different options is nice and easy to use. I would highly recommend this TV for anyone looking for a high quality, but fairly \\"inexpensive\\" HDTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen developed defect after 2 years of use, $1100 repair needed","review":"This TV was great while it lasted. But after about 2 years, the screen developed a shadowy defect on the right side of the panel. Looked like a swoosh running from the top of the screen to the bottom, not uniform. Turns out the screen panel was defective. Being out of warranty, the expected cost to fix was over $1100. I'm very disappointed that this TV only lasted 2 years. With the rate new televisions are developed and released to market, it's impossible to know if what you're getting is going to be quality. I just figured I should share my experience in case it helps someone avoid a purchasing mistake down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"I had this tv for nearly 3 months and am very satisfied with my purchase. In the beginning the brightness of the tv is a bit overwhelming in a dark room but after a few hours it will adjust to normal. 720p and 1080p video is exceptional and will measure up against any tv in the 10:000 to 1 contrast arena. The only knock I have against this tv is that in dark scenes, it is hard to see the picture clearly. It's a disappointment but this may be common in many LCD tvs. Other than that great tv and great deal from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung LNT4661F","review":"The picture is amazing but the sound quality is dissappointing. I was limited by the space I had to put it in so my decision was based largely on the size and the review from Consumer Reports (who said the sound quality was excellent). If I had unlimited space I would get a TV with larger speakers on both sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Addition to Addition","review":"I recently installed the 46 inch Samsung flat screen on a wall in a newly added room in our home. It is an attractive unit and works extremely well."},{"rating":"1","title":"lnt466af-","review":"wow did I have high hopes for this set. I did my research and decided to go for the brand new Samsung LNT-4661F. I compared it to the Sony, Sharp Aquos, and Runco Crystal (too expensive). Well I went with for the Samsung- it has the nicest look and feature set (per dollar) of any of the sets. After spending all weekend wiring my attic and wall mounting the set, I finally power on the set- and WOW what a POS! The image processor couldn't keep up with any motion. I tried HDMI, component and over the air and all produced a red 'dotting' on white areas of motion. Now I have packet it back up and am going to exchange it for another. I hope the next one has the bugs worked out. Samsung, nice job testing your sets before shipping them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote Code unavailable","review":"I bought this TV for a new home theather and my installer says Samsung has not released the remote codes for this TV so that a universal remote for this and other products could not be used. The universal remote would handle my new IPOD, DVD,CD player and surround sound system plus TV. We called the universal remote company and they confirm Samsung has not put the codes on thier web site so that purchaser of this new TV can download for a universal remote. I hope they are wrong and that Samsung will correct this soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS TV WILL NOT LAST YOU 18 MONTHS!","review":"OMG I didn't realize everybody else was having such a problem with this samsung, thought I was the only one with a lemon. About a year and a half after ownership the tv started cycling/clicking and turning on slowly with static/snow all over the picture and things have gotten progressively worse, I'm expecting it to crap out any day now. I thought Samsung was a great co. but they really cheaped out on their products, these things won't last 2 yrs! Is there a class action lawsuit on this???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this TV","review":"Had the 15 month issue that others are complaining about. Samsung did nothing, not even a coupon for repair or purchase of another. $1700 down the drain. That works out to $100 per month of use before it goes bad. You can go to Ren-A-Center for less and get it replaced if it goes bad. No more Shamsung! Sony Bravia, yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This TV sucks!!!!!!Don't buy any Samsung product even if it's bottled water.","review":"I bought this TV on amazon at $1689.25. After a year and a half, it started having streaks of horizontal lines across the sreen, uneven color, dark spots and multiple images. At first, we had to hit it from behind to sort of stabilize it.Even then it still had at least two or three horizontal lines. Now the screen is completely black; no images, only audio.And of course the warranty ran out a year after purchase.Unless you want to throw your money away, stay away from Samsung products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red vertical line after 18 months","review":"We were happy with this tv for about a year and a half when a vertical line started appearing on the side of the screen. We called Samsung but since we didn't buy the extended warranty Samsung wouldn't help us and the repair is $1200 for a new panel. Who is going to pay $1200 for a tv repair? So buy the extended warranty, or better yet, don't buy a Samsung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great TV...for the first year","review":"Had I reviewed this TV within the first year, I would've given it 5 stars. But 21 months after I purchased it, I've started having problems with the picture. When I turn it on, the screen is divided into 4 horizontal segments, with ghost shapes appearing below the images. At first, maybe about a month ago, it would \\"warm up\\" in a few minutes and the picture would become normal. It's gradually taken longer for this to happen... now, it's about 25 minutes or so. And then this week, a new development: After being on for an hour and adjusting to a normal picture, it then reverted to the horizontal lines/ghost shapes. Since I often only have time to watch TV for 30 or 45 minutes at a time, this has been especially maddening. I would've been better off keeping my older Toshiba, which is still working great for the friend I gave it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless brand","review":"I purchased a Samsung Lcd Tv in June 2008. It looked great ,the picture quality was great. However a week before Christmas it would not power up . No picture no sound . I called Samsung and they said take it in for service. The diagnosis was bad lcd screen , probably bad circuit board. The cost of repair is more than the cost of a new tv. I paid 699.00 for this set and now it is worthless. There are so many complaints on the same issue with Samsung tvs . I wish there was some remedy for this but the only recourse is to spread the word dont buy Samsung..They will not stand behind their product after one year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop working after 18 month!!!!","review":"This TV stopped working after 18 month.

Oh wait it does... The $1600 delivered I spent might have seemed like a bargain, but it didn't account for the $500 more that I would immediately drop to get a PS3 and watch Blu-Ray Discs on this magnificent beast. While watching 1080p movies through a decent HDMI cable you know longer sit their evaluating image quality, you are too busy ducking the blast from Voldermort's wand. The only thing that is a bit disappointing is the speakers. They are on the rear of the TV and and they have poor freqeuncy response. I have a good home theater system, so it's not a big drawback, and frankly a $50 sub-satelite combo can make a huge improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this TV!!","review":"This TV started giving us trouble a few months out of warranty. We tried to get it fixed with no luck. It shows 4 horizontal lines on the screen and ghosting of images on the right side. After 30 minutes it warms up and reverts to normal. And I find multiple accounts of this exact problem listed on the web. (in addition to others) What a waste of money, this cost too much month to be trouble free for not even two years. I personally am rethinking Samsungs in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem without solution","review":"I bought this set in June 2007. The first day when it was out of the 1-year warranty, the problem occurred -- TV with sound but no picture. Later on I figuured that this is a problem that will show up when it is humid but will go away if it is sunny. Fortunately I had the AmericanExpress. Howevever the repair shops can't really fix it because it is highly intermitent and goes away when the rain stops. I have been struggle with it and talk to different repair shops and American Express. But there seems to be no solution to this problem.

This tv will work great for 15 months too 31 months(mine), please read only recent reviews of this 1800$ bic lighter.Instead of trying to explain what my tv does here is a video I found on youtube that shows it, a video is worth a thousand words.[...]again, DO NOT BUY!!!Just saw I can't link youtube here(sorry about that amazon)so go to youtube and paste this in the search box-> Samsung LNT4661f problem brown screen <- the video that comes up shows what mine and many others are talking about with the picture.No clicking or going on and off on its own yet, but there is a video on youtube for that also.so please, from the bottom of my heart, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Samsung...$1700 and the TV heads for the trash!!!","review":"Like so many others, I bought this TV after plenty of research on 46\\" LCDs. Loved the TV for about 20 months and then lost an 8\\" wide vertical section on the left side of the screen. Can't get a response out of Samsung as the warranty was only one-year. Total joke...it was a great deal for about $1700 on Amazon when I bought it, but now it is a useless piece of electronic junk that I can't even use in my basement. Shame on Samsung and I will do whatever I can to never buy their products and tell others to do the same.

The tv is not even 2 years old. It is out of warranty. Samsung doesn't care that it is an obvious defect. They said they don't pay attention to what people on the internet say about their products. I was going to pay to have it fixed but after reading reviews from people that have done this it sounds like a bad idea. So I am going to buy either the Sony LED t.v. or the sony LCD XBR t.v. and just accept the fact that I threw away [...] on a piece of junk t.v. that lasted less than 2 years"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS TV","review":"I purchased this TV 18 months ago thru Amazon, it is now broken (picture failed) and out of warranty. This TV got rave reviews from many sites in the beginning but if you do your research you will find hundreds of complaints that this TV fails about 1 year to 18 months in - which is naturally outside of warranty and Samsung refuses to acknowledge the problem!

First, the standard capacitor issue, which Samsung decided to universally fix free of charge after a class action lawsuit. Second, the picture started to become distorted, dark, and have pulsating horizontal lines. After scouring tech forums, I am certainly not alone with this issue. Samsung has not recognozed the picture issue to be widepsread enough to cover the cost of the fix, which runs about $1000. Needless to say, I will be spending that $1000 towards a new, higher quality TV. I will never invest in a Samsung again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem as everybody else - The TV is only good for two years.","review":"Same problem as mentioned in the numerous 1 star reviews here.The screen is completely black when turned on and takes about an hour to warm up.After what I've read in the other reviews here it even seems pointless to have it repaired.In the market for a new TV 3 years after I bought this one...Interestingly enough, I know a lot of people that have bought the same TV in Norway, where warranty is more consumer friendly and you have the rights to complain several years after buying a product, and they have no issues what so ever. Is it possible that Samsung use cheaper components in the US market that they know will burn out just a little after the warranty have expired?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 3 years and then $$$$","review":"I bought this TV because of the good reviews. I expected it to perform on a par with other TVs I've owned, particularly in view of the price I paid for it. This was not to be.

The TV worked great for two years then started to fail with the purple dot syndrome many of this model gets. I would hesitate to purchase another Samsung as other reviews from other sources indicate they are not standing by this product since it is \\"out of warranty\\" These are expensive TV's and I expect something of this magnitude to last a lot lot longer. The picture quality is good once the set is turned off then on again to remove the purple dots. If you are a do it yourself-er, it can be fixed by replacing several capacitors for less than $50.00. Otherwise it could cost up to $200.00. Kind of big to bring into the repair shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung 4661F","review":"Awesome Picture.

Black shadows start showing up on the screen about 15 months into use. Someone else reported this problem as well and when I googled on it found quite a few hits.

You use the DK bongo accessories to play from a selection popular and classic songs. Some of these songs have been modified a bit to make them easier to drum to. None of the songs with lyrics are done by the original artists. This is actually an improvement, in my opinion, for some of them like \\"Rock Lobster\\" by the B52s.

I probably cried a lot while reading it--Lori's situation resonated with me. What really got to me, as the story unfolded, was the lovingkindness of the things taken for granted. We should all have such things to take for granted!I seldom read mysteries that have no other factor pulling me to them, and in this case, I think it was the rare-books aspect. The story kept unfolding, with one thread after another to knit up, and it All Came Right in the end.I recommend it to many people; and Nancy Atherton became a must-get-ASAPublished-read-right-now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual cozy mystery","review":"I hadn't read much on what this book was about, only assuming it was another normal cozy mystery. It started out strong and fun with Lori finding out her mother's secret and that Aunt Dimity was a real person. Lori's personality was solid and I learned to like her. But as soon as she got to the cottage, it got to be a little odd.The story unfolded as a friendly supernatural tale with a touch of mystery. The mystery wasn't a strong driving force, it simply unfolded. There didn't seem to be any red herrings or figuring out whodunit. It was more of a journey that you went on, following in Lori's footsteps.This book asks you to suspend disbelief for a little while. It is an entertaining read and had good moments of humor as well. I'd actually like to rate it 3 1/2 stars, but will leave it at 4. I will probably pick up the next in the series to read as well, out of curiosity. But I'm doubtful as to if it will stay in my permanent collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, yet unfulfilling, read......","review":"Despite all the highly-rated reviews, I must agree with the Publisher's Weekly review above.

For me, I need a little more suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet","review":"I read this first title in the series thinking the ghost would be the crime-solver, and was disappointed to find she was not. The main character is Lori Shepherd, the first person to have dealings with the ghost of Dimity, and the book is largely from her perspective.The author has a very pleasant style, but this is primarily a romance, and I don't like romances. That I finished it is sort of a tribute to the author, but it was soooo sweet, so very very sweet, that I think it left a cavity in my left frontal lobe and I need a reverse lobotomy.

She started out as a relatively well drawn character until she meets the executors of Dimitys' will. She then begins whining and complaining when anyone shows her kindness and respect.Although Bill is obviously destined to become more involved with Lori, I never got the impression he wanted a true friendship with her.On the plus side; I really enjoyed Aunt Dimitys' machinations and wished she'd appeared sooner and stayed longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for...","review":"I'm a big fan of the Laurie R. King 'Mary Russell' books - and was hoping for something to keep me occupied between publications. Ordered several books in the 'cozy' genre... including this one. It was just ok for me. Sort of like eating junk food... fine at the time, but you feel guilty afterwards for having indulged. Personally, I won't be reading any more in the series.If you're into fluff/romance type cozies - you'll probably enjoy this series. However, if you're looking for a somewhat brainier experience, stick to Mary Russell. The series I found that falls in the middle of this book and the Mary Russell books is the Amelia Peabody series... a little brains, a touch of mystery, and some romance... fluff, but with a tongue and cheek approach that makes it a little easier to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Aunt Dimity mystery","review":"Such a good series...this was the only one I hadn't found at the library or at a friend's house (to borrow).

Finding out the mystery behind Dimity's life, with the help of Bill Willis, helps Lori heal from her own heartbreak and embark on new adventures.

Besides mediocre instructure from the professors, this course's main detraction is this book. There are very few derivations or explanations for many of the formulas, which tend to help me stay interested in the material. Phillips and Nagle have done a terrible job and I feel that I will have to relearn the material when I get to grad school. This book is written from the standpoint that the reader is an experienced engineer who has been working for years; it attempts to make extensions from the analog world to the digital world, and does so very badly.

I admit, it felt great when I had it on, but after I took it off I didn't feel like it did anything for me. I decided to wait until the next day to see if I noticed anything. The next morning, my face still didn't feel any different than it normally does. I have tried it two more times in the last week and a half and still have noticed nothing.

Heck, I wasn't even into shooters, either (exception being Descent 3, but that's in a class by itself).Because I haven't played a Metroid game prior to Echoes, I have the opportunity to review this as a video game, and not a part of a franchise.The graphics are seamless. Most games, even when worked on for 4 years, have glitches. I can't find any.The music is creepy. I love it. Adds to the effect of being in an unfamiliar place. (Try listening in surround sound.)The sound is spot-on. Every shot and every squeal is well placed and is very recognizable.While you can't move and aim at the same time, it is easy to get used to. The weapon change is a little slow, but that adds to the challenge.This game is long. I'm not even halfway yet. This game is also hard. Don't play it if you have little patience. I'm serious about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game will kick some serious...","review":"No kiddin. The graphics are splendid.

Nintendo's got the GUTS to do things like these, unlike the PS2 and the XBox, where all the do is get your attention by \\"hot\\" and \\"sexy\\" people in their games, advertising uncreative junk to all.I am OK with Xbox and PS2. The games are sometimes fun, decent, and entertaining, but when some people try to destroy other because of lame reasons like \\"weird commercials...\\" is just... lame.Go buy MP2:Echoes, beat it, and prove my review wrong, if you must, any metroid-hating fan.

So does xbx, and PS2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard but incredible","review":"This is another great metroid game, but it is a little similar to the first one and so are the weapons. I mean, the light beam is like the plasma beam in the first game and the dark beam is like the ice beam in the first game. The savestations are much farther and you still lose all your cool gadgets in the beginning. Despite all these cons, the bosses are more challenging, there is more action, a great story plot, better graphics, more lively, and that you can travel to another dimension in Aether. It reminds me of Halo and acts like a Halo. And since Halo is a great game, that means that so is this one and if you can't take the heat then you aren't fit for first-person shooters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metroids, Look Out!","review":"This game is hot and rolling. It has a good storyline, perfect graphics, and nice new looking weapons! The only two things that I have to say against it are:(1) The glich after the Echo Visor(2) The Scan Visor is too colorful these days!Another thing is that the difficulty of finding everything(I had to ask my cousin for help)was very painful. The idea of Dark Samus is also genius-thinking! She look so awsome at the end when she takes of her so cool visor that reveals her three eyes. The reason why I rated it 4 stars and I'm saying it is so good is because...Well, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not really into Metroid games. What I mean to say is that, I suck at them!!!

This game is my way to get back at them.As a big fan of the first metroid prime, this game brings back old memories. In a good way, and to a lesser extent, a bad way. In a good way, the ideas that made the first one good are there AND better. The graphics, if it can be possible, are more stunning than the first. The scan visor can stan hundreds of enemies and objects. The mechanics are just as intuitive as they used to be.The only problem is that the game feels slightly similar with you losing all your items and having to start from the beginning like the first one.

The graphics are probably some of the best I've ever seen and the storyline is great. I won't disagree that this is very similar to Metroid Prime, but only in the weapons/power-ups aspect. The overall game is very different. If you're someone who likes a video game that isn't just running around shooting things, but also provides mind-challenging entertainment, MP2 is perfect. It's extremely challenging and unless you have a strategy guide, you won't beat it in four days like most games.On the note of the strategy guide, I advise you get one, but don't use it throughout the whole game; only use it if you are thoroughly stuck.The multiplayer isn't great, but the Single Player more than compensates.Overall, this is the best game I've ever played."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit difficult for me","review":"Before I bought this volume, I knew some of Tarrega's easier pieces, like Lagrima, a pretty piece, apropriate for my level.

After reading this book, I found it hard to believe he went to med school...let alone a reputable one. I feel that he was really reaching on a lot of his opinions. Not necessarily the ones about Scott but more so about Laci. For instance: He says that she was abandoned by her dad and that perhaps Laci does whatever to keep her marriage to Scott intact to avoid losing him. In For Laci, by Sharon Rocha, she says that she was the one who ended the marriage and left her husband. I think that Sharon Rocha's book is the best. Honestly, Dr. Ablow, when you use Star magazine's recommendation of you for your book cover, you lose credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"With all due respect to Dr. Ablow, I thought he was really over-reaching in his analysis of someone he never met. The book was filled with repetitive analytic conjecture about almost every sentence Scott ever spoke. Sometimes a duck is just a duck. Dr. Ablow repeatedly states how Scott \\"probably said ....\\", or \\"probably thought...\\" and Lacy \\"probably replied...\\" The book is filled with these fictional guesses as to the thoughts and feelings that MAY have occurred. Scott's apparent sociopathic behavior was traced in part to the murder of his maternal grandfather more than 50 years before Scott was born. It's obvious that, to a great extent, our personalities are the result of our parental upbringing, but to relate dates of negative events in the life of Jacqueline Peterson to dates of negative events in Scott's life is patently ridiculous. Overall, I felt that this was just one more opportunity to take advantage of this sensational case to sell a book. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of the insights I was looking for!","review":"As a self-admitted junkie of the Scott Peterson trial, I have read all of the books available to date on the circumstances surrounding this case. I can say that, without a doubt, this is the only book I have read that comes close to providing any insight into the mind of Peterson and how this seemingly \\"all-American boy\\" could have developed into a cold-blooded killer. This book delves into the background of not only Scott himself, but of his family and the many factors and life events that ultimately led to this tragedy. With \\"Inside the Mind of Scott Peterson\\", Dr. Ablow helps make sense of a senseless murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freud meets Lady Cleo","review":"I followed this case very closely.

Some of his ideas were really far fetched in my opinion. And repetative. I think some of his ideas make sense - even ones many do not agree with - such as Scott perhaps finding real love or feelings for the first time with Amber. But the repetative \\"birth equals death\\" was a bit much.Ablow writes at length about Scott's mother - Jackie - and how her father's murder set the stage for Laci's ultimate demise. And how Jackie gave away two children at birth was part of the \\"birth equals death\\" theory. Ablow shows Scott's psyche and how his sociopathy is formed as he grows up. But, for example, Scott never knew about his adopted-out siblings until about the time he married Laci - so how could this have been a part of his forming sociopathy?Anyway - there are interesting aspects of this book and some good history and juicy tid-bits about the Peterson family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a fan of Ablow's throughout the Clevenger series, but Inside the Mind of Scott Peterson (as well as The Architect) are great disappointments.

I just started it yesterday and am finished today. It reads very fast and it kept me turning the pages. Even if you are fed up with everything Scott, I still think you may find this book worth the read. It explains the dead pan look on Scott's face during the entire trial and his utter lack of any emotion including the fake tears he shed on Good Morning America. Dr. Ablow gives his opinion on why he believes Scott is the way he is. I found it to be very fascinating, though I dont know if I agree with all of Dr. Ablow's beliefs and viewpoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended....","review":"This book wasn't worth the original price in hard cover, now I see the latest 'NEW' price for mass marketing paperback is $149.99 (as of 11/21/1011). Dr. Ablow appears to be a mind unto himself. Basically, I think he is a few bricks shy of a load. I wouldn't recommend this book, or his new book about Casey Anthony even though I haven't even read the new one, just because of what appears to go on (or not go on, as the case maybe) 'inside the mind of Dr. Ablow.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid read","review":"Some people are just plain evil.

Check it out at the library if you must try to get through this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside Mind of Keith Ablow","review":"Unfortunately this book had an essay's worth of information so it was fluffed to full book size with the inner dialog of Scott Peterson as imagined by Keith Ablow but presented as fact. It becomes a work of fiction instead of concentrating on Ablow's theory on why Scott Peterson's family history almost guaranteed a personality that would be inclined to murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"still believe the jury got it wrong","review":"The author has based the premise for the book on agreeing with the jury. That is a faulty premise, with information now available in Tales from the Morgue, and Presumed Guilty, which reveal the kinds of evidence that even the jury was not privy to. I do believe Scott will be exonerated, due to the circumstances under which the investigation was carried out, under high profile, prejudicing the public and warping any rational outcome for the truth. The American criminal justice will be in better shape with his freedom. Hopefully much will have been learned about what can go wrong when trials are given the kind of status this one had. Justice can not prevail in such an environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This book is so bad it's unbelievable.I can't believe a famous celebrity like Ablow could put his name on this book. He would have been better off writing a new book of fiction using the outlines of Scott Peterson's case. It wouldn't be any less believable.It's amazing that he pulled it off.

He does not bother to try to get to the facts or get inside the mind of Scotty, instead he hypothysizes over and over again.\\"a normal person would have said\\" then makes up what Scotty could have said.Oh god, I was so bored.Scotty may or may not have been a sociopath, no way to tell from this book. And to think Ablow is the \\"number one forensic psychiatrist in america?\\"No hope for america.And he wants to study sociopaths but didn't bother to study scotty at all in this book, lazy writing.As someone who shares similar character traits with Scotty I was interested in some insight but nothing to see here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to the Core","review":"The recurring theme of Ablow's book - Scott's self-destruction as a child - creates a compelling, disturbing portrait of the making of a psychopath. Ablow guides the reader on a psychological journey that connects Scott's past experience of dehumanization to his capacity for murder. The reader comes to understand how an inexplicably cruel act makes rational sense in Scott's emotionless world. This does not excuse Scott's behaviour, but rather explains it. In this way, Albow's penetrating analysis throws light on the wider human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading.","review":"This book is an absolute joke. After watching Keith Ablow on Court TV being interviewed by Catherine Crier, I could not wait to get this book. It was a complete disappointment. The writing was poor including the grammar.

It should have been insightful, well researched and substantive.It was a big letdown and I hope Ablow is sufficiently embarrassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside The Mind of Scott Peterson","review":"Keith Ablow is a Court TV/Oprah Winfrey Show psychiatrist who opens his book by stating that he is indebted to Oprah Winfrey, for whom he has \\"profound respect for her daily, breathtaking commitment to disclose the truth...\\" He has written a breathless account of how Scott Peterson became a psychopath largely because of his parents' stifling his own personality. Looking for a substantive, scientific account? Keep looking. Ablow's book is written for Oprah's audience: short sentences, shorter chapters. Just right for short attention spans."},{"rating":"1","title":"crock","review":"the biggest bunch of bs i have ever read. not only is this the most ridiculous book i have read on the subject, the author couldnt even get some of his facts straight"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth It.","review":"Ablow's thesis and supporting material seemed to provide to this layman a credible, albeit ho hum explanation for Scott Peterson's motivation for the killing of his wife and child. However, Ablow's material could be easily condensed into an in depth magazine article. He circles back to point after point and freely repeats the same supporting information.I am unhappily reminded of my own efforts to reach the required word count of certain school assignments when I lacked enough facts to fill the requirement. Ablow just does not have enough material for a whole book. (kids, before word processors, some of us wrote really big and double spaced to get our assignments up to the required number of pages).Peterson is a sociopath who felt no empathy for others.

This book is a joke.I have to actually question if any indepth research had been done on this book at all. If this is Ablow's professional opinion, I can't help but question his credentials as a forensic psychiatrist.This book was nothing but ridiculous theories, assumptions, fantasy, fluff & insulting innuendos.Key phrases were repeated so often in this book I couldn't help wondering if Ablow's only true intent was to completely brainwash the readers into blindly accepting his so called professional opinions & conclusions as absolute fact.I really have to wonder what Ablow was thinking when writing this book. It hits me as nothing more than a bazaar, fictional story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The OPERATIVE word here is REDUNDANT!","review":"Ok, now although I did find Keith Ablow's analysis of Scott Peterson interesting, I didn't need to hear it over and over AGAIN throughout the entire book.

This book was definitely not his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes some logical sense but not rigorous enough","review":"I felt the book does make sense but wasn't detailed enough to prove that the \\"answer\\" is exactly on the mark. I was very angry with all the blank pages and very short chapters. Nor is disociation correlated with insanity in psychiatry but with law, anything goes! He says with medical certainty that Peterson was insane but \\"insanity\\" is not considered a medical term! Moreoverhe knew the difference between right and wrong. The problem is he didn't care about the difference, and that doesn't indicate insanity but obviously indicates sociopathic tendencies. HE KNEW WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG OR OTHERWISE WHY WOULD HE DO HIS \\"BEST\\" TO COVER IT UP!

So if you're a big fan of SATC like I am, and eager for a similar cast of characters, this is a really fun book to read. Add a murder mystery, and you get this amazingly entertaining, impossible-to-put-down book.The beginning of this book had me a little doubtful, but after the first 40 or so pages, I was hooked--I finished reading the book in one night. I must admit, the writing style isn't too great and rather undeveloped, but that doesn't stop this book from being very fun and entertaining--after all, you're not buying this book for literary value, it's more a \\"just for fun\\" kinda book.It reminded me of Kate White's Bailey Weggins mysteries with the same amount of romance mixed into the mystery.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Summer or Anytime Read","review":"Just a fun read.

It is my sincere hope that WGN TV would open its archives and that of the Chicago based Museum of Broadcast Communications (MBC) to release all that they can from Bob Bell's Bozo that ran for years and years on Tribune Broadcasting WGN TV.

Like I mentioned earlier, it works very well with the ReadyNAS X6 for video. (Photos and music are another issue, but no fault of ShowCenter).The only really wishes for a box like this are:1.

Come on, 2D games have been passe since Wolfenstein 3D came out way back in the early 90s.I kept thinking the book would get better as we went along, so I glossed over code that didn't work, techniques that even Microsoft has said not to use, and generally poor Delphi coding. I kept thinking that eventually I'd get to the mountain top and I'd actually learn to build a modern, interesting type of game and know how to do so in my favorite development tool, Delphi.

The author doesn't seem to be a very good Delphi developer. Also, the book doesn't read well. It's hard to follow. I didn't find the author's prose to be an easy read. His explanations often left me wondering what the heck he just said. Last, the examples don't work.

Worse yet, the examples are overly simplistic and exhibit code techniques that are error prone and amateurish. On top of that, the writing is quite bad. The guy cannot write.

I feel that this was not reflected in the book, and the messages are therefore not accurate or reliable.However, I do agree that dieting is not a solution and the dieting industry is largely setting people up to fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening!","review":"This is a must-read. Paul Campos marshalls the ample evidence that the dieting as pushed by the diet culture in the U.S. has less to do with health than cosmetics. As a chronic dieter, I am forced to own up to the fact that my dieting is all about looks, not health. So is dieting worth it? You have to read this before you decide for yourself. I couldn't put this book down; it's a very compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enlightening","review":"I could not put this book down. I am amazed at the extent of control that the media, goverment, and weight loss industry has on the \\"obesity epidemic\\". This is a must read.Also I wanted to make a comment to people who are giving this book low ratings. Campos does not mean to say that a weight of 350 lbs is healthy! He is just trying to say that if one is a little overweight that it would be more beneficial to them to attempt to lead amore healthy lifestyle than just try to lose weight. Dont try to read this book thinking that Campos is proposing that none of us should lose weight ever no matter the circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Viewpoint On Obesity","review":"The author presents a provocative view on the public-health issue of obesity. The book makes the case that moderately overweight persons may not be at risk if they are physically active and eating a healthful diet. The author shows how a moderately active heavier person is likely to be far healthier and live longer than someone who is thin but sedentary.In addition, the book shows how a common problem of yo-yo dieting is more dangerous than not losing the weight in the first place. The book in many ways points out that the steps that people take to lose weight can be more dangerous than the excess weight itself. One example of this is the story of Fen-phen which is explained in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha-ha-ha","review":"I bet the other reviewers are author's fat relatives.

A book debunking every myth spread by the obscenely wealthy diet/weight-loss industry gets published, and the rabid fat-haters come out of their cages and blast it. Well, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM! This book--as well as its author, Paul Campos--is a breath of fresh air. Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Slim-Fast, Atkins and all their ilk should be afraid--very afraid. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woohoo!","review":"If you've ever stepped on a scale or spent even one minute of your life worrying about your weight, then you need to read this book!It's brilliant, funny, heroic, and necessary.Thanks to Campos, readers will be inspired to enjoy good nutrition, good exercise, the good life, and also a good laugh at the con artists who care more about keeping us hooked than keeping us healthy.As the other, funkier Mr. Clinton says: \\"Free your mind and your ass will follow!\\"\\"The Obesity Myth\\" liberates.

But, I have to admit I was disappointed with this disk set. Maybe it was me, but I just didn't seem to connect with the information he was providing or the exercises it puts you through. Sorry, John :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"If you think you're going to become a psychic because of this CD, forget it. John even tells you that you won't. There's a lengthy very strange meditation on it to \\"hopefully\\" unleash your psychic potential but I found it bizarre. Just meditate and pray your favorite prayers and if you're more psychic than others, you may increase your awareness. At the very least, you'll relax. No need to travel to a place that holds your third eye, and some other things (as in the meditation). Love John. Disliked this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think John Edward may be a good medium. However, he is no good at teaching someone how to use their psychic abilities.There really wasn't much information on the tape. I have worked as a psychic for 15 years and have taught others to use their abilities. I often buy other psychics' books to see what they are saying, to see if I can learn something new. Let me just say that there are other books/tapes out there that are much more informative and instructive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in spiritual development. Although it is not (as he admits) the psychic training \\"silver bullet\\", it is full of very effective and practical techniques for psychic and spiritual development, especially for western society. The psychic defense exercises alone are worth the price of this book. Also, his creative chakra training techniques (found here and in most of his other books) are easy to follow, instantly committed to long-term memory, and very effective. John Edward does it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a magic show","review":"If you were like me, expecting to see a magic show, this DVD is not the one.

The entire costume is going to have to be sewn before my son wears the costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as nice as I hoped","review":"This costume is alright. Overall I am not impressed. I found that the polyester has many runs were it was cut. The velcro is not sewn on properly (falling off), it will need some fixing before my child wears it. Also when I was looking at the sizes, the size small recommended that the child be 6-8 to wear. 48 inches tall, 25 inch waist. There is no way this would fit an average 6 to 8 year old. The actual size on the package states size 4-6. It just fits my child. I wish the description said it was size 4-6, I would have bought the medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Served it's purpose","review":"Bought this for my 7 yr old for Halloween. It looks very nice, but is very cheaply made. You can see through the shirt ~ I had him wear a white t-shirt underneath it. The chain on the vest broke immediately and the cape had nothing to secure it to the shirt, no tie or anything like that (I used safety pins). Even still, it looked very nice in pictures and was one of the better looking costumes I found. Don't expect it to last more than one Halloween though."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE COST - Don't even buy used!","review":"This book is not Maxwell's best book and I believe he quotes himself way too much (1/3 of the total quotes are his!).

If you are looking for a full-blown book try 2 of his other books, 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader or 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. While I know the book is supposed to be about THINKING BIG I found many quotes from other books. There are better books out there to spend your money on.They key to getting any long-term value out of Maxwell's books is to highlight the quotes you love and integrate them into your daily life.

First of all it takes 45 minutes from the time you turn it on before you actually get to do something besides reading dumb scripts.

I discourage violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Maybe I just don't get it but this game was completely stupid to me. First of all the premise is so bad and unrelateable to the point of actually coming accross as weird. I think you have to be hard core Mario fan just to swallow this game. It seems like the game is more about the gimmicky features rather than the game itself. I guess it is kind of cool that Mario is paper thin via Parrapa the Rappa style graphics but overall these games just don't seem on par or even as evolved as the stuff Sony is putting out. Don't get me wrong some of my favorite games have been Nintendo games but Paper Mario is just below the bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"I love this game. While I wouldn't consider it a sequel I would say that it is a great game unto itself. It takes everything you loved about the first paper mario game and takes it to the next level. If you liked the first paper mario you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is, in my humble opinion, the best Mario game ever created. The difficulty, the characters,the action, and the plot mixes to form an extremely challenging, extremely fun video game. (Just note, is also EXTREMELY long!) My cousin has had it for several years, and to this day he cannot beat it....although he still tries. If you like this game, you'll probably like the following:Super Paper Mario (Nintendo Selects),Super Mario Sunshine,Luigi's Mansion, andSuper Mario Galaxy 2. Thanks for reading! Enjoy game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile game for all that have a gamecube","review":"Paper Mario: The thousand year door is an awesome game! First of all, I would say this is a very creative game for everyone. The music and replay value arent to good, but it is definantly made up by the awesome gameplay, cute graphics, characters, and story. It made me laugh a few times and it was GREAT FUN when you first play it all the way through. The way it does battling is similar to pokemon, but a bit more complicated. I highly recomend this game to anyone who still has a gamecube and for someone who wants a pretty long and a bit of a challenging game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Mario Game Yet!","review":"This game is a ton of fun if you are into platform games.There are loads of partners (7 to be exact) to choose from and each partner is unique! You have to collect 7 crystal stars and a long journey has to be taken for each one!The problem is that when you are talking to someone who is telling you what to do, it takes for ages!You get different abilitys such as Plane, Roll etc. and they are all briliant!I think the best bit is the battles, you have to fight bad guys when you bump into them on the field mode! Each crystal star gives you a star attack and they are all fabulous!If you like platform games and/or fighting games then this is the game for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper Mario Thousand Year Door","review":"To start, I just want to say that I love Mario. He is the best video game character out there in my opinion. This game is a really great adaptation to Mario. The graphics are amazing and really really cool. The story is also amazing.

Overall, I think this game is definitely a must have for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"This game was super appealing to me after i played its predecessor. The game itself was just wonderful, it is was just beautifully made by Nintendo.So many things in this game are better than in the original, the graphics are highly enhanced, the role play is better.

The battle scenes are challenging but also a lot of fun because you have added side games during battle to gain extra points and stars.

I had a lot of fun in some chapters but the further I got into the game, the more I realized that it wasn't going to take me very long to beat it. You get new side kicks and badges but not a lot of time to really use them. I could easily beat most of the chapters in a few hours making the game too easy and much too short. I was very disapointed spending $50 for a game I could easily beat in a few days. I was expecting something similar in length to Yoshi's Island for N64 with a few episodes per chapter but I was sorely disapointed.Bottom line: game is too short and too easy.

The emphasis on paper is a new trait for video games, being able to fold into a plane, move between bars, and roll up to bounce away. You fight for a crowd, so you can get bonuses for a good show and you can also command a team of small creatures (Possibly like pikmin). Only four party members, though, and some strange parts like an army of fuzzies right at the beginning and another of dry bones near the end.

This game is very fun and exciting, but the developers could of done a whole lot of a better job on the ending.

One thing that got me was how they hated the graphics! The point is paper! How much 3-D do you want with paper? Another thing was absolutely sad... They didn't like to read the words! Are they going to complain about a book because it has words? (At least I don't have to worry about them reading this!) It just shows how lazy they are. Another guy gave up on the game because he couldn't pass Chapter 7. I know that I'm not a game master so at least try buddy!

The album contains zero instrumentals, which is odd since most of their albums had at least two. The main word to describe the major theme in the album is Funk, with a artistic white-boy feel to it. Their not the meters, but they do throw down the grooves that remind me of riding on the back of a worm squirming through a bowl of Jell-o"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phish's best album since RIFT...","review":"Despite a bit of a lag towards the end of the album, TSOTG soars to wonderful heights that the band has no been able to achieve since Rift (which is still IMHO their best album). This is the album they've been trying to make since Hoist. They almost got it right on \\"Billy Breathes\\".. they have it dead on now. Phish have learned (unlike many of their phans) that a studio and a stage are two different experiences, offering different opportunities. It is important to note that the band HATES the alubums LAWN BOY and JUNTA, viewing them as sloppy, unenthusiastic second-rate versions of good songs (which is exactly what they are). While the new album doesn't have much (if any) of the long floing jams that we all love, that is because they don't really belong in Phish's studio sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phish continue evolving","review":"Phish are a work-in-progress. Every album shows them turning a new direction. Ghost is a continuing development in the band's funky-dance-vibe era, documented in Slip Stitch and Pass. This time out, we get to hear a lot more BASS, which really does a lot for the album's groove. So here's the thing: as Phish continue to lead the way in the jam-rock movement (by now having fostered a scene where younger acts such as Moe and 5000 Deep are running with the ball in their own unique direction)... where do they go next? Can't wait to hear it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best studio release to date","review":"The last few times I've seen Phish, I was disappointed by the move toward extended funky-type jam sessions with no apparent direction. The live release of \\"Slip, Stitch and Pass\\" reflects this trend. However, \\"Story of the Ghost\\" sees this new style merged with the old experimentation, and it proves that they are still evolving as a band. I was wrong, and happily so! Maybe we'll get to see a studio version of \\"Zarathustra\\" one day like we now have with \\"Guyute\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a bonafide PHAN","review":"Phish is far and beyond my favorite band.When I got STOG, I couldnt get the tunes out of my head, they were just so damn GOOD! It has a ton of great songs, the best of which include Guyute, Ghost, Meat, Wading in the Velvet Sea, Brian and Robert, and Birds of a Feather. However, I don't recommend it to someone who is just starting to listen to Phish. If you are a novice, get Junta or Picture of Nectar first, that gives you a better idea of what the band is all about, and also they're better. However, if you already are a phan then this is a must have...GREAT stuff on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Phish Album","review":"The late 90's saw the birth of Cow Funk. Phish's new funkier side emerged at their live shows and it carried over to the Story of the Ghost album. Great lyrics, a funky backbone, and rich and textured harmonies flow from the very fist notes. If your a long time fan you know these are the tunes you want to hear live even 14 years later...."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd was disappointing","review":"i was greatly disappointed by TSOTG. i don't get how anyone can compare it to junta, a picture of nectar, or a live one. those cds are WAY BETTER than TSOTG. phish's probing solos and awesome jams are almost nonexistent in this cd. yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have all the Phish gone?","review":"I just received the CD from Amazon and gave it a listen and am not impressed. I crave the delicate balance of fluidity and chaos in their melodies of yore. These tunes, for the most part, are boring--lacking grace or appeal. The vocals are hum drum, and the guitar plucks aimlessly. Oh well. I Guess Billy will have to Breathe again as the Ghost is laid to rest"},{"rating":"1","title":"whats going on with Phish?","review":"Is it just me or do other Phisheads know whats going on with these guys? Big disappointment in this one- I gave it two stars, one for Guyute, and the other for the cover art. I have every Phish studio CD and many live bootlegs. Can anyone honestly say that TSOTG can even compare with Junta, Lawn Boy, Rift, or even A Live One? Junta is the best studio CD ever made, period. Phish's recent stuff is really starting to suck.The band says they are going back to their roots, but the stuff I remember seeing in the small clubs in VT was more like Junta than anything.Phish has really disappointed me.Please, someone write back to this and tell me honestly what you think of this album, instead of just assuming that anything Phish creates is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage!!!!!!!","review":"If you people really think this music is great your all really high or just not exposed to anything good. Phish is not Sly and the Family Stone nor are they James Brown or Parliament. This set of white hippie funk shouldn't be recommend. There is nothing exciting about it and it's not innovating at all. It's more or less party music, music that can't be taken seriously, stuff that teenagers listen to. I would put this band on the same level as the Dave Mathews Band--90's---00's crap. I can't believe you people waste your money on this. Get something from the 1960's , the real stuff, our generation just doesn't have it in them to make good rock music and this album proves my statement. The playing rambles on with no purpose, VERY BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, generic music","review":"This album sounds like every other jam band in the world.Bland, samey songwriting for song after song. No fresh ideas, nothing innovative, just real good musicians playing well. That's fine for cover bands and such, but where is the creativity and vision? It just isn't here. Thats why Phish falls far, far short of bands like the Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Flaming Lips, and Wilco. They just lack any kind of coherent sound or songwriting ability.There's nothing original or interesting here. Big thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality mix of great tunes with a fresh sound!","review":"I find the new album to be exciting and a great listen. It's a perfect snapshot of the new songs and they do jam many of them out. Guyute is definately an album highlight, doing the song justice and immortalizing it (finally) on a recording. Roggae is a personal favorite, as is the soon to be comercialized Birds of a Feather. All in all, a fantastic contribution to the discography of Phish, the greatest band on the planet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo Boooooring","review":"As we all know Phish are an excellent live band, but the the shortcomings of saving all of your best stuff for the live concerts really shows on this album. Most if not all albums are made up of actual songs This one, with 2 or 3 exceptions seems to consist of fragments of tunes that never really seem to gel. Maybe they sound better live, but for the most part on TSOTG they fall to the floor and flop around like, yes, a dying fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I grew on me and now I can't pull myself to take it out of the cd player.

GOOD STUFF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have I told you the Story of the Ghost?","review":"This album is QUALITY. It is a true picture of the band, with a delightful mix of mellow/ballady songs like Velvet Sea and Brian and Robert with cow-funk like Meat and the Moma Dance. It even packs the jazz-rock symphony Guyute, a track which can only be heard in its entirety to be believed. Unlike Guyute, which had been part of Phish live repertoire for years, most of these songs are cropped from jam sessions and given words. All of the songs feel fresh and lively but tend more towards simple beauty than the high energy improvisational insanity that earned the band its reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"phish is always HIGH quality","review":"This album has a unique new sound that is only comparable to Billy Breathes. Phish is gonna change, if you cant change with em then i guess that makes you notaPhish phan.

I guess they were stoned..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Phish Studio Albums","review":"As far as Phish studio albums go, I guess I place them into 4 chronological categories: the early years (Junta, Lawn Boy, Picture of Nectar), the mid-years (Rift, Hoist, Billy Breathes), the later years (Story of the Ghost, Siket Disc, Farmhouse) and the post hiatus period (Round Room, Undermind). Story of the Ghost may not be the one Phish album I would take with me to a deserted island, but it's definitely the best of the later period and beyond. Granted, most of these songs were enormous live, especially in the summer and fall of '97 when they were brand new and awesome, but Phish somehow managed to contain these songs in the studio in a manner that doesn't seem stale or over-produced. These songs exist in two realms: one as a short concise cohesive studio entity...and in another as monstrous live improvisational jams that have no relation to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studio Beauty","review":"No question about it. The best studio album since Billy Breathes, perhaps ever. I'm a fan of the jams, but tight grooves laid on top of incredible songwriting and playfully smart lyrics are where Phish gets the least credit and deserves as much. This album is a shining example."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review for the uninitiated","review":"This album from the point of view of someone who listens to a little bit of everything.This is a fusion of funk, rock, jazz and country. These musicians are incredible, real musician's musicians. I can tell through this album that I have hit upon a group that has been evolving for a long time and have been exploring various aspects of fusing popular music from the last three decades. This band is very tight and grooves hard. The sound reminds me a lot of some of the 70's rock fusion but I have never heard anything else that was as much fun and as groovy. Older jazz-rock fusion tended to stick closer to one side or other of the fence but Phish has really gone in and blown down all barriers to create their own sound and still keep it very listenable.I would highly recomend this album to people who enjoy truly original music and funky grooves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, or not, depending on taste","review":"Pretty easy - if you like Irish party songs, then this CD is for you.

The gameplay, the music and the selection of Ferraris are top-notch. Compared to OutRun Online Arcade and OutRun 2006: Coast2Coast, playing the original game doesn't disappoint to the fans. Drifting the Ferrari is something we can do in real life now, but nothing like in this we see. This is the fun OutRun installment game since the first game for the Sega Genesis. The drawback of this game though, the missions are a pain. It has math, different tasks and run through what color the passenger asked. They're repetitive and tedious, they're just educational one way or another. Overall, four stars. I had to deduct one because of the missions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Even Hesitate","review":"If you are a martial arts instructor - or soon to be one don't hestitate to buy this book.

As a reference for the brand new instructor, it would probably save a good deal of mistakes. For someone who has already had a number of years invested in operating their school, it will be more of a retelling of things you already know, whether or not you already put them into practice (which would still make it worth the purchase).

DON'T TAKE THIS BOOK AND ITS SERIES AS MAIN STUDY REFERENCE or you'll have big possibility to get shocked in the middle of the exam!... After all, I will return to you after the exam to update this review! wish me luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely touches the surface","review":"I just passed my 70-176 exam today, and it wasn't because of this book! This book is a decent introduction to some of the items on the test, but far from being detailed enough to give you enough information to pass the test. Your best bet is simply using the MSDN Library alongside the Transcender exams. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Test Questions do not match Answers for test","review":"The worst VB Study book I have ever purchased. No Quality Assurance for the chapter test (which is the most important thing in the book). Chapter 3 has 2 more answers than questions, and the ones that are there are wrong.Quality Assurance was having a very bad day when they published this book, and should have spent many more hours making sure that the chapter test were useful and more importantly correct.This is egg on the face of Michael McKelvy (Author) and Cybex for publishing such bad material with out checking it first.Would not recommend for anyone seriously studying for the test.I have purchased both books in the set and can only hope that the 2nd one is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of logos, few text.","review":"Another of those books with a thousand logos, but few text. A bit like the book Los Logos, this is more centered in european design. If you like logos, but don't care about the story behind them, this book is for you. If you prefer books in which the design process is explained, then you'll better look for other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming story for children","review":"My mother passed along her 1952 hardcover to me. We read it together for years, and I have since read it to my own children many times.It's a delightful story of two stuffed animals who, when the toys in the attic are getting thrown out, decide to strike out on an adventure of their own. You will love reading about Squirrel and Golly as they find their new place in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCREDIBLY CHEAP QUALITY CABLES","review":"The only thing these cables worked for was my sd card adapter. Ipod will not work, neither will internet adapter, or external hard drive. THEY ALL SHOW UP AS USB DEVICE NOT RECOGNIZED, and there is nothing you can do. Basically, none of the more important devices work. Very cheap quality cables, so I will look towards a belkin cable. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE CABLES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't work at all!","review":"I was really excited to get this extension to be able to charge my iPad while using it, but it never worked! I tried it with different devices and still didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"If not for predictable stereotypes, this book would have no characters at all. There are lots of good things in Jackson Square Jazz -- including a likeable protagonist -- but I was unable to get truly into this book because I was always aware of the author's self-consciousness. He is trying very hard to entertain his reader and as a result prevents us from getting into the action. If he allowed the characters more depth and steered clear of stereotypes, this book could have been quite good. The story -- which is apparently based on real events -- is compelling but the lack of depth of the characters is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"The title is the most intriguing aspect to this book. You can put it down after you get that far. Stiff and amateurish writing that you expect to see in a high school paper rather than a published book for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Earth Shattering Hear, just good fun......","review":"I enjoyed this and his first book and look forward to others he has to offer in the future. Yes it's a bit light, but I don't want to be deep all the time. Good light-hearted fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Par for the course","review":"I picked this up because my library had it labeled as Fiction, so I was disappointed to find it was yet another murder mystery, not my favorite genre. This one was better than most gay-themed mysteries as the author wasn't trying to dazzle us with his non-stop wit and writes competently. But like most mysteries, this was full of the coincidences and implausabilities that are the stock-in-trade of mystery writers. The protagonist is not particularly likable, just so attractive that he has to fight off \\"pretty boys\\" with a stick and treats his would-be boyfriends badly because he's just too hot to give up his promiscuous life. The voodoo visions and tarot card readings didn't help but were easily skipped, and by the 100th time he invoked his \\"Goddess\\" or his brother called him \\"my queen,\\" I was quite ready to skim. I blame my local library for misrepresentation, since as mysteries go this was par for the course."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel I must warn you","review":"Call me unqualified to review this book, because I didn't quite finish it. (I came within eight pages of the end and put it down, never to continue reading.) But I feel after all those pages that I'm at least qualified to say that if you care about the craft of writing, you'll want to avoid this book. It's the kind of writing that gives \\"gay fiction\\" a bad name. Dear goddess, I wish I could be more positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"One who likes to read","review":"I found this book and his first one to be well writing. With info about New Orleans and what to look forward to for someone who has the chance to visit it during Decadance. Plus a little historical info as well. Scotty is the guy that if it could happen to someone it usually did. So it gave alot of eye opening info into the scene in New Orleans during Southern Decadance. It also brought out the good in a person (Scotty) to help someone (Bryce) who was in trouble and see it that he was taken care of. Plus Scotty had to deal with his own feelings about 2 guys who were both very interested in having a relationship with him.All in all I thought it was a very good book and I look forward to reading other books writing by Herren."},{"rating":"1","title":"great pictures, terrible mechanical & service","review":"Had a DX4900 for about a year when its internal shutter quit working. Bought the DX7740 so that I could keep using the same extra lenses purchased for the older camera (hated having to buy new batteries, memory cards, card reader). Bought 1st one on 11/11/04 - the shutter button autofocus quit working on 11/21. Exchanged for SECOND new DX7440 on 11/22 and its battery latch (little CHEAPLY DESIGNED orange plastic part) broke on 12/14. Exchanged for THIRD DX7440 on 12/15. Its battery latch broke on 1/12/05. The battery door does a decent job of holding in the battery so I guess I'll keep using it (it's pictures are really good) until it breaks further then I'll buy ANY OTHER BRAND. I'm not even buying any more Kodak film for the Nikon FG I've had for 15 years with NO PROBLEMS. Just try working with Kodak customer service - it's a real joke, nothing of theirs is ever bad. I'll never buy another product of any type that carries the Kodak name, EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet expectations at all","review":"Very slow between pictures. Terrible auto focus inside/low light where I take most pictures of my infant and toddler. Software would not load on my computer. I'm returning it and getting another Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"DX7440 returned as defective","review":"Because of the glowing reviews on this page, my decision to purchase a DX7440 was reinforced. Unfortunately, when the purchase arrived, it turned out that the \\"Made in China\\" camera was defective. There was a large black spot in the center of all photos which appeared to be the fault of either a defective CCD or a severe problem with the optics. Either way, the camera was unusable, and it was returned for a refund.And therein lies the good thing about Amazon: They will accept a return within 30 days, no questions asked. Kodak technical support was essentially useless, because support appears to be offshored to people who do not speak English as their first language.Needless to say, Kodak cameras are now on my \\"do not buy\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Latch woes","review":"I agree with the glowing reviews in that the color and ease of use of this camera are great. However, I've had it for 2 months and of course the dreaded orange battery lock door snapped. My wife and I baby this thing and have only charged it about 4 times and already it snapped. This appears to be a big problem. Yes, the larger battery/memory card door appears to hold it in. I say appears because it seems like it shakes around and that can't be good coming and going with the contacts. I have no faith in Kodak but I will try to call them tomorrow. I have little hope because I feel I will be without a camera for 2 weeks to a month minimum, and they may send me a remanufactured unit. $300 I pay for a remanufactured unit. I am very disappointed. My original 5 rating shoots down to a 2 because of shoddy plastic parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall camera.","review":"I purchased this camera after also considering a Canon. My wife already has the software for Kodak, so this made the decision an easy one. The camera is easy to use and downloading pictures is a breeze. Daytime shots are very clear and the camera is comfortable. On the negative side, though, indoor and nighttime shots are poor. Overall, a good camera for the price that i paid from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camera Ever!","review":"I have had my camera for over 2 years now and I like it so well that I bought two more, one for my Mom and one for my Dad. I also recommended this camera to a friend and she loves it. We off road in Jeeps and this camera has been subjected to all kinds of things like dirt, mud and rain as well as being banged around over ruff terrain and it has never let me down. It takes excellent pictures and it doesn't have a delay when you take the picture like so many cameras have today. It's very easy to use and always takes a great picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera even for digital newbies","review":"I bought this camera in August 2004 and have never regretted it. The Kodak DX7440 is my first digital camera. It takes excellent pictures and is very easy to use. The auto function fullfills the majority of my needs, but I had fun using the more advanced features as well. I posted a couple of pictures to the Amazon online gallery to show the quality when used by a beginner. It made me feel like a pro.I had one small problem. While the camera LCD screen framed the subject accurately, the viewfinder did not. It was slightly off, so I chopped off the top of most pictures. This problem may be a flaw in my particular camera, but check it out if you want to save your battery life by using the viewfinder instead of the LCD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pictures, camera quality not so good","review":"The Camera does take good pictures, and fast not like the cameras where you click and the subject is gone by the time the picture is taken (people with kids know what i am talking about) The bad things, if you take a picture from to far away ( more than 6 feet) and zoom in you get a grainy photo. Also, I would only recommend this to point and click people that arent interested in the best photos. Within a month the little thing that holds the battery in broke off and after about 8 months the dial is almost impossible to turn, seriously leaves welts embedded in your thumbs even if you succed in turning it on. IT would cost more to repair it then actually buy a new camera. I would never buy another one again. If your looking for a camera to last a long time this probably isnt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible camera and horrible support center","review":"The camera broke befre I even used it,kodak wont fixt it unless I give them $400 that is more than I got the camera for,they are crazy"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA","review":"If you want a digital camera, do your self a favor and look for something else, I bought this camera after reading online CNET reviews and the price seem right but is a total waste of money if you ever want to take any pictures indoors, because they will never come out right. I took this camera to a wedding and took over 200 pictures and not even one is worth keeping. and the Jog dial damaged after one week of usage and i have to pay to ship it to connecticut to get it fixed.....I will sell mine for $100 if anyone is going to buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Volume Hairspray","review":"It has a nice hold without giving a total stiff feel.

I still recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells good but no hold","review":"If you look at the first ingredient of this hairspray, it's water. I gave it 2 stars because it smells so nice but it didn't hold my hair at all. I was trying to find a cheaper hairspray than my favorite, Big Sex Hairspray but in this case it didn't happen.

I use her hairspray occasionally and when I used some of this I was immediately turned off by the very strong, perfume smell. This product is heavily scented and it smells more like \\"old lady\\" than \\"cute girl\\"... despite the name. I am going to advise my wife not to purchase this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hairspray I have ever tried!","review":"I have thin, fine, hair. I usually use an expensive freezing hairspray because I have my hair cut spikey in the back and longer bangs. I need a hairspray to hold up the back. I have had a terrible time finding a product to volumize and hold up the hair without a greasy look and to fill in the holes. I tried this yesterday, and it is EXACTLY what I have been looking for. I am going to buy 6 and hope they NEVER go out of business. I am a customer for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got2b Kidding About Volumizing","review":"This hairspray has a unique scent that I can't describe but I kinda like it.Unfortunately, the product is not exactly volumizing. I teased my hair with this spray and it just would not do the same justice as \\"Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play\\". Got2b works better as a product for a touchable hold. I rate it 4 out of 5 stars only because it is a great price and I'll use it to hold loose curls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be \\"Buildig a Relationship with your Manager\\"","review":"With a title like \\"Manage your Manager\\" I expected advice and tactics on how to deal with a manager who doesn't build effective relationships. Perhaps someone untrustworthy, or irrational. I believe that if you had a manager with whom the presented advice would work, you wouldn't be looking for this topic in the first place. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOODBYE RAPE!","review":"When asked why the Rape Song \\"Abduction\\" was removed from modern productions, the authors explained \\"Rape had a different meaning back then, and modern audiences might find it offensive\\" Okay, at what point did the word Rape get a different meaning? It's meant pretty much the same thing for the past 400 years. Re Censoring a musical classic makes The Fantasticks first act SO saccharine, one easily could get insulin OD. The whole second act is dark and offensive, so why remove one of the more CLEVER songs and connotation of the Rape of the Sabine Women, the same story SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS was taken from. Censorship, Political Correctness and the butchering of a standard is disgusting and, as far as I'm concerned, one of the seven Deadly Sins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Always a classic, this is almost as wonderful as the original, but with the new release of the re-mastered original cast, I would probably stick to that recording. This is delightful as well though, even if the re-wording of It Depends On What You Pay (in order to remove the use of the word \\"rape\\" so as not to offend..) seems obvious,forced and ludicrous.

It takes courage to tell the story of the young victims, the Palestinian children detained by the Israeli government. In what other \\"civilized\\" society would such human rights violations be tolerated? The book is well written and balanced in its approach to the problem, and presents a clear picture of the hardships the Palestinians, particularly young Palestinians, face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belkin Cable","review":"I needed a cable that would go far enough to reach my desk top and not infringe on other items on my desk.

I just gave it a one to move the rating to the right position. This album has three or four good tracks and the rest are uninspired songs you might find on a mixtape. I like BG, but this album is pretty bad. He needs to get some songs with actual concepts besides choppers, drug dealing, and sex.

It's packed with information, but written in such a comfortable style that it's a pleasure to read. The writing is so clear. Strong has great respect for and love of the loon. I can't say enough about Strong's obvious integrity and appreciation for nature. You will want to own this!

No more Amazon for this family...we are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usual high quality in an outstanding series for kids","review":"My introduction to this series was my older brother's slightly worn Scholastic copy of Mystery of the Green Ghost. We both read it several times, and once we found out there were more, look out! We read them from the library, we cajoled Mom into taking us to the mall to buy them, we bought them at a local used bookstore. We were both hooked!I can recommend every book in this series. My brother and I both read all the Hardy Boys (and liked them a lot), but these blow them out of the water! I think you can get 1-10 new (they've been reprinted), the rest you'll have to get used.I've still got a complete set, but I'm rebuying them for a nephew. He's as excited about them as I was over 20 years ago. Excellent characters, spooky happenings, and just enough chills to keep a kid's pulse racing.If you have kids, I can't recommend these highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"My daughter just turned 1 year and this bag is an upgrade from the basic diaper bag.

That is the biggest drawback."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dragonless dragon bag","review":"The bag arrived, and was exactly like the picture except it was MISSING THE DRAGON.Did my dragon come to life and fly off the bag?

It can even fit 2 bottles in the attachment. Behind, there is another big pocket (where we keep the changing pad that it comes with) and a small pockets for little extra whatevers. There is also a pocket on the side for my water bottle. I love the clips for my keys and pacifier, there are 2 clips! I also love the cell phone pouch. The big pocket is big enough for receiving blankets, clothes, toys, etc. It was always full when she was a newborn and now I have extra space as she gets bigger, so I could use this for 2 kids someday if needed. We have been using this bag for 10 months and I have washed it a few times, very durable! My husband loves it and doesn't mind carrying it around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest diaper bag!","review":"It took forever to find the perfect diaper bag and this thing flings over your chest and keeps snug to your body making it really easy to manage it and the baby.

I am sorry I bought it. It cannot stand up on its own when you set it down, and tips over constantly. The main compartment is way too small and my hand gets stuck pulling stuff out. Definitely not a wise choice if you'll be carrying lots of stuff with you. Also, the black color shows dirt! Think twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"This diaper bag is not the best one out there. The main pouch is not very spacious and once it is filled it pushes out on the three zipper pockets and the singed pocket in the back making them less usable.

It's super comfortable, easy to use and has lots of compartments for organization. Overall a great everyday bag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great; Zipper tabs broke twice","review":"First off, the bag is pretty small and doesn't fit very much in it. the main compartment is sort of like a black hole or the bermuda triangle. Things go in and never come out. Other than that, the bigger problem we had was that the metal tab of the zipper (what you hold on to to open and close the zipper) broke not once but twice. The first time, we shipped it back to the manufacturer and they repaired it and sent it back. Another one just broke and this time we're just going to return it. we're not particularly rough with the zipper tabs, nor are we big ogres who have really strong grips and can bend and break metal. I would recommend a different bag and wouldn't purchase one from Diaper Dude again, personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked better in pictures than in real life","review":"Quality of materials is sub par.

I got it for my first baby and could only use it if I had a second bag to put all the baby stuff in that wouldn't fit in the diaper dude. the front zip pockets are tiny, as are all the compartments. I spent 60 bucks on this and now I use a reusable grocery bag that cost $2 because it's so much better! If I had that $60 back I'd go buy a nice normal Graco diaper bag like all my friends have. Grrr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for what it is...","review":"If my brother hadn't had his heart set on this, I'd have gone for something less expensive and better quality.

Upon reciept we were thrilled but upon inspection? The material is a scratchy sorty of vinyl-esque material. We were expecting a softer more supple nylon, similar to the nylon in higher end REI or LL Bean Gear (I mean, for the price we think the expectation was reasonable!) Instead the material is a stiff thin nylon, and the entire bag makes a crinkly sound when you touch it. I'm dating myself here but this bags material reminds me of cheap 80s parachute pants... This is the type of material you get when you get the free cosmetic case from Lancombe...Sadly we returned it and are still looking for another option.

I used it until my baby was about 3 months old, then I just bought a bigger purse that I could throw some diapers and wipes in to and kept any thing else I might need in the car. The bag has several outside pockets, but if those have much of anything in them, there not enough room in the inside, and vice versa. My baby had reflux and we always needed at least a burp cloth and extra clothes most of the time. We tend to travel light, but this bag's design is just not efficient and there just isn't enough for a few diapers, wipes, burp cloth, and perhaps a few things mom or dad might need. I am about to have baby number two, so I thought I would try this bag out again, and before even leaving the house realized I need to shop for a new bag because this one barely fits enough for 1 kid, and definitely not what I will need for two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Neither my husband nor I are satisfied with this diaper bag. It isn't very spacious despite its bulk. The buckles are large and awkward; I've hurt myself with them twice. I can't get the zippers open with one hand, so nothing is easy to access. I plan to replace this with a different diaper bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag - Smaller Than Expected","review":"After looking at the pictures of this bag I expected a good sized bag that would easily carry a change of clothes for my potty-training toddler as well as all the necessities of carting a newborn around. It's a great quality bag - I love the large zippers and the multiple pockets - but it's not NEARLY as big as it looks in the images. Also, the cell-phone pocket on the shoulder strap is a joke - it's too small to hold any current smartphone, which is what a majority of people have these days. If you're not lucky enough to have one, and still have one of those smaller issues, consider yourself lucky with this bag - your phone will fit conveniently in the pocket! My husband also loves this bag, which is a plus, since, as a stay-at-home dad he'll be using it much more than I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"Bought it for myself.. it was the only bag I found that would fit my personality.

The single row of stitching holding on the three front pockets is unraveling, so they are falling off. The changing pad is inside, which is a pain after you've packed everything else up, picked up baby, then you're left trying to figure out how the hell to get that thing back in the bag without taking everything out again. Also, once the inside is full of stuff the back pockets become completely useless.

I even get compliments on this bag when I wear it. The bag works for both genders and is very unique.The number of pockets might disappoint some people as a traditional diaper bag is very roomy and has many many pockets. Some people may find this bag a little disappointing if you are used to huge bags with a ton of room. However it fits everything you will need for an all day outing and even over night if need be.

The discs all play correctly in other drives.

The band was incredibly loud and I was sure distortion would creep in. Not so.This bank rocks. If you want a great fast paced piece for those morning drives to work, buy it.

I would recommend this book for anyone; From people with small children, to whom they wish to read in latin, to the adult student who wishes to see a prime example of the latin language in use. On a side note, the fairy tales presented here are fabulous.

I don't grasp all the vocab in this book, but the fun part is that you already know the basic story so you can more easily figure out from your foggy memories of Latin and fairy tales.

I read it to my daughter to give her exposure to another language. Great book, fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for me","review":"Where do you go with Latin when you have some grip of the mechanics of the language - conjugations, declensions, and common grammatical constructions? This book fills that void; it presents complete readable texts for, in my opinion, the intermediate Latin student. It is funny to read a familiar story in an ancient language. How would you say \\"little piggy\\", \\"not by the hair if my chinny chin chin\\", or \\"let me in\\" in Latin? I notice the application of various points of grammar, and the contemporary vocabulary breathes life into this classic language. I think more reading at this level will improve my competence, and maintain my interest in Latin. Please, reader, suggest other texts of this level of difficulty for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, but...","review":"It's a very nice and readable book that is entertaining to read.

There are loads of colorful pictures that my son loves to look at while I read to him.Puer Zingiberi Panis: et Fabulae Alterae (Latin Edition).If you're up for something a bit harder tryFabulae Divales: Fairy Tales in Latin (Latin Edition).

But I must say that this one is more special because it names and clearly describes key dispositions that are fundamental to true conversion. In another of his book \\"Invitation to Love\\" chapters 17 & 18, the first four Beatitudes and the last four, respectively, the author does an admirable job of relating the heart and soul of the present title to the Beatitudes. In doing this, he powerfully drives home the point of imitating Christ(or of even being more Christ-like). The way to conversion is not easy, nor did anyone say that it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"PIAA Super Sporza Wipers","review":"These are by far the best wipers I've ever bought.

I am not saying that Merton's writings do not have value for pseudo-spiritual religious seekers, but his journal entries lack depth and poetry. He is a man who has not found himself but is constantly searching for himself: he loves the monastery/he hates the monastery; he loves a woman/he does not love the woman; he wants to move/ he wants to stay. The fact that this man has had so many books published and so many of his personal journals turned into published books makes one thing perfectly clear about the mainstream puiblihsing industry---they want to squeeze the last drop of milk out of dry cows."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed 2nd grader","review":"I had to read this book for my teacher in 2nd grade.

All the stories deal with survival at sea in the waters off Alaska. The stories are kind of repetitive but if you like the first one you'll like the rest.

Like \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\", this film slowly squeezes the viewer into a bottle-neck of engrossing yet terribly embarassing dramatic situations. At times I found it difficult to breathe while watching this film. It's also very beautifully photographed. However, the DVD transfer is terrible. Mottled artifacts of the MPG (DVD) encoding process can be seen swarming in the shadows, and still-life scenes look frozen and slightly odd. Not recommended.

The first phase is a series of drills, such as putting the knight in the center of the board and finding the least number of moves to get to each square of the board, to be repeated over and over. Many people might feel a little dopey, not to mention bored, following through on this. And the drills are not really explained in detail, nor are any answers given. The second phase is to buy the software CT-ART (purchased separately) and go through its 1000 problems 7 times. The book suggests a particular schedule for doing this, with each pass twice as fast as the preceding. The third phase is some simplistic strategic guidelines (since the author's own experience was that he actually couldn't quite make it all the way to Expert just with tactical training). The book strikes me as more on the lines of a motivational, self-help kind of work; there's not much chess in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Minutes ABS!","review":"This book offers nothing new in terms of improving your chess.He brings no new ideas, no new methods, other than to study tactics. Nothing in the book is composed by him, the vision drills, or anything else. Actually 99.9% of the work involved refers to chess software (CD Art 3.0) as a guideplan. If you are into 5 minutes abs, or get rich quickly type of programs then this book is for you. The author himself does not play anymore, as you can see at:http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?12775875If tactics is an issue for you I would recommend CD Art 3.0 directly rather than buying this book and listing to this guy rave on how he did it.Jeremy Silman puts it very well in his article about the book athttp://www.jeremysilman.com/book_reviews_jd/jd_rapid_chess_improv.htmlThere is no such a thing as rapid chess improvement.

The chess vision exercises are okay, but if you search for Dan Heisman's articles you'll find better. I wonder about a chess program that takes 1500 hours to jump to 2 grades. Perhaps a bit more insight and less drilling might cut this in half. If your looking for insight skip this book the author has none. So if you want the book in a nut shell practice simple chess positions lots and lots of times. His training method does work, I make fewer dumb mistakes against Fritz 8.0, but why pay for it.The author recomends CT_ART 3.0 instead of chess book problems.

He hasn't played since [this review is being written February 2003]).Had he taken a large number of students who followed his method and stated that a certain percentage increased so many points would be acceptable: but he's taken himself as the only example for his method's success: quite a small statistical sample.I'd say that anybody who spends as much time studying chess as the author proposes would improve following a different improvement method (like Silman's \\"How to reassess your chess\\") that would be more balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"What to look for when planning a move","review":"Rapid Chess Improvement: A Study Plan For Adult Players by chess writer and expert Michael de la Maza is a very solid and straightforward guide for anyone who wants to learn tips, tricks, and techniques to swiftly improve the competitiveness of their chess game.

Consequently, the method that the author suggests can work for some people and can't for somebody else. Personally, I think some ideas like the tactical drill are useful and they can actually help a beginner to improve. Basically I think the ideas in the book should deserve something like three starts. So, why I gave to the book only one star? The fact is that the ideas deserve three stars but the book itself it is an attempt to cheat the reader/buyer. De la Maza wrote in 2000 an article in two parts published on line \`400 Points in 400 Days' The book, which was published a year later, give the same information of the articles. It's just inflated with big pictures a couple of exercises/examples and some bla-bla-bla but if you have read the articles, you won't learn anything new from it.So, my advice is: go to chesscafe.com, download the two parts of the article and save your money for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over William Gibson and Walter Jon Williams....","review":"Nylon Angel is Cyberpunk at it best. Parrish Plessis is a bodyguard to a gang lord in a blighted, toxic ghetto in a dark futuristic Australia reminiscent of the world in Blade Runner. All Parrish wants is to break away from her current employer and have a life of her own but nothing's ever that easy. The storytelling is well-paced and the characters interesting(and sometimes bizarre) while the action is downright vicious at times. Parrish is tough, hip, and smart and not for the faint of heart. If Lara Croft was the good girl in high school with daddy's money and the dazzling smile, Parrish is the tough street punk in a push-up bra with a razor in her combat boots. There are three books in this series though only Nylon Angel is available in the US. Cyberpunk fans, Don't miss this book or you'll be playing catch up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun return to fading genre","review":"An action packed futuristic thriller with a flavor reminiscent of Heinlein. Set in a dark and dangerous landscape, the book features a tough heroine who's only looking to get out of her own personal hell hole. But, in her own bid for freedom, she ends up championing the causes of the downtrodden all around her...not by intention, it just works out that way. I used the name Heinlein and I meant it. This is the way he used to build his books. The sci-fi background of the story oozes out around the action and the interaction of the characters, not in a 30 page monologue. Once you get yourself oriented in de Pierres world, the book rocks along like a roller coaster. A fun read. I'm looking forward to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start for a cyberpunk noir series.","review":"Set in a not-quite post-apocalyptic Australia, de Pierres offers us an entertaining cyberpunk novel with film noir elements.

A very good read and I look forward to the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice start","review":"This book was neither great nor was it poor. There are parts that are really good, cleaver, and interested. On the other hand, there are parts that dragged and it didn't seem to truly finish although there was resolution. At this point, there is no reason for any other author to move over. Also, my experience may have been different from some of the other reviewers since I read the sequel directly following Nylon Angel. I recommend that other readers do so as well. The story ties together much more readily. The extra star is for reading it with the second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric Fail For Gardiner","review":"I'm a fan of some of Gardiner's work. Not this! I am so glad I did not buy it. Not only does the movie not make any attempt to provide a concise trip through its material, but it provides it in such broken fashion that you never know where it is going or why. Also, a large amount of the 75 minutes are nothing but unrelated pictures and music. Seriously, the narrator will take a pause while blurry images of old lamps are shown and rock music played... then more nonsense rambling.... then more pointless, unrelated pictures of household items with piano music...Philip majorly failed here. Did he have something to say? Who the heck knows. There certainly are not any hidden messages or subtext either. This is either a blatant attempt to make money from previously satisfied customers or evidence that Philip's opinion of his own work is not in alignment with his actual skills. I personally believe he needs to check his compasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doyle was nuts!","review":"So it is widely known that ACD was an eccentric, but according to this is was WAY beyond that.

It appears to have been xeroxed then mass printed. The reproduction is so bad that the photographed palm prints given as crucial examples at the end of the book cannot be read because they came out black rendering the lines of the palm invisible. The information Cheiro has to give is truly important. He was THE premiere palmist of the late 19th and early 20th century and what he has to say is extremely important to anyone interested in palmistry. This book however, because of its poor reproduction, is worthless.

Really, even better if you plug it into sonic and knuckles. I like using tails best because he can fly. This enables you to nab a few more extra lives that are too high for sonic to reach. Knuckles is cool, but I've noticed that he cant jump as high as sonic. Super sonic is the best, as he can travel extremely fast and is invunerable to enemies. My friends told me I was lying when I said you could get super knuckles, but get 50 rings and 7 chaos emeralds with knuckles and you will be suprised.

A band biography should be written by a true fan, who's life has been affected by the band's music and inspiration. Most of the information stated as facts were merely untrue rumors! When researching, you should back up your facts from more than one source (NOT just some kid on the internet!). The author repeats himself many times as if he is seaching for words to fill the pages. The band has a lot of great things to show for themselves and deserve a better recount of their hard work and success. \\"Step Into the Light\\" is a much better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than words","review":"I read the book music for the people DMB. Nevin Martell did an outstanding job of bringing us closer to a group of five individuals that we have all come to love. I learned many things that I did not know beore about DMB. I think he also gave us better knowledge of each of the members of the band and what they have gone through in their lives it hasn't always been easy for them. I think this makes it easier for us to be on the same level. He is one FINE author and I would suggest this book to all of my friends. I honestly picked it up and did not put it down until I was finished. If you are a true DMB fan you have got to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, yet poorly written","review":"I found this book on the most part, informative, but the writing sytles of Nevin Martell caused the book's information to be scatter and poorly organized. Thus making the book extremely less worthwhile than it could of been. The best part of the book was the setlists, complete cover song list, and the favorite bootlegs of the author. These reasons alone are not enough to purchase the book, as the setlists can be found on the DMB webpage, and bootleg favorites are best left up to the individual, and their personal taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smack the author of this book upside the head","review":"_I_ could have done a better job. This book had several mistakes (One particularly obvious one, if you trouble to glance at a picture of Dave. Blue eyes? Brown hair? Please.), the style wasn't altogether engaging and how many people actually care about the cover band? The lead singer of which, by the way, does NOT resemble Dave Matthews. I cannot believe he put a picture of them in there. Speaking of which, at least the pictures could have been of better quality. Plus, the layout wasn't exactly balanced. It's so maddening to see this kind of thing! Such simple little stuff in presentation and obvious errors in description. Songs that were mentioned in the book left off of the lists in the back to boot. Come on. Ever hear of proof-reading? Honestly, I do think I should try my luck at this. God knows it could not be any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly researched book on my favorite band!","review":"I was looking forward to this book because I thought it would help to update the established book on the band--Morgan Delancey's Step into the Light. Although the information is more current, I found a lot of mistakes here, and the story just is not as solid as Delancey's. All of this aside, the picture are old and really don't compare to some of the original photos that can be found in Step into the Light. This seemed like a quicky job, rather than a labor of love. The result is a book that seems hurried, haphazard, and lacking in factual accuracy. If you have to buy one book on DMB (and I'm not the kind of person who usually reads books on bands) make it Step into the Light. There is still room for another book on DMB--maybe several books--but I don't think this one really breaks much new ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information here","review":"This book is simply a rehash of every interview Dave Matthews has ever done.

It seemingly borrows from \\"Step into the Light\\" without conscious and then even fails to give credit to the author. \\"Step into the Light\\" offers a careful thorough history of the band and the major players without rushing through like \\"Music for the People\\" does. The pace is rushed and glosses over most of the other band members other than Dave and those that were there in the beginning (Peter Greisar). For those info hungry fanatics the book will leave a lot to be desired with a handful of NEW tidbits...unfortunately that information is undermined by the misinformation in the book and the reader is left wondering if it is actually correct at all. Chances are you will find something of interest here but \\"Step into the Light\\" is for the not-so-casual fan. Casual is just what Martell seems to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"To many mistakes","review":"There are to many mistakes in this book. If a person does not know alot about the band they will be mislead. Although these look to be editing mistakes. I don't know how they can miss the wrong song that the band won a grammy for. I also think that the book fails to go into things as much as it should.

If you were hooked in by the blurb on the front that says \\"with interviews and never-before-published photos of the band's legendary live performances\\" then I have much empathy for you. Nevin Martell could have taken a lot more time in writing this book. It appears that he just looked up things on the internet or looked at some old magazine interviews to fill the book.

Yeah, that'll work. Why would I need to interview the band members when I can just use quotes from previous magazine articles. Okay, I'm being sarcastic but it burns me that Martell is making money off this (maybe not if you don't buy it) when it's just a compilation of old news and re-packaged interviews.

The scary thing for me is that there are people too stupid to see how bad his arguments are. I have had people repeat principles from this book and completely unable to comprehend the holes no matter how simple you break down the flaws.

They have to read a strawman version of atheism by someone like Ray Comfort. Atheism isn't the most complex subject in America but like evolution it is misunderstood. Atheism doens't mean an absolute belief there is no God (something Comfort parrots) but can be just nonbelief in a deity. Agnosticism by the way is non-knowledge of a God. I wish more Christians would read something actually written by an atheist in a magazine article, letter to the editor or even a conversation with an atheist neighbor. Aside to Christians, you probably know some atheists and don't realize it. Many atheists, especially in the South, hide their atheism.

It easily explains that if something is designed, there needs to be a designer,(especially something as wonderous and complex as the human body) and uses observations of the world and logic to prove that it's more likely that God exists than doesn't. Im not sure it will speak to hard-core atheists that consider themselves intellectuals who need 'hard facts' that God doesn't exist (although I am aware that God has been scientifically proven) and they may be insulted by Ray's simplistic evidence, but many professed athiests won't be swayed regardless of how much 'evidence' is laid before them. I found his explanations simple and funny yet logical. I admitt that perhaps it gets a bit heavy on the bible stuff towards the end.I am confidence it could sway the fence-sitter and will strengthen a Christian, and gives the Christian some excellent simple observations to bring up with an idle non-believer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why _his_ God?","review":"I have very little doubt that most of Mr. Comfort's arguments could be used equally well to demonstrate that Allah, Brahma,Dhamballah or Kukulcan actually exist, not to mention Odin and Zeus. However, since he doesn't believe _in_ those gods, he overlooks this.As far as arguments from natural sciences - look at the human eye! How could that have evolved? - well, my studies of parasitology provide an interesting perspective. The sacculina parasite (it infests crabs) has a life cycle that would make Loki the trickster blanch, and ichneumon/digger wasps - who paralyze spiders, then lay their eggs in the helpless arachnid's body - would scarcely qualify as the special creation of an omnibenevolent deity."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Does Believe in the Easter Bunny","review":"This was well written considering the majority audience's education level.

Sheepskin linings can be too heavy; some slippers are too \\"shoe-like\\" and rigid to be comfortable, and others are just not sturdy enough for heavy, day-in-day-out wear.We first found these slippers years ago, and have re-ordered them ever since. They are the perfect men's slipper: comfortable, easy slip-on/slip off, simple but elegant design, not to fussy, but with nice detailing. The leather is soft and has a matte finish. They are good for all kinds of weather, neither too warm for summer or too skimpy for cool weather. They last a couple years on daily, hard-wearing, indoor-only use. Every once in a while we have a scare that they won't be made anymore and stock up on them. Hopefully they'll be around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soft-sole Slipper","review":"For several years I've looked unsuccessfully for soft-sole leather slippers like these as a gift for my husband since they're one of the few indulgences he really enjoys.

The less than good news, was that they were a little snug in the toes(something I have RARELY had a problem with, wearing a 12AA shoe). Being slippers, it didn't take long for them to \\"break in\\", and now I where them all the time. I've worn them outside a few times, but I wouldn't recommend it, as they have a real soft sole, which is how I wore out the last pair I had.

At the end of the book, we are left with EXACTLY the same characters. Everyone sleeps around, but no one changes or grows, especially the protagonist. This might have been groundbreaking thirty years ago, but now it is just REALLY depressing. The racial slurs are inexcusable, and the inability for the protagonist to get a life is baffling. The only characters who change are the two sixteen year-old nieces who have nose jobs and go to a \\"fat farm\\" and lose 15 pounds...suddenly they are the only ones happy. This book is really, really awful. Even the sex scenes are awful. About the only circumstance I can imagine recommending \\"Wifey\\" is if you are writing an essay on how depressing and empty the 70's were. Otherwise, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I first started this book, I was anxious to see what happened next; but it eventually got to be monotonous and somewhat repetitive as far as the plot goes. It was an easy read. I am disappointed that I paid $12.99 for such a short, easy to read, disappointing book. All in all, I feel like this book really didn't go anywhere... In my opinion, the ending was fairly abrupt and left you wondering what was going to happen. In fact, I checked more than once to make sure I really was on the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fast read, that will leave you laughing.","review":"\\"Wifey\\" was a great book, and a fast page-turner. I have been a fan of Judy Blume since I was in elementary school, and she has never disappointed me. \\"Wifey\\" is a story about the extracurricular and sexual activities of the well-off in suburban New Jersey, during a summer in the early 1970s. Sandy Pressman has been bored with her life and marriage, until the morning a man on his motorcycle rides onto her property. With her children away at summer camp, Sandy finds herself getting into certain situations that will forever change her \\"good girl\\" image. Meanwhile, life goes on for her husband, family, and friends, most of whom are clueless about Sandy's activities. Written in a humorous prose, \\"Wifey\\" will leave you laughing, and you will not want the story to end. Just be careful not to leave this book where a child will find it, because it is very sexually explicit. \\"Smart Women\\" will be my next read."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Wifey*--another Blume winner","review":"Judy Blume captures yet another mundane suburban life and puts a candid and humorous spin on it with Wifey. One can't help but identify--or at least sympathize--with New Jersey housewife Sandy Pressman and her strained marriage, repressed husband, and demanding extended family. All 33-year-old Sandy wants is to live a little, burst her protective bubble, and earn some respect from her condescending hubby Norm.Blume's style is so honest and Sandy's fantasies are so vividly sexual--and often absurd--that Wifey, while a quick and easy read, holds some strong literary merits for its brazenness and commanding humor. Pick up this *adult* read (many of Blume's books are for young teens, but this is NOT one of them!) and escape into Sandy's fantasy world and exasperating reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable fast read","review":"When I was a kid I read every Judy Blume book published including certain parts of Wifey! I've finally taken the opportunity to read the entire book and found it my favorite of her adult novels. The story pulled me right through and I read the whole thing in one day! That's tough with three kids running around, believe me! The book was sexy, honest and in many parts, hilarious. The characters were very believable, so much that I wanted to ring several of their necks! I highly recomend this book, especially if you've enjoyed her other books, but take my advice, if you have curious kids; HIDE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twinkies for the brain! 90210 in print!! Lots of sex!","review":"I bought this after reading Summer Sisters (highly recommend Summer Sisters as one of my favorite books -- a surprise as I'm a top seller fiction reader -- grisham, koontz, patterson) -- this book was a 4 hour read through will little to no character development -- lots of sex, but even that was a bit dull as it was meaningless -- I would equate this to watching 902 or a sunday night movie -- a quick way to pass the time but not too engrossing -- i'm just glad i bought it in softcover --"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Storyline drags on and nothing in her life interesting really happens unless it's a dream or fantasy. It really starts to depress me because her life is so sad and she seems to do nothing about it to improve it and has fantasy's about what she would like to to to change but never does. I take it back... she starts to cheat on her husband with an old flame and I find that depressing as well. I know many people do it but to me it just seems like she's taking the easy way out. I didn't find the main characters likeable and find them wimpy in how they deal with their life and failure of a marriage. I will not finish this book i'm sorry i paid for it on my kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing!!","review":"I loved Judy Blume's adult novel 'Summer Sisters' so I was excited to read 'Wifey'. I was so disappointed, the book left me feeling completely depressed and unsatisfied! The husband is a complete jerk and the wife is such a pushover. I wanted to hear about her triumph over her dominating husband, but instead it was a story of female submission and never-ending heartache.Would not recommend if you're looking for a light, enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"There are so many other great books out there. As a woman, I did not identify with this repressed, depressing character at all. The dialogue drags on pointlessly sometimes and the writing is unpoetic. If you are in the mood for a brainless read for a plane ride, this would be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Climatic","review":"This is kind of a boring book, maybe it was scandalous for its time, but its not now. The main character is a push-over and I felt that the sex scenes were almost disturbing because of her attitude :/ While reading I thought that it would be just boring at first, setting the scene and giving background info about the character but the whole book was like that pretty much. The ending is pretty bad too, in the way that when I got to the ending, I had NO idea I was at the ending! I would say check this out at the library if you are curious like I was and want to give it a try, or get the paperback so you can sell it back, because this book was not worth the $12.99 for the kindle in my opinion and I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"this was the most frustrating and annoying book i have ever read. the main character was such a sap it was painful to read about her exploits. the back of the book made it seem like she went out on sexual adventures when in actuality she either fell into the situation or didn't have enough of a backbone to get out of it. It was just agitating to read about a woman who couldn't think for herself and was walked all over by her husband. the only reason i can think you might want to buy this book is to skim it and only read the dirty parts otherwise, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An annoying read","review":"I read Judy Blume's Summer Sisters as a teenager and loved it and loved her other works throughout my childhood. Now as an adult I found her book Wifey terribly disappointing. The main character and I suppose protagonist is anything but. Sandy is an extremely weak and annoying woman. I understand that the story is set in a different time period where the world was quite a different place, but I just wanted her to snap out of it and stop being so weak. Usually I pass my books onto my friends and family to read. I will not do so with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Judy Blume needs to stick to her teenage books.

I didn't find it funny, amusing or entertaining. I am a police officer who has fought for the right of women to live in a violence free environment for over 15 years. Wifey sets us back 20.

Judy Blume cannot write. The characters are total stereotypes -- there is not one original thought in the entire book. None of the characters have any maturity, perspective, intelligence or judgment. It's hard to overstate how irritating this book is to read. Every one of the main characters is a Jewish suburbanite from New Jersey -- hardly a compelling set of personalities. Even the sex scenes are badly done. This book is just wretched -- predictable, shallow, like a cartoon. A bad cartoon. It's the literary equivalent of the little card in the seat pocket on the plane with instructions on how to use the life vest --it's about that superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash it","review":"Got it for a penny, read the first chapter, then threw it away.

Judy Blume make Sandy (the main character) come to life. I was not able to put the book down. The book is about a house wife in the NJ subarbs who is sick of her husband. Her children went to camp for the summer and she was left with nothing to do. Her strugles to keep busy are hillarious! So many things are going through her head every day. She always is thinking about how her relatives will react to her events.

It simply tells the story of a housewife who's got an itch to scratch but goes about it the wrong way.It did have amusing parts, such as the description of her sex life with her husband (how horribly droll!) but in general, today's woman has more control and power in her life, her sexuality and her marriage and, hopefully, will not be able to relate as well to her.I know that a book shouldn't be \\"predictable\\" but in this case I would have liked a cliché ending of \\"happily ever after\\". Rather, I was dragged along her journey of frustrations and felt like kicking her along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewers Let Me Down!","review":"I'm baffled as to how people can give this book a 5 stars. I bought this book last week based on the positive reviews on this site. You guys let me down.I was hoping for another Summer Sisters when I purchased this book, but when I finished it occured to me that perhaps Summer Sisters was written by a ghost writer.The main character in \\"Wifey\\" wasn't likeable in the least. She was angry, repressed, boring, and completely irritating. As another reviewer stated, this book was filled with stereotypes and I noticed a score of political undertones.The characters lacked developement, there weren't any scenes I looked forward to, and it seemed Blume tried so hard with the sex scenes that she missed sexy and went right for slutty. I felt like I was reading about a washed-up hippie commune without the love or drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such an easy read!","review":"This is the first adult novel that I have read by Judy Blume. I was hooked from the first page; not really because of the story itself, but how it was written. Reading this book was like reading a letter from a friend; there wasn't a single paragraph that I found boring. Honestly, I felt like I was reading about myself. I laughed a lot at things that were so true to marriage. Of course, I think Judy could write about composte and make it enjoyable to read! This is a must for women that love books about women; a much better read than any romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not satisfy!!!

I enjoyed Summer Sisters, and of course, Judy Blume bks. I read growing up. This was very depressing and I found it somewhat disgusting.

I don't know if I should even try Smart Women....but according to someone elses review, it was better, so I'll give it shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different & Fun!","review":"This book was fast-paced, funny and trashy. Her husband, Norman drove me nuts with his to-do lists, the special treatment of the dog, and how he hated his meal schedule interrupted.

Yet, I believe these things \\"do\\" happen in real life and that's what I loved most about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"I have always been a fan of Judy Blume. I read Summer Sisters last year, but I never even knew about Wifey until one of my friends told me about it. I really enjoyed the book!! It was a \\"turn-on\\" to me.

However, I was a little disappointed. It was an okay story, but I found it hard to follow in the beginning. It jumps back and forth from different time perionds in the main character's life. The ending, I thought, was unresolved and left you hanging. It's not a book I would go running out to buy. But if you've got nothing else to read and just want a good \\"filler\\" book between novels, it's a quick and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, Exciting Book Dies With Lousy Ending","review":"I would have given \\"Wifey\\" five stars, but it's ending was such a disappointment that I could only give it four. After all of the personal exploration that Sandy does, for her to recapitulate was a drag, to put it simply.

The pictures are good, complete with clear bird identification markings. The strange choice of background color for the pages detracts from the image quality. Most of the pages are either pale blue or pale yellow. When I recently saw the new National Geographic bird guide with pictures depicted on white pages, the National Geographic birds come through with much better perceived quality. All the text and range maps are in the Kaufman book and they are fairly complete with good descriptive text and maps on the same page as the subject bird.

Second was raised donuts and then fried chicken. All to perfection. Once in a while I get bubbles coming from the filter. No oil leaks and I think Some of the stuff in the bottom has passed thrpough the filter and because the heating element is close. It's cooking in there. Not a problem, but kind of disconcerting the first time 'cause you're waiting for the oil to leak everywhere. Didn't happen. I really don't care about getting the exact 375 degrees just as long as the finished product is wonderful.

Although T-Fal is a popular brand which I thought had a good reputation, I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been a great fryer","review":"This fryer is everything I want in a frier. It holds quite of bit of oil so batch size is decent. Good temperature control and it heats up reasonably fast. The vent has a grease catcher but not a carbon filter though. The drainage system works great and makes cleanup a breeze. I typically re-use oil once before discarding it. Overall the unit is fantastic.Edit: a shame but after a year or so, this unit no longer heated to 375F. I had been getting batches of sogginess and sure enough, the temp was 300-320 max. Too bad, I like the oil recycling system.Question: why are deep fryers so unreliable nowadays???"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Did I Do Wrong?","review":"I used a secondary restaurant-quality thermometer, and I couldn't get this fryer over 320 degrees F. Then it shut off completely and would not come back on. I know there is a reset button the back, but, hey, who wants to move a gallon of 225 degree oil around on the counter so they can see the back?I wasted a gallon of peanut oil, 4 pounds of cod, and was in tears. Now I see that the refund policy is replacement only. I've emailed the merchant - I hope I can return it. I guess I should have read that part first. It got the best reviews of all the fryers I looked at, and I spent a good week reading about them.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrical failed","review":"I purchased this unit and the electrical unit failed. I tried the reset button and it did nothing. I had to mail it back and they did send me a new unit in two weeks. Well I've used the new unit about 15 times over the course of the last year and the electrical unit has failed again. I have tried the reset button again--not sure what it is good for because it never reset anything. I feel this could definitely be a manufacturing defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS! Cold. Not Deep.","review":"This is a real disappointment.It leaks. It's never been above the top line and even when it's at the bottom line it leaks -- so it's not overflowing the container. I've made sure that the container's properly sealed and have opened and closed it several times to see if I can make a difference. I'm not sure where it's coming from, but it leaks every time that it drains. I have to keep it in an old broiling pan or it'll make a mess every time.It's not a \\"deep\\" fryer. It has lots of oil, but the basket sits in the very top leaving quite a bit of oil below it. It's ok for french fries or things that don't require much depth, but you'll have to flip your chicken pieces as if you were pan-frying and it doesn't hold much.It's about 40 degrees cold. I've tested it with a digital candy thermometer. Even if I set it at it's max temperature, I have to add time to all of the cooking instructions to get the food cooked properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fryer","review":"Wow!! I can't stop making fries. I have only used the fryer for fresh fries and frozen potato tots. The family has stopped buying frozen fries. I use eight medium sized potatoes for a family of four. Great ease of maintenance removing oil and cleaning. This is my first fryer after searching out many reviews and by far this is the best countertop fryer. A must appliance in your kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"received unit, followed direction, went to cook french fries at 370 degrees. Unit only went to 310 degrees. Sent heating unit to service center. replacement came. Only heats up to 350 degrees, not the 374 on the dial. The basket and container are not very deep. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fryer!!!!","review":"I just got my fryer and fried my first round of food and I must say this fryer is great. I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone. The automatic oil filtering system works great when you use the proper amount of oil. Had no problems with leaks or anything. To assist with the oil vapor/food ordors they probably should have thought about putting a carbon filter in between the steel filter. Other than that works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than my old one. i like the way the oil is filtered and stored","review":"much better than my old one. i like the way the oil is filtered and stored.workes great with french fries"},{"rating":"1","title":"blew up in my face","review":"I purchased this unit a number of years ago on the basis of the oil filtration system and the ability to keep it clean in the dishwasher. I used it four or five times and was very pleased with the ability to drain the oil and keep the used oil in the fridge. About the fifth or sixth time I used it, it started making a loud bubbling noise, and when I opened the top, oil exploded all over the kitchen and my face. (fortunately I wear glasses and wasn't badly burned.) I think I called T-Fal and didn't get any satisfaction. I subsequently saw a recall notice for a JC Penney fryer that looked identical, but TFal continued to deny any knowledge of such a problem. At some point I tried using it again (on the porch), and it wouldn't go over 300 degrees, so maybe I just had a bad unit. I might try another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rubbish, what a mess!","review":"as with most of the other 1 star reviews I had the same issue.

STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is my first and only review. I used to have the Hamilton Beach fryer on here, but it got left in the rain(idiot move). It did an excellent job, but messy to clean(plus half the price). I thought I would upgrade. Bad Idea. Put the oil in and let it preheat to the 374. The Preheat light went off. I dropped a test piece into the oil. Went straight to the bottom and barely bubbled. I let it heat more. No better. Never got to temperature. Ruined half the dinner with greasy balls of fish. Had to go to a pot of oil and finished dinner. I am returning asap. Stick the Hamilton Beach. Has a charcoal filter you will probably like better.Hamilton Beach 3 Liter Deep Fryer Digital Timer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Used it once and found problem. Seemed well made, oil drain worked nicely, however to cook properly you need hot oil and oil temp was always 20-25 degrees below the setting. For some food the maximum oil temp of 350 is ok for frying but for some you need 370-375 and it never got above 350. I used two different thermometers to check, stirred oil etc and it definitely was not good. Finally just brought it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this fryer!!","review":"I received this fryer two days ago and used it last night for the first time and it was a dream!We fried frozen breaded shrimp, frozen fried okra and some hushpuppies and it all came out great. I did make sure I only filled it with oil to the max line and left it to drain overnight. Checked this morning and it had drained properly and there was not a drop of oil on the counter!! I did use it under the stove hood because of what people had said in some of the reviews but I don't think I really needed to do that. I didn't notice much smell when I was cooking and there was no smell once I was done and none this morning. Can't wait to fry some catfish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drainage Problem (Mess)","review":"This product makes great fries and performed as advertised the first few times I tried it. Waited 3 hours after turning it off before draining. After the fifth time I used it I came into the kitchen to find about 7 cups of oil on the counter and floor (hence the mess). I thought maybe I had overfilled it with oil so I carefully measured again and reused it 2 weeks later. Same result same mess. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice.....well you know. Two strikes and you are out."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Fal Pro Fryer","review":"I love the T-Fal Pro-Fryer. It is an excellent product that heats fast and fries seafood to perfection! The ability to easily filter,drain,store and reuse the oil really saves money and mess. I typically reuse the oil at least 4-5 times even when frying shrimp or chicken. Cleanup is soooo easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined my kitchen","review":"While eating dinner all of the oil leaked out of the fryer, down the front of the hot stove and into the door seal of the stove. Cleaning 2.5 liters of oil off of the porcelain tile kitchen floor was horrible. We washed the stove out with degreaser and ran the auto clean cycle and the whole house filled with smoke and still smells. It is quite funny that the box says never touch oil again to stimulate your purchase. I assume that means if you only use the fryer at your neighborhood car repair garage and place the fryer over their oil recyling barrel. French fries should not be eaten any other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"EZ Clean Is Easy","review":"I have no complaints about this product except for the price. Cleaning the oil is easy, the product delivers good fried food, and all the parts (minus the heating element) is dishwasher safe. Can't get any better than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Atlas of Southern Trails to the Mississippi","review":"This is a great book, but not enough info on the trails that I was looking for.

So I figured I needed a long cord, and decided to get this one, which is supposed to be cat 5 stranded patch (which was what I needed.) Well, it's long. That's the only good thing about this cord. But the bad thing is so bad that the cord is useless. There is nothing on the ends! It's just a giant wire! There aren't any connectors on the ends that I can use to plug the cord into my computer, or the router. So I have a cord, but no connectors. It's completely useless, unless I buy the connectors separately, and attach them myself. Do I know how to do that? Do I want to do that? No. So I'm returning this. Maybe, if all you need is the cord (it's grey, by the way), and not the connectors, you might be able to use this. Otherwise, it's completely useless. If you can't find any cords this long that have connectors, maybe you should consider trying a shorter cord. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patch Cable - Super Long, but did not come with the clamps","review":"Based on the picture, I thought that this super long cord would have come with the ends that go from one device to the other. It did not. So I now have all of this wire when I should have just gone to Wal-Mart and purchased a 50Ft patch cord with the ends in tact. I did go to Wal-Mart and I'm satisfied.

The language absolutely flows off the page and the story keeps you hooked right to the end. Max Lakeman is a grown-up who not only still mows lawns for a living, but LOVES to do so. The book tells his story in a similarly original and almost childlike manner. Mr. Cohen brings us an amazing story not only from the point of view of the hero but also from the point of view of his dog!

Brando's focus here is on characters. The way they walk, talk, eat, drink, dress, kill and die is poetic, enigmatic and disturbing under Brando's direction. This film is filled with overly beautiful photography and highly detailed sets.The film's opening credits seen over Hugo Friedhofer's score seem very traditional. As the camera moves into the bank it soon becomes apparent that images can be quite deceiving. In a film full of deceit and betrayal Brando's allegorical style slowly becomes clear. A strange and uneasy film it is remains offbeat yet very captivating.This is an excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"This is a terrible non-functioning case.

I did not find it helpful for children. Children were drawn in to the story (I used it in the classroom) but couldn't identify with the issues of other autistic children. I, too, think that stories about nonverbal autistic children with motor stims is very limiting. Finally, I must say that the author is obviously very self-important, which I found to be a turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice book, but very limited in it's use with kids","review":"This is a lovely book, and the author's photo/illustrations are a nice idea. Anyone purchasing this book should be aware that Russell is non-verbal, and stereotypical in his mannerisms and behavior. As a parent of a 4 year old autistic son, I wish there were a book that discussed issues such as perseveration and echolalia...both drive my six year old completely crazy!! I shared this book with him, and it didn't really offer him any insight. If you have an aloof, non-verbal child, this is a great book. If not, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke my heart!","review":"As the parent of a child with autism, I was very excited by the possibilies this book offered. There is limited availability of books for children on autism. I was saddened though as a I read this book and looked into Russell's eyes. The pictures made him seem so isolated from his family and the world. All children have gifts and this book did not share Russells' gifts. It did not make me want to know Russell only feel sorry for him. My son's brother did not want this book read to his classmates as it would make them feel sorry for his brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many better books on autism out there","review":"This is one of my least favorite children's books on autism. It examines one autistic boy from his family's perspective, not his own. The pictures are black and white and very grim. While it might be useful for children who have a sibling with autism, it does little to give encouragment to the family or explain to that sibling how he can still have a brother who loves him very much. Granted, it looks at the life of a severely autistic child, not one with PDD-NOS, AS, or HFA. But it just felt so fatalistic to me-cold and clinical. Not recommended for classroom reading or reading to children, especially not for inclusion teachers.

Star Fox on the N64 just had tank and flying and thats what we wanted. But when i got Star fox 64 i wanted foot missions, now that I got them, i have to face the fact that it sucks. The flying missions are great and fun and so are the tank missions. But then u go to a foot mission and the action is stopped by the controls of the onfoot missions. Its a good thing that there arent a lot of on foot missions. People dont buy this game.

On the ground the enemies get killed in two hits and some can only be killed if you fully charge your gun. The tank is hard to use and not all that great.

If not, then buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter disappointment.","review":"What a let-down this game is. Seriously, is it too much to ask for a solid flying game like Star Fox 64 was? I mean getting out and walking around shooting things is great and all, but this is a STAR FOX game, and the last thing I would buy a Star Fox game for is to run around and blow things up, especially when there are other games out there that fulfill that type of game play so much better. I was expecting the bulk of this game to be spent flying around in an R-Wing....boy was I wrong.Do yourself a favor if you've never bought a Star Fox game before, go to a pawn shop, get a N64 and buy Star Fox 64.

No chasing ghosts to save Krystal here. This time the Lylat system is at stake and you must battle Borg-like creatures on several planets to save it.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"Other reviewers have described the control scheme, so I won't get into that. I love everything about the game except for the third-person perspective. I hate not being able to aim down weapon sights. Other than that, I have noticed that the characters move insanely fast on foot, and the multiplayer maps are pretty small and simple. Also, whether you are playing this with a gamecube or a backwards compatible Wii, you need a memory card. I would recommend the Madcatz 4x Gamecube Memory Card (251 Blocks) because it is very cheap.

And Now that it's FINALLY out, it was definetely not worth the money. The graphics are really good, and the music is really entertaining, but besides that it's terrible. The story is one of the worst I've ever seen in a video game. The voice acting is monotonous and all sounds like the actors are reading straight off the script, and just saying the words. But the biggest problem is the terrible controls. The landmaster tank is impossible to drive, and Fox can't even turn around well. This game has some okay rail flying missions, but the areas you fly in are too small to move away from things you can fly into. I loved Star Fox 64 on the N64, and hated Star Fox Adventures. There have been no good Star Fox games since 1997. If this series wants to continue, there needs to be a good game. If there isn't, no more Star Fox games will be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"very ok","review":"This game could have been so much better. The game was far to short, to much running instead of flying, and bad voice acting. The main reason I rented this game was to have that old star fox 64 feel.

(The only reason I gave it two stars for fun is because I owned Infiltrator for the original NES, I know what ONE star fun is!)The second you see Fox standing there with his pistol, the ONE star light should come on. If I wanted to see Fox running around, I would have bought that stupid Star Fox Adventures game. (P.S.

The boy Toby runs away from his foster home to work at the circus. From the very beginning he has his doubts about his decision, but doesn't want to break his word to the candyman who has offered him a job. Toby soon finds out that living and working and traveling with the circus is very different from what he expected. He has to work hard, gets little sleep and little food, and feels homesick. What keeps him going are his friends - at first, an old monkey, then a living skeleton and a fat lady, and he wins more and more hearts as time passes. He even gets a chance at becoming a circus star - but he still just wants to go home. This is an abridged version (though not much shorter than the original).

I read this book first over 30 years ago in junior high. My friends and I all agreed that this book was amazing. Each and every chapter is filled with a twist or a turn that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I recently read this book again, and it was the only book in the last four years that I couldn't put down. I honestly don't understand how this book is out of print.

My chisels are sharper than I was ever able to get by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good company and tool","review":"This deserves the high ratings it gets in other reviews. I will not repeat those praises here, instead I will offer a piece of advice.You may find that chisels sharpened with the Work Sharp have a slight angle to the edge, higher on the right than on the left corner. This is due to using an excess of pressure on the blade when it is briefly in contact with the disc. This excess pressure can cause the sharpening disc to diverge from level by pushing the it up on the right hand side of the machine. Thus, the disc is at an angle instead of flat relative to tip of your chisel.To remedy this problem use less pressure and place a large diameter, yet thin, fender washer on top at the center of of your disc. The large diameter of a fender washer will help stabilize the disc. It might be necessary to obtain knob with longer threaded portion for thicker washers."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Longer Dread Sharpening","review":"I've always done my sharpening by hand on stones.

Even though the Workshop can perform a range of sharpening tasks, I'm too old to change my habits now. I bought this tool for the express purpose of cutting down the time it takes to bring the backs of tools to perfect flatness and a mirror finish.

Humanity has a lot to unlearn before it could learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocracy","review":"Spong attacks and denies every distinctive point of Christianity while continuing to draw the salary and enjoy the privileges of, and generally trade on being, a Christian bishop.

However, since I did not have the luxury of a belief instilled in me from an early age, I naturally asked many questions that folks who have believed their whole lives didn't dare ask. Spong asks these same questions. While a few of the answers that he gives don't agree with my own experiences or beliefs, I found myself more often than not saying \\"YES!!! THAT'S WHAT I'VE FELT MYSELF!!!\\" In a world where fundamentalists tell us that \\"God said it, I believe it, that settles it\\", Bishop Spong says back to them \\"if your beliefs cannot stand up to a challenge, should you then still hold to those beliefs?\\"If some of these beliefs don't change, then the Christian church is in for a slow and painful death. This book offers a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. While it is certainly not the last word on where Christianity must head, it is certainly a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a straightforward alternative to a thiestic God.","review":"Bishop Spong lays out a carefully reasoned, well documentedand simply stated rejection of the theistic religion that Christianity has evolved to in today's major churches.

How the latter Jesus is helpful to anyone is beyond me. The funny thing is the problem isn't Christianity isn't Jesus or orthodoxy, it is the practice. All this is going to do is make people stand firmer in their positions. Both extreme liberals and conservatives throw God out and instead of blaming the faith, they need to change themselves. This book is only helpful to people who are modernist, it really doesn't help liberal Christians or help people outside of the faith. The scholarship is poor and the arguements are weak.

His writings go against the Bible and sadly, he will be held accountable someday for his false teachings. Christianity will not die because it doesn't change. That is the joy of loving a God that never changes and is always the same, yesterday, today and forever. He is a Saviour and the only way to eternal life is thru Jesus Christ. I'm sure Mr. Spong will face eternal death before Christianity does if he does not repent and truly give his life to the one that created him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radical Left Collectivist \\"Christianity\\" at its Lowest","review":"John Shelby Spong, supposedly a Christian bishop (although really an atheistic collectivist or communist), attempts to reconcile his radical left-wing philosophy with a traditional Christian Church that has established its beliefs over 2,000 years. Actually, he tries to bend the \\"ultraorthodox\\" (with which, IMO, is becoming too liberal) Church into his direction. In this serious affront to Tradition, Sacred Scripture, God, and all Christian authority, Spong suggests what amounts to no less than a nihilistic destruction of the entire Christian Church, an alienation of the Christian God (who is a bigoted racist/sexist, by the way), and all who oppose Satan and sin. \\"Acceptance of homosexuality\\" etc. is precisely what the Devil himself would love for us to do. So why give into this wacko and help the cause of Hell? I wasted my money on this book. Add it to the Index of Prohibited Books, now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bishop nears the end of his abandonment of the Christ.","review":"Unfortunately, amazon.com limits the bottom rating to one star. This book, while tolerably written, is an intellectually dishonest book. The Bishop has abandoned the wide spectrum of belief generated by the Christian church (in all its branches and denominations) for nearly 2,000 years. The Bishop is actually creating a new religion, which we might as well call Spongism; he creates a false idol and calls it the Christ. It is revealing that he calls anyone who disagrees with him part of the \\"religious right\\" ignoring the fact that his critics run across the political and religious spectrum. Spongism is a very narrow, intolerant sect -- this book is its high scripture. Regrettably, it is a complete and total abandonment of Jesus and his church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but Not That Historical","review":"As someone who has read loads of Historical Writings about the early Church and what the Gospels are about from a non-theogical point of view, I found much of the research in this book weak. In fact, I wished Spong had talked about the churches in the United States that have allready gone down the path that Spong suggested and what has happen to them, i.e. Christain Science and Unity. It is, however, a easy read and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting to question what is happening in traditional churches and why."},{"rating":"1","title":"More tired old liberal theology-from Tillich to Spong","review":"This is one of the finer examples of the result of following the theology of Paul Tillich-one leaves the oasis thinking that there must be something new to explore, and ends up getting lost in the desert, never to return. Such has been Bishop Spong's spiritual path.Though well written and easy to understand, Spong's book is ultimately a heretical bishop's rehashing of mid-century Tillichian theology, warmed over for semi-educated laymen. Spong makes himself and those on the same theological journey out to be spiritual heroes for departing from traditional Christian orthodoxy, but ultimately the stand he takes must be considered rather uncourageous, both spiritually as well as intellectually. \\"Death of God\\" theologies, such as the one propounded in this book, and utilizing \\"demythologization\\" techniques from the biblical studies realm, ultimately all fail in that they fail to give a rationally-based sense of hope to their adherents."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better title...","review":"Where is the book titled, \\"Why the Episcopal church must reclaim the apostolic faith or die?\\" It isn't Christianity which is dying, just the Episcopal church - which seems to be about nothing - absolutely nothing- and this book is further evidence of that fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated...","review":"I could say a great deal about the book, but I'll content myself with answering the title.

His solution is simple:The Christian faith must continue to evolve as our advances in technology and science have.Spong states that a 2000 year old understanding of God has not been able to keep up with our modern day understanding. As our understanding of God continues to expand, so too must our Christian religion. For some reason his opinion upsets alot of people. Must be true.

Century and who have their doubts about the relevance of a Christianity still being explained from a 1st. Century world view.I was particularly impressed with his definition of prayer.

Having a talent for episcopal politics and realising that books by \\"A Bishop\\" denying the Christian Faith sell, he had peddled a lucrative line in wholly illogical denial. This is is final throw (he goes in 2000) and it is more pathetic and extreme than most.

That's all you need to know about this drivel. His viewpoints are trite, full of empty platitudes. His writing style is amatuership, reflecting very little in the way of true intelligence. A book likes this makes you wish you were illiterate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try...","review":"I believe the Wittenberg Door said it best, \\"Spong calls himself a beleiver in exile because it sounds better than unbeliever.\\" Although Spong makes a serviceable argument in this book, what he ends up with is something other than Christianity. That's fine and dandy, but if it doesn't look like a duck and doesn't quack like a duck, it ain't a duck. Spong also presents a lot of academic theories and scholarly debated issues as if they were universally agreed upon by theologians and biblical scholars. It sounds good if you are unfamiliar with the field but if you have a background in these areas you see that he often bases his arguments on positions that are by no means accepted widely among scholars. Worth a read if you can check it out from your library but not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells us where we are, but not how to get out of here.","review":"Spong does a pretty good job of demolishing traditional Christian teaching here, but he's writing for people who already know that much of traditional teaching is contrary-to-fact and who wrestle with the fact that their Faith somehow survives this knowledge. Unfortunately, he doesn't tell us what to do about this, but he does do a great job of showing us where we stand, and that should help a number of people clarify their thinking. It sure helped clarify mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No surprises here","review":"I am a Christian. I was baptized and confirmed in the Episcopal Church, and I cringe everytime I think about Spong being an Episcopal bishop. How can anyone be a Christian if he doesn't believe in the divinity of Christ?This is a great book for people who think Jesus was just a nice guy who lived in Israel about 2000 years ago. It's not a book for people who have accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good example of bad reasoning","review":"Spong sets up a version of Christianity appropriate for a four year old, bulldozes over it, and then believes he's actually accomplished something. Anyone naive enough to think that hundreds of millions of Christians all over the world have never heard of Newton or Darwin, or really believe in a God who exists \\"Up in the sky\\" or any of the other silly ideas he tries to pass off as part of traditional Christianity will certainly enjoy having their prejudices reinforced in this book. What is extremely interesting and revealing is the fact that he attacks the \\"intolerance\\" of traditional Christians so much, yet clearly believes that anyone who doesn't think like him must be stupid. Spong is simply another flash in the pan. Far from dying, 100 years from now no one will remember Spong, and Christianity will be chugging along as well as ever. And just for the record I am NOT a fundamentlaist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainless drivel","review":"The book is a shallow attempt to try and explain what the author cannot explain. Simply put, he can not explain God or why what happens, happens. Therefore, Christanity's explantaion can not be true or valid. What is true and valid? The author has no idea. This person demands that God be logical and understandable to HIM or he will not acknowledge the existence or correctness of God. Who is God in this thought process? Spong seems to make himself that, perhaps unconcsiously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fashionable Theological Tripe","review":"Within John Shelby Spong's new book, \\"Why Christianity Must Change or Die,\\" readers are treated to Spong sacrificing authentic faith for the price of recognition in academia, a recurring theme in his books. I wept openly at reading a high ranking clergyman bombard Christian theological and moral dogmas which had been believed from the beginning. The questions this book asks of its readers seem to lead them into thinking that traditional faith is so outdated and non-inclusive that one never bothers to ascertain if tradional faith is true or not. This book is Fashionable Academic tripe of the worst sort. If someone wants to read Christian texts from educated writers, try C.S. Lewis or Kallistos(Timothy) Ware, both of which have many more letters following their names than Spong."},{"rating":"1","title":"News to me","review":"Did I miss something? Since when is Christianity dying? The latest world statistics show it to be making steady growth (Buddhism is deteriorating, however). The figures on the Epsicopal church, however, are revealing. Spong's own diocese has lost at least half its members and the Episcopal church in the USA continues to lose members to a dramatic degree. Pentecostal churches are surging, Catholicism is showing steady growth, etc. It is only the most theologically liberal churches which are hemorrhaging members. When you lose theological content, disaster results. God as \\"an immanent Hummmm-m-m-m\\" isn't going to sustain anyone's faith - and won't keep the pews filled.

But in the second half the poor bishop goes astray and settles for too little - he gives up on the supernatural, and as a result offers a god who is no more than 'the ground of being'. So sad.If this is all there is, we are to be pitied indeed. Fortunately there is more to life - a spiritual dimension we can discover for the rest of our lives.

In addition, it just didn't wash up well. I had taken it to a pancake breakfast at church where we got syrup dripped on it, and the syrup didn't wash out!

The foam strips come off easily and the headphones can be reassembled easily. Sounds difficult but it is very simple and painless mod, enjoy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop looking so hard......they're right here!","review":"I spent about a month searching for the perfect headphones for my needs: Movies, games, and music all in one. I was starting to stress myself out from looking so hard and overanalyzing. If you are doing the same thing......just stop and order a pair of these phones. The 555's sound excellent, are extremely comfortable and seem very durable......not to mention a 2 year warranty on top of that. I thought they would leak alot of sound at night if my roomies were sleeping but i just turn them down a bit and they don't hear a thing. I am highly reccomending these cans. Shop around a little.......they have come down in price quite a bit"},{"rating":"2","title":"HD 555 REVIEW","review":"I USE SENNHEISER HD 555 HEADPHONES FOR ABOUT THREE MONTH.

PRICE AROUND $100 SEEMS PRETTY FAIR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anorexic sound","review":"Highly disappointing. I bought these to replace a pair of worn-out Grado SR-60 cans, and was immediately appalled by their brightness and lack of body. The much cheaper Grados were superior, as were Sennheiser's own 'entry-level' HD580.Before sending the HD555's back, I compared them to my super.fi 5Pro earphones (driven by a HeadRoom Total BitHead headphone amp) at work. If anything, the HD555's suffered even more by comparison.I ended up purchasing the Grado SR-80 headphones instead, and am fairly happy with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"These sound so bad that they must be knock-offs!","review":"I have read dozens of glowing reviews of various Sennheiser 5-series headphones, including the HD555. Although the headphones I just received look like the Sennheiser HD555, I find it very hard to believe that they are genuine Sennheisers. They were so cheap ($105) the day I ordered them that I should have smelled a rat. In any case, they sound terrible. I really don't know what else to say. I would not go so far as to accuse the seller (World of Accessories) of selling cheap Chinese junk, but it certainly looks that way. What I know for sure is that the boomy bass, veiled midrange and tepid highs of the headphones I just received are not worth listening to at any price. I'm sending them back immediately. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These headphones have a good sound quality.","review":"These are a good quality headphone.

The softest sound is 7 dB softer and the loudest sound is 8 dB louder using these expanders.These Sennheisser HD-555 Audiophile headphones couldn't take it. They distorted badly and then clipped - the driver was locked at maximum travel.Seriously, $[...] Koss headphones out-perform these things. The Koss cans sound brighter and have no problem with the dynamic range.Audiophile is not a proper description - try pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE-THEY'RE EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE!","review":"These over-hyped headphones are so uncomfortable that they feel like you're wearing a very tight vise over your head!

I have worn out so many cheaper ones, and a few supposedly higher end models, but this set is made very well and has a nice sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm no audio tech head, but these bad boys sound REAL nice","review":"The only reason I'm not giving a 5-star review is because the bass seems to be a bit lighter than I'd have preferred. It's worth noting that I've only put about 10 hours of burn-in time, and I understand that these will sound better after more use, so maybe I'll be happier with the bass output later.Otherwise, these cans sound absolutely fantastic, especially if used for home theater and gaming. It's true that there is no insulation and all sound leaks out, but it's hardly going to wake anyone sleeping in another room, and the trade-off for spatial sound is well worth it. Ambient and environmental audio seems to actually come from different directions instead of all being inside your head. That, coupled with the oh-so-comfortable velour padding gives the illusion that you're not even wearing headphones.Add in the amazing value, and you have some very-near audophile quality cans at a great price. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro listening!","review":"These Sennheiser HD 555 headphones are wonderfull! The sound and reproduction is great.

These headphones squeeze my head terribly, despite me having an average sized dome. After about 20-30 minutes of trying to convince myself it wasn't that big of a deal, I started to develop a headache, and back they went.If anyone is interested, I ended up getting theSony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone, and they are infinitely more comfortable and sound just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving","review":"Well I ordered these headphones purely based on the fact that they are Sennheiser.First of all these headphones are quite uncomfortable. They are tight around the ears and puts undo pressure on the head.The sound quality is mediocore and people can hear whatever you are listening to. The bass is almost nonexisitant and the highs are too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly great, but be wary!","review":"I was very excited to receive these headphones. Sennheiser is a quality name and I take the reviews here very seriously. These headphones come highly rated, BUT after using/testing the headphones for only 2 hours I found them not only to be inferior to the cheaper Bose Triport Headphones I'd been borrowing, but of outright unacceptable quality. The bass had no power behind it and all ranges of frequencies a had slight crackle (most pronounced in the low end). HOWEVER, I maintain that Sennheiser does make quality products and that I believe the other people rating this product were happy. It is possible that my particular set was defective and so my advice to you is NOT to buy online just in case you find that a return is in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality sound... for me and everyone else in the $#&!ing room!","review":"These headphones provide good quality sound. But Sennheiser's open-ear technology defeats the purpose of headphones. Yeah, the sound may be good, but everyone around you can hear what you're listening to. Forget about taking these on a plane, unless you want to anger the fat alcoholic next to you who just wants to get some shuteye.Also, the main plug is the big kind. It has an attachment for regular plugs like i-pods, or your computer, etc., but it's not very long. I found that it didn't fit well in my computer or my sound system and as a result, I often received sound out of only one ear.I guess if you like good sound, but can't have the music thumping for the neighbors to wake-up to, then this is a good product. But don't expect your girlfriend to be happy with you when she's trying to watch \\"Animal Cops\\" or \\"Say Yes to the Dress\\" or whateverthe%&#@ever when you are rocking out to the Star Wars soundtrack in the same room."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to annoy everyone around you!","review":"First off, these are comfortable headphones with great sound quality. BUT the open air design of the cans turns you into an unwitting boom box for everyone around you. People within 5 to 10 feet will hear everything you hear in an quite annoying way. If you're going to use these alone in a room or studio, then great. If you plan to use these at work or an airplane DO NOT BUY! Don't be that annoying idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I normally would buy, but I am glad I did.","review":"Great item, not something that I normally would buy or spend the money on but when they were on sale I had to give them a try.

I have had my HD555 for about 5 (yes *five*) years now and they still produce unbelievable sound quality. I've taken them with me on travels, handled them roughly, dropped them had the volume very loud... everything! And still they show now audible sign of deterioration.I remember comparing this product to others when I bought them and felt this one gives the best value. Buy more expensive and you get extra sound quality that you can barely distinguish with average ears. Buy cheaper and you are stuck with bad quality or bad durability.Can't put it any other way, Im just in love with these things!ps. Nearly forgot: they are also comfortable (can have them on for hours and not feel them). Though I imagine you wouldnt want to go running with them.."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW what a difference","review":"Pro's: Incredible sound in games and music on my PC. Very comfortable and I love the large area surroundingthe entire ear. I can still hear people talking, so the outside sound is not 100% shut-off. Huge difference from my old Senn 180 headset. Wearing glassess with this headset doesn't hurt or pinch one bit. Did I mention the incredible sound quality?Cons: The velour padding tends to be a little squeaky with my glasses, but I mostly wear contacts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep","review":"I have had these for about a week now and I have put about all my music to the test on these, and what an experience that has been. I have a wide taste in music so it took a while to test. I listened to funk, rock, metal, grind, rap, hip hop, drum and bass, drill, jam band, and classical. I found that everything sounded great. I was highly impressed by the bump these headphones produce while listening to TRS-80, Outkast, and Ludacris. plus listening to fast loud music like Decapitated , Between the Buried and Me, Cannibal Corpse or Dragonforce came out clean and distinct. I could easily hear each instrument completely. These headphones are able to handle extremely fat synth like in Pharell stuff or Aphex Twin. They also sound really good for watching movies. I have also used them while playing gears of war, and that sounded great. I used them while working in Reason and they performed well too. These are definitely worth the money. I would suggest them to anyone with any musical taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but....","review":"Other reviewers summed this up well, but I do have to say one thing:Be careful with the cable, mine has a kink in it and it is very difficult to keep it playing music correctly into both ears. Not a good pair of headphones to wear on a plane the open ear design will anger your neighbors.Other than that, these are great for audiophiles and people who listen to their music in FLAC format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headphones for Home.","review":"Headphones are very comfortable and bring out fine details in the Music.

Put on your favorite album and be amazed at all the subtle notes you couldn't hear before.The Form:These headphones fit your head quite perfectly, and are very comfortable. You can wear them for hours and they won't feel it.4/5 StarsThe ONLY reason why I gave it 4/5 is because I did not like how they felt when you kept them around your neck. When you have them around your neck, the actual ear part pushes just perfectly into your neck so that you can actually feel some pressure. You can pull them longer so they don't constrict a bit, but then you have to readjust them every time.Get em. Enjoy em.

Good construction quality, good sound, good cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"HD-555","review":"I am really pleased with this item. It is very good value for money. I cannot give five stars due to the fact that the really top end frequencies are somewhat distorted. This reflects the middle price range that the 555 falls into. The set is very comfortable, even after long duration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I like these phones, the sound quality is very good and they have held up well. The problem is with the cord. It comes from the factory tightly coiled, and no matter what I try I can't get the coil out. Several times a day you wil have to unplug the cord and unwind the the twisted coil. It seems to do it on its own. It had a memory that tells it to twist up and become a 2-3 foot cord instead of 10-12 feet.I would not but it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like the HD-555's at all...","review":"I bought these after seeing the rave reviews here. Upon trying them I noticed immediately that the highs are lacking, and the mid-bass seems very exaggerated. Did some googling for more reviews, and found frequency response plots showing frequencies above ~8KHz are severely attenuated, like in the neighborhood of -10db to -20db, confirming what I hear. Even Sennheiser's optimistic frequency response spec uses -10db. Bah.Incidentally, I'm driving the 'phones with a real amplifier, not an MP3 player.On the good side, they do play LOUD. They just aren't accurate.It's costing me 25% restocking fee plus shipping to return them, but that's better than being stuck with headphones I can't use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Amazing, the only word that can truly describe these headphones...Extremely comfortable, an unreal clarity, and great bass...everything you could want in a pair of headphones...at least ones less than $300...I've only had these for a very short time and I like to crank my music so we'll see how tough they are in the long run but I'd say worth the money either way...and for 95 bucks (or even the msrp of $170) the price is definately right...on another note the velour is a great touch, really adds to the comfort and it comes in some VERY nice packaging...5 stars all the way"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Sound!","review":"To be honest, I really did not need these headphones because I own 2 sets of Sony Studio Headphones purchased over 12 years ago. I am so glad I did get these because the sound quality is so much more than expected. The reviews I have read were correct. These are so much better that the $220 Sony's I have. The FULL Sound is great, the seperation is fantastic, and the fit is very comfortable. I highly recomment these to all.

I received excellent customer service from amazon. The bass is decent and sound is crystal clear. After getting this set of headphones I could no longer listen to mp3s anymore - because I need to listen to lossless musics so that the potential of these headphones can be fully explored and experienced.The only thing that isnt very perfect is that it is not closed-designed. The sound tends to leak out of the cups, which makes the sound not very \\"shocking\\" compared to that of the closed-designed HD280 I have. Overall ,the sound quality is great, definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"sennheiser hd55","review":"very good product at this price point. i use the hd55 with my computer for movies and music. very satisfied with the quality of the audio experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD555, Very Good","review":"I use them with games and music ( go figure )They are just overall really goodOne important detail is that the gray part attached to the black part( the headband ) started forming a spider crack that was growing. It happened shortly after getting them, so not much abuse had been put on them. Ducktape ( as stupid as that sounds ) blends just fine with the gray and was an effective solutionOther thing is search *hd555 sound mod* in google, there's an odd little piece of sound absorbing foam inside the headphone on the grill of it... peels right off, i'm not sure what the heck that is about, some suggest an intentional retardation of the sound to encourage higher modelsI recommend them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD-555 audiophile headphones","review":"After much research I decided on a pair of these headphones. All I can say is WOW!!!!! Great for music and movies. Crisp highs and just as good on the lows as well. Very light weight, after a while with them on you'll forget there on your head.

He mentioned this is a GREAT head phone for classical music and Jazz. I agree 100%.I was listening to some songs from a Blue Mitchell (jazz trumpeter) record (Lossless MP3 files) and I can't imagine a louder bass response. It would ruin the song completely.I was also trying some old soul music tunes, like Otis Redding and even some Stevie Wonder. Any stronger bass response would make Stevie sound like Dr. Dre.I also tested it with my turntable. No extra bass was necessary.This is a great product just the way it was designed and, if you don't care for (or don't need) mind blowing bass, I don't recommend doing the \\"mod\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD555 a Winner","review":"The HD555 work for my needs, have a very large head 8 3/8 hat size, a BIG head. can where the head phones for hours an do, the sound is GREAT, am a HAM radio operator and the voice recantations is wonderful, music is wonderful,have some hearing loss am 72 an these baby's work for all my hearing needs and then some *****............walter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic stuff","review":"I am pretty satisfied with the positioning ability of this headphones, very good quality when used to listen classic music and watch movies.

It seems to be rather natural and transparent, so you if you're looking for this 'oomp' bass you probably won't find it here. However if you're into clear, 'studio' sound this is the way to go. Lows are low enough and clear, high are crisp but not to bright so for me it's what I like.In terms of design & built quality they seems to be constructed very well, design is modern and they look very professional. They are very comfortable thanks to plush padding. Cable is very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding for classical music","review":"These headphones are just the best possible choice for a reasonable price. (Given that you're listening to classical music: I have not tested them with other kinds of music). They are especially good for old mono recordings on CD. For example, I have tested them with Furtwängler's wartime Beethoven mono recordings (Music & Arts), and the result is just amazing: spacious presence, dynamics, clarity...! They sound actually better in these headphones than via ordinary loudspeakers. But of course, these headphones sound also excellent with state of the art recordings, such as Bychov's recording of Mahler's third symphony (Avie).Furthermore, they are very comfortable.So I recommend these headphones to all classical music listeners - not only those who care about their family and neighbours. You get maximum value for your money here. But if you need portable headphones, I recommend Koss Porta Pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracking","review":"Sennheiser headphones seem to crack / fall apart after 1-2 years of usedecent sound though, would be worth buying if they weren't made out of cheap plastic garbage"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for their price.","review":"if you dont know what open-backed headphones are...then dont buy these...or look them up. These are good for their price. I find that they are lacking a little bit on the bass end but are suitable for gaming, watching movies on a laptop, and for casual music listening. If you plan on taking these out in public then you should keep the Vol super low since they are open-back and not closed back everyone will be able to hear you music. I originally bought these for mixing music at night time since i live in an apt and cant use my studio monitors after 9pm without getting neighbors complaining. They are definitely not for mixing...i found that i would over compensate for the lack of bass and the mixes just sounded all over the place.

I have Sony receivers powering 500 watt MTX 15inch deep towers with 13inch Boston Accoutics, and I would have to blow the roof off the house to hear the detail in sound that I hear with these phones. The sound is the best there is, its simply incredible.

After a week they sounded distorted like the speakers were blown out. I only listened to these on a small Ipod and small MP3 players.

I sent them back and after 33 days I still have not recieved replacements.

I got a hissing vibration sound in my left ear only in gamers DVD and other movies. It was not the loud clicking sound that means you have the bass up to high. The vibration sound was intermittent and I felt like something was loose. The only option was to get a refund from Amazon. I took the option to have UPS pick them up and I paid nothing.

I was able to get them for under $100 (which is amazing, considering I've found them for upwards of $170 in certain places), and when you consider what a fantastic pair of cans you get for that money, it's the bargain of the century!I have these headphones plugged into a Headroom Total Airhead headphone amp and, without a doubt, these headphones do sound better being driven by a dedicated headphone amplifier. However, I get fantastic sound straight from my iPod (50 ohms equals portable player friendly). Although not as clear or warm as the exquisite HD650's, the 555's more than make up for it with a sparkling high and a great bass response.A note for people who are looking for isolation...these are open-backed headphones; meaning there is no isolation whatsoever (sound goes straight through).

They are great if you are doing something stationary like sitting at a computer. However, the cable is much too long to be practical for on the go, and the headphone jack connector is humungous. It comes with a converter to be able to hook into an mp3 player (such as an iPhone), but this was still not that practical as it made the headphone jack connector stand about 4 inches above my iPhone with little room for the end of the cable to bend. The amount of tension caused over time by the non-bending hook-up bent the inside of my iPhone.

When I, or a seatmate, tried to get to the aisle, they inevitably hit the plug, and it ultimatley became bent and inoperable.Hopefully, Sennheiser will replace the plug for me.

So, I let him buy some skull candy head phones that he really likes. And I use these. They are comfortable (thus the 2 star rating).

Personally, the sound was much more \\"true\\" than can be heard in any other brand such as Bose, Beats, Sony, or Shure. I felt as if I were in a studio listening to the music. Very great experience.Please understand that these open, dynamic headphones allow you to enjoy the music and also everyone else around you. I actually got complaints that everyone else could hear my music clearly. It didn't matter how loud I had the music, the sound resonated to those around me.A con to me was the stereo jack and the headphone adapter. I hated that I had to have an adapter just to plug the headphones into my computer or mp3 device. The stereo jack should not have been the primary jack, but the adapter.Since I personally did not care for everyone else listening to my music and the annoying stereo jack, I have decided to switch to the Sennheiser HD448 Closed headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good condition","review":"I have been using this over 10 months.

Artists like MC Frontalot, Cake, Great Big Sea, etc always seem to have the better music as it comes from the heart and don't seem to be in it just to make the bucks.So if you're wanting something different, refreshing, and alot of fun to listen to, check out his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a really interesting book for anyone who is fascinated by language.

But hey, there are plenty of movies that I love that she can't watch.This movie at least has the guts to show these guys as they really are: sometimes impressive, often embarrassing, quasi-heroic and to various degrees completely screwed up. This film embodies what I like most about documentaries: the characters who, playing themselves, manage to out-caricature the most flagrant Hollywood stereotypes. (Special bonus points to Marlon who's still managing to piss off critics in this forum and elsewhere -- and I'm sure enjoying it thoroughly.)Finally, because it was made by people who are actually part of the Scrabble world (co-director Eric Chaikin is a tournament-level player himself), it doesn't condescend.

Sorry, that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"enlightening","review":"This is a good film about an obsession shared by many, appreciated by few. I agree with previous reviewer that Marlon's foul-mouthed, pot-smoking, rude behavior was the downfall of the movie, hence the low rating. Low rating because the producers probably knew of his proclivities beforehand and chose him over a dozen others, thinking he would add color and interest. What he added was disgust and limited appeal. I eventually ended up muting his parts.Overall, however, this is a well done movie with nice graphics and filming.

Who wouldn't want to vicariously share in travels all over the globe and learn about faraway places? Yeah, there's the occasional factual or syntax error in the first printing that escaped the book's editor. But show me ANY other work as technically or artistically ambitious as this, that appeals to such a wide-ranging technical and non-technical audience, that doesn't have a shortcoming or two.

The author has not flown a Starship around the world (possibly not flown one at all), he has not visited all the places he writes about, and the events which take place never happened. As a work of pure fiction this would be ok if it were also well written and researched enough to be believable, but it is not. As a book which masquerades as a genuine travelogue and account of the actual details involved in flying a Starship around the world, the fact that it's mostly fabricated and full of inaccuracies undermines the very premise. It doesn't work as a piece of fiction, and it doesn't work as a travelogue. I persevered until I reached page 196, where the author describes a visit to the Potala Palace in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Once you create your first database, however, you will need other books, as Ramalho's does lack detail. DO NOT expect one book to be enough to learn SQL from. The best companions I've found are Sam's \\"Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes\\" for fast access to instructions on specific tasks, and QUE's \\"Special Edition Using SQL Server 7.0\\" for looking up details. CAUTION: if you are relying only on books to create your first SQL 7.0 database, I strongly encourage you to read Using's Chapter 6 on Tables and Datatypes.

It is difficult to describe. You won't find any \\"singles\\" on this program, but you may well find the music staying with you. It creates an ambiance, or mood, but it's not mood music. It's not a 'concept' album, at least I couldn't find any message. It has Native American blood running through it, but it's not a 'message' disc, either. The music takes you somewhere. You almost have to listen to it, and listen to all of it, to know whether it's for you. The pieces are different from each other, but again, there is that mood, that blood, that common thread that you feel throughout. The sum of it is much greater than the individual parts. Perhaps the best recommendation I can give you is to look at the list of performers who wanted to be involved in this, and trust their judgment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for those who only like mainstream pop.","review":"This is a brilliant album that I bought when it was first released.

I highly recommend it for someone who is tired of listening to the same recycled commercial stuff that is forced upon the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Whole World Is Coming?","review":"This album is a collection of well known musicians including Jon Anderson (Yes) who sings on two tracks. Unfortunately, one of the songs has two parts and Michael Bolton \\"sings\\" part two, which is not indexed for your CD player to skip. Jim Morrison's voice is featured, reading poems similar to his \\"An American Prayer\\" (great album!). If you like native American chanting and drumming between tracks of songs and poems sung and read by different performers, you might like this. It is a sincere and respectful tribute to the native Americans. The last words on the album are read by Martin Sheen... \\"the whole world is coming\\". I doubt it, and certainly not listening to this. For Anderson completests, you get about 12 minutes of his voice, thus the two star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh....","review":"I bought this for the Simon LeBon tune and Jim Morrison poetry. It's okay. I've listened to it a couple of times, but I doubt it sees many (if any) more trips to the CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"low rate","review":"this is absolutely different from the picture shownlooks like gipsy style shoesi did't like these shoes at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing & Beyond Useless","review":"Received the shoes which looked spectacular. Have been buying Bostonians for 30 years without issues. These shoes were comfortable and looked great for approximately 3 or 4 hours. Wore them at work, not outside and not in the rain. In the short time I wore them the nice shine had given way to a peeling surface on both shoes. Underneath was a flat greyish matt finish. I never wore them a second day. I don't know if these were fake Bostonians or the real thing with a major production malfunction. What I don't like about the Amazon process \\"and I love Amazon\\" you don't get any direct feedback when you return the item so you pretty much have to err on the side of caution and assume that the shoes are all the same and that you just didn't get a defective pair. Such a petty because the price is right but then again maybe this is why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality shoe","review":"The shoes were very poor quality - the exterior finish began to flake off after about 2 hours of wear. I'm not sure the product was even real leather as it was supposed to be. I do not recommend buying this shoe. I've owned many pairs of Bostonian shoes over the last 15 years, but the pair I purchased here was not the same. I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good but uncomfortable","review":"bought this because of the good review and looks. had it now for about 2 weeks and I find them uncomfortable to wear. I walk more than 2 km each day in these shoes, but it press painfully on top of my big toe. I tried wearing thicker socks and putting band-aids on top of the big toes but the result is the same. i cannot recommend these shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true - AVOID!","review":"These shoes are terrible. I read the reviews and took the risk anyway because the price was so good - too good to be true. My foot fits in fine, but my big toe (as another reviewer claimed) gets pinched even after a week of wear to break it in! Also, the \\"leather\\" start rubbing off within 10 hours of wear (1 day!) Other reviewers have claimed this as well! The shoe does truly look great out of the box, but a shoe that starts to get destroyed and is painful is not worth your money. Pay extra and get a shoe that is more comfortable and won't be ruined within a week.I bought a slightly more expensive Rockport and they are more comfortable and the leather does not just rub off! Do not buy this shoe.Bostonian is no longer a trustworthy shoe company. I urge you to look towards competitors like Johnston & Murphy and Rockport. Do not make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoes fell apart after the first use","review":"I was extremely disappointed after receiving my Bostonians. I wore them once and the \\"leather\\" began to peel away. Typically Bostonian are known for their quality and I've owned a pair before however these were really cheap. I wouldn't waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money.","review":"I've worn these shoes 6 times since I've bought them and right now they look like I've worn them daily for a year. They're uncomfortable and have an absurd crease where my toes bend. I don't have to wear dress shoes often for work, but when I do I'm on my feet all day and these simply cant handle that. I'm doing nothing strenuous with them, just walking around. Avoid these shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"The material seems too shiny, almost like a patent leather shoe. Not to mention the shoes are ridiculously uncomfortable�?I walked maybe a mile in them and had horrible blisters. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lather sole , Hard flat heels","review":"These shoes have thin lather (~3/8 inch) sole. You can also zoom in the image and see the threads to bind the sole with its top. Once the lather teared off ~1/16 inch, these threads will tear off too.Another drawback I found is its heel are too hard, just like a wood, they sounds when you steps on the floor (some people may like it). Heal have flat bottom, it should be little curved from the rear end. Being a flat and hard heel they will make you walk like a girl atleast for 2-3 days until they are curved by themselves.Good part is these have excellent shinning top and they looks very good.Above review is written after 3 week experience. Will update the review after about 6 months if I found them on my shoe rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product","review":"While I liked the shoes, a problem occurred which greatly diminished my enthusiasm for the shoes. It appears that the eyelets are punched too close to the edge of the flap and after a couple of months they ripped through. I bought 2 pair of these shoes and this occurred on both pair. I've never have had this happen before to me.What else can I say but that I wouldn't buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"I am now on my second pair of this particular shoe and I would have to say that I am just as pleased with the second pair as I was with the first. I have to admit that the price is what I find the most appealing. These shoes are very hard to distinguish from its more expensive peers and I believe that few individuals would be able to tell the difference. My only complaints are that they do not hold a polish quite as well as I would like and the sole wore out a little quicker than I had expected. These problems can be cured, however, with frequent polishing and a trip to the cobbler to have a rubber sole glued on for a minimal fee. Even without the addition of the rubber sole, my first pair lasted for about six months with daily use. These shoes are perfect for those on a budget, and will certainly get the job done in style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sole durability problems","review":"I wear these to work (office job) and immediately the black paint (ink) started wearing off on the soles, exposing the light colored tan underneath...looks terrible.
