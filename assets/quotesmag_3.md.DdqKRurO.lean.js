Read the story - it moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to write this review!!!","review":"I just finished the book and I enjoyed the story so much that I'm writing this review. The people in the story came to life for me. I liked how harris built the plot page by page. If you're looking for a new author - try this one. I'll be starting No Second Chance this evening. Both books have the same charaters and I can't wait to learn more about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I received the three books by Raina as a gift. I'm always looking for new authors. I started with Smoldering and enjoyed the characters and story. I especailly liked that I could follow the story without having to back track through the detail to make sure I understood where the author was going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This is the second Harris book I read. I liked her style and characters enough to buy another book. She has an easy and readable style. She doesn't add stuff to fill the pages. Her police investigators are full of energy and personality. She doesn't rely on the gross to get her story told, she provides great dialogue and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!!!","review":"I liked the fast pace. It kept me reading well into the night on several occasions. I select authors who write about the same characters in all their books. I feel that I get to know them. Harris created several life like people in her stories.I also like how Harris mixes romance in with a great police investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruby will bring you a new enlightenment","review":"It was a joy to read and once I started I couldn't put it down. I was amazed as to how fast I was grabbing for the next page. No matter what stage the character Sadie was in her adventure the reader is always wondering what will come next. I laughed and cried with her.Mary Summer Rain has again produced a story that will entertain, enlighten and uplift many readers from all stages of age and interests. She was able to impart many of her lessons of spirituality that she has written about over the years in a way that entertains the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great mystery","review":"There is so much packed into this book and it is so exciting to read. Written as a story, there are these characters with their confusion, pain and suffering. At the same time a great mystery is unfolding and Mary Summer Rain has us look at the nature of mystery itself and how we limit ourselves by trying to confine mystery to neat tidy boxes of understanding meant to keep us safe. It seems like there are metaphors in the characters; the critical judge, the silenced child, the searcher thrown into a journey. There is an openness to many forms of spiritual guidance and a revealing of the female aspect of God who brings healing to all of her children. For anyone suffering from grief, loss and guilt over a loved ones death, Mary Summer Rain helps you to see how the heart can open again to the beauty of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read and introduction to Iceland","review":"Indridason's Erlendur Sveinsson crime stories stand up well with those of the old story line of the world weary detective, lampooned by his colleagues and let down by his relationships, investigating the deeds of villains in a challenging landscape. His portrayal of Iceland as a backdrop is a strength, both in terms of plot and in displaying, very much warts and all, the country, its history and its people.Jar City is Indridason's usual quick and enjoyable read, replete with low life porn junkies, reactive middleclass hypocrites and indifferent officials. He plumbs the depths of human depredation but never gets crude, and revels in his protagonist's intuition and gritty dedication. Research for the 'Jar City' eponymous plot is reasonably sound and the characters are diverse and interesting. And the Icelandic climate gets the reader hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging crime thriller","review":"This is an excellent book that is hard to put down. If you like crime thrillers along the lines of Stieg Larsson, you may also enjoy Jar City (though there is no equivalent to Salander in this novel). It was also interesting to learn a little about Icelandic culture- since one of the underlying themes is directly associated with some unique characteristics of this island nation. I liked the book enough to purchase the next one in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Indridason's writing is on the level of a high school student. His characters are more overwrought than your typical soap opera. The plot has no mystery, thrill, or pathos. This is mediocrity at its finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a thriller","review":"I usually enjoy mysteries that take place in other countries, especially if they are written by natives. This fit both criteria, but I just never got interested in the story or perhaps more importantly, the characters. The author seems to have totted up the usual list of tough cop attributes, but they do not form a cohesive character."},{"rating":"2","title":"competent yet something less than awesome...","review":"I read 'Jar City' right after reading the author's 'Silence of the Grave', which is actually in reverse chronological order (..but it really doesn't matter). Although I really enjoyed the multi-layered mystery of 'Silence of the Grave' I found 'Jar City' to be a far more conventional murder mystery, and therefore somewhat less enjoyable. Yet certainly 'Jar City', a story of rape, murder, and forensic investigation, stands well on its own thanks to excellent writing. I don't think the author can write a bad book.Bottom line: certainly the second Icelandic murder mystery you should read after 'Silence of the Grave'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your run-of-the-mill whodunnit","review":"I've really come to enjoy books by foreign authors set in foreign landscapes because I feel like I learn something every single time I read one. In this case, I had no idea that in Iceland, they don't use surnames like we do. See, that's something you just don't learn on TV. Nor did I know that Iceland has a genetic database of its entire population, which is something that would certainly never fly in the U.S. Anyhoo, this wasn't your run-of-the-mill whodunnit. There is a murder that Erlendur and his partner Sigurdur Óli are trying to solve, but the story ends up being much more about the victim and what he did in his past. This is one case where the victim perhaps got what he deserved. Erlendur is somewhat of a drab character on his own, but I enjoy his interactions with others, especially with his wayward daughter, Eva Lind. I think there's a lot of room for growth in the series, and I look forward to reading the next two."},{"rating":"2","title":"jar city","review":"he writes good storys. his main character is a little depressing, but other than that, he is a good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jar City","review":"Read two books by this author...neither set my heart aflutter...the writing seemed uninspired and Idid not care about any of the characters. Live and learn. I thought I would try another Swedishauthor after loving Stieg Larsson...my advice is keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iceland Cometh","review":"I enjoyed this book well enough to order another of the author's works. It was well-written and suspenseful. I like reading about different places and this was a good introduction to Iceland. I'm reading his next book, Silence of the Grave, now and enjoying it as well. The characters are interesting, enough to love or hate. The plot final outcomes aren't transparent and so the impetus is there to continue reading until you have the answers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak plot.","review":"Based on previous reviews, I expected more. Accordingly,I was disappointed. The plot seemed weak and the writing style was awkward. Way too much padding for an ending that was easy to predict. I kept hoping there would be more. I doubt that I'll be reading this author again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jar City","review":"I put aside everything else until I had finished reading this book. The writer takes you on a journey into an unknown world."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the minority","review":"I love good detective stories and relish the brilliantly written and engaging Wallander, Stieg Larsson series, etc., but I found Jar City nothing but grim characters in unremittingly bleak and gratuitously gross situations, forced, prose-like dialogue (translation?), almost a parody of a Scandinavian thriller. After the rape and exhumation scene halfway through, I felt I had had more than enough and bid Jar City a happy goodbye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Maybe because it takes place in a country I know little about, but I enjoyed Jar City quite a bit. Finding out what the title Jar City referred to was interestingly rewarding. The characters were well drawn and the plot compelling. I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reykjavík setting makes for an interesting, worthwhile tale","review":"I'm by no means an expert of the police procedurals genre, but Arnaldur Indridason's 'Jar City' caught my eye. It did not disappoint. It's a crisply told tale that I found enjoyable, fascinating and well-plotted from start to finish. What was especially intriguing for this US-based reader was the Reykjavík setting. Imagine an investigation in a country where there are only 300,000 people. As the Publishers' Weekly review aptly states, you have a land where \\"(e)veryone is related to everyone else...and refer to one another by first name, even formally.\\" You feel that proximity and closeness. And, indeed, that inter-relationship ends up figuring very heavily - and quite plausibly - in the plot and its denouement. Highly recommended. You can pair this one with another Icelandic-themed book I recently completed: \\"Bobby Fisher's War,\\" a great blow-by-blow account of the epic Fisher-Spassky match in Reykjavík."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rain drenched thriller . . .","review":"Care was taken in the plotting of this rain drenched masterpiece. While organic in development, the story is full of twists and turns, insights into life's longings, fears, and hopes. You really feel Iceland: walking the dark, damp streets, feeling the spray of the sea, talking to the citizens . . . all of whom are related by blood or Viking bond. I was moved too at the personal side of the detective and his drugged-out daughter as they help one another in their search for redemption, a search we all share--no matter where we dwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"English translation is tough to follow, characters are shallow","review":"A pretty dark mystery novel. The darkness is the environment and characters. An unhappy divorced detective who has a junky daughter who is also a prostitute. A retired detective that is a misogynist. Neighbors and people of interest that seem shallow and thin. The story, mystery was not very interesting to me. I think some of my dissatisfaction is related to the translation. The book may have been translated into English, it was a far cry from American, and even if you are British I believe the nuance lost in translation causes Jar City to be a chore to read. I assume that it is a book that was a page turner for some, as the Amazon reviews are very positive. I expected something more like the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, Jar City is not it, at all. Both my wife and myself love the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo books. For me Jar City is not a book I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to the author and his characters","review":"A ripping yarn, I was immediately moved to buy more of the Reykjavik Mysteries, great characters, and lots of interesting insights into Icelandic society, of which I previously knew nought. Recommend it for lovers of Scandi Noire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iceland Noir","review":"A complete pleasure. Count me a fan. Complex enough to be intersting and to keep me guessing. The daughter gets on my nerves - wouldn't mind if she gets killed off down the road take the x-wife too - getting rid of them would just add to the Noir quality of Erlindur's character. Loved the setting - Iceland completely new to me! I am a fan of mysteries set outside the USA.

I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price!","review":"Pro's: It's a functional heater, if a bit pricey. Not too big. Has digital temperature display (ambient and setting).Con's: 1) It's an oscillating heater, which I didn't need and which is not in the description (at least to my eyes, in the product features). 2) Anti-tip over switch is far too sensitive- tip it a few degrees to see the temp display while it's on the floor, and it shuts down. At first I thought it was defective. 3) Lowest heat setting is 900W (vs 1500W Max); 750 or so would have been better. 4) Most annoying, no memory of last settings. Every time I turn it on, set to low(er) heat level, then rotate temp dial several turns to get the keep-warm temp from the 75 degrees default.New: Seems to change temperature setting spontaneously. Set to 62 deg, after a while it's at 60 deg. Not terrible in my case, but if a unit kept moving the temp up, could be a safety problem.

It has truly been a lifesaver. It is small and conveniently fits in an area next to my desk, but also delivers a powerful amount of heat. The oscillator and thermostat work fine. My only criticism, which is a small one, is that there are only two heat settings. Overall, it is a very good heater for small spaces and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Electric Heater","review":"Love this heater.

I have several Honeywell models which are ceramic. I also have the Honeywell model 709 oil-filled heater.This model, the 370 ceramic heater, is the best so far. The thermostat works the way it should. The older models that Honeywell makes like the 339, and 341 work well, but the thermostat doesn't work the way it should.This new model, the 370, works absolutely awesome.Don't buy the oil filled model. I did some detailed testing with thermometers and timers. The ceramic model heats the room twice as well as the oil filled.I use all my heaters every day for about 6 months per year. Take my word for it, this model is great.The plastic will smell for a few weeks though. That seems unavoidable with any model unfortunately. Just run it in the basement or garage for 15 minutes per day for a few weeks and the smell is gone.Buy this model and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS","review":"We used it for several months this winter without any problems. It worked great! Then this morning we walked into our 11month old son's room at the heater was up to 98degrees!

I'm on the phone right now with customer support to see what they have to say about this.--> Basically they want me to send it back to them (at my expense) and they will send me a newer model (at their expense).

However, this is not for begginers, since advanced theory and harmony is required for full understanding.

Best songs on the album are Amazed, Smile, What About Now, and the accoustic version of Everything's Changed.

I found some of it just slightly repetitive because it seems every 20-50 years the corset and it's makers would try to reinvent itself, but it would be exactly the same (minor adjustments) and everyone had the exact same concerns. So, it began to read like --totally made up dates-- in 1820, they made this adjustment to the corset. Society said \\"this\\", doctors said \\"this\\" women who wore them said \\"this\\". Then in 1850, they made this adjustment to the corset. Society said \\"this\\", doctors said \\"this\\" women who wore them said \\"this\\". Except people were saying the same things...I recommend this as a library check out read (I did this). I suppose it could be a coffee table book if you bought it, but I don't keep such things.

He uses a lot of non-standard products like mouthwash and beer. In this book he explains a little bit more about why they work which I really liked.

I read her other book, Start & Run Your Own Record Label and got just as much out of this one. They have different info - she didn't rehash much so you have to read both.

To those without enough intelligence to treat it as very nasty humor, it could be considered hate speech and inspire those mentally unbalanced people on the left to commit acts of violence. Carville would be funnier if he was non-partisan like Mark Russell. He does have a tendency to be just plain hateful. The 'facts' which Carville puts together are actually more circumstantial and speculative than those of Starr - who is declaring war against."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzz.....more political mudslinging","review":"No question he is a witty guy, but I am sooooo tired of the spinning and personal attacks.

However, thinking the same hysterics wouldn't apply to his writting, I expected a somewhat calmer, balanced, and, shall I say, saner treatment of the subject than can be found in this book. When it came down to it I just didn't believe him.

It is so informative and provides a balance which is ever so justifiable given the light of Starr's actions throughout the whole ordeal. Carville's skillful investigative points along with his brilliant sense of humor provides us with an excellent reading. I recommend this book for all citizens who care about the fate of our President and the unjust process in which Starr has performed his duty as a not so Independent Counsel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rapier wit strikes again.","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I feel that Ken Starr has turned this entire investigation into a witch hunt surrounded by a media circus. I am wondering why he hasn't been indicted on charges of illegal wiretapping, obstruction of justice, defamation of character, witness tampering, violation of First Amendment Rights, etc. What happened to the backbone of Congress that they are being led down the garden path by a Republican syncophant? Mr. Carville's book was a great read. He is insightful, concise and manages to hit the nail on the head while maintaining just the right attitude of outrage.

Guns N' Roses has quite a history-but this reflects the evolution and changing face of rock, doesn't it? The great and unforgettable music, the hard teamwork, the infighting between group members, mistakes with drugs, it's all here. I heard G N' R on the radio before and decided to try them out a bit further when I bought this CD. I'm glad I did! They rock! The first four songs on the album are from their past albums and demonstrate their ability to do hard rock (\\"Welcome to the Jungle\\") as well as meaningful ballads within the style of rock (\\"Sweet Child of Mine,\\" \\"Patience\\"). The band then throws in some great versions of McCartney's \\"Live and Let Die,\\" Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\\" and The Rolling Stones' \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\" I would highly recommend this album, especially for newcomers who want to see all that this band was.

Guns n Roses has so many great and essential songs that a greatest hits album would have to be at least to discs worth of music. Even then it wouldn't cover all of their essential tracks. Guns n Roses only came out with three albums of origional material and i wouldn't count on Chinese Democracy. Axl may still controll the name but GnR isnt GnR without Slash Duff and Izzy. My suggestion would be to buy a copy of Appetite For Destruction. You will leave that in your sterio for at least 2 months, i'll gaurentee it.

Finally if you want to complete the collection, get Spagetthi Incident and the Live Era-double.This is a much better thing to do, because GNR actually didn't have a single bad song on the four \\"real\\" albums. Every single one was a masterpiece on it's own, and this way you will get them all, instead of only a few.This \\"Greatest hits\\" isn't actally \\"the greatest\\", either, because it leaves out one of the most intellectual rock-anthems ever written: \\"Estranged\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SERIOUSLY SUCKS!","review":"First of all its just songs that you can get on thier other albums like Appetite for Destruction.

It does include some classic stuff though, like \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Patience\\", \\"November Rain\\", and of course \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\". \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"You Could be Mine\\" are pretty good too. I could have done without 5 covers, but at least they're not bad. I wish there was room for \\"Rocket Queen\\" and \\"Used To Love Her\\", but I guess those weren't really popular.

I agree that a greatest hits, with no new tracks is unecessary, however at least the tracks are remastered. For the reviewer I dont agree that fans should save their money for Chinese Democracy because I think the greatest hits will be a better buy and have more depth to it. Between Axl's \\"My World\\", \\"Oh My god\\", and wrecthed live performances I feel he has disgraced the name of the greatest rock band of all time and his album will be simply mediocre considering the amount of time it has taken to create. It seems slightly insecure on his behalf to hide behind the legacy of a name rather than disgrace his own name by putting it on his product.

This is a really solid watch with simple no frills functions. The velcro wristband is a huge plus for me due to it's great water resistance and is better suited to take on the damaging effects of saltwater and chlorine, as well as it's great ability to be thoroughly rinsed after use. When it came down to decision making on the purchase, I just couldn't pass up the years of trust and reputation that the G-shock brand has earned, specially when comparing to other brands that have way less years of performance under their belt, yet where 2-4 times as expensive.

The buttons are hard to push down at times to get a response. I have to shack the watch at time to get the light to come on automaticly.

It ran ok the first few times but was hard to start. I thought it was a little sluggish for a 33cc motor. I fell a few trees, small oaks and a decent sized hickory and couldn't keep the chain on or sharp. I replaced the bar and chain (with OEM) but still had problems. The following spring, after a tornado blew through and leveled some trees in our neighborhood, I couldn't get it to start at all. Sprayed some carb cleaner and starting fluid in it and got it to start but it died after a few seconds. I took it to the local shop to have them look at it and the bolts were sheared off in the head with no way of getting them out. I scrapped the saw and bought a used Craftsman, using the Homelite for spare parts. The next \\"new saw\\" I buy will NOT be another Homelite."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Big Leakers","review":"The Homelite chainsaw is not a good buy! If you want to have chain oil leaking like a dyke all over everything...I complained about the first one and Amazon was nice enough to send a 2nd.(Amazon does not have a return policy for chainsaws of this nature) The 2nd also leak worst.

With Run DMC And Aerosmith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rap pioneers' best!","review":"This is the most essential rap album of all time. This is the one that every old-school rap fan should have. All songs are great, with Run and D turning out their legendary razor-sharp lyrics and catchy beats. The classic 'Walk This Way'(w/Aerosmith), 'Peter Piper' with rhymes as fast and sharp as an f-16 jet. 'It's Tricky' and 'My Adidas' were the other songs to get heavy radio play. Run and D pull off a stunning beat-box on 'Hit It Run'. My fav song on the album is the title track, 'Raising Hell'. That song is just absolutely fantastic, the mix of rock and rap make listening the ultimate experience on that song. In my opinion, this is THE best rap album of all-time. Some have come close, but none can measure up to \\"Raising Hell\\". This album was the trend setter, fusing rap and rock in a dazzling array of 12 songs. Run, D, and Jam Master Jay are the true pioneers of rap, and this is a must have for all rap fans. If you don't have it, get it. ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the most influential rap CD of all time.","review":"\\"Raising Hell\\" is definately the best album from Run-D.M.C. and arguably one of the greatest rap albums ever produced.

Please get more copies---I want one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5 star classic!!!!!","review":"This CD started a new wave of rap music and musical beats. Peter Piper is most definitely the best beat of all time at the point in which this came out. And with all the recycling of music I'm surprised it have not been used again. This is a very well rounded CD which can still be played today. From rock (WALK THIS WAY) to yesterday beat box (HIT IT RUN). Even socially conscience, self awareness cuts like Proud To Be Black. My Addidas is the first rap endorsing hip hop's beloved shoes the shell toes. I recommend this for those young kids who don't know what true hip hop was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?","review":"This album really set it off in a major way back in the era of 1986-87. Everybody who's currently a fan of Bad Boy and No Limit needs to check out this album for some true school originality. Now that Dee, Run, and Jay have been signed by Arista Records, they have a new album due out this year- Their back catalog was also picked up by Arista- and it's bound to be re-released!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest rap album ever","review":"This is by far one of their best albums. Back in 1986 when it came out, the rap scene was being molded by people like L.L. Cool J, Beastie Boys, Doug E. Fresh, and the Duo known as RUN DMC. RUN DMC was cutting edge with riffs of rock and roll intertwined with raw beats and mean scratching. It began the days of catchy hooks with bells and screaming guitars masterly overlaid with hard core rhymes. Shell toe adidas, three stripe jogging suits, and cardboard boxes cut out for breakdancing mats were the premiss behind the sounds coming from large ghetto blasters, with the voices of Jam Master Jay, Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels and Joe \\"Run\\" Simmons ringing out over the tight fresh beats. True pioneers to what hip hop has become today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another mind blower...","review":"And another huge step beyond their previous album.

Poet, singer, musician extrodinaire, Christian, outlaw, murderer and drug addict. Ok, so not all of those stereotypes are true...Johnny Cash truly was a \\"Singer Of Songs.\\" This box set presents some of Cash's best work all bundled up in a package that's beautifully crafted and very well presented. The first four discs of this new set show Cash's eclectic nature with track featuring an array of guests from Joe Strummer to Fiona Apple. \\"Redemption Songs\\", the track with Strummer might be the most energized recording Cash has made since the 1950's. Neil Young covers, country standards, even a reworking on his 1970's classic \\"Flesh and Blood\\" all stand up to make this album an absolute ESSENTIAL to anyone's collection.

In 1985 the Crue were poised to release the follow-up to the metal classic \\"Shout\\". Instead of a great album fans got a great single, the MTV ballad \\"Home Sweet Home\\".Much of this album is tiresome.

I honestly don't know how this disc was ever really noticed. The songs are simplistic, the musicianship is thoroughly non-impressive and the production sounds poppy and dated even then. Out of the now 15 songs on this disc, only three are tolerable leaving 80% of the songs as pure filler. I find it nearly impossible to believe that this disc ever won a following when other bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest were releasing metal epics. Theatre of Pain was a profound disappointment. This cd, for me, really spelled the end for metal as it was known. If this cd was my first exposure to the Crue, then I'm sure that I would never have followed them. It's painful to listen to even now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"Theatre of Pain.*Motley Crue's venture into the mid 1980s. Gone for all intents and purposes is the heavy brash sound which populated SATD and TFFL. You get Motley Glam. Its a sad joke compared to the two prior releases.There are people who love this album. I am not one of them. The music loses the edge, power and feracity of earlier output.For all intents and purposes the Motley Crue of legend disappeared sometime between 1984 and 1985. Replaced by a drugged out band resorting to cliched MTV ballads, lame lyrics and the occasional cheesy cover. From here they never recover the greatness they flashed in the early years.Thinking about buying this? Don't. Shout at the Devil or Too Fast for Love are THE albums to buy. After this fughetabout unless you like cheesy cliche 1980s rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theatre of Pain","review":"1985's Theatre of Pain was the first big hit for Motley Crue. It had two hit singles with a cover of the Brownsville Station's Smoking in the Boys Room and Home Sweet Home. Those are both fine songs, but both can be found on the various greatest hits albums the Crue has, other than those two tracks I would say City Boy Blues is good,other than that this album has nothing to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Underrated Release","review":"Although far from perfect this album gets way too much guff from both members of the band and a certain percentage of the fans as well. First off, the cover art is awesome and Mick had a Kramer guitar with the cover art on it during this tour which was cool. You can see it in the video for Home Sweet Home. There are some really great songs on this album but I will admit, it could have been better. Stand out tracks are Louder Than Hell, Tonight(We Need A Lover), Use It Or Lose It, City Boy Blues, Keep Your Eye On The Money and of course, Home Sweet Home and their excellent cover of Brownsville Station's Smoking In The Boys Room. My biggest beef with this release is the production. I'm not sure who was more deaf, the band or Tom Werman.In reality it's probably about a 3 or 4 star album but I have to give it a 5 just because a lot of fans trash talk it, as does Nikki Sixx. I think they tend to listen more with their eyes on this album than their ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the weakest of the five classics.","review":"I recently re-purchased all the early Crue albums on disc since I originally had them on cassettes that went the way of my mullet shortly after the late eighties. Listening to this one again made me remember why it was the last one I bought over again. It's a given that the sappy-but-somehow-acceptable-for-tough-guys-to-get-into \\"Home Sweet Home\\" is one of their catchiest tunes, but beyond that, lots of what's on this album sounds in retrospect like they were just trying to squeeze out material to keep out of debt with the drug dealers back in the day. Too Fast for Love, Shout at the Devil, Girls Girls Girls, and Dr. Feelgood are albums that each had distinctive and ever-fresh sounds to them. I wouldn't say the same for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motley Whoo Hoo!","review":"Was glad to find this Motley Crue CD on Amazon and couldn't wait to get it.

(the video really made it for me, tho. when i hear the song i immediately think of those early days of mtv...) and of course, Raise Your Hands to Rock and City Boy Blue are smoking with vibe. they always give their all - absolute balls to the wall.now there is the obligatory power ballad, Home Sweet Home, but at least they do it well. the 12 string acoustic intro is just beautiful... and, yknow, this is afterall one of the seminal 80's pop/metal albums - how could it not have a power ballad... the extra track of Home Sweet Home is an instrumental demo version, its pretty cool. really lets the guitars shine.this album is just a great mix of punk, rock, power metal, and pop - the definition of the bad boys' version of glam."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound You Come to Expect","review":"I have always been impressed by Crue's sound -- someone on this review list alread mentioned their recognizability after the first few seconds -- and this album represents everything that I have come to expect from the band's sound. Kind of metallic, kind of sloppy, but expertly mixed: that's how I describe the music, and Smokin' is the best example on this album.

It has some humor in it and some really basic knowledge (dress in clothes that fit you, exercise, eat well, etc.), but when it comes down to the basic approach of meeting women, it's incredibly vague. They call your pitch to a girl a \\"rap,\\" and they divide the rap into three categories: beginning, middle, and end. The beginning is where you introduce yourself, the middle is where you build rapport and interest, and the end is where you close the deal with her number. These three sections are the most important parts of meeting women, yet they glaze over them in about 5 pages of text. Also this book recommends buying women drinks: this is a no-no, unless she buys you one and you buy her one. Supplicating a woman will not help your game.In short, this book can be summed up in about a page of bulleted points.

Also it was some what inapropriate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...snore...zzz....","review":"This book was sooooooo boring. I kept reading it only in the misguided hope that it would get more interesting. It has an unlikeable and annoying main character. The writing style is overly simple, and literally NOTHING happens. The reason that she and her mother \\"fall out\\" is never explained. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The text of this book it poetic and somewhat hard to read. I am reading this novel in a World Literature class. Jamacia Kincaid is great, yet the poetic form seems to be confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regreted Reading","review":"I had to read this book for 9th grade summer reading. It was the one book that everyone in the Freshman class agrees was horrible. It was pointless and boring. I enjoy a book that reaches you in the heart and Annie John comes no where close. With a little class discussion, we were able to find some meaning to the book but mostly reasons as to why we didn't enjoy reading. Nevertheless, this book has been taken off of the curriculum for summer reading at my school for 9th graders. Wish they would have done it a year ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Ninth Grade Required Reading Tripe","review":"I really can't recommend this book. I have *never* been so annoyed with the slow pace, lack of plot, unmeaningful imagery, and symbols that makes William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" look good. I think those that shared the experience of being forced to read this book from my highschool will all look back at this in fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved reading this book","review":"I wanted to read some of Kincaid's fiction, and i most say Annie John was great. I love the humor in her books, and how the characthers seem to come alive. Annie John is about the relationship between her and her mother. It makes one think of there own relationship with there mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I truly hated Annie John, the writing was too bland and I hope the book was not an autobiography like some say since Annie was pretty screwed up. For instance, Annie loves to go to funerals of people she does not know just to stare at the dead people. She also wants to tap the hump of a dead hunchback girl. Also, 90% of the book is just Annie griping about how much she hates her mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite books","review":"I'm in the process of reading all Jamaica Kincaid's books. This one is wonderful.The story itself is interesting and evocative. Below the surface are all the universal truths about mother-daughter relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"The roller-coaster called adolescence","review":"I wish that Kincaid would have wrote the entire life of Ms. Annie John for us. This is the first book of Jamaica Kincaid's that I read---I love her simple, refreshing style. The emotions of Annie John are very real feeling---her ever-changing relationship with her mother. The feeling that you are being abandoned, just because you are growing. Things you felt that you were only experiencing, but they were happening to other children too. A clear look at being young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age in the Caribbean","review":"What a wonderful tale Annie John is! I read this book my Freshman year in college--it was a required reading for an introductory anthropoligical course on the Caribbean. I was so delighted to find out that Amazon included this novella on their list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Symbolism and substance in Annie John","review":"I am teaching the novel to my advanced high school ESL classes. It's not an \\"easy\\" book, but the students are making a lot of sense out of it. With little in the way of real plot, the book is still about ideas that adolescents struggle with on a daily basis. I find the symbolism so compelling. The \\"much-hated\\" breadfruit (foul-tasting maternal nourishment) and the trunk Annie asks her father to build for her to replace the one her mother owns. The book is fabulous and filled with all sorts of little revelations that no adolescent can be a stranger to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annie John - A Review From a Student at a Catholic School","review":"Annie John was one of my summer reading books at my catholic high school. The other two were Anne Frank and House on Mango Street. I found this book to have a very interesting setting. Most of the character's live's almost totally revolve around superstition. The main character Annie, seems to be superstitous about her mother's hands which us readers learn at the begining of the book. Annie deals with her own immoral problems, and tries to \\"figure herself out\\" Most of it was interesting, and I liked the stories Annie described with her mother. Because of all of the immoral things the writer places in the book, I can't really recommend this it, but if your interested in Antigua it is quite informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annie John deep but where is the point?","review":"Please excuse me for saying this ,but as a young person ,who is currently studying this novel, it bothers me that i cannot find out, through my study what in reality is annie's real problem. Sure we know she's got a huge problem with her mom and that is the core of annie's later issues, but how is it in this sense that a child so young be so troubled and distaught. So many things in and about this novel bother me, that my class mates and i can't seem to work out its relevance, importance and its point."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book in the history of boring books.","review":"Jamaica Kincaid's piece of garbage Annie John is by far the most boring book that I have ever read in my entire life. Kincaid's writing would make for an interesting read, if she were to actually have the characters do things in this novel instead of whine and moan. Here is a summary of everything that happens in this novel: Annie John whines for 150 pages and then the book ends. Annie, the protagonist, is probably the most whiniest character I have ever had the displeasure of reading about. Books like this make me wonder if being literate is actually a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annie John, one of my school reading books","review":"Annie John was one of the worst and most twisted books I've ever read in my life.

Then I started listening to the clips. Something was not guite right. So I did a search and found the actual orgianl greatest hits ablum availabel for $9.99. And as memory served they sounded different. This is apparently a remakes of the original songs.For the price it was worth getting this but had I taken the time to compare and not trusted the comments and images I would have likely passed this by for the real original greatest hits.If you want a good representation of Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels I would recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on Rockin'","review":"Having been a rocker in the 60's, I played many of Mitch's songs.

The \\"body fat\\" part seems a bit of gimmick - I just wanted accurate scales. Unfortunately, we did not keep the receipt - bought it a drug store. It stopped working; we bought new batteries for $8 (the little disk kind) and it still would not work. It died after three months. To get warranty service (ten years!) you will need the receipt and send the scale by mail to Connecticut along with $5.00 more..... Not worth it. Will avoid Conair products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accuracy Should Come before Price","review":"Wanting to better track my health, I reviewed all of the scales on amazon and then purchased this model, which offered as many features as the more expensive models, but at half the price. Aware of the \\"cheapie\\" history of the brand, I had my doubts about the quality of the product, however, and I now regret my purchase. This scale is highly inaccurate and unreliable. The other night, I weighed myself five times in a row, receiving different measurements each time, including a total range of five pounds difference and 2% body fat difference, both of which are significant to anyone serious about losing weight and lowering body fat. I now realize that accuracy should be the primary consideration when purchasing a scale. I will probably give this scale away, and purchase one of the more expensive, better reviewed models here on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent readings, Body Fat reading does not always work","review":"Weight Watcher Scale By Conair WW31 Digital Body Fat and Body Water ScaleThis scale is pretty good if you just want to read your weight.

It's easy to use, no doubt, but every time I step on the scale, I get a different reading. One time it will say 150 lbs, then one minute later, it will drop down to 135 lbs.Now I don't trust it. For me, it was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The scales","review":"My old scales fluctuated daily by 2-3 lbs. I was never sure if it was a weight loss or gain for me or just the scales. This scale is solid as a rock. The fluctuation I see now are me not the scale. I use the body fat and water component also. It was very easy to set up.

(My punny friend said that if I was hydrated enough, it would read \\"water\\" instead of \\"err\\" (air). LOL!) Anyway, I bought this scale for those features, ESPECIALLY the hydration feature, so this scale is mostly useless to me. It's also a pain to have to turn it on before stepping on as well. Most other scales I've owned have turned on upon feeling my weight.The manual says nothing about how to correct an ERR message, outside of saying that it will ERR if my weight exceeds the scale's capacity. Um, excuse me?

It's the warmest and most powerful wrist heater I've found. The controls allow continuous adjustment of the heat from room temperature to marshmallow-toasting, and the heat is very consistent across the entire pad.My only minor nit is that it's quite bulky. At about 1.5\\" thick, the wrist rest tends to overshadow my svelte, sculpted Logitech keyboard. I can still type with the wrist rest in place, but it does take a bit of reorientation to get used to the size.I also noticed that the bit AC transformer gets quite warm, even when the wrist rest is turned off. To save electricity, it's probably wise to unplug the unit when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seasoning's better then the food","review":"2 1/2Apparently the worst of this band's brief classic rock haze, the dated material, often impressive in only technical aspects of minor increments where the majority of the non balls up rockers are concerned, stagnates with a lack of direction in songwriting aided by misguided vocals. Still, if appreciated in small sections, with regards to date of release, there are often enough impressive fills, licks, whatnot to gaze at while the overall song may be going nowhere, or in a generically rock-a-blue's (albeit with a nice bite) way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and painful !","review":"I don't see how people can rate this toy highly. Half the time the pieces just fall apart from each other spontaneously, the other times you need to fight with them to get them apart. AND THEN YOU GET CUT! I got cut and note the \\"Jennifer\\" in her five-star August 12 '03 review of the 100 piece said that she, her son, and her neighbor have all been cut. Also note that Hattie said in her four-star April '07 review of the 200 piece set that, \\"You really need some supporting blocks under your structure\\".

It's really works well with Lego Duplo blocks for building the base structure. The ramps, turns, drops are really fun to design.

He explains everything in a very concise, simple, and easy way to understand. His teaching technique is more effective to beginning MFC programmers of all levels because he explains and shows the transition from core C++ to MFC. You will see a gradual change from core C++ to MFC. Furthermore, he does not go into too much detail of the vase GUI tools that MFC and Win32 API offers. I believe new MFC programmers without Win32 API experience sometimes find the GUI tools overwhelming. This book is a bridge from core C++ to beginning MFC.I highly recommend Introduction to Programmng MFC with Visual C++.Kuphryn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out","review":"Unfortunately Intro to MFC Prog with Visual C++ by R Jones is written for a previous version of Visual C++.

Thumbs up, 10 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most important of three you need.","review":"This is an excellent book. It is an introduction, but that doesn't mean it gives little information - it leaves out lots of things you don't need, but there's plenty here. It doesn't leave out important details, and when you need to know something, it isn't hidden. I said \\"three books\\". You also need the Prosise book, and maybe(but probably not) one of those crash course books(21 days, 15 minutes, whatever), but this book helped me a lot. It is well written, and follows a good path at a steady pace. The only thing I wish for is that the answers to the problems were included or available on the CD or web. This is not a book on C or C++, but if you have only a little experience programming you won't be stumped. It's also not version-specific. If you use version 1.52 through version 6 of VC++ you'll be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"After going through several MFC books, I found this one.

Knowledge of c++ is assumed.Overall an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right book to start with MFC programming","review":"I have found this introductory book very useful to start with Windows desktop applications development. Although it is quite outdated and uses Visual Studio 98 as build environment, it guides you through the basics of the MFC framework (main classes, dialogs, graphics, document/view architecture) and Win32 programming in general (messaging, maps, data types), leaving room for personal development in the exercises after each chapter, and providing in-depth coverage of advanced topics like bitmap manipulation and database access for the advanced reader. With an additional introductory chapter on COM it would have been perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Decent for MFC Beginner","review":"If you know C++ and want to learn MFC fundamentals, this books is for you.

Otherwise, I would've given a 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for MFC introduction...","review":"I bought this book to find out how to use MFC in Visual Studio. I already know C++, so I only needed to have a guide for MFC. This book starts with creating a MFC program from scratch. Then it goes into using Visual Studio's project creator.

The material on this extraordinary find of an \\"INDY\\" album is both new and fresh yet somehow very warm and familiar. Freddy's diverse style slides on like a comfortable pair of old Levis. He moves from rich R&B through chunky bluesrock/country/folk in \\"RIDE THE WAVE\\" a very tasty acoustic guitar/slide guitar/mandolin thing, to the more up oriented Carribean bluesrock tune \\"YOU WERE THERE\\".

This is perhaps the first role that does full justice to Kiron Kher's talent. She's simply phenomenal. In the title role, Smriti Mishra does a very good job. Rajeshwari Sachdev too standouts especially in the final sequences. Newcomer Rajina Raj Bisaria adds a freshness with a sincere performance. Rajit Kapoor, Salim Ghouse and Amrish Puri lend sufficient support.The songs are very simplistic, created with beautiful lyrics and minimal use of instruments.

The story of the teenaged Maria Theresa who upon ascending the thrown is greedily attacked by Prussia, Bavaria and France is a great story. With no credible allies, Maria Theresa was able to rally her people to defend her empire.Reed Browning is good writer and has the organizational ability to help the reader keep track of the myriad of diplomatic and military details.

Somewhat unusually, there were no hit songs on the album, since none of the songs were released as singles. Which doesn't imply a lack of quality in the songs, because most of them are quite good. Buck himself sings eight original songs. Guitarist Don Rich and bassist Doyle Holly sing one song each. And there are two instrumentals; one being a fiddle instrumental and the other being a steel guitar instrumental.

As a firefighter, I really enjoy the perspective that Chief Salka is giving as I work towards a company officer position. The only part I don't like is that there are so many links to the business world, most do not apply for me but it seems like good advice for business people. However, from the fire service perspective, there are several lessons to be learned from this book. I plan to read this several more times throughout my career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This filter worked great. Cleared up my pond in 5 days. Crystal clear.

The damage was going to cost $150 so I opted for a new unit. This one was a step down from the Oasis unit I had, but Oasis is no longer sold in the US. The problems I had with the Fish Mate were that the unit requires dissasembly for a weekly cleaning while better units only require the turn of a knob to back flush. Also, the 500 in the 500 P-UV means it works for a 500 gallon pond, but only a 350 gal/hour pump. The 1000 P-UV will go to a 650 gal/hour. That was not mentioned in the description. So its going back and I'm looking for a larger unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi Cult Classics","review":"This Roger Corman package is quite a bargain. My favorite movies of the three were \\"War of the Satellites\\" and \\"Not of This Earth\\".

After years of bootlegged fifth-generation prints, we finally have what look like brand-new anamorphic copies. And the films are delightful (I'm essentially referring to crab monsters & not of this earth), perfect representations of low-budget fifties sci-fi. (Crab Monsters was the highest grossing low-budget production of 1957) Now all we need are similar editions of THE UNDEAD & IT CONQUERED THE WORLD. (I have to admit to relishing my old AMC full-screen edition of THE UNDEAD, as it gives full justice to statuesque Alision Hayes, but quality will out, and I'd rather see an ultra-clean, ultra-sharp anamorphic copy like these two) I haven't watched War of the Satellites, and it's a 4:3 transfer.

I got the impression the director hired the local children nearby so the scene was amateurish.In the original story, HP Lovecraft describes the painting the artist drew in detail, yes the people's reaction in the movie conveyed the idea that what he had painted was horrifying but you never got to see the painting.

With the change of key personnel, the new band has created music that maintains its edge. It has some damned good riffs and breakdowns that move a pit into action.

First - limited jacks and lack of tuner, but you knew that.Second issue: when the tv is off, superbright blue light comes on. If you use this in the bedroom it can be very annoying at night.

Unfortunately, the remote control is defective. It will turn the volume down, but not up, and won't turn the television on or off. I contacted Olevia to request warranty service using their website, but two weeks later have received no response. I called the number listed on the website, but was disconnected after being placed on hold for about 10 minutes. The television itself is really more of a monitor. It didn't have enough connectors for me to connect both a cable box and a DVD player. I had to buy a device that would allow me two switch between the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great TV for the Price","review":"I like the fact that you can save money with not having a tuner that you do not need. The Monitor is light and was easy to hook up. The picture, even not in high definition is great.

It worked great for about a week now the picture scrolls up and down consistently. All of the inputs starting doing this besides the composite connection. Now it does it also. Even the logo jumps when you first turn the tv on. The volume is another problem. When watching DirecTv, the lowest volume setting is still sometimes too loud and there are no adjustments.

I had the umbrella for only six months, and one of the rivets came apart on one of the metal supports. Now it is useless because one side of the umbrella droops down. And no, it was not from the wind. It broke when I opened the umbrella; there was no wind and absolutely no rust on the metal support structure. I found out that a co-worker's Samsonite umbrella also broke recently although she had her umbrella longer than mine. I have a small umbrella that I use most of the time, so I only used the Samsonite umbrella a few times during the six-month period. My order was fulfilled by Amazon. I checked the return policy and it is only good for thirty days and the item has to be in original condition, so it cannot be returned at this point.

There was an unexpected gust of reversing wind that turned this inside-out. Unfortunately that seemed to do it in. One of the cheap aluminum veins in the frame broke completely in two. That was surprising, considering this replaced the cheap $10 umbrella I've had for years, which has reversed countless times but held up (I wish I hadn't lost that one, or I'd still be using it...).Not sure where I go at this point.. time to look at the cheap $10 umbrellas or shell out even more $$$ for a supposedly higher quality umbrella?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong against the wind","review":"This umbrella is a disappointment. The video shows it not turning inside out in a wind tunnel. I don't know how they did that because mine regularly turns inside out in any strong wind.

However, today when it did, the wind bent the handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ideal umbrella","review":"I love this umbrella so much I've worn it into the ground over the last 2 years and am now ordering another one. We live in NYC, so when it rains- you're really dealing with it since you're walking everywhere. This umbrella is the perfect compromise when it comes to size.

No problems closing. On closer inspection I notice the stem part feels kinda flimsy. So I'm standing in line waiting for this place to open up in the rain with my new umbrella, when all of a sudden a gale of wind rain comes blowing, and it flips this umbrella inside out. I was so pissed. The wind was not that strong. In fact the other people in line who had regular umbrellas had no problem. The problem is with the wind release on top of the umbrella. The wind release skirt is on too tight, and unable to perform its wind release function. Another problem is that its too small, my sleeves and sides were getting wet. If your like me,average height and extra large, your gonna end up getting wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for sometime - no longer usable","review":"The product worked for sometime and suddenly I see some holes on the polyester and it is completely useless.

For a few months it worked very well. It even held up in some strong Chicago winds. It felt solid and kept me dry. But, unfortunately, today it just gave up the ghost. I've been super careful with it, but a big spring somehow popped out of the shaft and I couldn't get the umbrella to fold back.I'm a little disappointed. Evidently some people have had a great deal of success with this umbrella, but alas, not me. Perhaps there are occasional issues with quality control here and there.Worth noting too: it's pretty large when folded. It fit into my backpack, but just about, so those seeking a compact umbrella might need to look elsewhere. I did like its solidity though, just too bad it bit the bullet so soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works and most importantly is a aesthetically pleasing tuxedo black.","review":"Great umbrella that is a great color. Works just as an umbrella should and it's definitely tough stuff. Only reason for 4 Stars is because it could have been a bit cheaper, I found it at a Marshall's for half the price on Amazon.Oh and as a side note, it's not as 'compact' as those handheld ones that could fit in a backpack.

To be able to take a trip back in time when reading is one of the best things in this life. i highly suggest this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rarely has a book impacted me this much!","review":"Rarely have I read a novel that impacted me this much. A Voice in the Wind covers the time period when Jerusalem fell and the early church was persecuted. During this time, we meet Hadessah, a Jewish Christian, as she suffers the loss of her mother and sister to starvation, her father to martyrdom, and her brother to being murdered by Roman Soldiers. Hadessah is sold into slavery to a prominent Roman family. Hadessah struggles to conquer her fear and hold to her faith in a time of uncertainty and danger. Throughout the novel, I felt myself going through the journey with Hadessah. In many ways, she could have been me. By the time I was done with the book, I was overcome with grief for the suffering early Christians went through and a determination to live out my faith with the courage Haddesah had. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read only if you like exciting stories","review":"This book was extremely good. The characters were alive and vibrant. I received a good lesson about Rome and about Roman culture.

Thank you Ms. Rivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...","review":"This is actually the first review I've ever written. There was no way I could read this book and not share how wonderful it really was. This is the second book I've read by Francine Rivers (Redeeming Love being the first). I didn't think it could get much better. Well I was so wrong, the depth to all the different characters in this book are amazing. Rivers really has a gift for writing and faith that touches your heart. This book touched me from the very first chapter. This is an incredibaly emotional book and Hadassah's unfailing faith is a rock that we all pray we would be able to live up to. My heart was bleeding for her from the very beginning. I will recommend this series and author to anyone with that will listen! Thank you so much Francine Rivers for this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice In The Wind","review":"This was absolutely the BEST book that I have ever read. I have read this whole series 5 time over, I'm still not tired of it! Francine Rivers really puts this story of a slave girl in Rome, in a light that is realistic and understandable. You can feel the stuggles that Haddassah faces, not only read them. Its a book that can be really enjoyed by both genders. I stongly recomend this book to anyone. Man OR women. This book changed my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST HISTORY LESSON I HAVE EVER HAD!","review":"An excellent story set in the first century A.D. The first in a trilogy spanning the Roman Empire. It follows the story of a young jewish girl, left alone and taken into slavery after Jerusalem is left devastated by the Roman army. Several threads are running throughout the story and the characters are interwined as certain events take place. The author's research is superb and the historical facts throughout the story are very interesting. Certainly the best history lesson I have ever had. This is an excellent book. My first by Francine Rivers and one I would definitely recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me explain....","review":"THIS IS THE BEST SERIES... I BORROWED THIS SERIES FROM MY CHURCH LIBRARY AND CAN'T PUT THEM DOWN. I WANT YOU TO READ THEM IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN OR NOT!! A PERFECTLY WRITTEN BOOK THAT WILL KEEP YOU ON THE END OF YOUR SEAT...OR BED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"I absolutely love reading Christian fiction novels, and also love classic books, and this is by far the best book I have ever read. Francine Rivers took a unique idea that hasn't been covered in historical Christian fiction since books like The Robe and Quo Vadis. She made Hadassah come alive, she was so real. Her life is filled with tribulations, and yet you see her struggles. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I enjoyed this book by Ms. Rivers. The characters and the plot were interesting and developed. Her writing was clear and her characters were strong and real. I could not put the book down. I was transported to the first century Rome where life was not secure for a Christian. It made it clear that the first century Christian had to face many difficulties and faced death and destruction. Yet, God was there as a guide for those brave people who gave their live for Christ. It serves as an example of how Christians in other countries are living today. This is the fifth book that I have read by Ms. Rivers. In each book, I have not been disappointed in her writing or her characters. Her writings have made me think and feel what other people may be feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"all Francine Rivers books are good, but Mark of the Lion series is one of her BEST!!","review":"This is an absolutely remarkable book! The second in the series (echo in the darkness) is also quite amazing! I reccomend this for EVERY young woman and older woman alike. It will challenge your current committment to Christ and make you want to strive to have the kind of faith that the main character Hadassah has. Very encouraging.... better take a day off and have a box of tissues with you... because you'll be sitting and reading this straight through for 15 hours!The one downside: I felt like the first 100 pages in this book were a little slow-going (a lot of scene and character-set up). Its necessary to the story though, and pays off later; so buckle down and keep on reading through those first 100 pages, even if its hard.... you wont be able to put it down once you get into the story! The 2nd book (echo in the darkness) takes off much quicker because you are already engrossed in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice in the wind....A MUST READ","review":"This is a great book, amazing writing and ruch character. The writer does a great job of giving a detailed account of the times and the characters, you literally feel like you just took a trip. The suspense at the end of this one would make you you pick up the next series, so all I can say is make sure you have access to the full series cuz you would want to open them immediately you are done with the previous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for the first in a series","review":"Normally, I do not like the standard trilogy, where the ending of the first book keeps you hanging, but this book was well written and really gave a good view of life in Rome, so I give it four stars. I got to know the characters and began to sympathize with them. There were things about this book that really got me thinking. It starts out a little slow, but stick with it. It's worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I usually avoid Christian fiction because what I have read in the past never made me care about the characters or the plot for that matter. However, I also wanted to avoid the immoral content of modern, popular fiction, so I would read mostly 19th-century classics in order to find a balance between plot and morality. This is one of the only pieces of modern fiction that both mesmerized me and deepened my walk with Christ at the same time. Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BIblical, Historical, Romantic- very good!","review":"When i first started to read this book i just couldn't get into it, but i kept on reading and it started to pick up. It is a very good story that has a lot of different \\"colorful\\" characters. The ending is unexpected and leaves you hanging so i suggest having the next book, \\"An Echo in the Darkness\\" nearby and ready to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had looked forward to reading this series of books, but I was very disappointed. The first few chapters were boring and difficult to get into. I did not appreciate all the bloody, gory details of the killings in war and in the gladiator arena. There was much explicit sinful, sexual information that was way beyond my comfort zone. Not at all what I expected from this author. I want to see what happens in the rest of the series, but I will not be purchasing any more of them. I may browse through them if they show up at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I don't know what all the hype is for this book. I absolutely loved, loved, loved Redeeming Love, fabulous read. This book went know where fast, I kept waiting for the story to a start, but it never came. I felt like I was reading a boring high school history book.I stopped reading by the 6th chapter, what a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"Love, love, love this book. Read the series about 8 years ago and just came back to read it again. Francine Rivers speaks to my soul. This series taught me a lot about what it was like to be a first century Christian. The trials that everyday people went through. The persecution Christians suffered so that I could have the religious freedoms I take so very much for granted now. And how many similarities there are between modern America and ancient Rome. If you're looking to be spiritually renewed, check out this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark of the Lion Series","review":"This was one of the best series of books that I've ever read. Francine Rivers makes history come alive in her books. Her portrayal of history is very accurate. Francine Rivers has a talent to depict characters that face struggles in their walk with God that help encourage my faith and walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find books on tape!","review":"My friend at church loves books on tape, but they are very hard to find! She was really pleased with this one. I will continue to order more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, Godly book!","review":"Somebody bought me \\"A Voice in the Wind\\" when I was around eighteen or so and so I decided it needed to be read. I flipped to the first page and rolled my eyes. Historical books don't grab my attention. So I set it down. I felt terrible because somebody had purchased this book for me so I picked it up again and told myself I'd read it. As I dove into Francine Rivers world of \\"A voice in the Wind\\" I was captivated. After getting through the beginning (it's a little slow) I found myself entranced with the Roman day world. I've always been interested in Roman day mythology and this accurate account of it really held my interest. Coming from someone who loves YA fiction this was saying something! The gore and action of the gladiator scenes had me reading into the night. When I finally shut this book I had tears in my eyes and I said \\"I have to buy the next one!\\" Which I did! Love, love, love this series! I recommend them to everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This series is addictive!","review":"I think this series may be my favorite books by Francine. I also loved the sons and daughters of encouragement, great historical fiction. If you loved these, try Davis bunn the centurions wife it is a historical fiction series of three books...they also draw you into your bible! All of the above bring to life the time periods, Christ working, and faithful examples. They all give good clarity in painting pictures of how it all fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will haunt you for days","review":"The first time I read \\"Voice in the Wind\\" I cried my eyes out. I was in disbelief at the ending (I won't give it away!), and the heroine's faithfulness to God had a big impact on me. My mom and I read this book out loud together when I was a teenager. Such a special memory...The story is well-paced, with believable characters and a tight, well-written plot. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Inspirational Novel","review":"This book was a great read! Being a future educator, I am constantly looking for new books to integrate into my classroom library, and this one will definitely have a spot on my shelves.The novel seems to demonstrate the different struggles Christians go through and the ways in which they handle them. For example, Hadassah seems to represent the \\"perfect\\" Christian and accepts everything that is handed to her with a Christ-like serenity. She is a the kind of character who everyone strives to be and readers will definitely grow to love her and covet the love she has for God.My fondness for this book is too great to fit into a review, but ultimately, this was an exceptional read!I received a copy of A Voice In The Wind from Tyndale House Publishers through NetGalley for an honest review. All thoughts are mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I found it very hard to get into this book and find a value in reading it. I admit to only reading the first 100+ pages before putting it down and walking away. Why waste the time?The content of the first 100 pages was violent and quite grotesque which left me wondering where it could go from here. I saw little plot and little worth.I will admit the writing style of Francine Rivers was beautiful, but the content was definitely not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice in the Wind","review":"A wonderful read. I really enjoyed the book. It was, however, a little difficult for me to get into. So many seemingly unrelated characters were introduced at the beginning of the book and the plot jumped from one scene to another so quickly that it didn't hold my attention at first. If you can get past that, however, you will not be able to put the book down. The different plots begin to intertwine and you will feel like you know the characters personally! The other disappointment I had was the \\"ending\\" of the book - it didn't resolve any of the conflicts in the book. There is a second book, \\"An Echo in the Darkness\\" and I recommend having that one on hand before you finish \\"A Voice in the Wind\\". The book reaches a climax on the last page and leaves you hanging as to what happens next. I am awaiting the arrival of the next book and can't wait to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book!","review":"This book captured me from page one. I was completely unable to put this book down. I strongly encourage anyone looking for an emotionally captivating book to buy \\"A Voice in the Wind\\" by Francine Rivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windy Brendy","review":"The story starts out well, but soon jumps to new characters that you haven't established a desire to follow. It is also too violent! I couldn't finish it due to the violence and the poor storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Challenging","review":"This is Christian Historical Fiction which is at the same time an intriguing story that captures your imagination, and also challenging to the reader to consider how you would react in a similar situation. It is a very good read for even non-christians with vivid details of period life in the Roman Empire. The plot line is realistic, complex, and well paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"history and the human heart magnified and made real","review":"This Roman empire historical backdrop is the most detailed and intuitive I've seen in historical fiction. The clashes of every political and idealogical viewpoint are brought to light, while identifying the source of the conflict, the searchings of the heart and soul in each person. It is full of emotion, as the main character struggles with growing up, with relationships, and with spiritual battles within her own heart and in an anti-Christian culture and government. This is a great stand alone book, and beginning of the series. A little too focused on romance and sensuality for me, as that was all I could think about after reading it, but otherwise it was a very intriguing and thoroughly written book, with no strings left hanging out."},{"rating":"2","title":"History and Entertainment","review":"Oh, how much I learned from this series! The historical accuracy was amazing. Someone worked hard and researched thoroughly to complete this work. I found this book graphic and difficult to read at times, but the great story line kept pulling me back in. Now that I've completed it, the \\"rough\\" areas are now the very things I appreciate most about this compelling book.Great suspense. Great romance. Excellent history.You simply must read books 2 & 3 also.

Since I read my first book by Francine River (Redeeming Love) about half a year ago I have read all her books that I could get my hands on, and I have lent them to my friends. We all agree that this serie is her best. If you start to read this one make sure you have number two ready! I am looking forward to her next book that should be released in August."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meladrama anyone?","review":"This is a story that is mostly told rather than shown with a tendency to restate the obvious, making the effort amateurish at best. While the storyline showed promise, it never evolved into anything more than a book filled with a sense of preachiness that would have been more effective had it allowed us to experience the story through its characters. Instead, we get characters with the fan fiction definition of a Mary Sue and Gary Stu with an over-done narrative description."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I've heard from several Christian women that this was an \\"awesome book and so well written\\". I guess it is well written if you like romance novels. It was very repetitive-I can't count the times \\"he tipped her chin\\" or \\"his blood raced with fury\\". There was also a lot of \\"ick\\" factor when she described pagan sexual customs-which she did often enough to make me wonder. I was getting the feeling that this may not be the best thing for me to read. The central character was OK, but the rest were very flat and cliche. If you like to feel that you have really learned about another place and time and your time was well spent reading a book and you like to engage your brain, I suggest finding another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try for a first effort as a Christian, BUT...","review":"It is an epic and sweeping saga that would be awesome except that there is so much sexual innuendo and outright descriptions so liberally spread throughout this book that I had to throw it away halfway through the second book. She over describes things so much that it makes it hard to read, and you lose sight of the story at times. Combine those two and I think you get the idea.It is a valiant effort for the first book she wrote as a Christian, though. Without the sexual things on every other page - it would be an awesome set of books. But the problem is that she describes them so well that it puts a picture in your mind that is very close to porno."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time...","review":"This book is no more than a bad paper back romance novel (maybe slightly less graphic) with a few Bible verses slipped in. After reading the other reviews, I was very disappointed. Hadassah and her faith played only a minor role while Marcus', Julia's and Atretes' escapades dominated the novel. I did not feel edified or encouraged by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am ashamed that a person who calls themselves Christian wrote this book. It was unnecessarily violent, vulgar and worldly in its sexual content. I felt violated while reading it. The ending was disappointing. I will most likely never read another of Ms. River's Novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unconditional love","review":"A challenge for all Christians to serve with love and kindness to every person we encounter. Also, to love with the love of God, which can be difficult in a world that seeks for vengeance.

The books arrived quickly & in good condition. I'm glad I read the Voice in the Wind because I could understand more about the characters in the Echo in the Darkness. Of the 3 I enjoyed An Echo in the Darkness the best, but all are enjoyable reading & I hated to finish the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I read this series about 10 years ago, and I have told EVERYONE since that these are the best books I have ever read! Okay I'm not the best at book reviews (this is my first) but this series is so good, I want others to read it. My books have been passed around to so many of my friends with several of them deciding they needed to have their own copies! This series stays with you forever!

Each character touches a different aspect of humanity and how they turn or not turn toward Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"sensual and moving spiritual tale","review":"Francine Rivers is one of the best authors of Christian fiction, and this tale of romantic love and spiritual struggle in the face of deadly adversity is a real treat to read. This is the story of a believer named Hadassah in the violent, decadent ancient Rome of the first Christians, and her triumph over fear of persecution as she has the courage to stay faithful to God. Good love story here too. Moving scenes. Read it and pass it on.David Rehakauthor of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but graphic!","review":"From the moment I picked up the book, I was drawn in. This was a good story that was interesting and well researched. I felt that I was given a pretty good idea of what life in ancient Rome was like. Once I started the book, I wanted to know what happened to all the characters. I would have rated this book 5 stars except for one small thing. I sometimes found it too graphic for comfort. I like that Ms. Rivers portrayed the time period exactly as it was without whitewashing it, but I don't see this book being one I will read again and again. It is a well written book that definitely leaves an impression. To me, it was also disturbing. It is definitely worth reading but not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice in the Wind","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I love the whole Mark of the Lion series. However it took me a long time to get into the book, so don't quit...keep reading. It gets wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning to An Awesome Series!!","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end. It starts with a gripping, heart wrenching account of the destruction of Jeruselem and how the main character, Hadassah, survives the loss of her entire family to become a slave to a Roman family. We also learn of Atretes, a German warrior captured and sold as a gladiator. Rivers paints such a clear and realistic picture that I almost felt as if I were living with Hadassah and Atretes in Rome. The character and plot development in this book is a refreshing change from some of the more shallow work that I've read recently. I laughed out loud, got angry, afraid and even cried while reading this book. In the beginning, I was frustrated by Hadassah's meekness and quiet spirit, but by the end, I was convinced that I needed to be more like her. My faith was strengthened and it was an amazing read - literally one of the best I've ever read. I highly recommend this to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiators, Lions and a Fair Lady, Fascinating!","review":"What happened in Century 1?

And I hopped past them all to try Arthur's recipes at home. The book paid for itself in a month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable resource for your kitchen","review":"This book is wonderful! The book consists of recipes that use a wide variety of kitchen staples (with some exotics like capers thrown in). Each staple ingredient, such as \\"potatoes\\", \\"canned tomatoes\\", or \\"cheese\\" has its own section with some basic recipes you can make with ingredients you probably have in your pantry at any given time and without having to run to the grocery store. The sections are arranged in alphabetical order. I checked it out at the library and made several of the recipes and just loved the book; can't wait to get my own permanant copy! Especially helpful--there are a lot of pasta recipes throughout the book. Who doesn't have some pasta in their cabinet at any given time? You'd be amazed what you can make even when you think there's \\"nothing to eat\\" in the house!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Go-To Cookbook","review":"This is my go-to when the cupboard is bare. Over the years I've lent it out to various friends in tough economic times and I'm sure to use it more in 2009. I love that the recipes are alphabetical by ingredient. When you're staring at the fridge or pantry saying \\"I have X that needs eating\\" it is a great boon to be able to turn to that very ingredient and find simple straightforward recipes. The Smothered Cabbage and chocolate pudding recipes alone are worth the price of the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite cookbook.","review":"I've had this cook book for years. My copy is stained and sad looking, while my Julia Child still looks new after 25 years. I find favorite recipes here and it's true that you'll find something to cook with those random ingredients that you've pushed to the back of the cupboard.The chick-pea chili recipe is an all time favorite in my house.You won't go wrong with this book - and you'll discover the kinds of non perishable staples to keep on hand so that you can whip up something tasty, filling and comforting at a moment's notice without a quick supermarket run.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was looking for a cookbook that would help the new cook. The reviews I read sounded great, but this was not the book I was looking for. The recipes are ok such as they are, but I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I got this book because I wanted something I could use to cook with. What I got is some boring recipes. Also if I'm looking for something to eat at night (and having not gone shopping), I'm kinda screwed. A lot of the recipes have ingredients people won't have on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but dated.","review":"Arnold's coffee table size book is still one of the most comprehensive collections of information on and about gambling. First published in 1978 the book has become dated although it remains a great starting point for anyone who wants a general overview that would otherwise require reading a collection of books on different aspects of gambling.Some of the photgraphs and drawings used to illustrate the book are excellent and one wonders how Arnold managed to find them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to his voice?","review":"The reviewers before me here must be rabid Steve Walsh fans. I personally don't care for any of his solo work. The material on Shadowman is banal at best, the musicianship uninspired, and Walsh's voice sounds tired and as though he is singing through a cheesecloth. What did he do to his voice? None of his solo material holds a candle to Kerry Livgren's work solo, or as projects with A.D. and Proto-Kaw. I used to love to hear Walsh sing and have seen Kansas live three different occasions. He was magnificent. Arguably the best voice ever in rock! Sadly, this dog has had his day... I would recommend this only for avid Walsh fans..."},{"rating":"2","title":"STEVE WALSH IS \\"THE MAN\\"","review":"Shadowman has everything, superb production values, prodigious musicianship, captivating texture and most importantly infused with the passion of the greatest voice in Rock history. The first review said it so eloquently and I concur wholeheartedly.It is interesting how from song to song you are reminded of various eras of Steve's work from Kansas to Streets to Solo efforts. Don't hesitate....BUY THIS CD NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Walsh you have done it!","review":"I have got to believe that after being at the Pinnacle of rock with Kansas, Steve has asked himself, can I do it myself? This collection of songs should answer his question. I have been playing this over and over. Buy this CD. My only disappointment is that I will never hear these songs live. May Steve rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Talent Future Grammy Winner","review":"I had the joy of seeing and meeting Michael Tolcher in Concert last night (the 4th of July) and he was fabulous. His music is sing along friendly, music with a soul, that makes you want to be a better person and take time to smell the roses. It was the best live performance I've seen in years. And as an avid concert goer that is saying a lot. Loved him, loved his band. His guitarist is unequaled in talent and showmanship. He spent as much time as needed to meet his fans, in the rain, and seemed genuinely happy to meet everyone. His cd will catch you and keep you. On a bad day or a good day it will make you feel better or help you to move on. Trust me, I don't get on the bandwagon over a band or singer, but this guy is worth whatever you pay for his cd. I see grammys in Michael Tolcher's future!BobbieHolland, Michigan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic combination of funk & rock","review":"I saw Michael live in Seattle this week and he blew the place away. I don't think anyone expected him to be as great live as he was. The album is great and is just an intro into the experience. Its a fantastic mix of terrence trent d'arby and a little George Clinto with some dave mathews thrown in. Just a blast to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael is Amazing!!!","review":"I love this CD. Just saw Michael this weekend & he was amazing.

After the concert I took a picture with him and he was so cool about it! Then a few weeks ago I was watching ABC and I saw that he is going to be the theme song for a show! Then I heard his song on the show One Tree Hill. I was so excited! I really hope he gets all the success he deserves because he is really good! If you are thinking about buying this CD do it! You will be really happy with what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up-Beat Music with Positive Lyrics","review":"I saw this CD in a store and for some reason it just \\"spoke to me.\\" I bought it knowing nothing about the artist or the musical style, and it's one of the best muscial purchases I've made in a long, long time. The music is up-beat with positive lyrics, and Michael Tolcher is an exceptionally talented singer/songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooner or Later~ Michael Tolcher","review":"He's on tour with Gavin Degraw and Ingram Hill. That has to tell you something. I really like this album, its easy listening with rock mixed in there. He is very talented, and I deffinatly recomend this album to, anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM - impressed","review":"I recently saw Michael Tolcher perform live in Chicago, opening for Gavin DeGraw. This guy exhibited just as much charisma as the headliner; he's a keeper! He commented to the crowd that it took him 12 years to make this album. Well, I think it's safe to say that we won't have to wait that long for the next one! This is fresh, engaging music from a man with a real talent for songwriting. My personal faves are \\"Miracle\\", \\"Kiss & Tell\\", \\"Mission Responsible\\", and \\"Sooner or Later\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart adult pop, trying to do the right thing","review":"Michael Tolcher's debut CD gets better the more I listen to it. The CD is primarily adult top 40, and alongside potential pals like Will Hoge, Graham Colton, and John Mayer, what Michael offers that is different is kind of a search for virtues that other guitar singer/songwriter stars sometimes overlook.Take \\"Bad Habits,\\" for example, in which the protagonist is striving for life lessons and experiences to be a better person. \\"Mission Responsible\\" sounds to me like encouragement for a father to do right by his baby's mother and future family. \\"Sooner or Later\\" consists of good advice to a daughter who has a lot of questions but doesn't necessarily want the answers from her folks, but they love her and they'll give it anyway.I don't think this is Christian pop, but damn, if you're not feeling a bit uplifted either by the words or the sensible and effective guitar/percussive elements, I would be scared to meet your children someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa, you'll ask yourself, \\"who sings this?\\"","review":"Mr. Tolcher is one of those artists noone's heard of - yet - but when you hear his tunes you just got to know who it is that's singing such great stuff. Catchy, intelligent, toe-tapping tunes, (especially the stand out track \\"Sooner Or Later\\"), that demand attention. What a debut, many seasoned artists with mega contracts and years of experience and exposure would hope to release work this solid. Really, 4-and-a-half stars; will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"The album cover alone should clearly suggest that this album is not good. The whole peace sign is cute, but a little lame if you ask me.I saw Michael Tolcher live, and it was a good concert. The album however, is not. Most of the songs on this irritate me ten seconds in, and there's not a single track here that is truly enjoyable.Michael Tolcher has ripped off bands on this album, and has even admitted to it during his live performance. Half way through the song Miracle, he started singing the words to the Four Non Blondes song \\"What's Going On?\\" The chord progression is exactly the same, as is the melody.If you're looking to discover a real musical treat, steer clear of Tolcher. Check out Stephen Kellogg and The Sixers, Matt Nathanson, Ari Hest, etc. for similar artists who are actually talented.Oh yeah, and I'm not thirteen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolcher Rocks!","review":"If you haven't picked up this album yet then what are you waiting for? Michael is awesome, the songs are great. I bought this cd after seeing him perform at a Gavin DeGraw show. I had doubts that I would not like it so much, but I bought it anyway. He is awesome! I don't think he surpasses Gavin in any way, but he is right up there with him. I will be seeing him live again in a few weeks so all I have to say to anyone considering this cd is pull out the credit card and buy it!

Kudos to John Nettles and all of his wonderful work on the series. The ending was perfect and it was good to see all the characters we have cared about through the years gathered in one place. The only one really missing was Troy, but I guess that would've been too much to ask. Other than that I thought he went out on a good note and made the transition easy for the actor who is taking on a new role, but still the Barnaby name. I won't spoil the exact ending for anyone who hasn't seen it, but trust me to say that you won't be disappointed.

When the first one arrived, none of the disks would play at all -- the \\"ACORN\\" logo would appear after loading the DVD, but then nothing would work. Using the \\"next chapter\\" button or the \\"play\\" button didn't accomplish anything. Since all our other DVD's continued to work just fine, I arranged with Amazon to return this and to have another sent to us.The second arrived and also failed to play normally. My wife discovered that if she pressed the \\"next chapter\\" button while the \\"ACORN\\" logo was being displayed, she could get to the episode, although only after having to watch a long series of previews of other BBC shows.

Now, the minute she wakes up she wants to get in the walker. She loves chewing on and playing with the attached toys and she loves to zoom around the house smashing into furniture and walls and just laughing and having a ball.

None of these books came remotely close to helping me get 1% of the information presented as questions on the real test. Who ever made that test must have taken their information from the smallest corners of the earth they could find to make the questions. I still can't believe the vast difference between what seemed normal study material and what material was tested. Your company should go and take one of those tests and see how far out that test is compared to what you offer and get it in- line or you won't make much money or help people like myself to acheive a passing score using your books. Additionally, the study guide of which the college board offers is very vague. You could help all by re-doing your study material. By the way, I used the same books as mentioned above and tested high on the General Social Sciences Test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play, fiddle, play.","review":"This was the first album by Buck Owens, released in January, 1961. It mainly consisted of songs that had previously been released on singles. Which was not a bad thing, because there were five hit songs on the album. The biggest hits were the classics \\"Under Your Spell Again\\", \\"Above and Beyond\\" and \\"Excuse Me (I Think I've Got a Heartache)\\". Besides those songs, most of the other songs are also good. The CD adds two very good bonus tracks, which makes the album even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hee Haw","review":"Ok, \\"Hee-Haw\\" was one of the oddest shows in television history, with the worst one-liners this side of Benny Hill. But the music--and keep in mind this is coming from a one-time Rock purist--the music on \\"Hee-Haw\\" was just about the best ever seen on American television.The original hosts were Roy Clark--he of the syrupy slow songs and cheesey infomercial guitar course, but a consumate instrumentalist--and Buck Owens, who was a revolutionary country star before Dwight Yoakum or Wynona Judd were born.This album, which finds its way to the top of my play pile more often than I admit to my old Rocker friends, is supurb from beginning to end.It's a very good band, but the secret ingredient is the excellent guitarist, Don Rich, who combines melody and twang masterfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"This brought back a lot of memories","review":"I had listened to this album when I was a child, unfortunately, the album was destroyed some years back. I had looked at other sites trying to find it and finally found it on Amazon.com.

Crucial events of one of my favorite books are not found in the movie. With giant steps the director walks through the story, Alain Fournier's popular Le Grand Meaulnes. Camerawork is ok. Acting not bad. It's nice to see France in 1910. But director Verhaeghe should take the time to tell the story of Augustin Meaulnes, his strange adventure, mystery of the lost castle, the story of the gypsy and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for the 1967 version!","review":"I was happy when this showed up on my French TV channel, TV Cinq Monde.

I love Nancy Sinatra's music and I was really looking forward to this CD, but unfortunately although the CD appears to have been remastered, the songs are all \\"separated.\\" The music comes out through the left speaker and Nancy's voice comes out through the right speaker, so you only get to hear her in one ear if you are listening through headphones. The remastered songs on the compilation \\"The Essential Nancy Sinatra\\" do not have this problem. I compared the song \\"Bang, Bang\\" from \\"How Does That Grab You?\\" with the one on \\"The Essential Nancy Sinatra\\" and there is a noticable difference. The one on \\"Essential\\" sounds full, rich, and \\"centered.\\" The other one sounds much thinner and weaker in comparison. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the little it costs","review":"I ordered two of the Rubbermaid 3F23 storage chests. I am returning both. They are much too whimpy for what I intended.

Sorry, Rubbermaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not washable, just in case you're wondering!","review":"This is a fine storage box, a good size to hold a comforter up to a California King size. It's lasted well for the couple of years I've had it - until my cat decided to pee on it for no apparent reason... I wasn't sure if the reinforced sides were cardboard or plastic, so I decided to risk washing it, because the alternative was to throw it away. So just in case you're wondering, it's cardboard inside & I ended up throwing it away. But as long as your cat doesn't pee on it, it should last you nicely for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth for the price - look for better alternatives","review":"I bought this based on all the +ve reviews I saw in amazon. I got ordered this last week and received it yesterday, couple of days longer than the estimated delivery, but that's ok. What I felt about this product is - it is not worth the 24 dollars I paid for it. It can store stuff, yeah, but not like the kind of storage you would expect for the money spend. I wanted this to store my off season dresses, but I will need another three or more to actually store them all, and for $24 a piece they are not worth the bargain.I think I might return this back. I might just buy a proper plastic storage bin or something. For like $10, this might have been an ok deal, but CERTAINLY NOT for $24. I am disappointed, because this is one of my bad buys in Amazon - I am usually always satisfied with what I get from A because I do so much research. But anyways, here's hoping someone else doesn't also get his fingers burnt the way I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not as shown","review":"This storage \\"chest\\" hardly needs 3 handles since it's so small!

It's not a bad storage box for the price, but I prefer the plastic ones as they are sturdier, stack-able and easier to clean - this \\"chest\\" will not hold up to stacking unless the item on top is significantly light and, keep in mind that it's fabric so if you're keeping it in a basement or attic, it may be an issue.

Quite surprising how much you can actually pack inside one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a lot of stuff, and matches other accessories.","review":"This storage container holds a lot of my out-of-season clothes and is just the right size to fit on my Rubbermaid Configurations shelf. It is attractive and there are lots of other matching products to go along with the Rubbermaid closet system, my favorite being the 2-pak nesting bins. The cedar inserts, however, aren't what I expected--there are two, approximately 1\\" x 4\\" and about the thickness of an emory board. Not a big deal though and I do plan on ordering at least one more for storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but nothing to get excited about","review":"It's an adequate piece for basic storage, but not as protective as I expected. There is no moisture barrier, so this is strictly for dry areas. And the cedar inserts are teensy-weensy, too small, I think, to have any deterrent effect. I didn't smell any cedar aroma at all. The only upside is it's collapsible when not in use. I'll use it, but I won't be buying any more like this. Other pieces in the same series are a much better value, which is why I bought this one. Recommend only for clean, dry storage use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Rubbermaid","review":"The only good thing I can say about this chest is that it doesn't cost much. In other words, the chest is cheap. Actually, it's not really even a chest; its a rectangular canvas bag off of which the flimsy cloth handles tore almost immediately. As far as the \\"cedar inserts\\" go, they turned out to be two tiny, non-functional slivers of cedar veneer stitched into miniscule cloth pouches - just enough for the manufacturer to imply that there is some sort of cedar framing or lining, which there is not. To use the word \\"cedar\\" in association with this junky product is purposefully misleading. Shame on Rubbermaid for putting their once-trusted name on this so-called \\"Storage Chest With Cedar Inserts\\". It should be called \\"Light-Duty Rectangular Canvas Storage Bag\\". At least that would be honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storage, nice price","review":"This fits perfect in my closet to hold extra clothes from the change of seasons plus my various caps I wear. If your looking for mass storage or a dresser this might not be what your looking for. If you want to organize a closet, this is awesome. I also have the smaller bins and plan to order a few more of these for my basement. I always purchase cedar blocks for seasonal storage and the price is right on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for transport...","review":"I purchased this product as a gift for someone and the intention was for carrying the organizer and not just storage. While its a great storage product and if that is why you are purchasing it, it's great. It looks nice and will match any decor but for anything other than sitting somewhere in your house, it doesn't hold up. The bottom and top material are super flimsy and when you carry it, you can't carry it by the handles, you have to carry it underneath so it doesn't collapse.

But when I started having stomach problems, everytime I drank coffee my stomach would hurt. At the time Kroger carried Natural Touch Roma, so I tried it. The first few times I drank it with my flavored creamer it tasted a little different than coffee but it did not hurt my stomach. So the more I drank it [with the flavored creamer] the more I liked it. I have drank it for years. When I ran out of it recently I purchased a small jar of instant coffee. After a few cups of the instant coffee my stomach hurt again. I would give it five stars but as I only drink it with flavored creamer I thought I better not.

This bra fits but my arms are resting on my boobs flapping out penguin like. The cups push your breast to the side way to far. The band is small and it is hard to get the hooks through the eyes. You really have to contort to get the bra on. Also, this bra pulls your shoulders back so far that I have a back ache right between the shoulder blades. Very painful to wear long term.

Josie's vocal stylings here remind me of blue grass and that happy 40's and 50's country music you hear in old movies at barn dances and juke joints-- a blend of hillbilly and rockabilly, boogie woogie, be-bop!

Still, it is good that some of us helicopter pilots have recorded our flying deeds in this once-in-a-lifetime experience, one we treasure now that we survived it!! Chuck salutes many of his fellow pilots at the end of the book and shows that many Vietnam vets are now successful men of stature and success in their communities."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way It Was","review":"Carlock does his friends and future historians a great service with this book. It could have used a tighter structure, but the combat stories, the day to day living experiences of Carlock and his crewmembers will remain as a testiment to who those guys were and what they did. And why they are still so proud of it. Remember Carlock grew up on John Wayne movies, so it may sometimes have that John Wayne flavor, but it also shows John Wayne results. If you want to live vicariously in the flightsuit of a U.S. Army, Vietnam gunship pilot, you couldn't do better than to take the \\"Peter Pilot\\" seat next to Chuck Carlock.

I laughed out loud several times while reading this on an airplane. The other passengers thought I was nuts.You will learn about some pretty weird things that are really going behind closed doors in this twisted world we live in.All this and a guy named Sergio Fantastico. How could you not read this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bakersfield country","review":"I bought this album to listen to on my drive to Bakersfield where I would see Buck perform live at the Crystal Palace (which he still does every Friday and Saturday night).

Each album would feature several Buck solo performances mixed with numbers showcasing the rest of his band, vocally and instrumentally. Only one of Buck's hit singles was on the album: \\"Kickin' Our Hearts Around\\", a song Wanda Jackson had written specifically for him. Over half of the album features cover versions of other artists' material. Buck sings lead on seven songs, with Don Rich singing two leads, Kenny Pierce singing one lead, and two instrumentals. The CD adds two bonus duets between Buck and Rose Maddox. This is a solid CD that should appeal to Buck's fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonlight jazz","review":"One senses a course change towards more southerly climes with this collection...and it works. Warm, sweet and intoxicating melodies pour from one's speakers in a kind of musical happy hour. Each track has a distinctive and generous flavor without a single dud in the entire work. Even a weak album by Spyro Gyra is better than most others. This one is very good indeed...enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet from this terrific group","review":"Stopped in to a listening station in Fargo, North Dakota and took a listen to this latest offering from Spyro Gyra, a group I always felt has a consistent output but low profile.

I used to listen (and still do) to The Eagles , Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, etc... I have been lucky enough to avoid modern rap. The song Silk and Satin is worth buying the whole album, although all of the songs are great. Best album ever.

I would recomend it to any one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic Touch","review":"Jay Beckenstein, Tom Schuman, Julio Fernandez, Scott Ambush, and Joel Rosenblatt made one for the record books with this one. \\"Got The Magic\\" MUST be the best album they've ever put out. I owned \\"Road Scholars\\" before this, and that album wasn't to enthralling because some of the songs went on and on and they weren't my tempo/style. But then I bought this (with a lil' skepticism) and it was like I was listening to a whole new band. It made me appreciate \\"R.S.\\" a lil' more because there are some gems on that album. \\"Got The Magic\\" is relatively slow, but that's not necessarily a discouraging thing. \\"Breezeway\\" has the be the next best song they ever made right behind the classing \\"Morning Dance.\\" Other highlights would be... the whole album, but I would say they are the laid back \\"Silk & Satin,\\" the poignant \\"Springtime Laughter,\\" the mellowed-out \\"Teardrops\\" and the incredibly melodic \\"R.S.V.P.\\" All of the songs rank somewhere from 8-10 on a scale 10. That says a lot, dutten it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important, absorbing, and super-thought-provoking","review":"This book really impressed and intrigued me. Its early part, setting out the sad record of the Church in regard to killing people I found super-traumatizing. What a relief it is to see the change which has come in the Catholic position in the last 25 years! I will quote four compelling memorable sentences: \\"Punishment, yes. Death, no. People are not to be killed--not by any 'right' of the state, not in God's name, not for revenge, not to deter another, not at all. That is the nature of the right to life, the dignity of the human person, the law of God, and the teaching of Jesus.\\" This is one of the most important and memorable books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michigan Rolls still rolls","review":"I had read this in the mid 90's originally and loved it. Just read it again and still enjoyed it. I have recommended this one and Criss Cross (another non series title by Kakonis) to others and it was appreciated. The Tim Waverly character is appealing (ex con-ex literature professor now a card counting gambler) with some remnants and scruples still of his former life in academia. Any dialogue involving the two low lifes sent to retrieve the money stolen from Mr. Big (Gleep and Shadow) or their handler Mr. Gaylon was absolutely priceless. The author is compared in the review to Elmore Leonard - but to my mind he is a little edgier - perhaps more in the Eugene Izzi, Timothy Watts category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Just superb.

This album wasn't what I expected and I wasn't impressed. I am glad to have it to complete my collection, but I'm not sure I'll put it in my cd player much. Don't expect \\"We Are What You Say,\\" or any \\"For The Widows...\\" in this one. As I mentioned before, I would've bought it anyway, but you won't fall instantly in love with this one as with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinnacle of Modern Music","review":"East meets West; instrumental meets electronic; melodic meets textural--this album is perhaps the best example ever of a collection that features every musical influence through the history of man. At the same time, these styles are all thoughtfully assembled into a work that is catchy, intense, beautiful, inspiring, and sentimental. I have no hesitation in calling this my favorite album.This album should be taken as a departure from Sufjan Stevens's discography, in that fans of his better-known works are likely to absolutely hate this album, and those who don't care for his usual style may find this to be more up their alley. For anyone with interests in musicology, electronic music production, world music, academic music composition, or whose tastes span all genres of music, this album is an absolute must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent Junk","review":"This is not the brilliant Sufjan Stevens you know and love from \\"Illinois\\" and \\"Seven Swans.\\" Rather, this is an instrumental hodge-podge of noises, sometimes catchy, often discordant.

I find it to be unlistenable. The $16 cd now resides in my cd rack by my wife's old copies of Wham and Terrance Trent D'arby cd's that never get touched. BEWARE. It is noise, and grating noise at that.

This album is before the greatness of Illinois and The Great Lakes State, and it shows where sufjans melodies come from. He is a not a lyric driven folk musician like 99.9% before him, he is a melody driven musician much like any ambient music(ie air, zero 7, even radiohead). Granted this is a much larger pill to swallow, but dont give up on the rabbit, he will impress you more with each listen, and after the pill makes it down, Illinois and Michigan sound even more genious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not electronic- just a bad experiment!","review":"I would best describe the \\"music\\" on this disk as noise. There were a few moments when there was music, but mostly it was just a non-harmonic mess. He's done much better work before and since, I'd stick to those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what one would expect.","review":"So I don't have any real problems with this album. It just isn't my cup of tea. It is an instrumental album that is a branch off of the usual Stevens. I would suggest this album if you really enjoy high intensity electronic drone music. I wouldn't call it noise because there was is intention in there, but it is kind of hard to listen to unless this is your thing. I am all about experimentation but buyer beware if you are looking for the normal Sufjan Stevens album move past this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"jive turkey","review":"got this game for christmas and ....theres no game. just the expansion pac!

I would agree with most of what they have said. I do want to say that I believe that this book is one which will be appreciated by both children and adults given the reasons stated elsewhere on this book's page. I also want to point out that while there are few words about Scholastica, the pictures in the book show her as a novice, being accepted into the community and being sent out with other nuns from one foundation to begin another monastery, being chosen of the abbess for it. These pictures are included on the same pages that are portraying Benedict's life and relate to what is happening in Scholastica's life at the same time period as what is being written about which is happening in Benedict's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew!!!

Absolutely Great! It's also great for creating clothes for those dolls, as well as inspiration for your own doll clothing creations. I believe I will use this book extensively for making dolls for the children in my extended family. The patterns are easy, fun and quick to make.You can make them as easy as you like, or as complicated as you like, because they give all the details on how to create the doll already partially dressed. You'll have to purchase it to see how, its worth it, believe me. I'm actually an amature doll maker, and it will be a challenge to make them in their most advanced techniques. But, again, its worth it.I'm glad I bought the book, and the price made it all the better.

The first one I ordered only had a range of about 3-4 feet maximum. I tried all four channels with no improvement. Thinking I had a faulty one, I ordered another which had the same problem. I couldn't get a refund for the first one because I was out of the 30-day return period before I installed it. To return the second one I had to pay shipping for the return. So I've lost about $35 out of pocket on these switches. I would highly recommend avoiding this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short range","review":"The claimed range of 50' is false. I purchased three of these switches. They are all installed in an older home which would make re-wiring for three way switches difficult. Even so, I'm considering doing the work because these switches are unreliable, to use them you need to be standing in just the right spot or your body blocks the signal to the receiver and the light won't turn on. It's quite frustrating and my kids won't even use them. All three are mounted on opposing walls, in standard boxes, less than 15' apart. One other gripe, the switch style is unlike any other, so they don't match any of the other light switches we have, and for some reason they are only available in white. I wouldn't buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed this time.","review":"I have used the previous models of this Dimango product for over ten years with no problems.

While it may seem to be a stretch, I used this book when leading a study of the book of Ezra. God definitely was directing this step. We studied the fall and rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem while discussing the turmoil of the nation and world around us. Boice covers the problems of relativism extremely well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Corporal's War","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

His career has been a series of mediocre records with little to recommend them. Actually, this one's worse than mediocre; it's downright awful. Bad songs, bad production, and weak imitations of Merseybeat, folk rock, and Roy Orbison. Sorry, but to say that Fapardokly is on the level of the Byrds is pretty laughable.The only worthy effort he ever made was the first Mu album (also available on Sundazed) -- but then, it's a great record mostly because of Jeff Cotton's slide guitar playing, even though Merrell contributes songs. Buy that one and skip overrated crap like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent supplementary business reading!","review":"Upstart Start-Ups was a great read! It doesn't walk you through the process of starting a business like a guide, but it goes through the rough steps by explaining the actions and issues of various small businesses. Each part of the book contains a small introduction on the step or process in the business development process, then gives numerous examples of real people in those situations.If you are looking to start a business, this is not at all a primary read, but it gives some good advice, some good examples, and some good options for your business. This wouldn't be the only book I would read in starting my own business, but it was still very thought provoking and inspiring, and I'm sure I'll use it for reference in my own business ventures.As a side note, I will say that a lot of the suggested readings in the back are either very old, rather obscure, or ineffective, so just be wary."},{"rating":"2","title":"I consider myself a lucky shopper today.","review":"I went into a combination thrift, consignment shop today and picked up this book; not knowing just how great it was.

This book is sophomoric and offers little in terms of real advice to people who have serious ideas and ambition to develop their ideas into a viable business. This is best suited for high school students who want to know about the entrepreneurial life. The book fails on its promise to teach you how to overcome youth, inexperience, and lack of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first book to read before you start your own business","review":"Anyone starting his own business should read this book. The writing is clear and concise. The author is definitely a real writer. And each chapter is loaded with facts that are essential for anyone starting up. To really hit home, the author provides each chapter with examples from real start-ups such as Motley Fool and Kate Spade. The only downside is since this is such a quick read, more resources will be necessary. The chapters on business plan writing and marketing are more like primers which you need to read up on for these mandatory skills. But no worries, the author provides tons of resources in the appendix for additional reading. If you read this and then read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\"...it just might be your ticket out of that ka-rappy job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book -- If you want to start a company","review":"Ron has done an amazing job of identifying the problems and tribulations of starting your own company. He does not waste time with theory, or his own opinions. He tells you what he thinks matter, what the process is, and what other people's experiences where.

The pen in very easy to use and responsive. The mouse is really good too, no cord and no ball to clog. The tablet is not too large so it can sit beside my keyboard.

I would recommend this product to anyone who uses such software for their artwork. I was initially worried that the 4X5 writing space would be too small, but now that I have worked with it, I really can't justify spending almost twice the cost of this tablet, just to increase the writing space by a couple of inches.

My first comment is that this tool is not for children unless you are supervising them and they are very careful when using the pen. The pen is very fragile. I am very pleased with the pen, the tablet and the mouse. Easy and fun to use and customer support at WACOM is phenomenal. I spoke with them three times to get information and to return my broken pen for an exchange and each person I spoke to was courteous, easy to understand, patient and helpful. The pen is especially useful when editing photos because it allows you to manipulate the editing tools more precisely than with a mouse. I love the feature that converts my handwritten text (as I am writing it) into typed text. The space to work on the tablet is adequate for now but I will probably purchase a larger tablet in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphire Tablet","review":"It's great!

Quite frankly the best cooking vessel I've ever bought. I'd give up all my pans and pots for this one. If you're giving a gift to a kid going away to college. All they'd need is this one pan.The only improvement I'd make to it is to have a steam vent in the glass lid. Or an option to buy one as a add-on. Quite heavy, so the helper handle is of use.

WRONG! It's just way too heavy for me to get down from the only place I have to store it, and then it's just super-heavy to move around. Maybe I'm just more of a wimp than the rest of these reviewers, but I'm sure there are a lot of women out there who would have the same problem. The other thing I'm not crazy about is how hard it is to keep looking nice inside & out. I think stainless steel just isn't for me, although I wanted to like it because it's supposed to be one of the safest materials for cooking. Oh well, I'll probably end up getting more hard-anodyzed pans. My very favorite is a rather small Bernez (not sure I spelled it right). Everything just slides right out, so there's virtually no cleanup. I love it, but their products are very expensive. Anyway, I wish I'd never bought this pan - now it just takes up valuable space in my small kitchen. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for those how have seen the TV series (Series 2)","review":"If you have been rivited to the TV watching series 2, I highly recomend this movie episode. It, being the first fills in all the blanks and answers questions that you must have been asking yourself. How did Zev/Xev become a love slave and why? How did Stanley Tweedle become tha captain of the Lexx? ( A BIG Bug) How did 790 lose his body and how did he get brainwashed? AND just what is this handsome assassin's history and why is he alive-dead? You will be riveted to your seat for 98 mins. The Uk/Australian version is unedited so you get the full effect. A bit of Gore, nudity (a bit) and a lot of action. Get this video!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"see I Worship His Shadow first","review":"a suggestion: this movie is part two of a trilogy; it helps alot if you see the first part, I Worship His Shadow, before viewing the others; it helps explain the characters and the plot, and is a tremendous film in and of itself. You will enjoy Supernova much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastics movies. Only German sound available!!!","review":"If you can't speak German avoid this. You really can't understand these movies without knowledge of German language. I really wonder who was that genius who decided it is not possible to hear original english speech and soundtrack. Only dubbed German is available. 20 eur to the trash - wham!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tape!","review":"Lexx - Tales From a Parallel UniverseVHS was great! It shipped in a reasonal amount of time, and was worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"I write this review, not to belittle those who like Lexx, but simply to warn others not to watch what I believe to be one of the worst sci-phi films ever made. I can only imagine what an \\"ordinary\\", non psi-phi viewer must think of this mess. I don't even know what provoked me to keep watching it - hope that it may change for the better perhaps. Unfortunately though, it didn't. Poor acting, laughable dialogue and a thoroughly ludicrous plot contribute to an absolute shamble of a film. About the only positive thing I can say is that it conjured up a fraction of interest when introducing the idea of the Shadow, but even that enthusiasm was quickly ebbed out by extremely amateur plot handling. I just can't help but wonder how anyone was given financial backing to produce such a sure fire disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sponge","review":"the main reasons that I purchased this item is conveneience. Quality of product is not bad but kind of boring (more color selection would change this a lot). It is alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loofah","review":"What can I really say its a loofah and its priced right. My girlfriend likes it but the one she had before was a little bit bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value & Quality for $2","review":"These feel like high quality, good lathering sponges for your bath and at the price they are an excellent value. I would have to say that you could buy a similar quality and size one at Target and expect it to cost $4.95.If you need a few more dollars for Amazon free shipping, this is definately one you will find useful for your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"Back when this sponge was only $2, it was a good deal, especially for pushing your cart total over $25 for free shipping. The price is currently almost $5 now, so I wouldn't even consider it unless the price dropped. You can get a pack of 3 at a well known department chain store (BB&B;) for around $6, and quality is either the same or better (not sure if the three-pack is still available). The sponge itself is decent, though I find it rather small.Edit (2/9/13): Holy cow, thirteen bucks for a single loofah?!? Just dropped review by a star (probably too generous). Price gouging by Amazon is getting ridiculous! I recommendAquasentials Mesh Pouf Sponge (4 Pack)if you want to go cheap. Although the Aquasentials unravel easily and aren't super high quality, it's decent for a little more than a buck a piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unravelled after two uses","review":"My use of this sponge lasted for a total of two showers. All seemed nice. But on the third use, I loaded the sponge up with shower gel and the sponge immediately began to unravel into a single piece of crinkled material. Perhaps this specific one was defective but I am certainly not purchasing another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this product.

I wasn't sure at all when I ordered 4 of these that that they would work at all, but as it turned out, a simple drill hole installed the handles on the door, then a simple mark where the latch matched up on the frame and installed the simple catch there. The door closed tightly first try, but it has a diagonal slot adjustment on the latch that allows you to make it tighter. They hold the doors securely and latch with a simple shove... not even requiring a slam.The only reason I don't rate them 5 stars is that the template was printed on the back of the blister pack and was hard to get off without tearing it up... kinda dumb but no big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for a different dvd...","review":"I'm really disappointed in this dvd. Its title is misleading. It should say \\"Man talks about civil war battlefields.\\" This dvd basically shows old pictures and paintings as a person narrates. There are very few maps detailing the troop positions or movements. Above all there are very few images of the battlefields themselves.

I bought them for my husband, and they do look great on him, but decided to keep them for myself due to how amazing they feel. They are really lightweight, resulting in less indentation from the nose pieces. So far, this pair seems fairly sturdy too. I tend to be pretty hard on my sunglasses (should really take advantage of the nice case which came as a bonus with this order) but thus far, there is nary a scratch on them. I am keeping my fingers crossed that Jimarti will release a couple more feminine models, but am planning to order a second pair of these sunglasses today, as they really feel terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead by reviews","review":"I usually trust Amazon reviews and have never been disappointed with something 4 stars or more. I never wanted to drop allot of money on really expensive sunglasses but decided to compromise and get some $40 ones with good reviews. These can very quick and with extra goodies however the glasses themselves are horrible. The frames are cheaply stamped, you can see the seems from the mold they came from, the ear grips are inserted into square holes in spite of them being oval (circle in a square hole). I was going to send them back but unfortunately I drove over them the day after I got them. Almost as if they were beging to be destroyed because they suck so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase Sunglasses JiMarti","review":"I'm surprised ..the sunglasses didn't come with the complete Floating Case, Floating Hangers Micro Cleaner Bagjust as it was advertised at Amazon.

The good reviews of this product really makes me doubt the integrity of reviews all together. Seriously, I wore them about five times and threw them away. I don't know if it is because the lense isn't perfectly curved or what, but there are points of distortion. The polarized sunglasses at Wal Mart's vision center are way better. Gas station glasses are better. My take is you should spend your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Work well, until the screws fall out","review":"These sunglasses are great but after sporadic but very gentle wear, the screws have started to fall out of the frame and so the lenses are actually falling out.

I am blest to have it in my hearing.","review":"Mr. Smallwood continues to let us know that God is still in the blessing business. I, like many others, have loved and prayed with Richard since the late 80s. When I first heard \\"Healing\\" on the radio, I knew it was Richard's work. He has a musical signature, which is unlike any other. I was listening to the song one Sunday morning with my father, who was sick with metastatic cancer. The song, \\"Healing\\" made us remember and sing the spiritual, \\"There is a Balm in Gilead\\". My father died later that summer. Now, everytime I play\\"Healing\\", I am \\"ushered back\\" to that memory and I can't help but smile through my grief. Richard Smallwood helped me and my father sing about the power of God in our lives. That is a blessing. Lastly, once again, Richard, like his deceased Howard University classmate, Mr. Leon C. Roberts, has made my God and my Redeemer more accessible through song and I am forever grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This CD was given to me during a time that I was going througt a traumatic time in my life. My mom had just been murdered, and when a very close friend heard the CD he automatically knew that I needed this. When I listened to Track 4 (Don't Be Discouraged), I felt like this song was written just for me. I listen to this CD everyday, especially when I'm feeling lonely or down and MY SPRITIS ARE ALWAYS LIFTED!! I can't thank Richard Smallwood enough for writing that song just for me. I recommend this to anyone that's going through trials and tribulations. If you trust in GOD and you listen to the words of each of his songs, I guarntee you will feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This album is truly a blessing, for the past 20 minutes I have just played Be Open over and over again, and I have been blessed by this song.

Very good condition, and I am delighted to have it in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Clear","review":"Etienne Balibar's brief exegesis of Marxian theory is a lucid, but by no means dumbed-down account of the major problems and ideas in what is now called 'Marxism.' Balibar moves through the major concepts as a seasoned veteran of the ENS-his writing on ideology and history is particularly articulate. In addition, there are wonderful little snapshots of the major Marxian thinkers-from Gramsci to Althusser. Although many might object to the importation of 'ontology' in this interpretation, Balibar has still produced an invaluable resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Essay than Explication","review":"The title is misleading. This book is an excellent essay about Marx that places his thought in historical context. Beyond that, however, it leaves much to be desired. I found it to be only an historical introduction to Marx that failed to provide any focused overview of his ideas. Aside from the cursory mention of other philosophers and very brief allusions to their ideas, there is little here for anyone hoping for an explication of Marx's philosophy. In short, I found the book light on content and difficult to read. I was very disappointed and chose not to add it to my library. If you are looking for a clear and concise discussion of the philosophy of Marx, this book is not a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, useful, but not mindblowing","review":"Good useful stuff inside.

This is the kind of album that you like 2 or 3 cuts of when you first listen to it, but the more you play it, every cut is the best thing you've heard in a long time! Bilal is a true artist in the neo-soul class with D'Angelo, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu Maxwell. You will not be disappointed with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bilal, I feel you Boo, I feel you.","review":"The frustrations of love and life are well expressed on this freshman's First born cd. I just broke up with my boyfriend recently and I find myself playing this album all the time!!! Bilal clearly shows how hindsight is always 20/20 in his song \\"Sometimes\\"... when he sings lyrics like \\"Sometimes, I wish I seen the exit sign first\\"...How many times have we all been in a relationship and wished that we had seen the \\"exit sign first\\" before it crashed and burned?!!!!! Truely I needed this song in my life about four months ago. My other favorite is \\"Reminisce\\". That song keeps me rewinding Most Def's part as he's reciting lyrics like \\"just when I thought, I was getting along without you....somebody passed and ask me about you! I wonder how you're getting by?...Are the stars still in your eyes?

I really enjoyed the way Bilal controls his vocal range. He is truly a beautiful artist. A lot of people think that he is riding on D'Angelo's coattail, but I completely disagree. This is wonderful cd; it deserves to be heard. \\"Sometimes\\" is my favorite song of the cd. This is one cd that I do not regret buying. If you like Amel Larrieux or Erykah Badu, you will LOVE Bilal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"u mus b mi soul brutha...","review":"This is so cool. Another young R&B artist recognizing, reflecting, and respecting their full musical lineage. Fave cuts: Reminisce, Sometimes, When will you call, Queen of Sanity, Slyde(Words just can't 'verberate'? Too much!), & Second Child. The funny thing is, I wanted this disc because I loved 'Soul Sista' so much; but to me its actually one of the 'weaker' cuts on the disc. I know people will once again try to draw comparisons to more recent artists(Musiq, D'Angelo, etc.), some older artists(Prince, Rick James), but I say that we all oughta go to the rootz. Think Sly, Miles, Jimi, Ella, and Donny; you'll get the picture. We all have a family tree. In closing I'll say this: the only reason I'm not giving this review 5 stars is because of the delay in releasing this gem of a recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fav R&B album of the year","review":"In terms of style, Bilal is a guy's Maxwell. In other words, he reflects more male biases in his lyrics and style, and that might make him less of a crooner than Max. But he is more talented as an instrumentalist and producer and more daring as a vocalist. The only R&B vocalist of the last 10 years more uninhibited than this cat is Prince. The intro to this album [is bad] but everything after that is worth its weight in gold (even if you don't like it at first hearing). Know that modern R&B is unprofound. Then buy this album and you can easily find yourself relating to Bilal's lyrics. He does a good job of capturing those selfish themes of fustration, desire, hustling and trying to look good that are the staple of R&B. Therefore he is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MAN IS BRILLIANT","review":"I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THIS CD IS BY FAR A FIVE I WOULD GIVE IT MORE IF I COULD....BILAL IS A VERY TALENTED AND BRILLIANT MAN..AND I SEE NOTHING BUT SUCESS IN HIS FUTURE ALMOST EVERY CUT ON THIS CD I CAN SIT UP AND JUST LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER..PEOPLE TRY TO COMPARE HIM TO D'ANGELO AND MUSIQ SOULCHILD BUT THEY CANT TOUCH THIS MAN..EVERY 1 I HAVE PLAYED THIS CD FOR HAS GONE OUT AND BOUGHT BECAUSE THE MAN IS THAT GOOD..BUT OF COURSE YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE A EAR FOR MUSIC AND GOOD MUSIC 2 FEEL HIM....BUT I WOULD DEFFINITLEY GIVE HIM 5 STARS..\\"YOU ARE\\" IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL SONG....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Estimated Album","review":"I under estimated this album....I enjoyed almost every cut off of it.

This Bilal Cd is one of the Years Best. It is a very soulful and emotional experience.With the guest appearances on Common, Guru, Love&Basketball Sndtrk and the Soul Sista single, Bilal was greatly anticipated. Now he is out, there is no dissappointment. Love Poems is a very beautiful ballard filled with love and emotions.This album builds on different emotional boundaries for instance, Fast Lane, All that I am, Sometimes deal with growing up and feelings perspective of life and thought. While Soul Sista, Queen of Sanity, Love it and love Poems make you want to engage in love making. This cd is everything you need for a evening,ride or picnic with your significant other. For all lovers and lovers of Neuvosoul this is a must have. One of the Cd of the year. New artist of the year by far. Get this now because the wait is over. One. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Genius","review":"I'm a musician myself and rarely does an artist shake my foundation the way that Bilal has. His music is a drug that feeds my soul.

IT'S ME; NEO-SOUL IS DOIN ME TO DEATH! ...i'm sure bilal is expressin himself in the real and i mean no disrespect...it takes alot to stand up and be out there like that!! i got his back with that, but i'm jaded, spoiled by the efforts of them like jill, erykah, d'angelo anem...and with maxwell being the last of the heavy-hitters to come out now, the future of the neo-category is lookin bleak!...for ya'll lookin for somethin a bit more distinct and maybe something you're unfamiliar with, let me suggest isaac hayes' 'the best of the polydor years' from the soul essentials series...that's that dirt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"He can't sing! (I can't stress this enough). His grooves are your usual neo-soul beats/rhythms. Nothing genius or special that sets him apart. Very little originality. I think he would be better off as a producer than an artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"After playing \\"Soul Sista\\" out and waiting on his delayed album to drop, I was there for the debut. Sliced the packaged open and slid it in my cd player. If this is a falsetto well then please somebody tell the truth! First off, how can you get past the 2nd track without a dictionary or a built in microphone to hear what he allegedly is singing and then I get to hear overproduced beats with a unstable voice. If there's a good track on this cd, I couldn't make it there. To summarize, Bilal is NO D'Angelo, fa' sho NO Maxwell, and definetly NOT Musiq. Remember tho... \\"You can be my Soul Sista.........\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"this Guy has moments from time to time on here but overall the Feeling&Vibe is very Oridnary to me.He has a Interesting Voice but the Music for me on a whole goes nowhere.instead of showing Him as His Own Artist I Feel Like it's D'angelo part 2 at times.He has more COmplexity in His Work than D but overall the feeling&vibe is very much the same.anyway I don't get too excited on a Debut ALbum from many Acts ever so we shall see what the future Holds for Bro Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bilal - First Born Second","review":"Bilal is definately a talented man. This album however I don't think does him justice. There are a few cuts that seem out of place, mainly because of the beat selection. Both of the Dr. Dre beats (\\"Fast Lane\\", \\"Sally\\") stick out like sore thumbs on this album. Bilal sounds unnatural over them. He is more suited for the more soulful production and live intrumentation found on \\"Soul Sista\\" (Raphael Saadiq) or \\"Sometimes\\" (SoulQuarians). Bilal shows off his vocal flexibility on this album and at times it's breathtaking (Queen of Sanity). Other songs such as like the Marley-esque \\"Home\\", and the fervent \\"Slyde\\" prove that Bilal shouldn't be overlooked. It's a shame that Bilal has gone AWOL since this album. I think if he got with the right label he could work wonders. While this album has it's share of missteps it also has some great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st Born Second","review":"I just listened to this disc for the first time in a little while and was awed again by the talent of this young man. All the tracks on this disc are interesting to listen to and absolutely sound timeless in both the musical & vocal production. Only on these three tracks does Bilal remind me of Prince both vocally & lyrically: FAST LANE - he hits those high scratchy/screechy notes a la Prince in his heydey; WHEN WILL YOU CALL ME (a song that shoulda/coulda been as huge a hit as ADORE) and QUEEN OF SANITY.Other standout tracks to me are: LOVE IT, YOU ARE (beautiful song, if you listen close you'll hear Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry in the background), SOUL SISTA, SOMETIMES & LOVE POEMS.Overall this is a very strong debut from a talented young songwriter/musician who I hope to continue to hear more good music from in the years to come. If you have not heard any music from him but like Prince & D'Angelo then you will not go wrong in taking a chance on giving Bilal's disc a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Soul Music","review":"Without any doubt this is the best soul/r&b album of the 2000's period. I've been listening to it on and off since it first came out and I'm still digging it. Why it didn't do better commercially is a complete mystery to me. Bilal Oliver is a true original who hopefully will go on to more success and acclaim. Just to illustrate to you how much I like this man's music, I've bought CD's I normally wouldn't bother with simply because he appears on one track(Fighting Temptations, Tweet). Anyway, if you enjoy Jill Scott, Musiq, D'Angelo etc, then you should definitely pick this up. It won't disappoint you in the least, not like most R&B albums(I won't mention any names....coughcoughAshanticoughcough)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts on the butterfly lamp","review":"I love the way butterflys look & I feel a sense of freedom just watching them ,When I seen the accent lamp.

Thank you for making this possible to order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good even with beautiful Sandra","review":"I admit it. I bought this one because I think Sandra Bullock is beautiful and she looked nice on the box. I need not have bothered. She is a very minor character with minimal screen time. She does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a \\"good show\\".The story revolves around a Madison Avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion. He sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income. Near the end, he begins to see the light and reforms himself.There are a few brief moments of laughter, a few moments of Sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"Being a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, I bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work. Nope, this movie is garbage. First thing I noticed was that the sound quality is extremely poor which goes along hand in hand with the poor camera angles and shoots. The acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous. Over all, it's not a movie worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa! This movie is bad.","review":"WARNING! Do not waste your money or your time.Sandra Bullock is not in this movie enough to warrent the packaging headling her as the star. [...]The sound quality is really bad, as well as the lighting and if they used a script that too.Run from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made","review":"Without a doubt, this is the worst movie ever made, in any genre, in any decade, by any movie making company since the begining of motion pictures. Who ever put Sandra Bullock's image on the cover of the DVD should be arrested for false advertising, since Sandra is only in the movie a few minutes, and isn't very good in her role anyway. What a bomb, and that's an understatement. Don't rent it, don't buy it, and don't ever watch it, unless you are completely without anything to do, and want to find out for yourself just how bad a movie can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"This movie is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's not worth buying it, let alone renting it. Even the cover of this movie is bad. It shows Sandra Bullock in the foreground but she only plays a supporting role in the movie. It's the man in the background (Jonathan Penner) who has the lead role. It makes me wonder if the cover was made this way just to sell the movie. Penner loses his job and starts his own business by making his own religion but it was done in poor taste. Even if you are a Sanra Bullock fan, there are far better movies than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I do love Sandra Bullock and that is the only reason I rented it. I set a record and pulled it out of the DVD player after three minutes. I usually give a bad movie longer than that. Forget this one. The sound is bad, the camera angles are hideous, the dialogue is forgettable and inane, the scene lighting horrific. It does not deserve a quarter of one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sandra Bullock Movie that I didn't like","review":"This movie was a waste of time, weak plot and uninteresting. However, Sandra Bullock was as beautiful as ever. Was not something I would watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guided by God -- Saved by the heart","review":"Ms. Bullock is in this movie, (and gives an excellent performance in her small, but pithy part), but this is not a Bullock movie for those who want to view Bullock.This is a neatly-crafted, 1989-vintage ethics and morals spoof on what happens when success becomes your god. (In this case, George Plimpton)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fool and his money","review":"This is obviously an early movie of Sandra Bullock's and not up to her current standard.

I grew up watching the show, and would be happy to purchase the season I don't have, but I will not repurchase the sets that I already own in order to get the rest of the series.

Season Four is available separately for less than $20. I'm NOT paying an average of $21 per season for a set where I have three-fifths of the seasons and probably two-thirds of the discs already. I don't want the Fifth season that badly and I won't be buying the Fourth season separately at this point.I'm angry about this-and I DON'T get mad about double-dips as a rule.

To discover, just today, that the producers are releasing a complete box set -- without a separate release of the elusive Season 5 -- is wrong. I will keep an eye out for this to eventually occur. However, I will not be one to pay again for items already owned. I will not pay $100.00 simply to avail myself of Season 5.I share in the thoughts of those who have requested boycotting this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Le Grande Rip-Off","review":"I wholeheartedly concur with the previous reviewers.

Well putting it in a set like this without listing it by itself puts the price of season 5 between 47.03 and 99.99 depending on if you if you had seasons 1 - 4 yet. the price for season 5 should be $20 or less and all 5 seasons should be discounted to less than buying them all by themselves ie $65 or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next question.....","review":"I guess this begs the question, will this ever get released on Blu-ray? I have Seasons 1-4, don't think I'd buy the whole series just to get Season 5. I'd shallow hard and do it for my all-time favorite series, The Bob Newhart show, which only has season 1-4 out and nothing in the past few years.

I'm particularly impressed with all the added information that comes in the booklet. Pictures, tidbits about the characters and people who made it possible, stories from the people who know Ward and Scott. Only one complaint. I think it's really hard to get the discs out of the slots that hold them. You really gotta grab them hard on a tiny edge that's poking out of the cardboard slot and tug.

The fractured fairy tales are a favorite. The packaging is very colorful and has a good summary of the episodes. I don't like the stiff cardboard to hold the discs.

The album included one other hit song, which was a cover of the Drifters' song \\"Save the Last Dance For Me\\". Other than the hits, there were a number of other great songs on the album, including \\"Close Up the Honkey Tonks\\", \\"Truck Drivin' Man\\", \\"A-11\\", \\"Hello Trouble\\" and \\"Ain't It Amazin' Gracie\\" (the latter became a hit when Buck re-recorded it nine years later).

It comes in the box that I would never give as a gift (and I'm a guy). It looks cheap and if I had known what it looks like before purchasing I would have never spent $40. Basically you get the box (that is just like a happy meal box), two DVDs that come in the small packages like in the $9 bend at Wal-Mart, and the CD that you can find for $1 on Amazon. That's it.

That's the basics but as any fan of Green's well knows it's never easy or straight forward.It's strange and weird as Nightside tales usually are but the story is not tired or even a rehash of previous. Green keeps Taylor and the Nightside interesting and if not \\"fresh\\" then gorey and grim as a paranormal tale should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Cliches","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. I liked the PI angle, but it was hard to root for this self-proclaimed \\"bad-ass\\" because he seemed too two dimensional. Everyone in the Nightshade fears him because of the horrible things he's done, yet when push comes to shove, he seems more like an average guy with a god complex than someone who is equiped to handle the likes of the Griffin.I almost couldn't finish the novel when I read that Dracula (yes, THAT Dracula) was in the bar & he was a has-been. I'm getting the impression that the Nightshade is full of everything, especially things that have had their copyrights expire...I won't spoil the ending, but it is a big letdown, especially after the church scene. That's it? was all I kept wondering.This was my first peek into the Nightshade, and I'm afraid it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I loved the Night Side when I was first introduced to it.

That being said, this novel seems a little bit adrift compared to some of the other intrigue going on in the other novels. That's the only reason that I would give it a 4 out of 5. It's still a Nightside novels so that means it's still a great read. But I felt that this novel was not as tightly written as some of the past novels where the story line was building to a conclusion of John vs. his mom.

Oh, but there's a catch: John's gift isn't working correctly! It's never easy in the Nightside.If you've read my reviews of this series, you know I'm in love with the Nightside. Simon R. Green has such a rich imagination and is able to translate those ideas into books that are very easy to read. I read every single word in this book while sometimes I skim past useless descriptions in other books. Green's descriptions are so vivid it's hard not to visualize the Nightside.

What a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"No...doesn't work like it should","review":"Wheel cleaner products love to advertise \\"simply spray on...rinse off\\". This one can't do it at all. First off, the way it sprays on to the wheel...it's more like it squirts on to your wheel. Suds? Barely to none at all. The cleaning solution is so thin it runs off your wheels like water. Lifts dirt? Not at all, in my opinion. I get more dirt off by spraying the water hose directly onto the wheel. Scrubbing with a brush? Yes, it works...however, if you miss a spot, you'll definitely spot it when you hose it off. So you end up having to repeat the process 3-4 times with this product to make sure you get every part of the wheel, which is not the purpose of these wheel cleaners since they are meant for convenience. It's a cheaper priced product than others, but you end up using much more to get a thorough job done, so you don't save any."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a sponge","review":"I sprayed and sprayed and sprayed the Eagle One wheel cleaner on my wheels looking for the same results as the other reviewers. No luck. I still had to scrub the wheels with a soapy sponge to get all the dirt and brake dust off. Worthless.

I also enjoyed the many nice photos. I am irritated at the poor quality of the printed lyrics - lots of mistakes. Example: Burning of the Midnight Lamp. At one point the printed lyrics say \\"About the surface in the wishing well, and a couple lines later the word \\"bale\\" appears instead of bell. If you look across the page at Jimi's very legible handwritten version you will see \\"about the circus in the wishing well\\" and also \\"someone to toll my bell\\" - not bale! My recollection was that Jimi sang the words circus and also bell. There are many other similar mistakes. So I believe the printed lyrics are worthless. I bought a used copy and I am happy with the photos of Jimi and his original lyrics. I'd be upset if I paid full price for the book with all those incorrectly printed lyrics.

Laughing or crying, you reach for the tissue box a few times. You notice someone else's presence in that cozy room. He whispers, \\"Come to me, you who are weary and I will give you rest.\\" You snuggle down into the loveseat. Your soul resonates with Nancy's stories. They are different, yet so much like your own. You think, \\"Ah, that is what God was doing then. I didn't see it until now.\\" In Nancy Hoag's book, \\"The Fingerprints of God: Seeing His Hand in the Unexpected\\" you will read another woman's story of trials, courage, repentance, hope, kindness and grace.

I love piano music ..... be it jazz, classical or whatever. Having heard Brad's wonderful interpertation of Nick Drakes 'Time has told me' I thought that this disc might prove to be quite an intriguing foray into the area of reflective/solo pianowork. Well, I was quite right. The music presented here is extremely reflective offering one the possiblity of a bit of a journey into one's inner soul. I can hardly wait to listen to it on an autumn afternoon. Brad's playing and soul searching compares quite favourably with Mingus' 'Improvisations for Piano' , a disc that I save for the most special of moments. You are in good company ..... Brad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing and thoughtful cycle","review":"This is one of the most beautiful, intelligent, and profound albums it's been my privilege to hear in a very long time. It is as dense and cerebral as the writings of Mann, yet immediately accessible as well. Read the lengthy essay by Mehldau, an artistic and spiritual manifesto no less fascinating than the music itself. I buy dozens of CDs every month, and most of them get only one or two listenings, but this one is destined to be in my CD player many, many times. A treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grating","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Love Songs\\" by Anne Sofie Von Otter and Mehldau, so bought this cd hoping it would be equally likeable. I have been sorely disappointed. Something about it is rather like scraping your nails down a blackboard. It grates. There are a few tuneful moments, but they are fleeting. Overall it tends to sound rather dissonant and off tune. I realise that is largely to do with my lack of appreciation of this form of jazz.I would not recommend this to the casual jazz fan. It's for advanced aficionados who can \\"get\\" the difficult harmonies. It's not for beginners. I would not compare this to Keith Jarrett. His style is readily accessible to most music lovers. Mehldau's is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scraping greatness","review":"Tediously elegant solo piano will pay off for analytical listeners taking pleasure in compounded melody while possibly alienating many others with trying patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best new album I have heard in years...","review":"I have been listening to Brad for years and have enjoyed discovering that each time I hear him he has progressed. Years ago his music was complex and seductive; it has now grown to become one of the most powerful artistic forces around. This solo album releases an oversized talent to run free, play, meditate and yes, mourn.It's great to know that his creations will continue to grow for decades more. Buy this album. Then go buy all his others. They're worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterile colours","review":"Brad Mehldau has rejected comparisons between himself and Bill Evans, going so far as to say that he himself is not particularly fond of Evans' playing. In listening to Mr. Mehldau, it becomes clear that this is so: the harmonic structure he employs in his chordal playing and development is rather stark and modal. Where Evans and other pianists employ voicings and inventive use of the left hand, Mehldau is not only predictable but morose and stuck in minor scales completely absent of any interesting key modulation. This album sounds like a mediocre new age musician trying desparately to play jazz. Another disappointing feature of this ablum is what appears to be an attempt to bring certain classical features to the mix. At times, it seems as if he wants to sound like Chopin's Nocturnes -- endless runs in minor modes and keys that lack all warmth, reverie, or introspection. Perhaps Mr. Mehldau ought to give Bill Evans a good listening to in order to learn something."},{"rating":"1","title":"pedantic piano","review":"Sorry, I just don't get it.

Also, he's a pretty boring improvisor with very few ideas, side from playing up and down the scales with little invention.The review below ,claiming him to be the 'best jazz pianoist ever' is talking nonsense. He's not even a good pianoist.I would like to say more ,unfortunately theres nothing to say about this CD except not to get it.I really don't advise you to buy this or any other mehldau CD'sI took my copy back to the shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing a great intro...","review":"My only gripe is the missing intro to 'This Town'.

I bought this book because I read rave amateur reviews of it. But Horner's sentences do not contain whole thoughts; his build-ups lead nowhere. He makes little sense. (for instance he writes \\"and then the jury hears something they would remember for a lifetime.\\" How the hell does he know? They heard it 5 years ago! Has a lifetime passed?) .... What a shame; the Girly Chew case deserved a lot better handling than this. Now, do you want some magnificent true crime writing? Read \\"The Only Living Witness\\" by Stephen G.

God bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling reading","review":"An engaging treatment of the rivalry between two creative giants. This book takes you into the time period and opens the world of the early Renaissance to the modern reader.

There are not many history books that I give up on, but this was one- put it down after the first two chapters and haven't picked it back up yet.The major problem- more of a Brunelleschi bio than anything. Even worse, - at least in the first two chapters- every paragraph seems to be a new topic, and not related to the previous. I was really hoping for a nice, easy to read, narrative.Also seemed a little light on facts, but maybe they come later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming a nurse by character building","review":"This is a delightful book telling the story of a young girl from a relatively sheltered background who undergoes nursing training in America before WWII. The story follows her growth both as a nurse and as a person, including special friendships with other young nurses (Abbie, the accident prone), encounters with especially memorable patients (the young and precocious, the mad and the terminally ill), with older, more experienced colleagues (Gertrude, the imposing Sister) and with a certain young Intern, James Alcott; all of whom shape this young woman's character. It is an amusing, thought-provoking and interesting testimony to long days of hard work and study, and to nurses in general. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty and fragrant","review":"I order this tea for my husband who has been all but addicted to it for years.

It is black tea flavored with cinnamon, orange peel and essential oils. It is naturally sweet but contains no sugar or sweetener.Many people who don't like tea, love it. It is very fragrant and is great hot or iced. If you are used to drinking black tea with no flavor or sweetener you may prefer to blend it with a plain black tea as it is a very strongly flavored tea. Taste it before sweetening it.You should buy it in small quantities because it contains no preservatives and the citrus oils can go \\"off\\" after six months or so. You should also make sure not to store it or serve it in plastic or styrofoam as the citrus oils react with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet & Exiting","review":"This tea has a lot to offer to cheer you up at the end of a day's hard work. It is a strong tea but also sweet and exiting. Most peculiar is that it becomes better from the first cup to the last as you finish the pot. Even when you leave half a pot to turn stone cold it is good to drink. Thus, served hot or as ice tea, MarketSpice is an exiting drink. Furthermore, it has a refreshing and sweet taste. No suger or honey should be added. This makes it a great tea for those who are on a diet as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for!","review":"I used to buy this tea when I was a kid, and could no longer get it.

He also gets facts wrong and inserts his own politics far too often.A short concise history much like \\"1066\\" by David Howarth would be great on this topic.

They crushed the Revolution in the Parisian bread riots of 1795 and hi-jacked the process to their own advantage. These pseudo-revolutionaries were thrown out in the 1797 elections and turned to Napoleon to gain by force what they could not have by consent.That is the story of the French Revolution that one expects a man with Mark Steel's background to focus upon instead of the tritely amusing but disappointing confection he has chosen to provide.One looks in vain for a eulogy to Francois-Noel Babeuf, the Editor of Tribun and someone whom the author cannot but recognise as a fellow traveller.Shame on you Mark - was it because you have too many \`reasons to be cheerful'?.

The way Lilith and Gabriel were torn and kept apart resonated with me. Their chemistry is undeniable, and their struggles to compromise and find a way to be together (or to leave each other) are tense, emotional, and realistic.

Their pain, resentment, and longing are palpable.I found this second chance at love story compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"there is good information here","review":"If you are looking for serious and scholarly documentation regarding hell, this isn't the book for you. With that being said...I found this book informative especially from a media based standpoint. Many things that had any reference to hell can be found in here and some unexpected like Saturday Night Live. I think this is a good book for background information on a variety of subjects relating to hell but it is by no means a 100% complete comprehensive culmination of Hell. A agree with a previous reviewer saying that a complete encyclopedia of hell that would make the rest of the reviewers happy would have to contain many volumes and even then would it even be possible to be complete?

There are other errors an editor should have caught when the author tries to cover the program for both PC and Mac platforms. For example, a command for a Mac may actually be the one for a PC.I called the company about the CD-ROM and was sent a new disk (free) with several additional files (not all the missing files, but a definate improvement).In spite of these problems, I would recommend the book to novice Photoshop users.

Jim O'Rourke's mix, however, goes weird-post rock, timestretching the vocals and adding some processed guitar and a more pronounced drum, and Tommy Hools goes out-and-out hip hop on the track. Gak Sato's version of \\"Relaxin' With Cherry,\\" however, goes reverb-wild on it and hums along quite nicely; Dimitri from Paris & Bibi house up the track with appropriately funky results.

When I finally got one open and put batteries in it, I only used it a few times before the light bulb went out. Then when I tried to see what was going on, I couldn't twist the cover open, so I had to pull the whole light off the wall. The sticky adhesive mounting pulled a large patch of paint off the wall, so now I have to repaint my wall. For the $10 I paid, it didn't seem worth the trouble to send the lights back, so I consider it $10 wasted, plus a lot of trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"NONE of the 3 lights worked; trouble and disappointment","review":"Now I have to go to library to get return label printed, then take the package to UPS.

I bought them to light a bookcase at work where my phone is. I couldn't see the display on the phone and needed a little light. And a little light is what I got. Granted, it's doing the job...sort of...as long as the phone is angled just right to fall under the narrow beam of light. But as to lighting up the shelf? Not even close. Don't know yet how much they eat up batteries...I've only been using them for a little while...but I turn it off when I don't need it and only turn it on when the phone rings or I need to dial out. The price is right, though... But if you really need some light, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only limited by imagination","review":"I bought a set of these several months ago and just ordered a set of two more.Some have mentioned that they are not bright enough but that has not been my experience for what I am using them for:-- I have a couple I keep in the bath room for mood lighting for a bath-- I turn one in the bathroom at night for when my granddaughter sleeps over-- I have one under the desk where the computer is for lighting when connecting wires to the computer--I also have one behind the entertainment / TV area for task lighting for when I have to crawl behind there to change up components-- When my mother in-law returned from the hospital we placed one on her nightstand so she did not have to fumble to turn on the bed side lightThe battery life is surprisingly excellent however I still useSANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries.I am very pleased with these and highly recomend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dim","review":"I put these in my storage unit. They have a bad color so the light they throw gives everything a bad shade.They are also very dim, not nearly as much light as they are advertised as having. They are better than nothing, but I'm sure there are better lights like this out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I Love Ricardo Montaner and his music is the best you can fall in love just by listening to him. I wish that he could come to Phoenix I would be in the first row."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly uncreative","review":"On this album, Ricardo Montaner goes back and re-records his greatest hits, this time with the Metropolitan Orchestra backing him up. What kind of imagination does it take to re-record your hits? None at all. And Ricardo's voice doesn't sound as pure and strong as it used to. I would say this disc was for fans only, but I'm a fan and was very disappointed. Another Venezuelan singer-songwriter who is about the same age, Franco De Vita, is still offering fresh, creative ideas. Better to check his new album out or save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next level of Montaner","review":"I've been a Montaner fan since \\"Ojos Negros\\" back in the mid 80's, I used to own the record, believe it or not. This CD takes all the timeless clasics that we, his fans, have made famous and brings them to the next level of music quality. The arrangements are pure and sublime; and his performance contains all the feeling and passion that has made him unique. Whether you're a long time fan like me or somewhat newer to his music, you're going to love this one, I guarantee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap fun for younger crowd","review":"Shipment was 12 separately wrapped classic whoopee cushions.

Coax Seal is the best near-permanent sealant for outside antenna connections and splices, especially for buried splices. Installing Coax Seal is fast and easy with the finished product being a water and weatherproof seal that will last for years to come. I would recommend Coax Seal to anyone who requires a weather proof seal for any kind of electronic or electrical equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesser Known Works of Michael Card","review":"I have been a fan of Michael Card's music for well over a decade. This album is one of his lesser known works and was inspired by the book of Hebrews in the New Testament. The CD features ten songs. Musically I found that two songs appealed to me above the rest; \\"Pilgrims to the City of God\\" and \\"By Faith,\\" never-the-less the rest of the songs had \\"real meat\\" in their messages. Two songs are duos, one a remake from a previously published song. There was scant information in the CD cover...neither lyrics or scripture references though perhaps there was originally (I bought from a reseller). I would recommend this to anyone familiar with and a fan of Michael Card's other albums, but would choose one of his more popular albums as a gift to those who may be hearing Michael's music for the first time. Michael Card is indeed a wonderfully gifted artist whose music has often nourished and helped anchor my soul. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as represented","review":"If you are interested in the ship itself, don't buy this book as it is not about the ship at all it is only about the researchers and other people such as museum people. Not a single word about any of the pertinent information on the ships history, or it stranding or ship logs or anything at all. On top of that it is only 42 pages of uninteresting information and I paid $38. for this useless book, and when I contacted the seller, I was informed that I could not send back and get a full refund, only a partial refund that was unspecified. So I elected to donate it to a thrift store rather than give back the book and let the seller keep part of the money. Not happy at all with this transaction, to say the least. I could have used that $38 for some other book of more use. It was WAY overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest children's books ever written","review":"I give this book as a gift and use it every semester in my classroom.I used it when I taught in the school system and now that I teach future and experienced teachers, on the college level, I share it with them as well.The language is poetic (full of imagery and joy), the illustrations are vivid and delicious, and the story line is glorious!.Any age from 3 to adult will enjoy this marvelious story."},{"rating":"2","title":"bluegrass rock and live music lovers must have this one","review":"Rollin in the Hay has become one of my favorite bands over the years. They tour extensively and this album captures the energy of their live performences nicely. The album includes light-humoured original tunes as well as good ole classic bluegrass tunes such as little maggie. I recommend this album and the band to anyone who likes fun, good hearted, live southern bluegrass music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hollies' True Masterpiece","review":"Having been a fan of the Beatles for a few years I found that I had grown a taste for their British inspired harmonies. Looking in several different directions for new talent, I happened upon the Hollies. This album is as good if not better than the records the Beatles and their other contemporaries put out at the time. With it's lazy pop in \\"Postcard\\", to its backward tape effects in \\"Try It\\", it covers lots of ground. \\"King Midas In Reverses'\\" failure to take off as a single is simply amazing after you hear their tonsils lock on it. If you like the beatles and are looking for another more harmony laced group to try, start by buying this album and then go get \\"Evolution\\". You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real gem of the psychedelic era","review":"One of the best albums of the psychedelic era. A real diamond full of kaleidoscopic lights and fresh breezes of patchulie. A must for conoisseurs and lovers of the best kind of music. Expressionism full of warm colour tones. The triad Clarke-Hicks-Nash by definition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"I was looking for pages to store all the 5\\" X 7\\" photos I purchased until I get them into frames.

The cover picture of Damone in the middle of a muddle of models sums up the show: songs and beautiful girls, presented on location.Billy May, coming off his classic work with Sinatra on albums like \\"Come Fly with Me,\\" is also at the peak of his game here. His crisp arrangements are wonderful.Damone is also known for his 'tropical' songs, and those are well represented on this double set. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Key board noises","review":"Oh my goodness i dont know what this is. I made a hastie purchase while buying some Dogg Pound cds and this ended up with me.

This is a gorgeous book!","review":"The vibrant full color pictures grab your attention and you just can't put this one down! Really great ideas for all of your next big or small celebrations. New Orleans is known for great food and all of the most famous restaurants have contributed their best recipes to this glossy hard-cover book. Really impressive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book but...","review":"The title of this book is a little misleading. I would not call it the confession, but rather biography of Donald Cabana who worked in the prison system for a number of years and, as warden, oversaw the execution of two people.The book is very well written, easy to understand and is, in my opinion, quite humble. Donald Cabana had a remarkable and varied career. His feelings about capital punishment, especially after personally overseeing executions, are interesting to read about. There are not too many books from this unique point of view.If you're looking for detail on the death penalty process or execution technology then there are better books to read. If you are looking for an interesting biography with some insights into relationships between prison staff and inmates, then this is the perfect book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling true story","review":"This book chronicles a prison warden's career through the prison system. His recollection of specific incidents (e.g., a hostage situation) is vivid and heart-wrenching. Cabana's moral struggle with carrying out an execution is not presented philosophically, but instead relates what it's actually like to give the order to have someone put to death in the gas chamber. Whether you agree with Cabana's (arguably compassionate) viewpoints on the correctional system or not, this book is a page-turner because of his interesting life events. For those who are looking for a death penalty discussion, this book is a good accompaniment to \\"Dead Man Walking.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A true insider's view of capital punishment","review":"As a warden, Don Cabana had an insider's perspective oncapital punishment that few others really have. Whileproponents of capital punishment might (wrongly, I think)dismiss Helen Prejean's perspective (Dead Man Walking) asnaive and sentimental, they will find it hard to dismissCabana as a meddling nun that romanticizes prisoners andtheir fate. As a career correctional officer, Cabana hadseen it all in prison life when he became warden atMississippi's main prison, Parchman. Although he clearlyfavors tough treatment for those that deserve it--as we alldo--he argues, from an \\"I've been there\\" perspective, thatcapital punishment is ultimately a futile way to administerjustice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoever Harald Kloser is, he's going places!","review":"I've not even seen \\"The Thirteenth Floor,\\" but listening to this album over and over again as I've been doing, I really want to. Within the shiny little spinning disc is an incredible range of music. Often, film scores end up as collections of variations. Not so here. The breadth and depth of Mr. Kloser's offering is incredible. A worthwhile mix of orchestral, period, moody, techno, dramatic, symphonic. And Mr. Kloser works his orchestra. By far the primo piece is \\"Downtown LA, 1937.\\" The entire album is like a great meal at a cherished restaurant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"I expect more copies of this CD would sell if samples of the Grand Wilshire Swing Suite were made available.

It's worth every penny, and even though it's not from a famous composer like Williams, it's definitely a great soundtrack.It's a perfect mixture of the 20's music and modern styles.But this great soundtrack has been wasted on a movie, which - although it isn't bad - doesn't really deserve it....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"If you want your head to spin over the ability to make things really look 3-D, she has made it easy and stunning.

I first thought it was a ballad, it sounds like one but it's so much foul language in it that makes me wonder. The F and B word's are not really words that should be included in a good ballad,he either got some problem to express himself properly or perhaps that's how he sees women. The hit single is catchy however, that's why it's top 10 on bilboard.Eamon get's very emotional when he sings, so i supopose he must have had some bad experience of girls. But the other songs are simular. None of them are any good though. His voice is good, i kind of like it but when the songs aren't any good it'sm difficult that he'll have other hits, some good producers would have helped to improved the album. I believe he'll be gone soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eamon... totally overrated","review":"After just listening to the cd preview on his website, this must be one of the most commercial cds to come out in a while. Half of the tracks involve getting/giving head, f**king hoes or hating them, and the other half is purely aimed to get radioplay and appeal to mainstream.

The hooks on this album are annoying and hurt the ears. I'm glad a friend, who wasted their money, let me listen to his copy of this horrible mess.

This albumn should not even be listed in the hip hop section. The single gets nation wide airplay on all corp. owned stations, which just means that station are still accepting way too much illegal inncentive money to play crappy music, regardless of what real people think.

Me and my friends were driving back to town from a school musical and one of them turned up the radio and asked if I had ever heard this song before. I'm like isn't it \\"I dont want you back\\" by Eamon and they said no and I am like are you sure cuz it sounds like it. It was some girl (probably the same girl the song was directed to in Eamon's song) singing back to Eamon in her own version, in her own song! I thought it was pretty funny but I don't know who sings it and I don't know what it's called. So if anyone knows please tell me!!

So when the opening of the lead single and title track floats over the radio i'm thinking yeah i like this this is how i felt about some B at a point in time. When I looked up info on the disc I thought this was the male eminem but after listening to the disc twice I realized this is kinda lame. This is Jive's attempt to make lots of sales off of the shock of cursing in R&B songs. Here's a thought rappers have been adding their profanity to R&B for years. Since Eamon doesn't really have much to say it kinda makes the whole album very very very immature. I expect this to be a hit among teenage boys and the young college boys and maybe goofy girls who think this is funny (even though their being degraded). As a grown *ss man i'm here to tell yall *itches that *uck it just buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst crap ever","review":"i don't even want to give this thing any stars. the cd is horrible. it isn't funny, it's stupid. this boy has a complex that needs to be dealt with before he pollutes the world with more of his \\"music.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This is PURE CRAP","review":"I am sad to say that music artist have fallen to an all time low. I was excited to see a fresh new face and when I listend to this CD, I threw the thing in the trash. It wasn't even worth my gas to go back and return it. It is easy to see that this guy has some SERIOUS issues. I am so looking forward to the day when music reverts back to MUSIC. The stuff now days is full of Bitc* dis and Hoe dat and folks wonder why teenage pregancy is so high. Males, grow up and be men and stop disrespecting women. Females, grow up and be women and stop asking is this low enough when told to 'Get Low' or Shake it Like a Saltshaker. Who ever produced this CD needs to be put out of the industry. This is definitely a slap in the face to music artist that are trying to do right by the fans. The scary part is that there are people that actually like this stupid CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who signed this moron?","review":"First, Eamon can't sing. His voice is so obnoxious. I'm not sure who gave him a record deal, but they should be shot. \\"F**K it\\" is a terrible song that gets more annoying everytime you hear it. I'm dreading his next single. All the songs on the album are the same. Eamon cursing every 2 seconds on a crappy beat. The guy curses like he thinks it's cool & it will sell more records, but i have news for you: THIS CD WILL TANK, & PEOPLE WILL SAY F*** YOU EAMON, WE DON'T WANT YOU BACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is just bad. I guess if you're a fan of this typical kind of nasty type rap which is pretty much universal, you may like this. There's no point to any songs, but that's what it's about right? cash, money, hoes..and life in the ghetto. I'd rather listen to Eminem who talks about whats real, what's funny, and at the same time sad. Eminem fans, there's nothing here. And this guy is a wannabe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking...","review":"I lied, I don't even give it one star. I just had to put something in to get this review posted. I heard the cd and I agree with the majority. He sucks. The only song I like is \\"I Don't Want You Back\\", but not this version. Oddly enough, I found the clean version to be a lot better. It struck me, but this explicit version just sucks. I mean, I listen to groups like ICP and Twiztid, where you hear swearing constantly, but Eamon just isn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eamon","review":"I think Eamon's cd \\"I don't want you back\\" is an excellent CD. I was personally happy to finally hear a guy come out with a song to a female like all the female songs that are singing to guys. The CD is basically saying the same thing. My favorite song is \\"Something Strange\\". If you like break up songs or you've been wronged in a relationship you should like this CD and Eamon is pretty Hot LOL.Other then that all I can say is check it out and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEEPING IT REAL!","review":"What a trip, he's gots da flo'!

Can't believe da sucka from South Afrika. Total flava. Sing it out dude. I still can't believe he does opera on the last track. Whassup wit dat?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"something new","review":"i don't normally write online reviews but i was surprised at some of the poor reviews given for this album. It is true the album is explicit, but if you open your mind enough to look beyond that, it is a quality album. Eamon's voice is totally different in sound as is his music. The introduction of ho-wop is something everyone should hear, '4 the rest of your life' is a particularly good track to hear something other than f*ck it, if you wanna try another eamon track. There is a reason why great artists such as jay-z want to work with this guy and that is apparent on the album...open your mind and give it a go, the ho-wop era is here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought","review":"The single was a decent song, nice beat to I dont want you backbut the rest of the cd is just bullsh*** it has to be one of the worst cds i have heard in my life. dont waste your money on this...im from staten island like eamon, let me just tell u the rest of us are not as dumb as him."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could, I'd rate it ZERO.","review":"I, like everyone else in America, have \\"Don't Want You Back\\" stuck in my head. Unfortunately, it's one of those songs I wish I could forget because I think the song is terrible. Out of curiosity, I listened to sound clips of the rest of the album and could not find one single song that was not full of cursing or talk of his crotch. Even if this kid had any vocal talent, it still wouldn't help this album. He has one of those voices that sounds like he sucked on too many helium ballons as a child. This is easily one of the worst albums of the year. If you see it in a store, DO NOT touch this album. It's not worth your time. Heck, it's not even worth burning a copy from someone else. If I could rate this cd at zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice.","review":"I'm sure you heard one of his songs, liked it, and wanted to buy this album. Then you would only be buying it for that hit because this album doesn't have much to offer. The profanity seems like it was added to just to toughen up a broken spirit. And theres a whole lot of it. Where to the point when it goes from self expression to pointless vulgarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"in the words of eamon - a f***ing s**t album","review":"ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL (APART FROM MAYBE \\"CONTROVERSY\\").

He has a nice voice, but unfortunately he has chosen to employ it in a rather horrible way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, that was horrible!","review":"First of all, this guy cannot sing. He sounds like he is yelling into the mic on Don't Want You Back, and the rest of his crooning is just as bad. He tries to act like a thug and comes off as a punk. For the last time, R&B cats cannot be thugs. The whole album sounds like teenie bopper crap, made for a truly shallow generation. It really saddens me because I am part of this generation that puts out this crap. If you hated this and want some real edgy R&B, check out Cody Chestnutt. His album, \\"The Headphone Masterpiece\\", is what Eamon was trying to do here. I must say, Eamon's album has the worst production, singing, and most of all, writing. I mean c'mon \\"I even said you were my great one.\\" WTF is that? He stole that from A Bronx Tale! Okay, I'm rambling, point is, do not buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!","review":"I haven't even bought this cd and I wouldn't buy it his voice is terrible!!!

He just tells it like it is. Everyone thinks those things when they break up with someone but only he has the balls to say it. so all you haters back the **** off and leave him alone. He is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh, this is music?!","review":"ok, this guy sucks, period. Zero talent .that's all you need to know. AVOID at all costs!! this is not good music.As a public service, i'd like to translate Rick from NY's review into English, since what he wrote doesn't make a lot of sense:\\"Stop saying all these bad things about how Eamons cd sucks. With the exception of a couple bad songs, this cd is good. He has a very different style and voice than anybody I've heard before. F*** It is a good song and a lot of other songs are good. Listen a little closer, 8, 11,13, 15 are very good. Just because he talks about hating girls and everything doesn't make this a bad album. Eamon is very nice\\"Did that make better sense in English? I didn't think so. Obviosuly, anyone who buys this cd has zero taste in music and should never be allowed to buy cd's again.

Its one of my favourite cds. definitly buy it and give it a chance, and for everyone else quit hatin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh man....","review":"So i listened to the whole cd. It has it's ups and downs. If youre looking for a fresh R&B sound go with this cd. Other than the single, I throughly enjoyed the following tracks: 04 On and On, 06 Get off my D, 08 My Babys Lost, and 14 I'd rather f with you. There are other great songs on it, about 9-12 out of the 15 songs are listenable. Great cd, looking forward to his followup...."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF!! Why are people giving this higher than one star?","review":"This is Joseph's oldest DAUGHTER.This guys stinks. BIG TIME. And if you looked up the definition of \\"Talent\\", you definitely WOULD NOT find Eamon there. Look up the definition of \\"Awful\\". He'll be there.He can't sing. And he degrades woman. BAD combination.Don't support this sorry excuse for an artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"this kid sucks.","review":"wow..i can't even believe some of you gave eamon 2 stars. he's terrible. absolutely terrible. his new single sucks too. i can't believe he thinks he's remotely attractive. he's disgusting and has NO talent. he sings like a whiney girl. and yes, these reviews are \\"americanized\\" because this is america, you idiot. normally, i would give him some credit for trying, but he SUCKS! oh well. i can't wait to watch his career screw itself over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"I compare this album to having chappped @ss from taking to many dumps.Eamon sucks canal water through a straw.This is by far the worst piece of garbage I have ever heard in my entire life.I recommend pouring gasoline on yourself and lighting yourself on fire rather than listening to this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't confuse this w/ R&B/Urban hip hop!","review":"The CD is ridicolous and embarrassing. I can only laugh and imagine How in THE HELL did he get a record deal, less more a hit on top 40 radio. I am so thankful that radio stations that I listen to don't play this garbage.

Thats not to say it was a good thing - the only reason it gets stuck in your head is because its dull and derivative. It's like a little tune you could make up yourself and hum under your breath - not great material for a song. That was why I got the album - in the naive thought that if I listened to it enough it would get out of my head, or atleast I would be able to find another song more annoying to replace it. I have to say, the album isn't all that great. The songs are all just as dull and derivative as \\"I don't want you back\\" and most of them aren't even as catchy. Eamon's voice is average, if a little whiny. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want swearing, whining and more swearing - and if you want that I suggest you buy Eminem songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this???","review":"Wow, what is this world coming to!! This guy needs a shink. So what if a girl screwed him, it happens all the time. He should get over it and not tell me about it because, to tell the truth, I really do not care. And calling girls hoes, sorry, it doesn't cut it. He should look at himself first because, like it or not, men are bigger hoes then women and that is a fact. It's real life, get over it. I don't hate, I look at real facts and tell it like it is. And wheater you like it or not, rap sounds the same all around, it's not a joke. All they rap about is how women screwed them or how women should be treated. If that is not an insult, I don't know what is. They should rap about something that is important in life not about the same sh*t over and over again. It's boring and not realistic. Maybe a woman rapper should rap in the same way about guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This music sucks, plain and simple.","review":"This music is GOD AWEFUL. Not only does he suck as an \\"artist\\", he sucks as a person in general. His music is completely disrespectful to women and just plain sucks. Not only that, but he sounds like he's still waiting for his balls to drop...sooner or later they will. And as for the \\"Music Guru\\", Eamon is NOTHING NEAR Eminem and never will be.

The lyrics are not only juvenile but poorly written. One would be better off buying the one single don't want you back, which is by far the only semi decent song on the cd. It is clearly obvious that this artist will be seen on a future episode of Where are they now or What ever happened to that one hit wonder. Eamon is such a bad artist that P Diddy, Missy Elliot, and the Neptunes combined wouldn't even be able to savage his lame attempt at being a music artist.

This band, who appear to be half German, and half Polish (judging by their names) recorded this one album for Ohr back in the early 70's, then disappeared. It's pretty good stuff, similar (but inferior) to Wallenstein, and will appeal to fans of the early Krautrock scene.

First of all, the texture is vastly different from the Lil' Crunchies. These wheels are incredibly hard and do not melt in your mouth like the Lil' Crunchies. There is also no taste of cheese at all.

You can get a new radio with everything for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"This antenna is terrible","review":"I have had a Sirius Radio for about 2 and a half years. The original antenna I had from when I bought the unit lasted about 14 months with no problem, until it broke. For the last 12 months I have been purchasing these pieces of junk at $40 each from my local bestbuy. In 12 months time I have probably gone through 4 of these antennas with each one lasting about 2-3 months. I\`m about ready to go purchasing my 5th antenna because the one I own is getting ready to die. Buyer beware on these. These would probably be a better deal if they where only 10-15 dollars each. But at $40 per antenna with an average life span of 3 months is just outrageous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing!","review":"There are many fine recordings of Chopin -- probably many not so fine too, but this one stands up there right alongside Rubinstein.GAnz brings a warmth, sensitivity, passion and depth to his performance of Chopin that is a \\"must hear\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun!","review":"I found this to be a most enjoyable CD.

Kim's description of the beauty of Northern Idaho is right on. Once you connect with the beauty of the people of the remote areas there is no other place. Her portrayal of being raised in a non-forgiving religion does test ones faith. When I read the \\"lesson of silence\\" I almost cried, many of us know this lesson well. This is a great read; one I will read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairness in the face of miracles.","review":"This book is beautifully written, with her early years happening in a kind of Idaho Eden, but what impressed me most was the author's fairness. She presents such a kind, loving, balanced view of the church, her family, their larger church family. She illuminates the glory of charismatic faith and accepts the presence of faith-based miracles. But when she explores what is lacking for her, what was missing as she tried to imagine taking her place as a wife in a Pentecostal family, the reader's heart breaks. Her questioning mind will not let this simple faith stand. As someone with no personal experience with this kind of religion, I was astonished by the rigidity of the church, appalled at how unforgiving a faith supposedly born of forgiveness could be.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A confused and wandering discussion of Quine's work","review":"Unless you're a die-hard Quine scholar, I don't suggest this book. Dilham's critique is rambling and incoherent. The book is full of references which the reader may or (more likely) may not be familiar with. Much of the book seems unmotivated and directionless. He may very well have some valid points, but it's hard to tell, and it's not at all clear that it's worth working through this book to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Light Read","review":"Being a die-hard fan of the show, I have read the other books in the Alias series, but had a bit of trouble finding this one. It was an amusing, fast read, but I thought it was lacking in plot. All Sydney does is hang around in a castle while her co-inhabitants are picked off one by one. The real action does not happen until the very end of the book. I thought the scene showing how she gets to know the hunky Burke was the high point of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 2 Good Books, This One Falls","review":"I am very sad to have to give this book a bad review. I loved the first two, especially the second one. But this one just wasn't interesting. It doesn't do anything with Sydney's character development. It just focuses on her first \\"real\\" mission, which turns out to sound like one long game of \\"Clue!\\" (Was it Mr. Mustard in the library with a candlestick?...) Book 2's mission in Paris was much more exciting & true to the feel of the show. In this mission mostly people are sitting around talking - ver slow, very boring! I kept waiting for something to develop, but it never did. So you can trust me when I say, go ahead and skip this one! You won't be missing anything! I will still be purchasing Book 4, in the hopes that this was just an aberration."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Valiant Effort","review":"While the first two Alias books were fun, exciting, and action packed, this one is a drag. Sydney goes to a \\"spooky\\" castle to discuss the problems of a fictional European country with several organized crime figures. Sydney doesn't do much when they start being bumped off one-by-one. The story isn't very original and there isn't much action to this book. I am sorry to say it is a disappointing addition to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful.","review":"I did not find anything useful in this book. If you are looking to start a career in the fire service, the best advice is to go to your local station and ask the firefighters. They will be happy to give advice and will know specifically what you need to do to get a job in that particular area. If you really feel the need to read this book, go to the library!

I forced myself to read the entire book hoping to get something out of it but was really disappointed. I have been using photoshop for about eight years and like to brush up on things once in awhile but this book is so poorly written that a lot of it just does not make sense or will not work as explainedFor example on page 327 the technique he explains does not work the way it is layed out if you use Multiply mode as instructed in the book, nor does it come close to matching his sample on the CD regardless of what blending mode you use.

However, when I decided days later to look up the recipe for a raspberry margarita I noticed the book did not have an index, a table of contents and was not in alphabetical order. What insanity! I had to hunt for the recipe. Unless you are into trying unusual concoctions like Avocado-Cilantro or Cherimoya or Blood Orange Margaritas, I recommend that you skip this book. I bought The Bartender's Black Book [$12.95 for 8th edition on Amazon] and am very pleased with it.

I have been lucky that they didn't require special formulas. This formula is great for the price. If a child isn't a sensitive eater, this is the one.

I bought it with two packs of negative sleeves and I have put all of my negatives in each of the two that I bought. They're dark so they keep the light away from my negatives and I was able to fit it right into my small safe. It also has a side panel that's label friendly. The handle that comes with it can be put on or left off, I left mine off so it would fit neatly into the safe. It also works upright on a bookcase and can be used for a variety of things. Shipping was also super fast from this retailer through Amazon. I got it the Thursday after the Friday that I had ordered it!

I read the entire book in one sitting and afterwards presented copies to each of my children. All of them appreciated the gift; the stories evoked both, laughter and tears. I have a particular fondness for one of the chapters and found that Irene Harner and I have very sympathetic views on life. Her memories of friends and family are recorded with respect and love, and you feel you know her when you put the book down. Her escapades paralleled many of my own and encouraged me to experience even more of life...in her honor. I enjoyed the book. Thank you, Irene."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my time back!","review":"What a waste of time!Each book after the first is basically the same, everyone get separated, has their adventures, solves their particular problem and then they all come back together.

The author doesn't develop his characters very well which to me makes for dull stories. There tends to be plenty of action, but the action is predictable. The characters end up split up by forces beyond their control. They each concur the evil forces by the powers they possess. And they reunite in the end. Each character stays within the limited characterist the author gives them and never steps out of those rolls. There seems to be no growth in the characters. I haven't finished this book because it fails to take me anywhere new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Comfortable Lord of the Isles","review":"As a general fan of David Drake, his inspired character development, story pacing and plot surprises keep me going back for more. The Lord of the Isles series is one of the few of his I missed, and I have read them exclusively and now am on the fourth in the series, Mistress of the Catacombs. While the outcome is predictable(the heroes win), the way they go about it makes for fascinated and varied reading, so that I spend what little free time I have reading the series. Plaudits to David Drake for keeping me up late at night reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just \\"another\\" book about adults with ADD","review":"I think I've read just about every book for adults with ADD that's out there, but this is the best one yet. Sari offers not just insight as to how the ADDult mind works, but she also gives solid advice on how to reclaim one's goals and dreams despite our difficulties. This is the first book I've read that really helps those with ADD to learn to separate our difficulties from our gifts and talents, and to forge ahead in the knowledge that ADD need not destine us to a life of resignation to getting less from ourselves because of our difficulties. This book was a real breakthrough for me and just what I needed to read at this point in my own ADD journey. Kudos to Sari for a very well-written and necessary addition to the number of works on adult ADD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the normal ADD book","review":"This book goes beyond the normal ADD books.

I found Will Ackerman's \\"Just Dancin' Like Fools\\" with the violin blending with Ackerman's guitar and the vocal ending especially fitting the idea of celebration of the solstice. Lisa Lynn's \\"Cancion de Amor\\" featuring her on the celtic harp with cello and percussion backup also seemed especially fitting with the theme. Other highlights were \\"Shaka Slack Key\\" (first time I've heard George Winston on the steel string guitar rather than on piano), Jim Brickman's \\"Circles\\", and David Arkenstone's \\"Reflections on the Pond\\". Heck, I even enjoyed Jay Beckenstien's soprano sax on \\"Summertime\\", even if the Gershwin tune is old hat in comparison with the rest of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, bland and routine","review":"Enough is enough already.

Although Empty Glass by Pete is top notch, this album is simply much stronger. As stated in previous reviews the writing is incredible and Frampton's work practically jumps out at you-his guitar style is so recognizable. One thing that hasn't been said about this album though is the emotion in John's singing. Songs like \\"I Feel Better\\" and Apron Strings really showcase this well.One thing I would love to see is a tribute/remake of this album with guest singers. Couldn't you just see Kid Rock singing \\"I Feel Better\\" or \\"I Found Out\\"? How about Travis Tritt covering \\"Thinking it Over\\"?At least that way these incredible songs would see the light of day and perhaps John would get the recognition he always deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORDER THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"It is not often when you stumble upon a great little book and it makes you feel good about yourself!

After going through elixers, exps, and various martin strings, I was getting desperate for a string that had deep bass and non-tinny high notes. I was actually getting frustrated. Then I remembered seeing these strings at Guitar Center. They were cheap, unlike the other strings I had bought, so I decided to take a risk. After restringing my guitar, I was amazed. The strings sounded bright and clear, the exact thing I was looking for. The strings sound extremely clear, yet rich, and I am pretty satisfied.Just one complaint: The strings are advertised as medium light, which is 12-54. However, when I put the strings on, they felt much thinner. For example, the high e-string felt like it was 10 if not thinner. Maybe it's just me? I don't really know; it just felt strange to me.Great string overall though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth trying!","review":"I love these strings. I don't know what it is about them but they sound very bright, have a nice organic tone, and feel great too. They also are very shiny for some reason. I've been using D'Addario EJ16 strings for all my acoustic playing and never tried anything else until now. Those D'Addarios are nice strings and I still like them, but these ones from Ernie Ball suit my taste more. They are louder and the bottom strings are slightly thicker actually.

Within about a week or two these strings sounded dull and had to be replaced. I regret not having spent some more on strings that would hold up a bit better. My fingers do sweat a bit, but I also wipe down the strings after playing. Just seemed like very low quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernie Ball Guitar Strings","review":"I was very pleased with the transaction and the product.I have not used the strings yet but am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late -60's Buck","review":"Here is another great re-release by SunDazed Records from the Buck Owens Catalog. I admit I prefer the early Buck Owens' sound, and this CD really has nothing wrong with it; especially if you prefer the more polished and later sound of Buck and the Boys. But, I find it to lack the energy and enthusiasm (exuberance?) of the earlier recordings. But, with that said, I would whip out my billfold and buy a dozen copies of this CD before spending a penny on the trash coming out of Nashville today. There are 14 songs here, including the title track, \\"Where Does the Good Times Go\\", and \\"Let the World Keep On Turning\\". As with all of the SunDazed collection, the sound is great and the liner notes are more than sufficient. As with all of these re-releases, you would be smart to grab them while you still can. They wont be available forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Leader is a wonderful training tool","review":"My husband and I have 2 large dogs (chocolate lab & boxer/lab mix) and they each have their own gentle leader. We use them anytime we leave the house. If you buy the correct size and adjust it properly it will quickly become just part of life for your dog. Whenever we pick up the gentle leaders, our dogs get excited with happiness and then sit very still so we can put it on them. We have a connector leash so one of us can walk both 80+lbs dogs at once. Without the gentle leaders, this task is almost impossible.For anyone who is afraid this is akin to a muzzle, this is not. They can open their mouths and do just about everything they want to, except pull. It does take a couple of days/weeks for your dog to accept it, but that is because they love to pull and be in command.Our trainer recommended it to us and every class she has. She loves dogs almost as much as my friend who is a Vet and she recommends the gentle leader as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lubricant!!","review":"I bought this item and It was fantastic, I enjoyed it and I recommend it to everyone..Dominican Republic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old standby","review":"While there are more expensive, smoother, and longer lasting options when talking about personal lubricants you really can't complain about Wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a gel","review":"First of all this stuff burns like you would not believe .

The 10 year battery is a real plus, and, aswith most digital watches it has stopwatch, dual time,alarm, date, and day of the week. The only thing Idon't like is the date and day-of-week fields at thetop of the watch window are too small - if youreyesight isn't what it used to be then you can'tread it without glasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch","review":"I am quite pleased with this particular sports watch. The functions are straightforward and the display is nice. I possibly could use a larger display with bolder numbers, but that is more a problem with my waning eyesight than with the watch. The light could be brighter, however. I like the stopwatch feature, which is why I bought the watch, but would like the watch better if it included a timer. For the functions it does have and the many features at this particular price, you absolutely cannot go wrong (and with the 10 year battery I am sure the wristband will give out before the watch does)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album!!!!","review":"Michael Hill said in a recent interview that he really likes to try another kind of works and it's really what he have done at this new album by an independent label.He left Alligator Records but don't forgot that roots and friends,and that old style to play,his urban blues with great social influences.What is curious is the fact that Hill seems to be affective with kids,and the art cover of this cd reveals this side of his personality!!The participation of Living Colour's Vernon Reid on \\"41 Shots\\" must be remembered.A great album of this really true bluesman searching for new bluesways!!!I enjoyed so much!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Togo the real hero of the Iditarod","review":"I read this book in my third grade class.

So, she continues to fight, but with each strike she feels less like a human and more like a monster. But can she escape this life of murder and pain...?Not for children, this book has several scenes where Naomi and her boyfriend are making love, or just pictures of her nude. And the adult themes of regret, jealousy, hatred, anger, and despair would be hard for younger audiences to understand. The action moves fast and the dogfights are spectatular, but short.I loved Maico and I like this one! Bring more of his work into the English repertoire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth ordering, save your money.","review":"This book is basically a \\"rehash\\" of the first book. It reviews the entire first book. As I was reading, I could not wait to get to the new material and events that have occurred in Dannion's life.

This series is a true shojo classic, a true anime classic and this presentation is worth having over all the others that came before. The package is lovely, the series looks better than ever with all the changes it got (There no George Lucas style of editing here, all the changes are for the best) and the booklet included with all the comments about the production is worth for any fan of the series.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice first draft","review":"The story is uneven and slow in places. Some of the dialogue is stilted and the editing is non-existant. I found many typos and dialogue that was credited to the wrong character or not at all, leaving it uncertain who was speaking. One short paragraph was so badly mangled it made no sense at all.I have read a lot of Marion Chesney, both the romances and the M.C. Beaton mysteries. Parts of this book seemed to be written by someone else. The writing is not as strong and descriptive as Chesney usually is and some of the actions and dialogue do not fit the characters I have come to know from the first two books. The storyline itself is very slow and almost disappears for a while before finally returning to the mystery of the murder.Also, in this book, it is stated that Captain Cathcart forgot to give Lady Rose an engagement ring, however, in \\"Hasty Death\\" the ring was clearly given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of shadows of doubt","review":"This book is a good cozy read but I don't think Ms. Chesney wrote it. In the second book he gave her a ring and in this book it said that he didn't. Also, lets get these two together already. I am sick of their stupid lack of communication. This could be a great series if they just got married and solved mysteries like in the Pitt books by Anne Perry. My advise is wait for the paperback or use your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I'm not a big fan of this series, but since the books are small and breezy, I wanted to finish them. Sick of Shadows is my favorite in the series. Or, perhaps more accurately, it was the book I disliked the least. Here's why:*I liked that Rose and Daisy got to spend some time in the country with a new family. It did wonders for Rose's humanity.*Harry and Rose are finally taking steps to forming a real friendship and admiration.*The tone was a little more fast-paced which made for a better, more tightly written mystery. I found myself actually caring whodunit and that wasn't so for the previous books.*Harry's new Secretary, Ailsa. Who can't love a character like her? Even while gin soaked, she still manages to fend off bad guys with a gun. Love her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of M.C.Beaton and her \\"Agatha Raisin\\" and \\"Hamish MacBeth\\" series, so it was with great anticipation that ordered all three of her books, in hardcover, written under the name of \\"Marion Chesney\\". It's difficult for me to believe that they are written by the same author. The Chesney books lack the wit, the depth of character and plot, and the wonderful use of language in the M.C.Beaton books. The Chesney books are rather like reading the writings of a high school student....plot might be okay but there is no development of characters and the scenes are underwritten.After reading the first in the series, I continued to read, hoping they would improve. They did not.I am so disappointed. I will continue to read the books written by \\"M.C.Beaton\\" but won't spend the money on another \\"Marian Chesney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for any woman at any age","review":"I loved this book! First, we meet an unnamed person who is narrating the thoughts inside Gideon Rayburn's head as he arrived at Midvile Academy, a rich prep school where he probably wont fit in. He comes from a very middle class town in Virginia and ends up in a school where everyone has money and trust funds. Luckily, or unluckily, Gideon managed to befriend (or he thinks he has)his two roomates: Cullen, a bonafid ladies man and Nicholas, the silent sexy type. They make a bet for him to have sex with the plain Jane girl named Molly by Halloween. However, Gideon's hormones make him want Pilar, a sexy exotic rich girl from Brazil. All the while some girl is narrating his thoughs. Gideon is thrown into the world of rich prep school kids and he trys to fit in the best he can. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers all that it promises","review":"This book was sooooo interesting. Everything that goes on in Gid's head seems spot on to what a boy's mind could be like in reality. If not, who cares, because it was so exciting to read. It was hilarious. Also the mystery of not knowing who the girl inside his head is, really adds to the excitement.Just throwing this out there: The descriptions of Cullen and Nicholas were pretty good.And personally, the font used in the book, and the paragraph spacing was perfect.I can be easily turned off by font I don't like, but this one was good.Let's hope you think the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly a Waste of Time","review":"Okay, I admit it. I was intrigued with the plot of the book. The whole idea about being inside a guy's mind, knowing what he is thinking 24/7, is tantalizing. But this book is really a waste of time. No joke. I mean, an entire school of only beautiful girls? Anyone who finds this book \\"amazing\\" is seriously deprived. The characters are jerks, especially Gideon. Maybe I'm being too harsh and I am oblivious to what happens in the \\"real world\\" and in teenage life. But I have to say this book was trash. Completely predictable and unrealistic. Hey, anyone who likes reading this kind of fiction, go right ahead. But while you read it, just think of all the other productive things you could be doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book purchase review","review":"Good book, fast read would recommend to friends also had the book The Other Girl that was a continuance of this book.

Of course he can't read so he just looks at the pictures, but I have read a few pages here and there during the thousands of times we have looked at it, and it is actually pretty interesting! It discusses the conception of monster trucks, how Bigfoot really changed the whole thing and then how it turned from a novelty into more of a sport. It is a very informative book. And the photos are terrific.

This is improvisational jamming at it's purest form, with Jerry having some of his finest minute moments- free to pick- free to move- free to leave the realm of the ever-changing musical landscape at will. Venutian Blues is a true gem with the other 3 idyllic songs running a close behind. This is cosmic jamming folks- this is Jerry at liberty with what he loves to do best- plugging away at the guitar. He was truly a beautiful man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this trip","review":"It sounded as if the previous reviewer did not like this cd at all, yet they still gave it four stars. I am not as generous with stars.Most of the harmonic ideas Wales lays down here just sail over Jerry's head and he continues on with some rather directionless noodling. Yes, there are several minutes worth of mediocre moments on this cd, but generally speaking, it's playing like this that makes people think that Jerry was not a very good musician.For as incredible as Garcia was in the Grateful Dead in 1970, he's the exact opposite of that here.

It make statements about culture, society, and has many universal themes for all of mankind. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie","review":"I really, really loved this movie. It's one of the few movies I have seen lately where I could actually get attached to the characters, and to the plot. I loved Evan Adams' portrayal of Thomas. He was such a positive and endearing character. Also, Irene Bedard is one of my favorite actresses so in my opinion any movie she is in is a great one. Adam Beach gives a really good performance as Victor too. I would recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of what kind of movie you normally like. You get a good view of Native American culture, as well as a storyline that just about everyone can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"humor unlike any other","review":"Growing up on an Indian Reservation may have something to do with why I find this movie so great, but isn't it entirely. From the start of the movie with the KREZ radio station dj I was laughing- and yet at the same time the movie is very moving and has a \\"moral\\" to the story.

To have lived through the stereotypes he develops in his characters reminds me of the years I taught on the Spokane Indian Reservation.

As Alexie writes in his books...\\"there's a whole lot of love on the reservation...\\".

It is still nice to watch after not seeing it for years. The story is timeless, the acting and directing are fantastic. What I like about Smoke Signals is it's an original film about American Indians and it's not everyday you see movies about our people. It's like a breath of fresh air to watch this film. I catch myself looking in the background at glimpses of scenery of the the mountains and deserts I am so far away from. It gets me out of the hellhole of southern california that I'm in. I even like some of the background music they use in the scenes, it's soulstirring. I'm just glad I have Smoke Signals as part of my DVD collection again.

Native people love humor and friends, and it's a good study of how people who deal with terrible tragedies grow up and become who they are to be. Feel what Indian young people go through, learn a different kind of perspective, kind of sarcastic at times, but you know it's true to life and thats what a lot of us look for in a film; fun, cultural exploration, learning, feeling joy and deep hurts, sharing life with friends. Smoke Signals, shi k'is danolinigi, ayòò shi ya at'èèh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true take on native peoples","review":"I teach high school and often use this movie for students to understand some of the issues of native peoples. Its accuracy on gritty issues like alcoholism, high school drop-outs, absent fathers and early death is astonishing. But what brings me back is the hope in the power of the tale, the story, to both keep a history alive and to embellish it into the dream all their lives could be. These characters are not types, but flesh and blood native folks trying to navigate their own, as well as the white man's, highways. Lots of laughs and some tears, just like real life. Stunning in its poignant handling of a reality of which too many non-native peoples are simply ignorant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Native American Excellence","review":"Its hard to write the words that best describe this movie. What an emotional, honest, and respectful piece of work. Chris Eyre really shows his directional skills by composing a masterpiece. Not only do you become emersed in our main characters' journey, but you make your own memories as well. There aren't too many Native American-made movies out there, but this movie is truly among the best of them. It compares to 'Dances with Wolves' and 'Thunderheart' easily! Look for Chris' new movie, 'Skins,' out on DVD. A masterpiece and a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke Signals DVD","review":"I have been a fan of this movie for some time and was happy to have it in my collection... Shows how some Indians actually live on some reservations. Actually it reminds me of a reservation I visited out west in the mid 70's... It looked like a 3rd world country inside our country... Made me feel ashamed... Movie is a delight and has some funny moments in it as well as somber moments too. If you haven't seen, please do... The DVD was inexpensive and was shipped quickly and in new condition. I would buy from this Seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"One of the best movies I've seen.

I find this hard to believe, and just see this movie as a young man looking for the truth of his father. Sure this storyline is about the two Native Americans, but it is not hard to show how this same story could evolve in any type of lifestyle, or race. Overall, it is a great movie and shows how a young man comes to terms with his life, his fathers life, and his best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone with a father should see this movie without fail!","review":"If you relate at all to young men trying to grow up, this movie is for you.

Recorded in late 1989 in front of a small crowd (so small you can't barely call it a crowd), they seem totally unrehearsed: the drummer (who only played on this album) is sometimes off beat and Humungus makes mistakes one after another and almost forgets the lyrics of the songs. Even Humungus admits that this records is their worst one. It's a pity because when you look at the setlist it could have been a great album including all their classics.

He supports his arguments both with scientific evidence and with personal observations.Among my acquaintances I see a wide variety of diet styles from junk food aficionados to health conscious eaters to allergen obsessed orthorexics, and I could see this book, with its truly holistic perspective in choosing a diet to maximize overall well-being, being of interest to all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try Dr. Bratman","review":"I'm going to have to agree that we simply cannot achieve optimum health by accounting quantitatively and qualitatively every nutrient we place in our body.

The result would be to take back the billions of dollars lost by pharmaceutical companies to the natural-health movement. Having personally recovered from a disease thru elimination of processed foods, this issue is very personal to me.I often wonder what terrific perks Dr. Bratman receives from these same pharmaceutical companies for serving as their propaganda machine.

Something tells me Dr. Bratman is a University of Jamaica graduate.On a 'traditional' 'healthy' American diet: 5'9\\", high blood pressure (170/90), overweight 200#, hypercholesterolemia (210g/dl).Modified with drugs: Cholesterol: 200, bp 160/88, still high.Drug free on a vegan diet: weight 160, blood pressure 110/70, cholesterol 100.... and THOUSANDS of peer reviewed medical journals supporting veganism.I smile at the ignorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly stupid......","review":"So it is now a fixation to \\"obsess\\" about healthy food? This is the most stupid, irresponsible drivel i have ever heard of.Ok, let's NOT obsess about food, let's keep eating meat, and dairy, and preservatives, and chemicals, let's eat genetically modified food, let's NOT read labels, let's NOT think about what's in our food, let's keep getting diabetes, cancer and heart disease which NO DOCTOR has ANY CURE FOR!!! Just treatment, NO CURE. Let's do that. Because doctors are so good at curing diseases.

But than again, the process of new information developing is always characterized by two steps foward and one step back.This book is the one step back.If you feel that nutrition has no role in health or disease prevention, then this book is for you. But then again, why would you want to read it? If you enjoy finding out about the widening role food plays in regard to our emotions, health and vitality, you can forget about getting anything out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Dr. Bratman assumes that because he had some sort of eating problem, everyone else who eats in a healthy manner does as well.

I like erotic romance as much as the next person, and have enjoyed Susan Johnson's novels, however there was absolutely nothing erotic or romantic about this novel. The sex scenes had no spark, there was no fire between any of the characters, they just fall into bed with each other. This was definitely a case of telling without showing, and it's unfortunately a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"sex without meaning is no fun, or so my mother said....","review":"My mom always said that sex without meaning would be no fun, and it seems that Susan Johnson has proven her right. I love soft porn and some of Johnson's earlier books, but lately she's just been doing the sex parts and leaving out the \\"unnecessaries\\" like characterization, plot, motivation, etc. It just doesn't work. She's bringing it down to slot A and tab B."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This a rambling, disorganized waste of time. It's probably more approximates \\"Chick Lit\\" than a true appeal to a reader's hope for a romantic escape. Again Johnson displays poor characterization, overemphasis on sexual details, not quite believable \\"sex talk\\" and totally \\"modern\\" bitchy,women's libbers who delight in being with it and bashing all men. This is escape romance? Can I identify with any of the characters? No way! Would I want to be any one of them? Nope. Susan J. wrote wonderful books when she first published. I kept them all. Her writing has deteriorated into pages and pages of meaningless conversation between the protagonists and dirty details of sexual intimacy devoid of human feeling. Where is the foreplay both mental and physical? I will no longer buy any of her books!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If All You Want is a Little Steam...","review":"As an avid reader of romance and erotica, I can honestly say this has to be the worst combination of genres I've ever read. Notorious for her ability to inundate readers with multiple love - no,excuse me - sex scenes, Ms. Johnson has a devoted following; however, with her latest she has taken a bend in the road. Perhaps it's her age (no I'm not an anti-age, I enjoy Dorothy Garlock who is roughly the same age) or because she has not explored the contemporary world of romance enough, I'm not sure. I am sure Ms. Johnson not only left her novel unresolved (a BIG No-No in the romance genre), but left the reader having no empathy for any of her characters. Immature and beautiful; well-endowed and mysoginistic....need I say more?I would only recommend this novel to those who thumb through the pages looking for the \\"naughty\\" parts. There are many, and they are the only decent part of the book. I wish I'd done that, it would have saved me some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book I've read that has no PLOT!","review":"This is one of the first books I've read that didn't appear to have a ... PLOT. What the...? I guess having three couples to focus on triples the sex scenes, but there wasn't much substance to hold the story together and move the story along. What few obstacles were presented for the couples to overcome just petered out (no confrontation between Billy and Heather, a sister who, due to her need for therepy/detox delayed two of the characters from...having sex). I grew up near Ely. It was fun to recognize some landmarks, lakes, etc. But that was the sole enjoyment I got out of this book. Glad I checked it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!

I own all of them but I guess I am done purchasingthe new ones for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"But there's no plot!!","review":"Susan Johnson has done it again - soft porn without interest.

Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ewwwww","review":"This book was terrible! I enjoy a good romance mixed with a lot of passion, but this book failed on both accounts. There is no real plot to the story and someone must have poured cold water on the hot passion because it was sex, that read more like a how to guide, then a story. I tried finishing this book for 3 months, but could not do it. I had heard a lot of good things about Ms. Johnson's writing, but I am afraid to read the other books that I have of her's because of this book.

The author seemingly doesn't know what story she wants to tell and when she deviates from the main storyline you are left confused as to why she is boring you with anecdotal background that does little to help the story. I would rather suggest you read Batavia's Graveyard. A story of shipwreck and mutiny in which the background (The rise and operation of the Dutch East India Co.) is as interesting as the shipwreck itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressingly negative","review":"The author describes the history of Selkirk's life, including being marooned on an uninhabited islandfor four years and four months. Selkirk's contemporary Daniel Defoe made his story into the famous novel Robinson Crusoe. To round out her historical research, the author apparently took a brief trip to theisland itself, now part of Chile. I was disappointed with the author's consistently negative attitude. I can wellbelieve that Selkirk was an anti-social and violent man, and that the pirates he sailed with were greedy and cruel.But I at least hoped that the author would have a few positive things to say about the island that allowed Selkirk to live and thrive for so long. But no, even her description of the island as it is today dwells on the way the few inhabitants are despoiling the place. Only the book's few grainy B & W photographs hint at the fantasticbeauty of the island. Too bad the author apparently didn't enjoy the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even average","review":"This book I'd rate below average. Its really just a mess of conjecture. Although, to be fair, since Selkirk didn't keep journals, that really is all the author had to go on. I was disappointed by the lack of information regarding Selkirk's four years on the island. When it came down to it, we really only had less than a chapter that dealt with those years. Also, I read this book after having read Mike Dash's incredible effort, Batavia's Graveyard. If you're reading this review, I'd like to point you to that book instead. Dash truly is an inspired writer. Batavia is a gem. This book...not so much. Honestly, the only real reason I gave it two stars and finished it was because I paid for it. This book was better off out of print.

It delves heavily into the world of track and field. It was obvious Regina Jacobs was a cheat (who set a world records at 39 but then couldn't run in Sidney). God, I hate them all. They destroy it for every hard working dedicated athlete. The writing is a little disjointed at times, but well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tainted book - beware when reading!","review":"This book uses circumstantial evidence to incriminate and conclude that Barry Bonds took steroids, and that this cheating has been the sole reason for all his homeruns since 'allegedly' taking steroids. The book would lead you to believe that all of this has been proven in a court of law, and Barry Bonds is the worst and most dishonest athlete ever to have walked to planet. However, not only is the book poorly written, it mixes fact with fiction, and leads one to believe that there is a race issue underlying the Bonds incrimination.More important issues which are not addressed in the book include: would steroid use really help him hit more home runs? Does more muscle equal more distance on a flying baseball? What is the chance that he did not actually use steroids - if you really want something to be true you can throw together all the circumstantial evidence you want, but that doesn't mean it is so."},{"rating":"2","title":"*GOODBYE MR ASTERISK*","review":"FINALLY THIS FRAUD IS PUT IN HIS PLACE!HANK AARON IS THE LEGIT HOME RUN KING.BARRY, SAMMY, MARK, JOSE, RAFAEL...WE DON'T NEED YOU!BYE-BYE LIAR AND FRAUD BONDS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged","review":"Seemed to drag on and on.

What I got what not what I expected. Bonds is the centerpiece of the book, but the authors also dig into the formation of Balco and the personal lives of Victor Conte and Greg Anderson as well as other people and athletes who were associated with Balco.I thought the authors did a terrific job of setting the events in precise order, from Victor Conte's humble beginnings to the recruitment of various track stars like Marion Jones and then into Barry Bonds. The book was detailed and well written, giving the reader a clear understanding of Balco and the men behind the scandal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Researched Very Well","review":"The authors researched their topic very well and are to be admired for their effort to break the scandal.

Much of the info is from grand jury testimony. Some of the other info is less objective and questionable though, like the interviews with Bond's girlfriend and other associates who clearly have axes to grind. The book doesn't exclusively focus on Bonds. Rather it focuses on Victor Conte and it alternates chapters focusing on the track and field athletes who have been caught up in this mess.

The Sports Illustrated excerpt has just about everything in it already. Bonds takes up may 1/3 of the book.

You already heard what Bonds' ex-girlfriend said, and there's nothing more in the book about her. The \\"leaked\\" testimony... if you followed the story, you already know it.

This is not investigative journalism but a witchhunt of someone who doesn't throw a bone to such media persons. The irresponsible and insensitive way that the private life of a black athlete, going for a hallowed record, has been laid bare is a shame and a blot on investigative journalism. These authors are out to make a fast buck, at the cost of someone else, with sensationalism and no regard for others' character assasination -- a classic trait of Yellow Journalism made famous by the British tabloids. In short, it's a book written by shadowy journalists who have no conscience and regard for real investigative journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A JOKE","review":"Clearly some fact checking needs to be done.

Tagtrem pulls it off perfectly in a few tracks.Think Hypocrisy trick is to have enough melody and structure to make the sound hold together yet still be heavy.

It is a testament to the group's vocal talent and Brian Wilson's unique creativity that through multiple album reissues and boxed sets, right up through 1999's \\"Endless Harmony\\", they never ran out of worthy material. Consider the bottom of the barrel to have now been struck. Honestly, how many versions of \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" and \\"Surfin' USA\\" do I really need to own? It's unlikely that even the most diehard Beach Boys fan will find themselves listening to this more than once or twice. The only thing of real interest here is the \\"Vegetables\\" section.

Demos, outtakes and beautiful a cappella versions of songs we know and love (and some we don't know but still love).

Every other version (including the newly remastered \\"Smiley Smile\\" version) sounds like it was recorded in a bathtub and engineered with a Fisher Price tape recorder. Should they have gone past 1972 and given us demos from \\"Love You\\" and beyond? Yes, but buy lots of copies of this compilation, tell your friends, and maybe, just maybe, Brian, Mike and the rest of the boys will have another urge to go back to the vaults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for the true fans","review":"Im sick of all these so called 'fans' that cannot find any value in this collection or dont understand the value in listening to instrumental-only beach boys tracks.

This is for us who own ALL the albums, know every part by heart, and have marvelled to the musical genious of Brian Wilson as well as the vocal abilities of the beach boys.

If your tolerance for Wall Street's volatility is running out or if you wish to fortify your portfolio against a worldwide crash, you would be well-advised to look into these crash-proof investments."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Safe and Profitable Investment","review":"If no-risk is as much risk as you're willing to absorb, you should know about a unique, tax-free annuity that's completely private, in a country world renown as a bastion of safety and privacy. What's more, the profits are guaranteed by the nation's government. Hold it in any currency you choose -- Swiss francs, German marks, U.S. dollars -- and change whenever you wish, as often as you like. Over the last 25 years, this strong, safe annuity averaged over 10% yield annually. That yield, combined with currency gains, would have turned a $50,000 investment in 1971 into $633,100 today; a 955% gain -- with absolutely no risk.

From the first track to the last one, this album is GREAT! And even much more... The guitar is punky, the drums are hypnotic, the singer's (Mr Perry Farrel himself) voice is heart-whirling and the bass is hip-moving. In a whole, this album is unique and obsessing. Listen to it once and you'll be addict for the rest of your life. Sincerely, eyes closed in your best chair or jumping wild on the dance floor, you will be moved by Jane's. I've listened to a lot of music, different styles, different bands, but no one has ever given me the wish of jumping over the sun (cause the moon is clearly not high enough) but this very album from this very band.

The pace is slowed down for 'Jane Says' with Farell's identifying beach sound, it always reminds me of long, summer evenings (well I can dream...). Standing in the Shower Thinking is pure brilliance and I always get an irrisistable urge to dance when it is on.

I love the hard-hitting lyrics: they tell the truth without preaching to the audience. The music is just as hard-hitting, with the lead singers voice carrying us through the whole album and the music holding its own weight as well.As a special bonus, the two Spanish tracks at the end flow with the rest of the music, as they are versions of two songs on the album. The lyrics hold up even when translated and are well-put in both languages.If you decide to buy this CD, you won't be disappointed at all with any of the songs.

Collins was a modest success in the country music field, having a handful of hits in 1954 and 1955, and then having one more hit in 1966. After Buck had made it big, he decided to pay tribute to his former boss by recording an album of his songs in 1963, although it's likely that many country music fans had forgotten Collins by then, since he hadn't had a hit in eight years. Anyway, these are good songs, many of them humorous, and Buck does a good job with them. Somewhat surprisingly, Buck doesn't cover Tommy's biggest hit, \\"You Better Not Do That\\". \\"It Tickles\\" is a duet between Buck and his ex-wife, Bonnie Owens (she plays the girls who say that his mustache tickles when he kisses them). This is not an essential Buck Owens album by any means, but it's a solid album that his fans should enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Coast Country from 1963","review":"In the mid 1950's Buck was an unknown singer who landed work playing guitar on recording sessions for artists at Capitol records. One of those artists was Tommy Collins who had a string of hits back then. This album was a tribute to a friend and mentor. It contains no hits but is well worth the listen. Many of these songs are full of humor and heartache. The perfect blend for a great country album.

It is a good way to protect the slides, but since the plastic that makes them up is kind of thin, you can expect the three holes (for the binders) to eventually wear if you are flipping them often.

The edge is gone. The originality is gone. The social consciousness has drifted away into self-absorption. Has success spoiled Catie? Has she been co-opted somehow? Let's hope that it's just a phase or creative rebuilding. In the meantime, if you haven't heard Catie before, look to her first outings, not the latest two CDs. \\"My Shirt Looks Good on You\\" is, let's face it, boring, despite one good cut in \\"Walk Along the Highway.\\" Even a song co-penned with the riveting Mary Gauthier is not strong.

Basically, I have nothing to add to the criticisms already in other reviews. Just as noted in other reviews, it doesn't want to make coffee, it just wants to blink all its lights (not mentioned in the instruction book). When you get it to make coffee, it puts waaaay too much water in the espresso, and the program function to change the amount of water it puts in doesn't change a thing.I sent it back, and I am hoping for a seamless refund to my credit card.I think the point is that you can't get a good espresso machine for such a low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse by the month","review":"This machine had a lot of promise and was great to begin with. Then with each passing month something went wrong. Slower to steam and now it just gives a squirt before it stops dripping out the coffee.

Go for low tech, fixable unit, if one is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good espresso but flawed design","review":"This is my second machine in ~1 month, the first was returned because the overflow tray started to jam. The second machine now has the same problem. As mentioned in other reviews, this tray fills up very fast. There's a nozzle that dispenses hot water directly into the tray towards the back of the machine (not sure why). I think what is happening is that the hot water bows the plastic tray slightly but enough to cause jamming. By jamming, I mean I have to pull so hard to slide the tray out that I'm afraid I'll break it. This is not just a minor annoyance since you'll have to turn the whole machine upside down in the sink to empty the tray. Hopefully, my experiences were the exception and not the rule, or this problem can be avoided by emtying out the tray more frequently. Me personally, I expect a machine to be idiot-proof. Thankfully I bought mine at Bloomingdale's so returning it will be easy. I would not recommend ordering this machine online."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisy, rattly, and doesn't work","review":"Judging from the other reviews, this product is a lemon. Even the one guy who's happy says he's on his second machine -- had to box & ship the first one up. Batting .500 Krups isn't good enough.We were satisfied for a decade or more with our low-end steam-driven Krups machines. They've lowered their manufacturing standards on those, so now they only last us about 6 months before needing replacement. We thought we'd upgrade-- mistake. $250 for the frustration of blue blinking lights, water dumping into some tray underneath and overflowing, and the knowledge that in the end I'll have to clean it up, put it in a box and ship it somewhere.Really disappointing, Krups. I've gone back to making coffee in a paper-cup filter. Sad, after so many years relying on Krups for 3+ cups a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups could have done better","review":"This product performs poorly. Within 1 month of receiving it, water no longer flowed through the coffee. After complaining to Krups, sending it for repairs and finally getting a replacement, I am still not very happy with it. The frothing part is unpredictable in its creation of quality foam. Krups did better with their older model of this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picky machine but it makes good coffee","review":"This is the first espresso machine I have owned so I have no other product to compare it to. So far I have been happy with my Krups, although I have already had to replace the gasket once. The machine seems to be VERY picky about when it will and will not pull shots. If the espresso is not loaded just right it refuses to pull the shot, which causes water pressure to build up (this is how the gasket broke). Bottom line: the coffee tastes great, however, sometimes making the coffee can be a bit of a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I have returned this item TWICE. Their tray is not pulling out, so you have to -suck- out the water from it. It doesn't hold all types of coffee, sometimes I had water coming out from the sides, or straight into tray. And I suspect that the pressure is not sustainable because I'm getting different results - sometimes coffee is good, sometimes you just can't drink this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"This machine worked fine for the first week. After that however, it has been spotty at best. The frother does not work at all. It does not heat the milk properly and makes minimal froth. Even making a cup of espresso has become a crap-shoot. The pre-programmed amounts (single, double shots)give different amounts of water each time and more times than not, I've had to push the button several times to make one cup of espresso. The tray underneath fills with water constantly. I had a Krups machine for 10 years prior to buying this one. I want my old one back. This is garbage. Do not waste you money.P.S. Its noisy and rattles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This machine will break!!","review":"My husband purchased this espresso machine for me and I was thrilled at first. It worked well for just shy of 2 months, then broke. The water would no longer draw up into the filter it would only drain into the drip tray. We exchanged it for the exact same model and the new one was worse! We followed the instructions to prime it before the first use the night we received it and turned it off without making coffee. Luckily I smelled something funny before going to bed or else my house may have burned down! Internally the machine didn't turn off and it over-heated so badly that it scorched my counter and warped the plastic on the top and sides! The second machine never made a cup of coffee... We promptly returned that one as well and decided to purchase a different machine entirely! Please don't waste your money on this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"We returned the Krups XP4050 after several attempts to use it. We faithfully followed the directions, priming it three times just using water and we even called the help line. We ended up with hot water spraying everywhere as though the pump wasn't able to force the water up through the machine. It made a lot of noise. When we finally did try it with actual coffee, it was no better. The steamer did not heat the milk, half the water still ended up in the collection space below the carafe, and the steam spewed out all over us. Perhaps we needed lessons but, being that my husband is Italian and a professor of mathematics, we thought we should be able to purchase a product, read the instructions and make it work. We have returned to our little stove top espresso maker used in almost every home in Italy and wonder why we ever thought of spending this kind of money on a yuppie espresso machine in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Machine worked for 2 months and then water stopped pumping through the machine.

Or the fact so many people beleived what the Bush administration was spinning.It would seem that many of the people who panned this book didn't read it. Which is typicall of the far right. They want so to beleive that the Bushes didn't mislead them. Even in the face of such damning evidence that they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Title, Mediocre Book","review":"It's a shame that a book about story and spectacle would be so poorly structured and without message. The book has a fantastic title but is otherwise a complete waste. Rich is very endemic of the problem that critics of Bush has - they want to paint him both as a Machiavellian genius and completely incompetent at the same time. The reality is much simpler and more in need of telling - his leadership style created incentives to be dishonest and manipulative and he was incapable of being aware enough to admit their was a problem. It makes for a bad presidency and boring books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary stuff","review":"Rich starts out saying his book isn't meant to be a harangue on the Bush administration then proceeds to do just that, which would be lots of fun if it weren't so frightening and dangerous. I enjoyed reading it on one level, I learned some things and I could enjoy finding agreement with someone on the Bush Administration, but I didn't enjoy the sad truth of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatest Story Ever SOLD","review":"I got this book, \\"The Greatest Story Ever SOLD\\" , for my ex-husband and don't know if he even read it, so I don't know how to rate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Story","review":"A thorough and entertaining story of the art of misleading the public by those we trusted. Reads almost like a novel although it is well-documented non-fiction. Frank Rich is wonderfully readable with a difficult subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"Having read only 25 pages, I couldn't take it anymore. This book was written to hate on everything America is about. Besides the constant attacks at President Bush in every other sentence, Rich criticizes the troops, our own country, and many other things that will make your spine tingle. It is ridiculous how biased and narrowminded he is; it is almost as if he set out to tear apart a president who was forced to lead our country through several difficult times (and led well, I might add). Rich has absolutely no respect. I can see how liberals would love this completely left-wing book, so go ahead and read if it pleasures you, but for anyone who has common sense and doesn't want to spend hours reading a book that is poorly worded and full of mindless, partisan analysis, I urge to to refrain from coming within 100 yards of this book. And if you do, throw it in the trash. Or better yet, burn it. That's what I'll be doing soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Obligatory Political Hit Piece","review":"I only read this because I got it for free from a raving lunatic fiend (SP friend) who blames Bush for everthing from global warming to a establishing a conspricy using CIA suicde bombers on 911 to fly planes into the twin towers so he can win reelection in 2004. Our agreement was he would in turn read a copy of Liberal Facism (which was burned with out a second thought). The features the obligatory half truths and contradictions so often associated with these types of political hit pieces and clearly demonstrates to any individual capable of reasoned thought what is wrong with our culture. We are allowing and even encouraging the insane among us to shape our thought and actions. If we listed to garbage like this regardless of ideology we deserve what we get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sarcasm","review":"Too much sarcasm from start to finish. It's a far-left view of the Bush administration where author Frank Rich seems to be visibly upset at any Republican administration. He uses references to Jon Stewart's, The Daily Show along with Saturday Night Live numerous times to back his opinions on current political events. In my view, an author of his age background and experience should not have written this farcical, liberal montage of jabs at the office of the President of the United States. Better luck next time Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum...","review":"Nothing new here. Not a surprise that it just eked out Noam Chomsky on the best seller list...I'm sure Chavez picked up a copy of this tome as well (great minds...etc).

I do think the author is all wrong in his Katrina analysis, but that's me. Most bi-partision econominist & financial players don't credit presidental policy that much for the direction of the economy. (Well maybe their tax policy makes one feel all warm and comfortable at night depending on your politics.) What comes around goes around. Anyway, i am still waiting for the democratic options & alternatives besides all this Bush psyco-hate? Why is the author so in denial about the world wide radical islamic threat? You know it's alright to losen some legal chains for liberal policies and not for protecting the USA and preventing another or worse 9/11. How about some thoughtful and reasoned anaylsis, argument and less inflamnatory demo-skulduggery, but that does not impress or sell books i suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read The Timeline After The Epilogue","review":"A bit of a polemic, but well worth reading.The 80+ page timeline is a chronological history of what the Bush team KNEW on one side of the page, superbly documented. On the other side of each page, Rich produces what the Bush team SAID. The differences are dramatic. This administration obviously has no respect for the intelligence of the US electorate.How did the Bush team manage to sell its agenda, especially the war, when the lies were so transparent (at least in retrospect)? That is the theme of this book, and Rich suggests the media and Congress have to bear some of the blame.I'm reminded of a book [I didn't read] from the Nixon era. It was called \\"The Selling of a President\\" and had a Marlboro cigarette pack on the front cover. I guess some things never change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vingate Rich","review":"If you enjoy Rich's column, you'll love this book. If you don't, you may not like it, but you will certainly get an interesting perspective from reading this. And I think that in the end, the book is as hard or harder on the press as it is on the White House. The story that too many have missed here is how the media has gone along with \\"Mission Accomplished\\" and the like for far too long. Rich nails it -- and does so in a way that is consistently funny.I see that a lot on the right have showed up to trash this book and keep its ratings down. I think they're barking up the wrong tree. Rich is more media critic than partisan. And if there's one thing the left and right should agree upon, it's that our media needs fixing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading for every American","review":"Meticulously detailed facts, along with shocking revelations about the mainstream media bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Left Wing New Media Traitor of the YSA","review":"More Left Wing Liberal News media hate fest rhetoric based on rearrangement of the facts to suit the conclusion. Yes Bush led the country to war and yes Iraq is troublesome and problematic on many levels. But we are in fact at war with a determined enemy out to destroy our culture and make us all worship and worse yet act a certain way. And even worse yet writers like Mr. Rich are helping that come true. I definitley did agree with the authors conclusions and accusations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this \\"sale\\"","review":"Same old, same old. Rich hates Bush and hates America. I'm tired of hearing it and this book provides nothing new, just the same old finger pointing bulliness that has defined the left. I wanted solutions in this book, didn't get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"HORRIBLE BOOK FOR THE BUSH DITTOHEADS","review":"This is one terrible book for the Bush dittoheads. The neocondriacs have written bad reviews accusing Frank Rich as a liar. Besides, their bible are the books of Coulter, Hannity, Limbaugh, O'Reilly et al. Anything that was written by people who exposes the lies and deceits of the Bush administration are just plain BASHING to these neocondriac dittoheads. I bet they haven't even read this book yet they're already bashing it. Most neocons don't read books who criticize their God (Bush), and they almost always attack the messenger instead of the message. What a bunch of ingots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"marketing the white house","review":"having recently finished rich's book i was surprised at the average rating it had received on amazon. with the reviews divided either 5 stars or 1 it became clear some of the reviews were based more on loyalty to bush than objectivity to the facts. unlike the negative reviews of the rich book, the author presents a solid listing of facts and real events to illustrate the current administration in washington. it is true that rich's book is clearly anti-bush but that might be due more to the performance of bush than the presentation by rich. you can accuse rich of poor manners when he calls bush a \\"spoiled brat\\" but you cannot argue with his assessment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just about the seller, but the buyer","review":"Missing in most of these reviews is recognition that Rich is not just concerned here with the creation of a fictional case for war to \\"create our own reality,\\" as a member of the Bush Administration candidly put it, but with the tacit acceptance of the screenplay by the news media. Unfortunately, Rich makes the point far better in his lectures than in this book, which is its main weakness.The Administration fed misinformation to the press, including famously the NY Times, than cited that misinformation to justify its actions. Editors rolled over, the national networks cheered, and what we have is Iraq. Bush did not invent stage management, Rich said in Portland several weeks ago, he and his coterie simply used it more effectively than others before him and with more disastrous results. There is nothing, he said, to prevent the next Administration, Republican or Democrat, from doing exactly the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The evidence is clear","review":"The vitriole with which conservatives are attacking this book serves to validate the content so much more than the book ever could on its own.

Next time, I will make sure to inquiry about authenticity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuff Like That, my review from Barcelona;Really great stuff","review":"I like 'Joe Guitar Hughes' mainly when he plays Blues and this 'Stuff Like That' is a good live Blues record, because this journeyman Texas soul Bluesman steps out from his usual role as a sideman for Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland to deliver an excellent Blues album, taking on the main guitar and vocal duties. This is a top-notch album that besides good Blues conclude with an interview track with JOE. The anecdotal thing is that audience present in this performance are the engineers who know their business and JOE plays with enthusiasm to them. All the themes are very good, first class Blues, even the instrumental Blues version for a Soul song \\"When a man loves a woman\\". I recommend it and I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooke Allison debuts with a mess","review":"She's blonde, with a waistline most girls throw up their food for, but can she sing?

I love that they've made their ancient ways work with (instead of against) the modern world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unique Approach","review":"This is a very colorful documentary that instructs about Buddhism--history and culture--and more specifically the life of Buddhist monks, through interviews with monks and those who practice multiple religions, but have an affinity for Buddha."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I like this more than my child does!","review":"I absolutely love this book.

Good read aloud book for teachers in grades K-2. Only problem is that Ms. Galloway has totally ripped off another author names Andrew Clements, a famous name in children's literature. The book is a carbon copy of Big Al and Galloway should be held in contempt for a brazen steal of an idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"One of the best books I have read recently. The plot is sustaining; the language spare and brilliant. This author must be a poet!Mr. Hamamura shares a time in history most of us prefer to forget -- the discrimination against Asians, the relocation camps, and what Japanese/Americans experienced as they fought against their relatives in Japan. All of this told through the life of a young boy who reaches manhood. I appreciated the sensitivity and compassion of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic account of the Japanese American Experience","review":"This sweeping account of the Japanese American experience was educational, engrossing, and wonderfully illustrative of our experience. The community should be proud of John's accomplishment with this novel. I shared it with clients, friends, family who are always interested in learning about what it can be like to be Japanese American in the U.S."},{"rating":"1","title":"just OK","review":"This book held a lot of promise but didn't deliver for me. A lot of the potential plot developments such as the treatment of the Japanese in the camps and the terrible prejudice shown them during the war are glossed over. The author's use of words is compelling but he too often uses them to make scenes that are very contrived and just corny. The main characters are unbelievable in their perfection. Sam excels at everything he does and if there's an emergency Sam will swoop in to save the day. In spite of the shortcomings, I enjoyed the book. I just wish it had been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life At A Distance","review":"This book focuses on the lives of two Japanese characters who attempted to create a family together in the midst of World War II. Author John Hamamura tells this story as a painter would, scattering colors onto a canvas-- seemingly haphazardly-- until they take a meaningful shape. Some important historical elements receive almost no focus, some subplots appear to have no lasting impact... but then you finish the book. You realize that you did so in less than a day, without regret. You understand that this was not a book about two people falling in love, but a book about two lives merging and continuing on afterward. It is an illustration of their lives as we ourselves would see our own, with some moments being more vibrant, more memorable, than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed","review":"I love this book. I did not want to put it down, but I did not want it to end, at the same time. This is a very harsh and true story of war, love, growing up and values that make us , written in a magical way. Going back and forth between the real world and the msytical atmosphere that the author created I had a very pleasant and satisfying reading. Thank you Mr.Hamamura."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just guitars!","review":"Mike has made this Album playing all instruments. That is not so very unusual.

It plays back ok on my cd-rom, but would not do so on regular cd players. I know it has to be the disc because my other cd-rw (not Memorex) plays back ok on all disc players I have.

However, he's had similar problems and said if I had problems to bring 'em back for a refund.Well...I took 'em back for a refund. Once used, the two discs I burned were incapable of accepting new files and refused to delete existing files.Memorex is offering shoddy products that are clearly mislabled. Look at the reviews here: 37 out of 40 are one-stars!What else does anyone need to know?One hint I'll share: reportedly if you leave a defective Memorex RW disc in the sun for 15 minutes on a side, it might function as advertised.

We sure miss you Ben."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time great golf book","review":"This book was loaded with hilarious tales and net insight into the world of golf. I felt like I was behind the scenes with all of the players and stars. Ben Wright is funny and I miss his voice on golf TV, but reading this book brought back his dry wit and amazing knowledge. I didn't want the book to end, because it was one neat tale after another...some of them unbelieveable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bounces, Bad read","review":"Wright's tales are stupendous, but to the point of being absurd. This is one of the few books in years that I finally just put down.

I liked Wright as a commentator but leave this book on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the bounces were good","review":"Ben Wright does a superb job in taking mere golfing mortals behind the scenes of some famous, and some not so famous, tournaments to give an insight into LIFE in the golfing world. It is a page turner that had me howling with laughter as he strips bare the mystique behind both golf broadcasting and some of the peripheral characters that add to the colour of the sport. Of course in the true style that has endeared him to so many he also takes a few swipes at some brighter lights in the business of golf. Wright has an obvious deep love for the game but he does not let sentimentality get in the way of a good story. I am sure that he must have a stock of untold tales waiting to be let out of the closet and I look forward to the next installment from this very funny, very English and very lovable raconteur."},{"rating":"1","title":"bring Ben back please","review":"I emplore CBS to bring Ben back to its broadcasts so he won't have time to write any more books.

There are so many stories of Wright being in or near every significant golf event in history, I thought I was reading the Forrest Gump story. Plus, he went on and on with adolescent glee about how many times he, Pat Sunnerall and others were so drunk, thrown out of restaurants and hung over that one wonders how CBS ever put on a golf telecast. However, there were some interesting insights to numerous Ryder Cup matches.Most people who read this book are looking for Wright's version of the infamous Joanne Carner/ Valerie Helmbreck story, but the aftermath was somewhat anticlimatic.Then there are Wright's vicious attacks on Gary McCord, while all the time claiming to be his friend. I guess fate evened this out, as McCord is still broadcasting and entertaining, while Wright labors in obscurity; accent and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Overdue!!!","review":"I'd forgotten how adorable Webster was.

To be sure, \\"Wildfire\\", \\"Carolina In The Pines\\", and \\"Cherokee Fiddle\\" are included, although you might find those on a number of other collections. What sets this apart are some tunes that have only been available a time or two before, and, in one case, on no MMM collection (Thom Schuyler and Paul Overstreet's wonderful \\"A Long Line Of Love\\"). Some of you may have most of these already, but the updated arrangements are more than worth the price of admission here, and this is certainly a welcome addition to my collection.

If this is the last book (not saying it is I'm not sure) then I must confess, I, as a reader, am not satisfied. There are a few matters that were not tied together to my liking, though this does not effect the quality of the book, just the story as a whole (from book 1 the short story in Cravings to book 2). I felt more appeased at the end of book 1 than at the end of 2. Here is hoping this isn't the end. If you are still debating on this book, pick it up, its worth the price tag.

Sorry, but I know all good books have many people involved including caregivers, babysitters, friends, neighbors and all the publishing house employees down to the typist.Okay, so I went on. I have been tolerating her bad language, but then she had to insert a very graphic sex scene that just turned me off.

The first book was funny and enjoyable, which was why I got the second book, Undead and Unemployed. When is Betsy going to grow up? Her airheaded antics suggest someone with serious developmental issues. Her sarcastic attitude just isn't very funny anymore. She's had three months to get used to being a vampire (and her crime fighting suggests that she's putting her new skills to good use), but her attitude towards Sinclair and the whole vampire crowd is very off-putting. And what's up with her insistence in the Epilogue about being poor--I thought she had the wealth of three dead vampires. Did the author make a mistake? In summary, I was hoping for some character development, but I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LIFE CHANGING MUST READ","review":"If you follow the plan which Frank Somma has set aside for you and me, this book will change your life.

However, I was disappointed because the book comprises of independent chapters authored by different experts. As a result, the chapters repeated themselves slightly (because the authors wrote independent of each other)and within each chapter, the authors did not delve deep enough into each subject. The tone was not sympathetic to a layman pet owner, but curiously neither was it technical enough for a practising veterinarian -- I think the editors just didn't do a good job.

While making her point, she seemed to be defending Richard Nixon and I felt she was trying to be an advocate in his defense. It would have been more convincing if she had spent her time simply laying out the case against Clinton and left it at that. After all, her book did say it was the case against Bill Clinton.I couldn't get past the first few chapters. I kept thinking it would get better, but it didn't. I tried to get through the entire book and did a pretty good job. I had to quit at Chapter 18; Wampumgate.

This reviewer does not attempt to dispute that, but I do believe that failing to acknowledge likewise behavior from her side of the political spectrum as well creates a hypocritical stance. This rhetoric is the common bail-out answer of pundits on both sides of the political spectrum. This is nothing more than RNC propaganda, and I'm sure it'll be followed up by someone as equally sophomoric on the left.

I studied Constitututional Law in college, and can find nowhere that a President who lied to a Federal Grand Jury shouldn't be impeached.

She also turns a blind eye toward recent Republican presidents. Bush I was a documented adulterer. Bush II has more crimes on public record than they were ever able to find through years of looking into Whitewater, and would probably have spent time in prison if he were not so well connected. Reagan and Bush I committed far worse crimes against the constitution during Iran Contra and elsewhere.This book is completely unimportant when it comes to any kind of scholarship or even basic intelligence.

Coulter is looking for someone to blame, and being conservative she found Clinton to be a shining target. The book goes on and on about moral issues - expecting people to understand the built in shame of the author as if everyone is so afraid of life. I would advise the avoidance of this book just because it is so restrictive to living life.

Coulter uses the Federalist Papers very well to give the reader an understanding of what the Founding Fathers considered an impeachable offense.

Such double standards. As you can see, I have a great number of issues with George Bush and I could write a book in the same vein that Ann Coulter wrote about Bill Clinton and it would be just as good. Maybe even better.

Her constant use of the term \\"the framers\\" (in lieu of the Founding Fathers) and various forms of the word \\"pervert\\" for Clinton got old very fast. She also couldn't decide if Clinton \\"molested\\" interns or had affairs with them (two very different actions). At times, her book seemed more like a tabloid than an investigation into the alleged crimes of the former President.In her defense, she tries to do a thorough job by sifting through all the scandals and supposed cover-ups.

Thank you, Ann."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Summary","review":"A little smart-alecky for its own good sometimes, and sometimes drawing some probably unfair conclusions, this book is still the best summary of all the Clinton scandals until 1998. And oh my, were there a lot of meat to those scandals. It's a startling reminder of just how much substantiated fact was involved with the Clinton allegations compared to the allegations that the left just can't seem to make stick on Bush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clinton Administration a mirror of things to come","review":"The funny thing is that I have recently re-read this book and it seems that Clinton would be far more desirable then what we have now. I think that goes to show just how bad the Obama administration really is. Clinton is shown to be the liar and the pig that he really is. Even when witnesses were relunctant to testify against him and told the truth Clinton made darn sure that the trashed them publically. Coulter as ususal footnotes everything and has her facts in line. The bad thing is that the book will appeal to rational and logical people which excludes the majority of liberals.If you really want to know what the Clintion administration was like then this is a great book. The sad thing is that it is awful to realise that we have even an worst one now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this book if you are faint of heart","review":"This is an exceptionally enlightening book, not just about the most ethically challenged administration in the history of this country, but also about the political, legal and historical context of the process of impeachment itself. It is quite an eye-opener when we read about some of the impeachees of the past and what little thay had to do wrong to be ousted and contrast them with the overwhelming pattern of abuse perpetrated by Clinton which we are supposed to excuse. Coulter makes a very reasoned case of the appalling realities about Clixon. Whether you support or oppose him, the evidence against him is irrefutable. Coulter has exposed a scary side of this administration and offered the constitutional cure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Convincing Case","review":"The lovely Ann Coulter has made a very convincing case for why Bill Clinton should have been impeached and removed from office in this book. I am a conservative, but surprisingly liberal on some social issues, so I definitely not a member of Hillary's \\"right-wing conspiracy,\\", and I have a lot of respect for the office of the President, regardless of which party is currently holding it. However, I do believe that Clinton's multitude of scandals, particularly the sordid Lewinsky affair, have degraded the standards of the office, perhaps irrevocably. Coulter's books has strongly reinforced that opinion. I am docking the book one star for an offensive reference to assassination and the fact the Coulter is sometimes a bit repetitive in her arguments (this book could have been about 50 pages shorter with some tighter editing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK VERY MUCH.

There were things in the book I did not even know Clinton did. Illegal and immoral things. Coulter shows Clinton has done nothing worthwhile for America while committing his own high crimes and misdemeaners. It's a shame Clinton was allowed to wreak havoc on this great country, but it's better that people like Ann Coulter expose people like him.

It's interesting to note that she does not hold the Republicans to the same moral standard. In my book, lying that sends thousands to their death and costs the public billions of dollars is far worse than lying to save your marriage.

The sections on how physically demanding the trek to Everest is were interesting. Amid all the IMAX films and articles, I'd forgotten what an amazing feat of the human body this is. It's very historical too, and hearing about the forgotten people who came before Sir Edmund Hillary was a treat. Coming from someone who has hiked up Everest himself, it makes the book all the more rewarding and fascinating. The author has been in all of these frozen, dangerous places!

The over-the-ear hook is too thick to share space with my glasses and made my ear sore. The function button is too small and very fiddly - hard to press without jamming the speaker even further into my ear, which brings me to the third problem: The protruding speaker pushed the tragus forward and made it sore too.

They'll just have to get over it, because I can't deal with a sore ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality bluetooth technology","review":"I am not 100% satisfied with the product that I purchased. Plantronics Explorer 320 Bluetooth Headset is reasonablly priced but the product itself is not a stellar product. Ever since i've owned the bluetooth wireless device I have had many calls dropped due to weak signals and static. I also have a big problem with the comfort of the device on your ear lobe. Wearing the product for more than 3 hour intervals will leave your ear's sore because of the insertable earpiece.Overall, the product is not something to rave about or invest money in.

The annoying static occurs even when I have the phone on my hip, and you can't walk from room to room without the interference getting loud. The volume is also VERY LOW..I had to yell and repeat things 2-3 times to my caller, who also complained about a bad connection. This Plantronics Explorer 320 was priced better than the ill-fitting Motorola H500, so I gave it a try, and was pleased with the quick pairing, and secure fit on my ear, but the static was too much to bear...alas, I'm returning this to Best Buy ASAP, and sticking with my wired earpiece from Jabra, which is quite dependable.

This may be more a reflection on my SE 520a than on the headset though. Otherwise, sounds great! I don't even keep it turned all the way up, because that is TOO loud. I do notice a little bit of crack/hiss if I am near a wifi transmitter, but only if I am within about 15 feet of it.Comfort is fine for me, but I have not worn it for more than 3 hours continuously yet. I wear glasses, and this headeset is fitting just fine.I think it feels very secure on my ear, and, unlike my old headset, I have never once had an urge to make a phantom grab at what feels like a slipping headset.Battery life is slightly less then stated specs, but close enough that I can't complain.Windy conditions are so-so, but I don't think any headset is going to work well through the Great Lake gusts we get here, so I can't complain about that.For the price, I am extremely happy with this headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really impressed","review":"This is my first experience with using a bluetooth headset. I've had my 320 now for 2 weeks and I don't like it. I love the idea of handsfree wireless, but I have to keep the phone so close to my headset that its almost pointless. While driving, I have to put the phone on my door's armrest or I'll lose signal. In my home office, I leave my phone on the desk, but if I move away, say to the printer 8 feet from my desk, I get really bad break up.I'm considering a return and perhaps replacing it.

I bought it because it was relatively cheap and lightFirst the good: LOUD. I could get the volume loud enough to be uncomfortable. The volume is easily adjusted. Also the micraphone is clear and people said they could hear me very clearly.Now the bad: The head set would loose it's pairing with the phone frequently. This of course would require re-pairing it. Not a burdensom thing but a bit of a bother.(I have never had to re-pair with the headset that replaced this one)There is a great deal of static that I do not experiance with the replacement head set.IT HURTS THE EAR. The part that fits in ot the ear is large and hard edged and after about a 1/2 an hour it starts to hurt. There is no option fro a smaller piece and it is quite hard. It was this that prompted me to replace the head set finally.All this by the way is with the same cell phone so it is a good one to one comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all worth buying!!!","review":"I had ordered this item from Amazon.com...and looking at its sleek design was quite impressed at first.But the product was way below its expectations and I had to return the device in 2 days.Cons: The device does not have a clear indicator when its charging is complete.There is a lot of interference even if your cell phone is located quite close to the device.The sound quality is not that good either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for the price","review":"I have tried other brands that were designed so they did not match with my ear -- hearing was a challenge at best.

The main problem is that the sound quality is terrible unless you have your phone in your hand and hold it at chest level or higher. It was ridiculous.

It is comfortable, light weight, and pairs easily with my phone (LG PM325)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money - older technology","review":"This is a good unit for any non-business or non-heavy user. I've had this headset for many years, but stopped using it years ago because of the inconsistent connections. With California's new hands free law, I've started using it again, but the periodic drops or bad connections were not acceptable for business use.

Ive done all the normal troubleshooting steps but it still doesnt work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on Plantronics Explorer 320 Bluetooth","review":"Pros: I have found that this unit is very lightweight, is comfortable to wear for long periods of time without becoming a nuisance. Also, from the feedback that I have received from individuals that I speak to, everyone tells me that they can hear me clearly when I speak. I have also found that no matter which side you carry your cell phone on (if you wear on a belt clip) that I do not pick up much interference or static. I can hear everyone that I speak to very clearly.Cons: Sometimes when I try to reduce the sound level the unit is not compliant (on occasion, not always). Also, when I am traveling on the interstate and have wind noise, I have had people ask me if I was riding with my windows down, when I was not. I believe that the sensitivity level is very strong on this unit and that is why it picks up background noise.Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This is a well made product.

It continued to be paired with my Treo, yet, the call was filled with too much static (for both callers) to be functional. I took the headset home and tried it with my PC and Skype. Same problem.

It finally stopped working after being dropped too many times.This newer model works even better and doesn't have the annoying disco light show. People say that it sounds as good as any POTS land-line phone.In fact I'm here now to order a second one to have as a spare. The price is definitely right!The only downside I've found is that the sound quality does drop when I walk more than about 6' away from the phone, very short compared to the Mororolas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Distance with Treo 700W","review":"I am using this product with my Treo 700W. The battery life is good and the sound quality is good - up to 2 feet from the phone.

I would not recommend this headset if you have a 700W."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headset","review":"I really liked this headset:handy and a snap to use; it takes a bit of adjustment to get used to the \\"short\\", \\"long\\", and \\"very long\\" presses, but I guess it is just a part of \\"bluetooth world.\\" Works great with my palm treo 680."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason why it is cheap","review":"I purchased this headset when I bought my first bluetooth enabled phone. It is light weight and the buttons are very easy to use while you have the headset on. Unfortunately (like the other reviews have pointed out), this headset does have a lot of static unless the phone less than two feet away and has a direct line of sight. I started getting static even if I had my phone on a belt clip but covered by my jacket. After one week the hinge on the ear piece broke, so I returned it and got another Plantronics 510 (which I like much better)Bottme line...Don't waste your money on this model"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"Crystal clear reception, no cut outs, easily attaches to ear, very comfortable, definitely would recommend this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"plantronics explorer 320 BT headset.","review":"Very light and comfortable to wear, has a slight problem of slipping out of the ear if you lean your head sideways although the plastic clip keeps it from falling. Good sound quality and excelent battery life. It should be noted that range and sound quality degrade rapidly as the battery wears down so it is neccessary to operate the unit with a minimum of a quarter charge left. All-in-all satisfactory and a great deal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service by Amazon","review":"I placed this order on a sunday afternoon, selected the free super saver shipping, and the estimate date of delivery was 10 days. But on the following wednesday, I got this item! Amazing!! its as if they gave me a free 2nd day shipping. I was very happy. It was my 1st ever bluetooth headset, and i bought it coz it was quite cheap. The product feels good. Its light in weight, small and handy. I could pair it up with my Sony erricsson phone and my laptop too. The single button is taking some time to get used to and remember. But all in all, its good.

I thought this was a good a choice based on reviews I had read at numerous sites. At the time I bought the item there were 12 1 star ratings and 50 5 start ratings on Amazon. Overall I felt the device had a decent review.However here is what I found:Pros:+ Charges in 2 hours+ Comfortable Fit+ Easy to connect to my cell phone (LG VX8300)Cons:- Calls have lots of static. The people I called could hear me fine, but I could not hear them well. I had the phone in my pocket, so max range from the headset was around 3 feet.- I tried with a different cell phone, but got the same results.I am quite disappointed with this headset. The primary function it has to perform it doesn't do well. If your considering this item you should move on, I also recommend that Amazon remove the item from its inventory. It's not good business to sell products that don't function as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is great to be hands free.","review":"It works pretty good and I can walk away from my phone and it is still clear. It does become a bit uncomfortable on the ear with long periods of wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset for the money","review":"This headset is easy to use, has excellent sound quality, stays in my ear, and was simple to pair with my phone. My only complaint: weird connection with the charger cord. This is a big improvement over my previous (much more expensive) Jabra headset, which had lots of bells and whistles, but poor sound, wouldn't stay in my ear, and was difficult to pair with the phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A show ahead of it's time","review":"What a great show. This was on Thursday nights (on it's regular time slot) at 7pm central against The Simpsons.It was an expensive show to produce, I remember a $1 million per episode budget being mentioned. With a score by Danny Elfman and a slick/dark production, this was a treat on Thursday nights.

In fiction...","review":"The pilot for the Flash was aired a long time ago on one of local tv station in my country (Yes, I am not from the state), and I was drawn in into this terrific tale of crime fighting masked vigilante in the form a crimson speedster.That was my first actual introduction of the Flash. Before that, the only super heroes from DC that I've known were of course Superman and Batman. But I find the Flash much more fascinating because of his expertise in 'speed', and of course he being just a man unlike the \\"Man Of Steel\\". I find the series much more delightful than \\"Lois and Clark\\" that was aired during the same period (locally), it's a pity that it ended so soon...I have no regret buying the complete series for The Flash. It had being one of my saved items for quite a while now, and with a charming price of 15 plus dollars, who could resists and not to mention that a movie adaptation of The Flash will finally come out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash DVD Series","review":"I was very pleased with the timliness of the order.

This DVD is 1 step up from owning the series on VHS. Everything with this set feels like it was hated from the moment of production.What I don't understand is why it costs so much for this set. I could've done most of this DVD on my home computer and had better quality. It's REALLY sad to see that The Greastest American Hero actually looks BETTER than the Flash given that TGAH is almost a full 10 years BEHIND it.Still, if you're looking for The Flash, get it. I seriously doubt WB will reproduce it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast shipping","review":"Bought the dvd as a gift. Was impressed by the fast shipping. Got it in time for christmas.

I thought John Wesley Shipp and Amanda Pays were terrific! Unfortunately, I think it was a tad too \\"campy\\" for most people - even back in 1990. Thus, it only lasted one season.I picked this up as soon as it came out and I love it! The episode with Mark Hamill as the Trickster is exceptional. One can easily see how this character might have led to his recurring voice-work as the Joker on the Batman Animated series.The other thing I had completely forgotten about this show that I really dig, though, is all the classic cars! They went for a sort of new world/old world style to the sets and there are TONS of gorgeous classic cars all over the place!This show was a classic and it provides a fond rememberance of life in the early '90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV live action hero","review":"Definitely the best comic character taken to a TV show ever! truly faithful to the comic storyline this TV show only did bad cause it had to compete with some sort of super bowl thingy.In this pack you get the whole first and only season that was produced.

We have all of the Wonder Woman DVDs, Justice League cartoons, Superman movies. You get the idea. :)I purchased this on a whim because our oldest is a huge fan of the Flash and there is so little out there that is just about the Flash. It's a lot of fun. It has some of the old style stunts, which I think kids are a little more into, the CGI stuff seems to leave them with more questions than answers. The acting is a little campy, but overall it's a fun series. The kids really enjoy it and it's fun for adults to watch with them.If you are a superhero fan, this is a must have for your DVD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series they had on tv","review":"I thought this was a terrific series and wish it didn't end so soon.

Same as hundres of others (& those are just the ones who've posted). Just as the pilot episode gets to the end it starts to skip & eventually freezes up. It appears to be a big error in the disc itself as tons of different dvd players, computers, etc... report the same thing. Looks like Warner Brothers will probably have to repress the first disc & have a tradein program. Not every copy is showing this glitch, a few have reported no problems. But, that could be the player & what happens if your next player shows the glitch up even if it plays fine now? WB needs to redo disc one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great series ---Brilliant TV!","review":"WOW ---I was a huge fan of this series when it was on TV (only missed one episode first run) and when I saw this DVD set available I bought it and I loved each and every episode again just as I did the first time! .... The really neat part of buying this to me was that my 2 daughters (ages 8 & 11) liked it as much as I did if not more! The whole family watched episodes one after the other as time allowed and felt really empty when the shows were all done ....the same feeling I had when the series was originally canceled. I highly recommend Flash: the complete series...Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flash is back!","review":"I've always been a fan of comic book and I enjoyed watching the TV show when it was on.

Just a shame this is the only season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Series","review":"The Flash boxed set is well worth the price. It was once the most expensive weekly show televised due to the high cost of the special effects. It also boasted good acting from its two lead actors, John Wesley Shipp and Amanda Pays. I especially liked the subplot between Barry Allen and his father, who did not equate lab work to real police work. My only regret is the lack of competent villains throughout much of the length of the series. I also missed the character Iris from the pilot episode. However, the series still holds well in spite of its age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the show...hate the dvd","review":"I am a huge fan of this show and was very excited to receive my set.

Dated, and 1990 wasn't exactly \\"The Nineties\\" either, so this is basically a late 80's concocted Stab-In-The-Dark tv comic series. Think back, what did you see?Trust me, watching this now is not like watching it in 1990. The dated-ness feel, and cheesy 80's style character arcs are just unbearable for me. Granted, many STILL like it, so maybe this is just the other half talking.I love sci-fi, especially the comic book variety (GenX), and I think this just basically sucks. sorry fans.."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Just no.","review":"The problem with this series was that they cast a body-builder in a velour leotard instead of a willow-thin guy who can run fast.Thanks to this DVD set, you can enjoy every moment of this fatally flawed and completely wrong-headed treatment of a beloved comic book character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone in a flash.","review":"Okay where do I start? The series is too dark (not the characters, the lighting.), It all feels rushed and too influenced by the previous year's Batman success. The Flash is a good, bright character, nothing at all like Batman. And yet this series was clearly trying to be similar to Burton's original. Even Danny Elfman's theme tune sounds like a rehash of the Batman score. It does have it's moments, however. The feature length pilot is reasonably worth watching and Mark Hammil's guest appearences are hilarious. (Think cockknocker without the giant fist) But it mostly sucks. The costume is too padded, Wesley Shipp is miscast, his sidekicks are just annoying, I could go on and on.And with not one extra feature this boxset is for hardcore fans and collectors only. On the plus side, it only lasted one season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"I would give this product a 5 but Amazon recently raised the price $6.

The picture quality suffers under all but the best lighting conditions. Putting some kind of filter over the strobe (I used Scotch tape and copy paper) produced some acceptable flash pix, but most of the objects in the center of the photo were washed out. The fun comes when you hand it to your seven year old taking little video clips (with sound at 10 fps). Shutter lag is substantial. None of my photos are sharp, and the colors can only be made pleasing by correcting in Photoshop. The LCD is small but reasonable. Battery life is okay. The pictures simply cannot compare to my Olympus D550, which is FAR superior with the same number of pixels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junky!","review":"This camera is by far the worst camera I have ever had.

I do not know if the claws are different than the ones on the bears that some other people received (going by their reviews) but, I see no problem with them. The claws on the bear I got are soft and bendable. If they seemed to be too sharp all I would need to do is simply take some scissors and round off the tips but, that will not be necessary with this bear. It seems to be very good quality and stitching. For the price I am very pleased and can not wait for him to open it on Christmas morning.

My husband admitted he hated it as much as I did. Seriously gross.I gather from all the positive reviews that perhaps it's one of those lotions you either love or hate the scent of... but just be forewarned that, like me, you may be in the latter group. What a waste of $7."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"There is fragrance in this and retinyl palmitate; I thought that it would have natural fragrance from essential oils but no.

This system works very well in my car. I spend most of my time away from NYC and rarely have a problem finding a channel to get good, reasonable quality sound. All these products will have variable success in large cities, I would imagine, but I hooked it up, found a channel and got what I was looking for. Just remember to switch the device from \\"DX\\" (mono) to \\"LX\\" (stereo)--which frankly is not as easy it sounds and go to the website if you get confused. When I turned mine on and had mono sound, my heart sank. But it's fine on LX/Stereo.I bought the Griffin because of the reviews on this site.

For 15 dollars or so this is a bargain to get your iPod going in the car, with fairly decent sound.The cons:1)You have no volume control on the iPod once it's plugged in.2)The volume is a low even when you crank it on the radio's end, which is my main complaint here.If you are willing to pay three times this for a Monster one with better sound for music, suit yourself, but bang for buck-wise I think this works. However, this is coming from someone who'd rather just use CDs for music, and my iPod mainly for news/podcasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not charge the new ipod collection","review":"It works very well as am fm transmitter, but the title is misleading- it does not charge the this years newest ipods. if i had known that i would not have purchased this particular product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Country Living","review":"After reading many reviews I was not expecing much from this product, but when Igot it hooked up it worked great!

All you have to do is read the directionsincluded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charge and Play","review":"I love that this iTrip charges the iPod while you're listening and driving. When you need to leave and bring your iPod with you it has a full charge. The option to have stereo or mono is a great option. If you have a good signal (a lot of static on an FM channel) then the LX (stereo) option makes a huge difference. If you have a decent signal you might as well stick to the DX (mono) signal so you don't lose any sound quality. Another bonus is the backlit LCD, which is great when driving at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't charge the 4G nano","review":"Great product for the money. It works wonderfully -- no back static at all and the sound is perfect. I was a little disappointed that it won't charge my ipod while playing.

Otherwise, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Capabilities for $15 - Can work with Iphone 3g","review":"I bought this device hoping to get it to work with my Iphone 3g and low and behold, it does work. What a great deal! Not only can I stream music stored on my phone, but as long as I have a decent 3g signal, I can stream music from internet using Iphone radio apps like Pandora, and AOL Radio! How cool is that?! Like having satellite radio without the cost.There are only a few small drawbacks. 1) It doesn't charge the Iphone. Meh!..oh well, if you put your Iphone into airplane mode, you save quite a bit of battery power anyway. But you don't have to put it into airplane mode, still works in regular mode. 2) You get a little hiss or background noise - keep adjusting the placement of the transmitter to reduce this and or turn the music up a little louder. :) Oh, yeah and use the tip from a previous poster to change the device to international mode to use the 87.9 FM frequency.I am very happy with this device for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading-ipod touch","review":"This would have worked great if it had worked with my ipod touch-2nd generation.

Not wanting to pay $75, I came across this product. For the $25 it cost me, I have no complaints at all. I listen in mono mode becuase stereo had a lot of static, but in the car, you really can't tell the difference. Unless you are some kind of audio junkie, I find it hard to believe you won't like what this iTrip does for you. It is a transmitter, so you know you are going to get some static, but that fact is independent of this product. For somebody who wants to cheaply use their iPod in the car, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, just what I need","review":"So glad I bought this online vs. Best Buy.

The ability to charge the ipod while transmitting is very helpful on my girlfriends nano. However, sound quality on every FM transmitter I have ever used has been pretty poor. If you are an audio buff, this is not the product for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak transmitter","review":"I bought this because I had a good experience with the Griffin Roadtrip. The Roadtrip is out in the open and I wanted something a little less obvious to the iPod thieves so I bought this iTrip Auto. It is pretty much worthless because of all the static. The transmitter is not nearly as strong as the Roadtrip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am perfectly willing to believe that this transmitter works better in some cars than others and better in some locations than others. I have used other transmitters successfully with my iPod mini and switched to the iTrip only because I replaced the mini with a 3G Nano. In my car (a 2002 BMW 3 series wagon) and in my town (Philadelphia) it was far far too noisy to be useable. A weak signal from the transmitter and lots of background hiss when I turned up the volume on the radio. Thank you to Amazon for the no-hassles return policy. If you decide to give it a try, save the wrappings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Static","review":"Unfortunately this product did not work well with my car radio.

It's unfortunate because I know that generally Griffin makes a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performer","review":"I owned a previous version of the iTrip that I really enjoyed. I expected higher quality, volume-adjustable sound. I expected to be able to tune it to any station that my car plays.Instead, I have to crank my car radio all the way up to 90%, and can only use it in rural areas where there's not a lot of radio traffic.For whatever reason, Griffin decided not to include 87.~ range on this device - that's the only spot in my area that doesn't have traffic.I basically bought a $40 car charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"driving and rockin","review":"I like it.

It's easy to use, I have experienced one time where the sound was fuzzy, otherwise it usually comes in clear and I don't have to continuously switch stations like my old one. It looks great and works so much easier then the previous one I had bought that just hooked onto my ipod but not into the car. It was constantly popping out of the jack and the sound was terrible!

Overall, a good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good, Looks great, Manufactured to be replaced as junk","review":"This is the 5th version of the iTrip that I have purchased. The last two (includes the Griffin 4026-LCDT & Griffin 9501-TRIPCB) were not durable and fell apart with normal use. Both failures reveal poor manufacture. Though I found the sound satisfactory and the ease of use a plus, the durability of the item should be a total embarrassment for Griffin: the 4026 casing popped open and the SELECT button slipped inside the casing of the 9501 making station selection impossible after a brief use.Earlier versions for the 1st generation iPod, 3rd generation (4 button), and mini served well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I do get some static driving around Seattle, but it works very well most of the time.

I had one that went on top of the iPod and I loved it, but it was difficult to use and set-up. This one works great, it's easy and adaptable to the three cars I've used it in. However, the first one I bought fell apart at the part where you attach it to the iPod. I would say for $30 this will get the job done.

I tried it out and it was hard enough to find a decent FM station and when I found one the sound quality was horrendous. The sound was too faded and I was hearing more static then the actually music. My patience with this transmitter was very thin because listening to static isn't the most appealing thing trying to get the thing to work.The one I would recommend is the Griffin Technology 9631-NANOTRIP iTrip Nano LCD/FM Transmitter for iPod Nano.

Whatever the reason, these are useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get it to work with my car","review":"The transmitter is very easy to use.Unfortunately it doesn't work with my car. No matter what frequency I select, my 2006 Volvo XC90 radio cannot get a reliable signal from it. It's like listening to a very remote radio station - the transmission is getting broken all the time. Probably issue is with how antenna is located in this particular car as other people are saying it does work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well for the Price","review":"I live in a large metropolitan area and have had no trouble getting the iTrip to work in my car.

My experience has been that it's signal is weak and results in distorted sound.

I immediately went outside when I got this package only to find out that it does not work well.

It transmits via radio frequency, and I like this better than the analog tuner or the transmitters that only allow you to choose one of five frequencies. My only issue with it is that in order for it to work, it has to be plugged into the lighter/outlet in the car, which means it will have to be charging the iPod if you want to use it. I'm afraid this will damage my battery with the constant charging (normally I let my battery die before I charge it), but hopefully it won't. Also, I wish my city had an iPod-only station that was clear, but unfortuntely there does not appear to be any clean frequencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound","review":"this particular itrip produces poor sound. the high frequency parts are nearly non-existant.

And we're not talking about quiet static, it's nearly twice as loud as the music you were listening to.And the sound quality when the signal is clear is extremely quiet. I have to turn my stereo up nearly all the way to enjoy music with the windows rolled up.I sold it for half price to a friend who lives south enough of Atlanta to put it to use.

I contributed it to being left in my car in Georgia heat so when I received my second Griffin iTrip Auto I took it out of the car every time I was done with it.

The sound quality was also horrible when I could get it to work. I turned the volume as high as it would go and I could still barely hear it. Then you forget how high you turned the volume and blow your speakers when you put it back to radio.

If you have an audiophile sound system, you'll be disappointed (but probably won't be buying this anyway), although it's no worse than an ordinary car radio. I drive a Honda Accord, that most generic of cars and it works fine, although you have to to be careful of where the adapter for the cigarette lighter is inserted (it's less intuitive than it should be.

I tried several other stations; none where void of static, even though some had a lesser undertone than others. The hint of static was consistently present.It's kind of frustrating because I have a sports car and I don't want a bulky transmitter, so stylish wise this was the most suitable.

Luckily enough managed an empty station in the denver area, so I'm stoked. Great deal for under $20, definitely worth it. Won't work better than a direct line in, but with this thing you don't have to worry about your ipod's battery because it powers and charges it for you.

I tested the iTrip in my car in the garage to better inhibit other FM signals, but the performance of the product was next to unusable. I've had other FM transmitter items work far better.

I'd have to turn the FM radio up really loud to hear it very well. Then, when the interference comes in (which it always does), or if you switch to AM or CD, now the car stereo blasts you too loudly because you had to turn it up so high. In cities, outside FM stations make the thing useless almost ALL the time. I finally got so fed up one day I yanked the piece of garbage out of the cig lighter and smashed it to bits.

The iTrip took battery power and gave you only one choice of a radio broadcast station. The iTrip Auto not only gives you a broadcast choice, it seems to broadcast better, thus much clearer music. Using the dock connector instead of the headphone jack also allows you to control the volume of the music solely from the radio controls in the car. On top of it all, it charges her ipod while she drives. She loves it and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough signal for the buck","review":"I used it for a few days before sending it back. Too much static.

I went to the Post Office where they told me the tracking number only confirmed it was delivered to a regional distribution center 60 miles from my house. After four full weeks, I asked the seller to help me in locating the item. They stopped returning my emails and would NOT help at all.

But the \\"set\\" button was stuck in the down position, and no amount of digging could bring it back up. I was stuck with the first station I selected.Since the receipt was long gone and I couldn't return it, I tossed it out of the window, ran over it in the parking lot, and bought the Monster iCarPlayer Wireless Plus. Works beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre - Hopefully it will be fine-tuned...","review":"Just like the MP3 players themselves were. I picked this up and don't really like it. If you live in a metropolitan area, or any place where there are loads of radio stations, it might be tough to find a good, clear frequency. And on top of that, they were a bit modest in saying that the signal used is weak - it seems near non-existent! The volume comes across low... except for when you hit a bad frequency patch.It does have a car charger, but I don't think it's worth it since you can also get one of those separately (along with a wall charger). I use the tape (that people used to use with CD players) instead of it, as even the sound quality in the tape is noticeably better to me, even with the mechanical noise. Hopefully in the future there will be better ways of integrating the players with cars. It's one thing to have sound quality that's a bit lagging, but it shouldn't be as noticeably poor as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the frustration","review":"When I bought this iTrip at Best Buy, I opened it in the car to try it out. Upon pressing the station change button the first time, it broke in my hands. That should of been my first clue, but I went back into the store and they gave me another one.This new one lasted about a month and the mini blade fuse in it blew, rendering it useless. I spent a week searching for these 2 amp mini blade fuses - no store carries them, Radio Shack, Autozone, Advance, etc. NOBODY. I found a couple overseas dealers who sell them for about$15-$20 for 5 after shipping. What an incredible hassle that has left this item I paid $70 for useless after a month. It's not very sturdy and will probably only last a month or so. If you want to spend $33 a month (Amazon's price - too bad I didn't get it here) to listen to your iPod in your car, go for it.Sound quality was passable when it did work, but just that: passable.

My ipod would play the first few songs of the playlist just fine, but then it would advance to the next song about 10 seconds after the song started. Then it would advance to the next song after another 10 seconds and so on. This only happened when the ipod was connected to the transmitter. The ipod worked normally when I was using it in my docking station or using it portably. This happened on three different occasions. I quit using the transmitter when I noticed my album cover art was erased and my videos would no longer play. I had to restore my ipod settings to get my art back and videos to play again.

Next tried in my wife's Honda Accord. I got the same distorted quality. Also, tried several frequencies but no clear sound. I even moved the transmitter unit around and close to the radio but no luck.

I live in suburban Washington DC, and this transmitter simply can't work though the static in the area. It does an okay job finding gaps where there are no FM transmissions. The problem is that it yields little but static and faint music over those frequencies.

For that, I will hold on to it.

Lots of rural driving where you wouldn't expect much interference from radio stations. We were unable to get a strong enough signal to listen to any music from my iPod. Sometimes an acoustical guitar would sound okay, but if they started singing, it was all over. It sounded like when you are driving over a hill going away from a distant radio station and you love the song and don't want to change the station even though it sounds horrible. You only really hear the song at all because you know in your mind how it goes.Per the instructions on the device, I switched it to Mono mode (that's supposed to boost signal), but that did not improve it. My Subaru Forester radio doesn't go down below 88.1, so I was unable to try using the lowest setting on the iTrip. This device may work well in some cars, but not in ours! I plan to see if I can return it. The only thing it did effectively was charge my iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"The Griffin iTrip is pretty nice but depending on where you are the static can be annoying but if you like to play your music loud (like I do...) then its money well spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst fm transmitter I have ever used!","review":"This transmitter constantly cut out unless I turned my mp3 player to full volume.

Either there is some significant variability in the manufacturing of the product or the location and design of the FM radio antenna in some cars is the problem. In any case, the signal from the unit I received was so weak that there was noticeable static regardless of where I placed the transmitter and how I positioned the cable. It didn't matter which station I chose - they were all bad. Worse, even when it was stationary the static hiss would increase, decrease, increase and so on. Also, as others have mentioned in reviews, the audio was considerably quieter than the car's built-in components.Nice idea, but I second the review that voted for a stronger transmission signal. With Amazon's easy return process, and given the ratio of positive to negative reviews, you may want to give it a shot. But it's a shot in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you own a 4th Gen Nano","review":"This product works reasonably well for transmitting the audio signal but it does not charge (as advertised) the newer I-Pod Nano's. I bought it specifically because of the ability to charge while on the road and it does not do this. Very disappointing and it is not listed anywhere in the information from Amazon and only in the most obscure location at Griffin Technology. I'll be returning it to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will not charge, but transmitter works well","review":"First note that this accessory will not charge many new iPods; I assume that is why it is on sale. According to Griffin, this product charges via Firewire and the new iPods (like my new iPod Touch 2nd gen) charge off USBBut the transmitter works relatively well. I only use it for spoken files, like NPR podcasts, so my audio quality demands are low. I previously had an iTrip for my old 20 Gb iPod and it worked okay for my needs. The new unit is more convenient to tune; you just choose the radio frequency on the gadget instead of on the iPod as in the old unit. I need to keep it fairly close to the radio, and interference creeps in as I drive around, but for the cost it serves my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this transmitter!","review":"I purchased this transmitter after trying one of the cassette adapters from BargainCell, which was cheap in both price and quality. It had no high frequency response and the overall sound quality was poor.On the contrary, the Griffin iTrip works great! It was easy to find a frequency that would work and the sound quality is almost exactly like you would get from a docking stereo. So far, I have not experienced any problems with static that I have read about in other reviews. I really like the fact that this unit charges the ipod while it is playing and also that I don't have to worry about what the headphone volume level is set at when I plug it in. The price I paid at amazon.com is about 1/3 of what I would have paid locally. I would definitely recommend this transmitter to anyone who doesn't have a MP3 jack on their car stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"I plugged this into my radio in my 2002 Jeep Liberty (original manufacturers cassette deck radio)and it worked perfectly on any station,clear as a bell with no interference, so I'm thrilled with my purchase. Out of curiousity I tried it in my husband's 2007 Ford Ranger (original CD player)and it worked, but not as clear and there was some staticky interference, so if that was the vehicle I bought it for I wouldn't be as happy. I guess from car to car the quality will vary, but luckily mine works perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"My car doesn't have the FM frequency needed to use the international setting. And almost all of the FM frequencies around here are either taken or have some degree of static. I did find one frequency with very little static, and tried that with the Griffin. It was OK, but not great. Then, since my car has a power antenna and I seldom use the radio, I unplugged the power antenna. This made it much harder for the radio to pick up FM frequencies. With the antenna inop, the Griffin worked much better. I have to turn my stereo volume up quite a bit higher than normal, but the sound quality is good. No FM adapter is going to sound as good as a wired hookup, but this one is definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet my needs!","review":"Two star rating is because the transmission/receiption is very poor on the product.I purchased this for my iPhone--while I understand the product description does not include the iPhone in any of it's claims.

Does not charge ipod Touch 2G","review":"I bought this based on the reviews.On the positive side, the product is simple to use.

It feels like moving around a metal hanger to get reception on an old TV (does this date me?).

My old iPod died recently and I bought a 4th generation video iPod to replace it, and the Griffin iTrip to replace the Transpod. What a difference! The iTrip is tiny, unobtrusive, and puts no stress at all on lighter sockets. The sound from the iTrip is much clearer, the digital tuner much easier to work with, and by using International mode you can avoid almost any interference.

However, for me it is almost useless. Living in Los Angeles (westside, venice) means there are almost no empty spots on the radio dial. Griffin has a a chart on their website with recommended frequencies. For LA they list 3, 2 of which don't work for me, there's heavy carryover from other stations. The third is OK 60% of the time.

The audio coming out of the iTrip Auto was too quiet and so I had to turn up my stereo's volume, which made the background static even more noticeable. There was also a lot of distortion when it plays songs that sound perfectly fine with headphones. Maybe this works better in a rural area, but for us people in the big cities with lots of local radio stations, the iTrip Auto's sound quality is horrible at worst to barely acceptable at best. For something that has an MSRP of $69.95, it is not worth it, even when on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I had ordered this for Christmas last year, but it was back ordered and I didn't receive it. The price at the time was around $50. When I saw the price was cheaper, I knew I had to buy it. The sound quality is exceptional, especially on those un-used frequencies like 87.9FM. One thing that got a little annoying was that if a song wasn't playing off my iPod, the iTrip would shut off after a while, and the radio would play static. Not a big deal but I thought I should mention it. All in all, a good purchase at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static, lots of fidling and crank up the volume","review":"We're not impressed with this transmitter.Ease of use - nope. You have to click through all stations to find the best. As you drive from one area to the next, that best station may need to be adjusted.Sound quality - nope. You have to crank up the iPod volume to the max in order to get any signal through. The iPod doesn't have the best amplifiers, so the fidelity suffers. You also have to crank up the stereo. Be careful when you switch to another source on the car stereo or plug in headphones to the iPod!

I also like the preset feature in case you are traveling and have to find the same clear station again.I have recently upgraded to a device that will hold my phone and charge it while including an FM transmitter, which I enjoy more.

Needless to say, by the time the show came around, I was very familiar with their songs, and quite simply put, it was the best concert I had ever attended. Amazing live, amazing in the studio, and just all around great people. This band has extreme talent and are definitely ones to watch out for, and Rise is a CD that will not soon be forgotten.

I feel that, although the plot was basically a stolen one, it was better done. The suspense and terror build nicely, and there are frightening elements to it that were missing in its progenitor.

I suspect a lot of people would find this easier to use though and so I think the grammar section (as a real introduction) deserves 5 stars.My only real complaint comes from the reader, which uses a facing page translation format so there is a substantial urge to \\"cheat\\" and look over at the other page when stuck. If the English translations are to be offered at all, I think they should be separated from the OE texts to reduce this problem. I'd actually take off 2 stars for this, meaning that the reader gets 3 stars and is better for advanced students than beginners.So the grammar gets 5 stars and the reader 3.

The Eric Kuyper dance remix butchers the innate beauty of the song.My biggest complaint, however, is that the original version of the song is edited (ie, cut short from the proper album version). You know the end of the song on Version 2.0, where the song segues off into about a minute or more of instrumentation and beats? Well, it lasts about 20 seconds on THIS CD single.

The Brawl For All boxing match between Butterbean & Bart Gunn was crud to the 10th power. The Mankind-Big Show match was so-so with a cruddy ending. The 4 corners elimination match for the IC title was pretty good for a 4 corners match. The HHH-Kane match was a hard-hitting brawl with a lousy DQ ending. The European title match between Shane McMahon & X-Pac was a fun & entertaining bout with a twist that you have to see to belive. The Hell In A Cell match between The Undertaker & The Big Boss Man was a sloppy but solid brawl.

After just over a year, it started doing the same thing as my old dvd player -- I could hear it spinning the disks in an attempt to read them, but it would then say \\"No Disc\\". I contacted Sony, who wanted me to mail it out to Texas and pay an additional $80 to have it assessed and then they would let me know how much it would cost to repair it.

This compliation, however, has more of the obscure groups, singers that did not necessarily make it big, either in England nor the United States. However, it is fantastic; I don't know of a better CD disc to play and to get the feel of the excitement and energy these performers exuded during their prime.

It certainly did speak, both for, and to, me. 5 Star ranking because very few books manage to generate such succinct and poignant empahy from the reader.

Microserfs is no different. While it includes many apt insights about our current technologised society, it is a one-sided account which igonores any kind of resolution or positive direction of that society. In other words, the novel is stuck in the-life's not fair supplication which, inevitably has no reward except to lead to a redundant and circular chase of our own tails. Quite frankly, it wears thin after a while, which is not to say that Coupland will not produce something of better quality in the future, its just saying that his present, while appropriate to his creative development, is a repetitive whine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abrupt","review":"This book was very well thought out, and had a plethora of information throughout. unfortunately the story was kind of left behind. and only a few different thoughts were kept through. and at the end every single thing is just thrown at you. don't get me wrong, i liked the book, in fact i liked it a lot. it's just i thought the ending could have been more of an epilogue rather than this ending, that in fact didn't have anything to do with the story or the rest of the people in it.but i do understand that he wanted to find jed, and he did, so i suppose i should be happy for him. but, he doesn't exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ggod read","review":"A great way to spend an afternoon.

As a software developer myself, but one that likes to get philosophical, this book was a welcome addition to the normal 'social commentary'-type of novels that I read. Coupland introduces a group of developers who work for the largest software company in the world, and decide to relinquish their benefits and stock options in order to work for a start-up whose philosophies they actually believe in. He conveys the satisfaction experienced for working for the startup versus the drudgery and monotony and eventual breakdown of working in corporate America. Its not often that we read about someone whose passion for technology matches their passion for life, but that is what exists in Microserfs."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and whiny","review":"I can't stand this Coupland guy, this stupid excuse for a writer has delivered one of the whiniest books about generation X that I have ever read. It seems that all his characters do is worry and bitch and pretend that everything was perfect in the 50's and 60's, and all this generation can do is sit around, whine and maybe if their lucky, find their inner child. Oh and another thing, don't worry about having to have extensive technical knowledge to read this book, Coupland seems to only know three computer terms: C++, OOP, and internet, everything else is just a bunch of psychobabble/sociology B.S."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time.","review":"If you're tired of books about the cool, hip or romantic multimedia/computer industry this one will serve as the straw that breaks the camels back.

I had a hard time doing it, but I read the whole book just to see if it did actually ever get into anything to do with the things it talks about on the cover or in the first couple of pages; it doesn't. The clown author just wrote a book about clueless/lifeless characters and gave them jobs in hi-tech to attract an audience. The soap-opera story isn't even original (in fact, it reminds me of Danielle Steele's work). The author continuously reveals his lack of knowledge of the hi-tech industry in the few mentions he gives the subject. If you bought this book, I feel sorry for you.

It's slow and mostly pointless at times. Think of all the excitement you have working in a cubical with situations much less funny than those you'd see in Office Space.

I'd love to see what working in Microsoft was like when things were just starting to get huge!4. My friends and I are all computer nerds. This is EXACTLY what it are going to be like when I graduate college this year!I was wrong on all counts. There is nothing I, as a 21 year old tech-savvy, internatioanl business major, could relate to. It lacks an interesting plot. It lacks characters the reader can enjoy. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of a few mildly interesting situations scattered few and far between in the book. Go.

It's too long, too shallow, and too boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff and Frivolous","review":"Coupland's style has never really impressed me much. But, I always given someone a second chance.Contrary to many critics, Coupland reliance, or better yet - dependence, on popular culture is not symbolic or metaphoric of a generation. Instead, Coupland style dripples from one stereotyped flat character to another with little or no substance. His lack of any creative flavor puts Microseft right up there with an E! Entertainment programming.Coupland failed to even study accurate basics of the individual cultures that are supposively present in his characters. Most of his settings are sophmoric and naive, like someone who wrote this book from reading generalized Wired magazines about nerds and Microsoft.In the end he tries to push all of these broken elements together in order to have his poorly construed characters obtain enlightenment.It is amazing what they will publish today. I would not recommend this book to anyone I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close to perfect, yet so far away","review":"Amazingly amusing throughout 99% of the pages, the ending serves to send the book tumbling down to an 8, being worse than predictable. Apart from this, Microserfs is a well-written, postmodern view at a world obsessed with computerized relationships. The fragments from the main characters' database of thoughts sends the reader reeling into strange rows of associations and adds a dimension of openess and awareness to the book that would have been impossible to express otherwise. These fragments are the counterparts of the small narratives in Generation X, but possess a freedom and life of their own that makes them genuinely unique.Having seen Douglas Coupland live, I am also pleased (and relieved) to find once again that he is much more coherent on paper than in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wake up call","review":"Coming from the software industry I was a little wary of this book for two reasons - 1, it was at the time the first by a new author (to me) and 2, I was uneasy at the prospect of reading a set of caricatures. Some hours later I walked away from possibly the most provoking book I have ever read, it's insight into my generation (oh the joy of having someone write about people I relate to) and the hollowness that surrounds us (and it's attractiveness) were quite something. Even now some years later I am at a loss to describe the pertinence of this book. Buy it, read it, get past the jargon and get to the message.

If you like technology and how it intersects with our day-to-day interactions with the people in our lives you will really enjoy Microserfs. It also helps if you have any nostalgia for the 90s.With that said, this is a terrible e-book. Was there an editor or someone to proofread the final version? It looks like someone just scanned the book and relied on the computer's optical character recognition (OCR) to get everything right.

Just days ago, I finally got a copy of my own to read and I've been hooked ever since.Microserfs is the sort of book where you start to read it for just a few minutes and the next thing you know, it's past midnight and you've only got a third of the book left. This book grabs you and will not let go.Normally I hate titles in this vein, peering through a window into the life of the main character, but in this instace it works.

There are letters missing, a few entire words missing and many, many instances of the wrong letter over and over (like a U instead of a V - there's an entire section where it says Silicon Ualley over and over) and places where the wrong word was picked up (ie - Interiority becomes Inferiority, somewhat appropriate in describing this edition).I've read the book before and enjoyed it but the Kindle edition was a bit of a chore.

Everyone that reviewed had purchased it for a half size sheet pan.I couldn't let this obvious injustice continue. The Cooling Rack is INNOCENT!

Just replace Jay Gould with Ken Lay, stock pools with hedge funds, rail stocks with internet stocks and it could have been the late 90s when the story takes place.Other than the story, there are bits and pieces of investment and trading advice throughout the book.

I didn't notice any, but I didn't catch a fish to see anyways. The reel I received is good, but my rating is low because of getting a cheaper model...and because I don't have high hopes for the reel even though it feels good and looks good.

I typically pre-boil my noodles but the instructions on the rice noodles said no boiling was needed. So I made my recipe and refrigerated it for 2 days as usual. I cooked it for 50 min let it stand for 10 min before serving. I was disappointed that the texture was mushy - not the same firmness as the wheat pasta noodles. Perhaps it would have worked better if I made it immediately before cooking and cooked it for a shorter time."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!","review":"Gin Miller's Circuit Challenge tape is wonderful. I have a large collection of step workouts by Gin Miller and this one is my favorite. Gin's instructions and cues are excellent (as always). Her assistants do a terrific job as they demonstrate advanced and low-impact modifications.Another great thing about this tape is that it is a nice change from regular 60 minute + step workouts which can be so high impact and jarring to knees/legs. Switching to the weight intervals gives your knees a chance to recover so you can put 100% energy into all the step intervals, even the advanced.Another plus for this workout is that it does double duty by combining strength training with cardio. I use the 8 inch step height and 10 pound weights for a heart-pumping workout. I also appreciate the fact the tape is only 45 minutes in length. If you are a busy person who has a difficult time fitting a great workout into your schedule, this tape is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected.","review":"I'am a big fan of Gin Miller, but this video was not what I expected. The camera angles make the workout very hard to follow. They give you to many upclose shots of Gin's face and not the workout. If your tall (I'm 5'9\\") I found it hard to use the resistance tubing. I recommend hand weights instead.I also do not recommend this video. Instead look into Step Reebok The Video (the original and still the best) and Step Reebok Intense Moves.

Instead of getting a workout, I was worn out just trying to keep up with the girl doing the \\"beginner\\" routine (and if you think that consitutes a workout...!!!) I found this video more frustrating than anything else. I love Gin Miller's instruction but it's not enough to save this video. The camera switched angles way too many times, even at times focusing solely on the musicians!! I don't recommend this one, if you want a step video that's paced correctly where you can actually feel your muscles working, try Karen Voight's Lean Legs & Buns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good moderate-intensity, all-around workout","review":"The stepping/resistance training cycles keep this video interesting, with a good combination of moderate-intensity cardio and strength exercises. The cueing is good. I do not mind the changing camera angles or the shots of the live musicians, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. I worked up a sweat, but my heart rate did not ever get very high. For a really intense aerobic workout, Reebok Intense Moves with Gin Miller is much better, as is Kathy Smith's Fat Burning Breakthrough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT OVERALL WORKOUT!!","review":"This video gives the body a really great workout!! Sometimes the step moves were a bit confusing, but that doesn't happen often. Rotating between stepping and toning exercises is great because it gives the body a chance to rest from the cardio routines, while giving you a chance to tone your muscles. I didn't use the tubing. Instead, I used hand weights, which I personally like better since you can always change how much weight you use. This video is definitely a great addition to any workout routine!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Hobo Philosopher","review":"Needless to say, I was not surprised.

Gone are the sweeping melodic lines of ambient perfection, replaced with a stronger more sophisticated blend of rhythm and a myriad of other instruments. This Album seems to take root in as well as its inspiration from a wide bass of musical genres. The first piece on the album has a James Bond feel while the second song is composed around a Latin or African rhythm with Moroccan overtones. I think this album is a great step forward for Robert Miles and if you like the music of Peter Gabriel Passion or the hunting songs of Lisa Gerrard or even the most recent Moby releases you should love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"robert miles at his best","review":"i couldn't find this anywhere and then i found it here thanks so much .......:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different yet delicious","review":"If you are expecting something along the lines of Dreamland, or even 23am, then this is probably not the CD for you.Initially, I put this CD in my discman, pressed play, and a couple minutes later sat there thinking to myself, \\"What the hell?\\" This was not the Robert Miles that I had come to know and love... this album is like 23am meets a dextromethorphan trip gone horribly awry.However, after a few listens, I began to love this album, and it really grew on me.

I for one will stick with his first 2 albums and sell this one or use it as a frizbee/coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"USE YOUR BRAIN PLEASE","review":"I think many of his fans were expecting pop or dance music. They have a short attention spans or attention deficit disorder. Give it a chance. Give it a listen. Use your brain. He's trying to take you to higher planes which is what a musician should do. He expanding rather than resting on his laurels... which is what your ears and your brain should do. Go forward, further, move ahead, don't stay static.

While he has a bent for the melodramatic in other albums that I can deal with, this is darkly cheezy, like the music for a bad vampire movie, or an evil porno. I'm pretty disappointed in this one. The wailing electric guitars are too much, and the whole thing doesn't even come together. I'll give it more time, but I still think you'd be best to download this one from GNUtella or Napster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you for clearing that up--","review":"I bought this CD because of the name on the cover, but then I realized that this was not the same Robert Miles... just another artist by the same name.

I quickly through him into the \\"gods of dance music\\" for making a wonderful CD. THIS CD is not only annoying to listen to but I also got angry that I paid for this. Robert Miles hits no emotions or dance moves with this one. If this is what he is going to record and offer his fans he should quit while he is ahead. He owes us a huge apology!!! Maybe his next one he can do that by making the music we know should be coming from him!

Apart from a few half-good pieces up the front, the rest of the CD is pretty much pretentious twaddle that you'll never want to listen to again after one hearing. The A&R person who let this slip thru needs a good swift kick up the backside. The sales will be appalling and I hope Mr Miles learns his lesson. A costly disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"For 'trance with an upbeat' lovers","review":"This CD is relaxing, but it has more of a \\"get up and move\\" feel to it then 23am and Dreamland. This is something you'd probably hear in a bar as backround music or at a club. Not really for everyone who listens to just trance. More of something for people who have recently just stumbled across trance or Robert Miles and are curious. A great gift for people who are wondering what \\"instrumental, without words or very little words\\" means. It ties the trance world with the non-trance world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i was expecting","review":"I bought this CD because it's from Robert Miles.

However, the best way to go about listening to this album is to put what you currently think about Robert Miles aside and listen to Organik as if it were his first album. After a few listens I immediately found the genius on yet another album by Mr. Miles. I believe \\"Trance Shapes\\" is his best song to date and \\"Release Me\\" may easily be his second best. There are so many amazing sections on the CD. My only problem with the CD was that the amazing sections were not long enough and because of the experimental nature of the CD, it suffered melodically because of this. Just give the CD a listen a few times before you pass judgement and I think you'll understand how brilliant Robert Miles is regardless of your opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I hate to say this but \\"Organik\\" was far from anything I expected from Robert Miles. After a five year wait since his previous effort \\"23 AM\\", I was eager to hear what Robert had to offer musically after such a prolonged absence. As the saying goes \\"absence makes the heart grow fonder\\".To begin with it is apparent that Robert got dropped from Arista Records, because now he is on a smaller label called \\"Shatki\\" but I could be wrong. From the moment I heard \\"Tsbol\\", the first track off \\"Organik\\" I knew immediately something was not right. This was just too bizarre coming from Robert Miles, and I wasn't liking it. From there the music just went downhill. I couldn't enjoy it as much as I did with \\"Dreamland\\" and \\"23 AM\\". I understand that an artist should be allowed to grow and to develop their talents but at the same time the artist should realize that change can be difficult for his/her fans like me for example. I hate to say this but I'm sorry I bought this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it'll grow on me...","review":"I just bought this CD yesterday, and thus far am not overly impressed. It could be that I'm just not into the style...This CD is unlike RM's previous two CDs. The style (in my mind at least) has more of an Eastern mixed with African flavour to it. Sort of similar to Evan Chen. (Of Crusade fame, for those not familiar with him.)I'm not willing to say that this CD is garbage. It's not.

Whenever I read an artist decribing his work as \\"personal\\", it usually means it's going to suck. And this one does... big time! As an avid listener of this genre, this CD is a total artistic failure. With the exception of the vocal track \\"Paths\\", the album's haphazard, uninspiring and self-indulgent doodlings ultimately amount to nothing. Each track meanders clumsily into the next without a thematic arc. The heavy use of distorted guitar is totally out of place. Maybe after getting 'Organik' out of his system, he can get back to making some music with substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful. What on earth was Mr. Miles thinking?","review":"If you are a fan of Robert Miles' first two cds you'll be in for a very big suprise with this one. 'Organik' is Robert Miles' attempt to experiment with a much more dark, industrial sound and is simply a total failure. I'm all for an artist wanting to progress musically but I feel the combination of styles he's mixed together (industrial, classical, trip-hop, world, noise, etc.) just doesn't seem to work on here - I'm not sure what it is but I simply could not get into it at all. If you like really off the wall experimental music give it a try, but if you prefer the sound of his two previous cds I recommend buying albums by Chicane or ATB instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sytrinol","review":"Quality product, good price.

From the time we took it out and tried to tune it (tighten strings) it didn't work. Within the first 5 minutes that my toddler played with it the strings came loose and came off, complete waste"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frets Are Not Tuned Correctly","review":"After finally tightening down the tuning lugs in the back to keep the strings in tune when open, it became apparent that the frets are in the wrong place. So going up each fret is not quite a half step. You have to go to the 13th fret to get an octave (mornally 12th fret). What this means for non-musicians is that even if the guitar is in tune, as soon as you put the finger of your left hand on the frets to play higher notes, they will always be out of tune and dissonant. There is no way to fix this.Therefore, this ends up being just a toy. A cute toy it is. Just don't plan on playing real guitar music on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within minutes","review":"I guess the low price should have tipped me off, but the guitar is very poor quality and ALL the strings broke within minutes of my son playing with it.

This is the melancholy music your computer would listen to as the sun sets. Or these days, the soundtrack to a VW Beetle ad.The palette of instruments is essentially the same on each song, with drums, synth melodies, occasional strings or acoustical guitar backing up the various bleepery. Occasionally the band resemble early Autechre (\\"This Sandy Piece\\") or grate more than fascinate (\\"She loves Animals\\") , but as a whole they succeed in bringing warmth to cold machinery.

This book let me know that it is OK to get annoyed and for some reason that makes me less annoyed with my sister. I don't know why but it does. Emily says that she feels like the big sister and that is exactly how I feel! I don't like worrying about my sister so I don't like it when we do the same activities.

In spite of quite a lot of talk of finding fossils, the book only actually shows one. The remainig pictures disappoint. Where we are told of thin layer boundries, we get broad landscape photos; where the green to red transition marks an extinction event, we get a black and white picture where not even a change in the shade of grey is evident.This book is more in the genre of explorer's narrative: Darwin's voyage on the Beatle, Huxley's on the Rattlesnake, or even Hooker's travels in Tibet... but there is little adventure involved. While the presentation of evidences for extinction are interesting, and the author, well, authoritative, the mixture of travel and science muddles the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bags","review":"Really surprised at the high quality of this bag.

I bought this one and set it up today with a Planet Wise diaper bag. People mentioned in other reviews that if you did not use grocery bags, the lid did not open properly. So far I have had no problems getting the lid to open with the foot pedal despite the thicker bag. It is on the small side, but it fits perfectly next to my changing table against the wall.After I have used it for a while, I will update my review if necessary.

I did not want a huge pail or genie that held a month's worth of dirty diapers. This holds about 4 days worth, and is sealed tightly enough that I do not smell anything when it is full. The little lid has a compartment for a deodorizer. I use the nursery Arm and Hammer ones and I think it gives it enough weight to shut tightly so no odor escapes. I use medium trash bags (8 gallon) and they fit perfectly. For the price and size, you cannot beat this. If odor ever becomes a problem I plan on throwing a scented fabric softer sheet on the bottom of the pail. So far, a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would buy again","review":"As other reviewers noted, this pail is a little large for a standard plastic grocery bag. However, with some care one can be fitted to the opening.I have observed the issue mentioned in other reviews regarding incomplete opening of the pail lid. I was able to resolve this by repositioning the bag so that the bag does not rest on top of the lever arm. Also, if the pail comes into contact with something behind it (eg a wall) the lid will not open completely. Since the pail is light, it tends to slide backwards until it does come into contact with something. The solution to this problem is to make sure it isn't shoved up against anything.This pail successfully contains the dirty diaper odors even without an air freshener tablet.I would recommend this item to someone looking for a small and inexpensive diaper pail. Its few operational quirks can be readily avoided as described above, and for me they certainly don't obviate its usefulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Product but it Arrived Dirty!","review":"I've had this diaper pail for almost three years now - and it works perfectly fine. This isn't a fancy diaper-genie type of thing - this is a temporary pit stop to the outside trash. We put a disk-type room deodorizer at the bottom of it and then the bag, and we're good to go. It also holds up to heavy sanitizing/cleaning. and you don't need special bags for it - we reuse bags from a big box or grocery store.For some reason the pail showed up really dirty - had to wash it upon arrival, a definite inconvenience when you have a newborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Standard","review":"It was as I expected it to be!

The top doesn't open far enough to drop the diapers in. It will only lift up a few inches, then I have to bend over and lift it up the rest of the way. Not good! Defeats the purpose of having a step/hands free pail. It is okay for now b/c my baby doesn't move, but once he starts wiggling around I can't take my hand and eyes off of him to be fooling with the can.With a thick wet bag in it, the top doesn't come off all that easy either. I could deal with this if the top opened properly.I will put it somewhere else and am ordering a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even usable as a TRASH CAN!","review":"We bought this to use as a trash can in our babies' room when they were a year old and starting to get into everything. I figured if it is marketed as a diaper pail it must be able to handle simply trash! I was wrong. The pail is so light and flimsy that it flips over as soon as you hit the pedal with your foot. Nor does it close tightly. My kids were into it immediately, and we put this trash can in the trash a few days later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..","review":"Arrived dirty and scuffed.

The larger version of this from safety first is different, and useless as it leaks out air contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for cloth diapers","review":"I purchased this pail for cloth diaper storage, but I found out after two days of usage that it is not good for it because this pail can hold only 4-5 wet cloth diapers, which not even one day's worth of diaper supply. I think it would hardly hold one day worth of disposable diaper supply for disposable diaper user, which is only good if you want to dispose diapers everyday. Overall, I think this diaper pail is too small and only good as a secondary pail to use somewhere else in the house other than nursery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again!","review":"This does nothing to keep the smell of diapers from getting out. The lid is too thin. It is hard to take the lid off and on when emptying the pail. I bought it to have at my house when grandkids visit and didn't want to spend a lot. It was cheap and is worth less than I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"well made","review":"Bought for use with adult diapers for inlaws. Work very well at keeping smells inside. The only thing is they did not arrive with blue lid as in picture. They are white like the rest of pail which is fine with me. Might be a problem with someone else however.

I was mistaken in believing that this was a diaper pal. It's not! It's just a small trash can with a compartment at the top for what I am assuming is an air freshener. This is a guess of course because no air freshener is included. That's right, nothing but a few hole separates this from a normal trash can that can be purchased for $10 at your local store. Seems like an okay trash can but I will have to BUY something else to make it smell better before I but a diaper in it.

I had one when my son was first born, and then I had to buy another one when I moved, since I didn't have room in the car for it. The smell can get bad if you aren't careful. I use scented trash bags when I can find them, and wrap the diapers up tightly before throwing them away. I don't even need to put anything into the odour-eater compartment.All-in-all, pretty satisfied with this. 8 gallon trashbags work perfectly, and are pretty cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"diaper pail","review":"The diaper pail is smaller than we expected, however with the pedal we don't have to use any hands to open and dispose of the diapers.

And because it is so much smaller than most, we have to empty it more often and therefore we don't have odor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"I highly recommend this product..it's affordable..it gets the job done...no odor..you can literally use the shopping bags as pail liners..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cheap diaper pail","review":"This is great little diaper pale. You can use standard wastebasket liners (I get a 500 pack at costco) which are inexpensive or grocery bags (tight fit). There is a little compartment on the lid for a disinfectant. I use munchkin arm & hammer disinfectant pods from target which fit fine. No odor, no mess, low cost. Probably best for small diapers as the pail is not huge. Our experience is with a Newborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give negative stars...sad that this is the best rated pail","review":"Nothing positive to say about this pail. I guess you can use your own bags, but a regular garbage pail would be better.Cons:Super smallDoesn't contain smellYou can't open it with your foot, because it just slides out from under you and falls over. I absolutely hate this.This is the one time buying things based on the rave reviews didn't work out. They must have redesigned this pail to suck. I cannot see anyone who received this pail within the last couple months (May 2011) giving this more than a one star. I only kept this pail, because I just use it for wipes. I use cloth diapers, otherwise, I would have thrown this pail out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells up the room in every use","review":"It does a good job keeping the odors out. I don't like it because every time you step on the foot pedal to put a dirty diaper in, it releases the odor. I use diaper pail bags. I empty it almost every day. Sometimes I take it out in the morning. Because the lid is open the smell will escape and makes the room smell. When the lid is closed there is no odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good option for cloth","review":"I use cloth diapers and an elastic-top wetbag liner I figured the Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail could work: either bring the liner through the small opening on top, OR pull it over the base with the lid secured on top. Neither works. With the first option, the lid won't close all the way (ewwww). With the second, the lift mechanism can't attach to the lid. Either way, the opening or lid wouldn't be locked securely. Lose-lose. :-(This probably works fine for disposables, but not a good option for cloth diaperers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for wet cloth diapers (but good for the poopy ones in the bathroom)","review":"I ordered two of these to use with my 2 year old son's cloth diapers. I use a PUL pail liner that I sewed myself. We currently have one in my son's room and one in the bathroom. We use a diaper sprayer on the poopy diapers and then put those in one of these in the bathroom. For this purpose, I think this can is great. It's not very big (a plus for our tiny bathroom). I like that it has a space where you can put a baking soda disk to control smell. The pedal to open it isn't very powerful, so the lid only opens about halfway, but that's OK. The can is really too small for my son's wet cloth diapers in his room. I can't make with two days of diapers, so I think we will switch to a larger can for that purpose. We use a combination of mostly prefolds and some bumgenius, so I would guess that ours take up even less space that someone with an infant using entirely pocket diapers or all in ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought two...","review":"..and neither of them work as they are supposed to. For being \\"step\\" diaper pails, they are not simple as listed, nor do they lift, which make it very difficult to even use when you have a baby in your hands. I have to bend down and throw the diaper in from the side to get it in..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for cat litter","review":"I purchased this pail to use as a cat litter (poop) disposal. It seems to do the job. It keeps the odor inside but careful when you open it! I placed a scented tart in the lid (there's a place for it), and it does help. Suggestion, dispose of the poop at least once a day. In doing so, it won't be bad when you lift the lid. It's worth every penny! I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small, Way too small","review":"This came in the mail off our registry today and I couldn't believe they sell a diaper pail that's the size of a small bathroom trash can. Guess I should have read the dimensions more closely! Makes no sense to me why this is helpful when it can hardly hold anything. Especially for $20 for a trash can to be this tiny. I am headed out to just go buy a kitchen trash can with a lid.Also we have cloth diapers and this makes the size even more unrealistic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper pail","review":"I bought it online because I wanted a small diaper pail that I can empty once a day or 2 days. Before this I owned Dekor Diaper Pail, which got rusty over 3 year use with my first kid. Safety 1st is just a cheap backet with a lid. Grocery bacgs are too small for this backet, lid does sit tightly which makes a really usless diaper pail or a trash can. Do yourself a favor, buy a regular garbage can if you want to safe money. It will look better and you can test it in so many stores instead of making a special trip to a baby store. Plus, regular trash can might cost you even less than this cheap piece of plastic. Oh, this pail will never hold any odor, for sure. By the way, Dekor does hold odor (not 100%) mainly due to an extra lid that is always closed and opens only when a dirty diaper is pressing on it. At some point I stopped buying refills and used regular 13 gallon trash bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does nothing for odors","review":"I bought this diaper because of the good reviews however I found that it does nothing to keep out odors. I am going to purchase the odor disks I just saw on amazon. Hopefully this will help. My son's room is very small and once I open the diaper pail his whole room begins to smell and its not like the pail is filled with dirty diapers when this occurs. I would only have 2-3 diapers in there when it begins to smell. I wish I had gone with a more expensive diaper pail because I can't take the odor. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to small for cloth diapers and the foot pedal is lame","review":"I bought this pail despite the reviewers who said it was too small for cloth diapers. Well, trust them, it's way to small for cloth, unless you want to wash every day. I found myself piling dirty diapers on top of it! Ew! The biggest problem is the foot pedal. Even if you're not going to use this pail for cloth diapers, the food pedal doesn't work all that well (and we had it connected correctly). Stepping on it brings the lid up about 1 inch. Not very useful. Perhaps ours was defective. Also, grocery shopping bags are too small and kitchen trash bags are too big! Save your money and get something bigger and better functioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pail tips over when you step on pedal","review":"I ordered this pail after reading many reviews and was so disappointed when we received it. It is awful! The design is so poor that it can't even function as a diaper pail. When you step on the pedal to open the lid, the entire pail tips over. It is so off balance that placing it against a wall doesn't even solve the problem - it will flip itself over against a wall. We even tried putting a small can of paint in it to add some weight to it and hopefully prevent it from flipping over. That didn't work either! It is quite comical. Did the designers never attempt to use this product?Maybe they changed the design recently? Other reviewers had mentioned that the lid didn't open very much when you stepped on the foot pedal. Ours opened all the way.You can't easily open the lid with your hand to remedy the problem. There is no good grip on the lid to pry it open. So the flipping foot pedal is really the only option. This diaper pail is being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used","review":"I ordered this from Amazon directly and it arrived used. It smelled like rotten baby poo and cigarettes. It was also a different brand and not in any packaging. I called Amazon and they are sending a replacement. I threw out the one I received as sending it back would have been a heath issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music for a bad movie","review":"I must have been one of the dozens who actually paid to see American Anthem on the big screen; the movie that proved as actors Mitch Gaylord and the future Mrs. Gretzky were good gymnasts. This film stunk badly. HOWEVER, the music was great; classic 80's fare. The soundtrack arrived in great conditon and quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"When I was a lot younger the original \\"Birth of a Legend\\" was one of my favorite albums but since it was on cassette I had forgotten about it. I recently came upon this CD which combines \\"Birth...\\" with another album of material from the same time period. This is the young Wailers making classic songs, some of which they would re-record later on. This is vital music if you claim to love Marley, Bunny or Peter for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early stuff","review":"If you understand what you're getting, this is a great compilation of early Wailers. You have to understand the phases they went through, (which followed the Jamaican music scene in general), with early soul & r&b influences, ska and rocksteady. THis is still great music, though, and this is one of my favorite compilations of their earlier stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I received this today but had to send it back because all 20 tracks have treacly overdubs on it. I'm disappointed that this was not in the product description. Something like: ADVISORY: THIS ALBUM CONTAINS BILIOUS CHEAP SYNTHESIZER OVERDUBS ON TOP OF HISTORIC RECORDINGS. This album contains a good cross section of the Wailers' Studio One work and some songs are really, really good. Too bad someone couldn't leave well enough alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple softcore...","review":"Simple softcore storyline. Easy story with some sexy scenes and simple dialogue.

And San Francisco's Symphony has certainly improved tremendously under his tutledge. Here, they show an excellent understanding of Copeland.

It was recommended by Really Right Stuff (those in the know are familiar with their quality photo mounts) as part of their mono pod solution. At first glance from the pictures it appears to be made of plastic. It is not! It is made from cast aluminum and very sturdy. I don't believe you would risk it braking off and dropping your camera if you exceeded the weight recommendation. I figure the thumb screw will not hold its vertical position if over weighted though. It works great with my Gitzo GM5540 Mono pod!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogen-swivel tilt head","review":"Was lead to believe that this was needed with my purchase of a mono-pod. It wasn't. Unless I am too ignorant and can't figure out to use it, it was a waste of my hard earned 'shekels'. The unit seems to be of superior quality but not needed on a mono-pod. I would work well on a tri-pod not having an adjustable head. I would give it a 5 star rating on quality but give it only 1 star for functionality in my case. It is now sitting in the closet gathering dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection!","review":"Shabba Ranks - Greatest HitsIf you love Reggae, as I do you will probably like this one.

I have always been a fan of trying new music. It's like the thrill of exploring uncharted lands, but I don't have to actually go anywhere. Yet, this cd definitely took me places.I remember the first time that I heard \\"Wildhoney\\" by Tiamat. That was back in 1994, and since then, I have bought every cd they have recorded. This cd is much like that one. Not only the aspects of the sound and style are similar, but the passion, haunting melodies, and the instrumental compositions ring true as well. If anyone is a fan of Tiamat, I would dare them not to give this cd a chance. Layered with such beauty of lyrics and versatility of sound, I have been asimilated into a Dawn of Dreams fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Ball Aim Trainer","review":"This product is partially functional if a stop shot is used.
