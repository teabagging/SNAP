This is a thriller in the genre of Clive Cussler, Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn.For a first offering the author sets a great storyline that could have others build off of it. A former NAVY seal who is now on the secret service detail for the president. He not only manages to help save the president's daughter but he also manages to keep from being killed, when many people who you think are working with him pursue him. This story has a lot of wonderful plot twists and turns that keep you guessing as what will happen next.I am looking forward to reading his next story (or listening to it as I did this one) in January."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak political thriller","review":"\\"The Lions of Lucerne\\" reads like a first novel. The prose has a somewhat amateurish tint to it, as do the plot and some of the action scenes. Just one example of completely amateurish writing: there is a scene in which the protagonist assaults an FBI agent for insulting him. No doubt that is supposed to show how macho he is. Just not done, folks. Assaulting a Federal officer is a felony; any questions? Scenes like this rob this novel of authenticity. Further, the plot just does not cut the mustard. If the US President were kidnapped by terrorists there would be an uproar many orders of magnitude greater than this book envisions. And the President would not be rescued by a disgraced lone maverick. More would be telling, but really, there is not much more to be told. RJB."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I found a new author","review":"After reading a lot of vince flynn and lee child, someone told me to read brad thor. Lions of Lucern was great. I really liked it, very similar to vince flynn, but what I really liked about this one, was the location. I have been to all the places where the action was in switzerland. A good read...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the series gets extremely better!","review":"The Lions of Lucerne was Brad Thor's first book and it introduced the world to special agent/ex-Navy SEAL Scot Harvath.This is not a bad book, but I really wanted to like it more than I did. The dialogue is a bit week and the story is a bit convoluted; however, it is a great entry point into this amazing series. I am currently halfway through the sequel - Path of the Assassin - and I cannot emphasize enough how much better the sequel is!I do not want this review to be too disparaging, but compared to his more recent work - this book falls a bit short of the high bar that Brad Thor has set for himself since. However, being the completist that I am, I would recommend that you find out where and when special agent Scot Harvath got his start by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Awful Dialogue","review":"I would've given this book one star, except the plot has enough twists and the pacing is brisk enough to earn a bump. However, I know middle schoolers that can write less ridiculous dialogue. The author has an incredibly irritating tendency to have each character repeat the last two or three words that were just spoken to them. In the beginning, it was only a minor annoyance for me, but further into the book, having it occur in literally every conversation and up to 8 times on a single page, I wanted to scream. I would have thrown the book in the garbage if I hadn't been reading it on my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning","review":"I have read Brad Thor since The Apostle and I have enjoyed them all. So I decided to jump in and try the first book in the Scot Harvath series. I am very glad I did. This book was terrific. Normally, when you read the first book of an author, particularly in a series, the book has holes and flaws that are cleared up in subsequent books. Not this one. It was just as good as some of his more recent books. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot put this book down!","review":"I just finished reading this book and on an evening when I was sleepy it kept me awake until 3:00am. Then I couldn't wait to finish it the next day. I am a Tom Clancy fan, but this author will become a new favorite!It is fast paced and visually accurate. I had visited Mt.

She knows I like books about special forces and terrorists, so away we go.First off, I enjoyed the book. I kept going, fairly fast paced. I enjoyed the mentioning of airsoft (I own an airsoft MP5A5).It's obvious that Mr. Thor has traveled to the places he described, especially the towns in Switzerland. When I found out that Thor is a travel writer and produces a travel show for PBS it was even more clear. It often seemed like he was giving more descriptions of locations as filler (something Anne Rice does too much with New Orleans).The one real trouble I had was a lot of the book was too predictable. I told my wife of the start of a plot point, and she was able to predict, easily, what was going to happen in the next thirty pages.Despite this, I'd go get the book and read it. It's a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lions of Lucerne","review":"What a ride! This was wild action from beginning to end. I couldn't put it down and was sorry when it was finished.

I would highly recommend this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Built A Franchise On This?","review":"Completely agree with the reviewers who referenced the cringe-inducing dialogue, the one-dimensional characters, and the absurd plot contrivances (the villains are world class mercenaries, yet can't kill Our Hero with any of the hundreds of bullets they send his way).The protagonist and the plot of this book are also AWFULLY derivative of Vince Flynn's work. My advice is to stick with Flynn and avoid Thor. You'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money On This One","review":"If there was a zero to give for a rating on this book, that's what I would give it.

In my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"i finished reading the entire collection of Vince Flynn novels and needed something to read. the reviews of Brad Thor said i would like these if i liked Flynn, and they are right. nice easy reading books exciting and fun. i enjoyed them so far (currently reading the second in the series) the first two need to be read in order IMHO not sure about the rest.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, it's a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thriller","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I hesitate reading a lot of popular fiction because it gets rather obscene. A few of the bad guys swear in this, but, overall, not so bad. The story is really interesting. It weaves its way through so many paths that it is difficult to believe that they are all going to end up in the same place, but they do.Since it is one in a series about the same character, you know the good guys win. What you don't know is how. The bad guys are smart, just not as smart or tough as the hero.Lot of interesting details. Who knows if they are real? Who cares? They are still interesting.This is the second Brad Thor book I have read. I stumbled into the first one in a secondhand store. It was so interesting that I went looking for more. i will continue to look for them.If you like good action thrillers, I would recommend this to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Vacation Read","review":"This book is fast-paced with good action and humor. The characters are well written and the plot is nicely done. This was my first Brad Thor book and I'll definitely try another one. There were a few places where the coincidences were just a little too neat, but this was a solid 4-star read with pages and chapters going very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good page-turner, but not his best","review":"This book is a terrific page-turner -- it is hard to put the book down once you've started reading. I have also read Takedown by the same author, and it is a much better, more mature book. There is a little too much coincidence in this book, and perhaps one or two too many miraculous escapes from impossible situations. It is still very entertaining. One other thing that struck me was the similarity to The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom, down to the role of the Jungfrau in the plot. You should read this book, and read his later works to see the development of an excellent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Stern Editor","review":"Lord knows I love a good international military thriller, but in my not so humble opinion, this book could have benefitted from a stern editor. The prose and especially the dialogue is painfully stilted. Given how big Thor is in this genre, I was shocked to find that, for all the action-related goodness, he really doesn't seem to be a very good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great, Fast Paced Entertaining Read","review":"This book was exciting, fast paced and well written. Secret Service Agent Scot Harvath is the only survivor of a well executed kidnapping of the President. Frustrated with and suspicious of the investigation (for good reason!)he takes it upon himself to find the President. The only problem with this book was that I found myself turning the pages too fast in an attempt to find out what happened next.If you like government conspiracy books and covert operation books, this one is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as most","review":"Scot has more lives than a herd of cats. Just keeps going no matter how incapacitated he is from all the many injuries that regularly visit his bod. Hard to stay on track after all the fancy escapes he pulls off despite being seriously injured many many times. Incredible. Stopped reading it halfway through, don't think I'll try another one of his. Give me something a little more believable, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lions of Lucerne !!!!","review":"A fantastic read! Recently finished the Vince Flynn (Mitch Rabb) series. Brad Thor's character is equally exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps moving","review":"I am not easy to please when it comes to books. I need a story where the author does not allow the action of the story to get delayed by adding way too many details. What the room colors are, what the thread count of the sheets is, where his shoes were made and how long he has been wearing them. Who cares? Thor gives just enough detail to paint an outline in your mind and then lets your imagination fillin the details. The story never got sluggish but was constantly moving from one exciting adventure to another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluff, but fun","review":"The book is fast pace and fun. I am calling it fluff because of the material being far fetched. It was a fun and catching story. I ended up buying the rest of his books in this series... but fluff non-the-less. I would highly recommend this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottom Line: It's Entertaining","review":"This book is fairly engaging from the start. It establishes the cast relatively quickly and hooks the reader into the story in a solid way. Sure, the action sequnces are beyond believable and the dialogue is at times banal, but it still holds it's entertainment value. The characters are relatable even if the are shallowly developed and we do care what happens to them in the end. (This is not always the case in action oriented fiction). If you can overlook some corny dialogue and suspend your reality based disbelief, this is a worthy effort from Mr. Thor and most readers will find it very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read.","review":"This was the first Brad Thor book that I've read, and I will be finding more. Fun, fast paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lions of Lucerne","review":"Fast moving thriller - similar to watching \\"24\\" on TV.

It is a CD I never tire of listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par John Denver","review":"I didn't like this one at all. The phrasing on his standed hits is rushed and choppy.

Very sad he's no longer with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many great memories","review":"This collection brings back everything I enjoyed about the 70's and 80's through the medium of John Denver's beautiful voice and humane vision. There's a whole lot about the era that I would skip reliving, but the hours of listening to these songs as a young teen and 20-something, hearing Denver express his ideals of peaceful human coexistence while dreaming of a creative, artistic life, opened up my own views as to what was possible in life. I have several of his individual albums, but I wanted a CD that collected the stuff I remembered the best so I'm glad I bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Denvers hits","review":"Was not what I originally expected as I thought I was replacing an older version of his greatest hits that I had lost but after listening to this one it is so much better than the one I was replacing. Thoroughly enjoyed listening to it during a recent trip I took and will be playing it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a must buy","review":"I really think John Denver's songs has more to it then amazing melody and lyrics and ofcourse not to forget his voice.Its actually hard to compare him with other artists but I can definitely say that I feel the best listening to his songs. Although some of my other fav songs like love again are not included in this cd but still the cd has most of his best songs. The highlights of the cd are the unrealeased version of calypso and leaving on a jet plane. so, If you have heard his songs before or not, this cd is a must buy for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devine","review":"A great addition to anyones collection.

Someone was kind enough to send a replacement which also was not as expected. On the second disc there are several songs in which there is a pulsating sound on it that is not part of the song. It's distracting but too much trouble to get into again. Bottom line, Im dissatisfied with both and dont use or play either. A bad experience for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Music","review":"I really enjoy this CD, I'm sorry to say it has been a long time since I have listened to John Denver's music of this era. This music brings back so many memories for me of my wife and I when we were young and my wife was still alive. This cd has renewed my interest in John's music. I enjoy singing along to these songs, I recomend this cd to anyone, especially if like me, it has been a while since you have really listened to his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"My recent order arrived on time and in good shape. The book Blood Sugar Solution is excellent. Worth considering even of one does not have elevated blood sugar.However the CD by John Denver was a disappointment. Not the music, but several tracks on the CD would not play. After cleaning it and trying on several players with the same result, I gave up. There was no packing slip in the shipment, so there was no return authorization. I sent a letter to the return address on the package, but so far no response."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Denver Lives On","review":"This cd truly touches every component of my heart.

After all, John Denver was never \\"cool\\" or counterculture. Let me just say that, upon hearing his voice again on the first song, I broke into tears. There is a sweet innocence and rare beauty to all his songs.I suppose that singing about nature and devoted love is so unhip. But, if it is, let me hear more of the John Denvers and less of the rappers.I enjoyed every single song on this CD, a rarity these days. Loved it, loved it, loved it. John Denver is sorely missed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"We received our CD right before we left on a road trip.

(and a poor conversion at that?)","review":"This all-in-one joystick has a NES-quality port of the old arcade game Frogger. Nothing more, nothing less. It's not particularly faithful, especially to your ears -- the sound and music are completely redone. The graphics and control are nice, though.If you really want Frogger without buying a full-fledged game console, a much better choice would be the \\"Konami TV Arcade\\" from the same manufacturer, which includes this version of Frogger in addition to ports of 5 different old Konami games (Gyruss, Kung Fu, Rush N Attack, Time Pilot, and Scramble). Search for Amazon item number B0002IQOQE."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 bucks for a mediocre version of Frogger? Hmmm......","review":"Yeah, I bought this thing, as I am collecting as many of these TV games-things as I can. The version of Frogger on here is ok, at best, but it's certainly not emulation. For 20 bucks, and for only one game, I expected a near-perfect emulation (or at least a decent re-creation)of the original arcade game!As I've stated in my other reviews, I wish the people making these TV games would endeavor to make the emulation as close to the real thing as possible or just not bother. I often wonder if the people creating these TV-games even compared their work to the actual machine(s)!Yes, to those who've only casually played this game back in the day (and have never seen it emulated in MAME since then), a unit like this would probably give them some enjoyment. But, to anyone like myself, who has been playing these old coin-op games forever and even owns a few actual machines, many of these TV-game units have been disapointing, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"$20 for ONE whole game?

The sound effects and music are completely different from the arcade version. If you want to play this game really badly, but have the same sound effects and music as the arcade version does, then I will suggest buying the arcade machine (If you have the money) or go search a little harder for a better version of this.

Peg leg is also from my hometown of Spartanburg, SC and we knew some of the same people. That said, this album is interesting because it mostly features some raw, solo harmonica playing that, while recorded around 1970-72, harks back to the earliest forms of African-American entertainment. The \\"Fox chase,\\" that appears here was once the staple of all pre-blues harmonicists. Peg Leg is somewhat of a legend in Spartanburg and there are stories about him playing the harmonica with his nose and playing 2 harps in his mouth at once (both of which he allegedly does on this CD).

There were a few random lines Dave said in the movie but not enough to keep my interest, I wouldn't even recommend renting this movie.

What I got was a wonderful cross section of hip hop, from the lyricists to the musicians to the revolutionaries to the divas. The performances are genuine and as such are sometimes chaotic. Energy at such a high level doesn't always flow smoothly. But the performances show the lie that hip hop is all about sampling beats, violence and degradation of women.

I agree with most reviewers that this movie is not really funny by any means, but it gave me a new light to the comedian. There is a serious and very respectable side to Mr. Chappelle and i feel he is the next big comedian to hit our generation. I never knew Chappelles understanding and respect for jazz music and his dedication to learning Round Midnight by the great Monk. He brings up almost \\"almost\\" a philosophical way of looking at how comedians and musicians intertwine. I enjoyed it, the replay value isn't there though. There was not enough footage of the music performances. It could have been set up into 2 parts i felt, The Concert, and than his little documentary, but it wasnt set up like that. Overall i gained some respect for Dave after seeing this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expert Compilation","review":"If you want just the very best of Stax/Volt, get this box: you'll be in good hands.

Despite the superbly interesting programme, the performance is dull, and uninspired. The recording quality sounds as if you just placed two Radio-Shack microphones in each of the pianos, recorded on a portable, cassette Walkman. The instruments used in the recording may be Steinways, but it is doubtful that quality instruments were used. The entire album sounds like they were recorded on old, unmaintained baby grands, probably model M, instead of finer, larger instruments. The acoustic environment resembles a small, carpetted living room where no reverberation could possibly take place. The sense of harsh, mediocre sound as if my head is stuck in the pianos, with the uninspired performance of these magnificent work is an impressive display of misguided amateurism that deserves to be confined to the same living room where the recording was probalby made."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent TV - non existant customer service","review":"We are pleased with the picture quality of this set, better than expected for the money but it does have a major problem. Pre recorded VHS tapes do not work with this TV, when played the screen goes blue. Yes I have tried three different players with the same result. Repeated calls to customer service and technical support Are fruitless, no one answers the phone. Emails are only answered by their computer telling you they recieved your email.

When playing DVD's thru the DVI connection it looks great (so would any TV), but the regular broadcasts are terrible. Factory defaults are bland and bright. If you turn down the brightness, skin color turns either a sharp pink, or the opposite, a sallow yellow. No happy medium.Same goes for the aspect ratio.

In the beginning, the line was owned by a small company in Fort Collins, Colorado--where I lived at the time. One day I left my Voice-It in my pocket in the laundry. I took it to the Voice-It office, and they repaired it--no questions asked.Forward 3 years. I purchased another unit just after VXI began remarketing them. It stopped working within 2 months. Customer support recommended a reset process, which worked for a few days-then it stopped working again. I was then unable to speak with anyone at VXI--the CSR's couldn't do anything more, and the supervisor never returned by call.

Yes it's more expensive (about 3x) but for all the extra features and one less device to carry around its well worth it.Another possibility is the iRiver iFP-180T 128 MB MP3 Player which is only about 2x also with MP3 and Voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Product, Poor Quality Control","review":"I, too, upgraded from the VT-90 to the VT-300 for the extra time capacity. I also prefer not having to shop for foolish watch battery sizes. Standard AAA's are MUCH easier to find and last a lot longer. A volume control would be nice, since playback is loud, and that sucks battery life fast! Talking quieter into the unit improves the loudness, but fidelity fades along with it.BUT -- my biggest gripe is the cheap buttons. They gradually deteriorated over time, either failing to connect or bouncing (start-and-stop recording immediately), missing the recording repeatedly. Now, I can't even get it to operate 1 time out of 30 button presses.The BEST feature is how compact it is. Nobody else has one that even comes close in size. Too bad they didn't design a better keypad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Product Quality and Support","review":"I was given a VT 300 for Christmas. After some 20 - 25 short messages and 5 months later the unit failed to respond. I tried replacing the batteries ( 5 times with brand new Duracells) but to no avail. Upon calling VXI, the customer rep told me to initialize the unit, again to no avail. She further told me since the unit was older than 3 months she could do nothing. And NOTHING VXI did!

Five more reels that were found by guitar-guru-soulman Billy Duffy after the main Box Set was released are found here. There are 77 tracks from '86 to '91 that are basic, rudimentary outlines of some killer songs. What I love about this set is it's a deeper look into the awesome duo of Astbury/Duffy. The first set is a collection of songs done around the time of the Manor sessions, before the Cult teamed up with Rick Rubin. The Second Set was recorded during the Sonic Temple period while the Third Set consists of Ceremony tunes in the making. All these songs are found elsewhere in The Cult universe, but these tracks have a voice of their own. Any Cult fan who wants a microscopic view of The Cult during these energetic, spiritual and chaotic times in a classic Rock n Roll band, will truly appreciate this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Numb album","review":"I love this CD. Although it is dancey, it is more industrial than other \\"industrial\\" bands. It has plenty of effects and samples to keep it interesting. It is very dark but not ridiculously like Wumpscut and VAC can be. All these songs are hits. This came out before EBM lost its industrial influence and became techno music with maybe a vocoder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancey industrial","review":"The tunes on this disc are consistently catchy, moody, and incredibly danceable.

I still remember watching it then as I was just turning 20 and was facinated with The Beatles and with Rockabilly music via the Stray Cats. As far as I know this is one of the first of those \\"esteemed elder rocker jams with younger buds\\" music shows that became popular in the late Eighties and early Nineties.I will never forget the first time I saw this, when George Harrison is introduced and tears into Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby it made a huge impression on me. It is obvious that George and Carl shared a special friendship throughout, but at the end, when Carl finishes Blue Seude Shoes only to have George start singing it again, it is just one of several really sweet moments that made this show very special to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session","review":"The music performances here are first-rate, as is the cool factor of having all these incredible artists paying tribute to one of the greats who helped form their musical identities. The sound is mostly first-rate as well, marred only by some muddy-sounding drums and some vocals that could be louder.But what caused me to give this two stars is the video quality, which was obviously copied from somebody's VHS tape. And not even a first generation copy. Simply put, the video quality is awful. This artist (Carl Perkins) and his guests deserve a whole lot more respect than they were given here by the greedy bastard who couldn't or wouldn't secure the rights to the original tapes. I can't believe no one commented on this in their reviews. Had I known, I wouldn't have spent my money on this travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun!","review":"Very nice look back to the 80's with some of the best English artists of the 60's and 70's playing along with one of the seminal American rock icons, Carl Perkins. Loads of fun to watch, well executed and produced with nice sound. It's a recording of a TV special, better than most I've seen. Don't want to miss this if you're a fan of early rock, rockabilly, Eric Clapton(man,can he make his guitar sing!) or George Harrison. Ringo has a minor role, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really rockin here.","review":"I love this concert, Carl Perkins really brings down the house with some really good rock songs.

I couldn't get it to play on either of my Blu-ray machines (one is 3-D capable), so I tried it on an older one I've had for 10 years. It began to play on that one, so I settled in on what I thought would be a great hour's worth of classic performances. Towards the middle of the disc, the pixilation and freezing became so prevalent that any further viewing was impossible.

Something that is obvious factory defect (since many people experience exactly the same problem) costs more than half of the camcorders price to fix at sony service.

We couldn't stand the Trivial Pursuit -- Unhinged.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly poor sound","review":"I purchased this receiver in order to obtain optical inputs so I could plug my Apple Airport with Airtunes in and listen to music from my computer. My previous receiver was a Sony STRGX47ES, which I have been happy with. I didn't want all the bells and whistles of the higher-end receivers and assumed the sound would be fine. Boy was I wrong. I plugged it in to my Paradigm Mini Monitors (which I highly recommend!) and the sound was unbelievably poor, direct from a CD. Even my wife, who normally does not notice these things, agreed that the sound was drastically worse than with our old receiver. I promptly boxed it back up to return and have since \\"inherited\\" an STR-DE1015G from an uncle, and the sound is easily as good as my old ES model, plus it has the optical inputs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Is All I Need","review":"This is one of my favorite Gene Watson albums. His cousin, Bobbi Bost wrote a number of the gospel songs on the album and , Gene, definately does them justice. It was nice to see new material rather than all the same hymns. Very nicely done, with beautiful harmony by two of his sisters. I hope Gene records more of God's music, as he sure can sing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best","review":"I'm a huge J-Church fan, but i wasn't blown away with this collection. I think they kind of got off into this self-indulgent thing. All the songs kinda start to sound the same. That said \\"versace killer,\\" about andrew cunanan is a fast pace neckbreaker that i will dust off and crank up loud for the neighbors every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"relatively mean-spirited","review":"We own all the Land Before Time videos, and I was disappointed in this one. Although the tiny dinosaurs are cute (and so is Cera's dad's girlfriend), the characters are either mean-spirited, dumb or ineffectual. Littlefoot and Cera are shown to be spiteful, Cera's dad is a raging, lying bully and Grampa has regressed from being a wise elder to being a weak and ignored character. The plot: Littlefoot feels inadequate for being short so he tries to eat the tree blossoms that Cera's dad guards fiercely. The tiny dinos come and eat what Littlefoot knocks down, Littlefoot lies to protect himself and Cera's dad organizes a posse to hunt and kill the little ones. The songs include references to eliminating others, how bad dads are, and other choice themes I'd rather not sing aloud with my 5 year old son. This is by far the worst of the lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Adventure Yet!","review":"I watched this with my family, and I must say it was the worst adventure yet. The quote on the back says \\"The Best Adventure yet!\\" Frankly, I'm surprised that this movie got any praises, while the first one didn't. The movie has obviously been written with very young children in mind, since the plot shows almost no struggles, and the dinosaurs never leave the Great Valley. You know; this is the first adventure where Littlefoot and his friends see nothing of the Mysterious Beyond. And the Mysterious beyond is the only fascinating place in the LBT series. The sharpteeth are real cheap, and all of a sudden, enemy and enmey become instant best friends! HELP! The message is good, but the plot was cheap. It takes more than just a good message to make a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Kids - I Guess - Really Little Kids","review":"This movie has obviously been written for prescholars, since the villains are real cheap, and there's no excitement, and way too many songs. Still, pretty harsh for kids, since song lyrics include, \\"Everybody hates those little creepy crawlies,\\" \\"Dads can be a problem,\\" and \\"Stupid stompers!\\" The movie is pretty much way too smooth-flowing, with no real struggles. Littlefoot tells a lie, and puts the tiny ones in danger. We've all seen this before. Get this for an open-minded kid who knows that what they watch isn't always the truth. If you ask me, get this for a toddler, but no older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary , i'ts the Greatest Movie of all","review":"The land before time movie's are great. My children 13 and 2 both love the movies, they have 1-10. They just can't wait for number 11 to come out especially my 13-year-old. You won't regret buying this, for first time buyers buy volume 1 see how they like it then 2,3,4 e.t.c . Trusts me you won't regret it if a 13-year-old will like it so will your child. Trusts me this movie will be awesome. try it you must by this ,you will only know if you like it if yu buy it, honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expected..By The Z","review":"This one was not horrible except for the new addition of Littlefoots voice. Another thing, Aria and Jeff need voice lessons Badly! Their reprise of \\"Creepy Crawlies\\" was horrible. The semi-plot wasn't the smartest thing to do but Tria has a pretty good singing voice. With the addition of Skitter, Lizzie, and Big Daddy made a cool impression, \\"Girls and Dads\\" was the only impressive thing in the DVD. Cera's dad though is really starting to get on my nerves. He is getting really mean to Cera and it kind messed up the story line. Littlefoot's song: \\"If Only\\" was really good because it was sort of a confession why he lied and that proves that if you lie, it will only get worst. Most importantly though, The Land Before Time 12: The Day of the Flyers should be pretty interesting. The date of arrival is TBA. I hope that the sequel is better than this.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ungh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"11??? There are that many of them!?!?!?!?!?! I wonder how all of those tiny things got in there!

We worry that movies and games they play are appropriate and make claims that there are terrible things being watched out there.

Besides, according to the movie, Dad's just don't get it anyways.\\"\\"Dad's [incorrect use of possessive] just don't get it anyways [incorrect use of plural].\\"The movie is trying to give its young viewers the strength not to disrespect their parents, but to try to set them right when they're wrong about something. Parents can be as wrong as kids, you know; here in terms of spelling, but in other ways too (my own parents are glad to admit when they're wrong sometimes).The movie is still awful, but only because the animation is bad, the drawing is ugly, and Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse are funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have the LBT writers lost their minds?","review":"Horrible.

Great animation, but a poor story line. Tria was pretty cool. I also thought that was cute when Cera and one of the other tiny dinos had stuff in common.Some of those songs had to go! The only one I really liked was \\"Dads and Daughters\\". Cuz, you know what it has some truth to it. (I hope I'm not just speaking for myself!)Ducky and Petrie were totally out of character, and Spike, was well, the same.

I recently found this book in an old box in a closet and when I opened it up, the piece of paper that I used to keep over that picture was still there. I have tried to read these stories to my daughter, but I do not have the gift of the language like my mother used to have. So now my daughter takes the book with her over to her grandmother's house and begs her to read about Brer Fox, Sis Cow, and Brer Rabbit.

What this actually is, is a retrofit, consisting of a base, a collar and a different style Xenon bulb. This would be great if the lamp being replaced/upgraded was a Maglite brand flashlight. My Streamlight brand flashlight uses the Maglite bulb, but is not compatible with this retrofit (the replacement collar is a larger diameter).Due to the low price of the item I had to purchase several more than I needed to meet the minimum purchase amount.

But it's the standard story of capitalism run amok. And maybe that story needs to be told over and over, look at the early 1900s where they wiped out all the game animals before game laws and cut down almost every single tree in places like WV. There was no consideration for sustainability and now there is. I would hate to go back to no conservation.

The trees once they're processed die off for whatever reason. Again, typical liberal propaganda. Aside from the 3d modeling, I have nothing to recommend for this movie.

Dont get me wrong, I love trees and I believe in planting trees but I have no problem with loggers, if anything I think they make use of the trees before they get wasted in a forest fire. Didn't care for this movie at all. I just saw that it was produced by the same company that made Despicable Me so I thought it would be a good one for my kids... Should have watched the trailer, oh well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's a woman?","review":"How ba-a-a-ad can I be, I'm just doing what comes naturally.

While the graphics were great the delivery was not. It would have been better if they spent more time on the story and dialogue and less on the cheesy songs that filled the entire movie. Even my 9 year old twin nephews couldn't handle it.

The plot is slow, there are several scene that can be eliminated. We couldn't finish the whole DVD because either one of us would ended up distracted to do other things. Managed to finish it in three days, but also regret that we've even started. The bunnies are cute though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off by Universal again?","review":"This review is not about the movie, but about Universal's digital copy practices. My copy of The Lorax arrived, with promise of both Ultra Violet AND digital copy. The instructions to download to my iTunes send me to UniversalDigitalCopy.com/TheLorax. However, there is no such site. So where, pray tell, should I go to redeem my copy? I have searched related sites--nothing. Except they would cheerfully sell me a download for $4.95. Not feeling like paying again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I found the film to be a sickening insult to the book's author.

The movie, however, never really begins until it is almost over. It starts with a boy that wants to impress a girl because they were raised with plastic trees and he wants to find a real one for her, so you have that whole back story. But, just when you think the story is about to begin, the boy meets the the guy that destroyed the trees, and now you have that whole back story. Then you have the back story of the main villian that invented air so nobody would need trees for air. Then you have the brief back story of the Lorax and various woodland creatures. Then you have the filler of many highly forgettable songs, and if you blink, it's over. The end.

My 13 year old said it makes all business look evil, and tries to indoctrinate kids. Not a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"This movie was funny.

She loves Dr. Seuss, therefore, LOVES the movie - and can't beat the price on Amazon!As for my review of the movie, if you are a true Seuss fan, you will like his \\"corny\\" way of expressing his opinions.Now, about the movie (just in case you don't know), the movie was on the banned list In California some time back. It is more about \\"green\\" issues which would have horrified my husband since he is a Mining Engineer (tee hee). Here is an article that can explain the contoversy before purchasing it for 5-year-olds. :-)[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"My kids watched this 4 times in 3 days. We all love it and laugh a lot. My biggest dislike of the movie is how catchy Mr. O'Hare's \\"let it die\\" jingle is. I don't much care for my kids repeating that so I redirect them to focus on the more positive elements, which very heavily outweigh the negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"I am an adult without kids and totally guilty of loving Dr Seuss.

It's definitely a great movie for anyone to watch, adults and children the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone version of a Dr. Seuss Classic","review":"Being a fan of Dr. Seuss, I was looking forward to watching this animated film. It was a huge disappointment. I contrast this experience with re-watching a Charlie Brown Christmas, which was made in 1965. Although some of the animation was interesting, they went way overboard trying to make this movie into a in-you-face, fast action film. Maybe this is the current status of animation? Anyway, as a result, the filmakers of The Lorax completely lost the subtlety in Dr. Seuss's message. While I understand they need to stretch a short book that you can read in minutes into a feature length film, they probably shouldn't have tried. In my opinion, they just killed the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 hours is too short","review":"The rental was too short to enjoy with my kids taking a nap every four hours.

Actually I have not seen the whole movie. Just the first 30 minutes or so. That is how much I hate it. I was watching it with my 3 year old grandson and I turned it off and told my wife to go exchange it for a different movie or throw it in the trash.This is the green movement\`s indoctrination garbage. It\`s trying to attract young viewers with colors, music and a lame story line by subtle brainwashing tactics of global warming. No wonder they used Dr. Seuss to push this crap. They had no other character they could create. Dr. Seuss was liberal Democrat.The Lorax is a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"humans are bad blah blah blah","review":"Oi, while it nicely animated, it was sooo ham handed and heavy in its messaging of \\"man is bad, green is good\\" that it made the movie just poor.

The first movie is simple and teaches kindness to children. Therefore, I thought this new Lorax would be just as nice; I bought it for my child. When I sat down to watch the movie I was choked with the scenes of a boy and a girl (the boy likes the girl); it looked like scenes from \\" the girl next door\\" movie, something not appropriate for a child to watch. The movie is also so full of everything; confusing, and a little annoying, since you don't feel you've learned much at the end of it.

But as the movie drew on, it was clear that there wasa strong environmental and political focus to the plot. In a nutshell, it basically branded the entrepreneur spirit as moronic and evil. Anyone who ever started a small business will find this movie disturbing. A great adult version of this movie would be Atlas Shrugged. We watched the Lorax once and tossed it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor remake and does not mirror Despicable Me","review":"My kids might give this 2 stars, but as an adult that relished the older TV version, this simply stinks.

He loved the world and all its beauty, and he couldn't stop the way it went, he wanted to protect the little bears and be happy in his nature. The things I loved, the beautiful water in the land of dreams, I wish my home could be this, pink and purple trees, a horse and buggy that holds all you need, a friend like quantum, teddys to hold onto, only thing would be loving angel people.

It is however, a highly quotable, highly enjoyable musical comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"underlying socialist message is not for little kids","review":"The movie portrays corporations as evil destroyers.

So what was the point of making it a 'seussical' when singer/songwriter Taylor Swift never sings? True, the original book did say 'No one can sing who has smog in his throat.'

I was extremely excited when I saw it would be made into a full length film, and couldn't wait to see it. I would have watched it in the theatre, but I couldn't swing the funds at that time, and when I could I had other things I needed to do.So when it came available to rent online, i did it. I was pretty disappointed. Not so much for the story, or anything that was great, and that is why it got two stars. The songs ruined the whole movie. It would be one thing to have intelligent, humourous lyrics to add to the film. That would have been ok. However, the songs were inane, idiotic and did not add anything to the film. In fact they were very irritating, and as I stated before ruined the whole thing. If you want to watch it, that is your choice...however I will not be purchasing this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie EVER!!!","review":"I thought that this is a great family movie that reccommend to those big and small, it's a movie that anyone can enjoy it also has a really great message at the end.

When the self-seeking are brought down by their own selfish choices this story shows us how we can compassionately forgive those who make costly mistakes and that we can still care about those who have caused us pain. A great message for our current and difficult times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The smile says it all","review":"My teenager loves this movie.

I am a huge fan of Dr. Seuss and have been since I was a child. I have The Lorax tattooed on my leg so you get the idea. I went into the theatre understanding that obviously to make the book into a movie that the actual story, that most of us are used to, would need to be expanded on. Knowing that I went in excited to watch the movie and watch how The Lorax story was adapted to be on the big screen. I loved the story. The Lorax with Danny Devito as the voice was a great choice. I also thought that the two children characters (Ted and Audrey) was a fun was of honoring Dr. Seuss and his wife. The basic story was still in the movie and I found myself saying the lines that came from the book because I know them by heart.

Dr Seuss always did have more to his stories than meets the eye, highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moms and Dads - do your homework!","review":"Don't trust this movie! All the bad guys are capitalists and business people - but the goal isn't to be successful, make money, support a family or achieve the American Dream. No! All the \\"bad guys\\" want to accomplish here is pointless destruction and pollution. It seems that they would actually be happy being be LESS successful, but only as long as more innocent destruction is guaranteed along the way! TWO WORDS: Cliche and Microcosm.... So sad that we have come to this as a people."},{"rating":"1","title":"tries too hard to be different","review":"this movie was...ok at best. very predictable as most movies these days.

I have no idea why it is called Lorax, if you just remove this Lorax guy from the movie, there is no difference at all.I have to say this is the worst animation movie I have seen for the last 10 years. Maybe just okay for toddler who is no more than 5 year's old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to get through","review":"Upbeat songs, but it is pretty boring.

It was pretty good tho and my daughter loved it so that is all that matters.

They came across as something you would expect from a straight to DVD production, not something of this movie's caliber. It didn't do the film justice at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I bought this for my grand daughter and we had a great evening watching it.

This movie takes it to a whole different level. From a back-handed slight to believers in God, to demonizing all corporations and thematically denouncing entrepreneurs and profits. Such as the idea that the president of a corporation is intentionally polluting the air so his company can make a profit by selling people clean bottled air. Finally the city walls are destroyed presumably so that the \\"healing\\" can begin. I always liked the story of The Lorax. This just felt like a propaganda film by some Earth-First organization. I just wish I hadn't bought the electronic version so I could at least throw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say, not a winner by a long shot","review":"Preview looked interesting, but even though the 3D add some visual fun the overall movie did nothing for me.

Save your money, I wish I had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is better.","review":"All I can say is that I was disappointed with this and I really, really wanted to like it. The new story it was embedded in took over and much of the original impact was lost. Not a bad movie, but if you loved the book you may want to rent this movie first and think about buying it later. Wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely didactic","review":"I care about the environment as much as anyone, but this movie was nothing but a pulpit where anything human made is inherently bad and how the world is only good if a wild animal is at home squatting on it. For contrast, James Cameron eloquently stated his environmental position in the extra features included with the movie Avatar and is much more realistic about the balance between the wild and human habitation.I would not recommend this animated movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal, please fix your blu rays!","review":"We just got this, and my daughter was all excited to watch it, but the darn thing can't load. Oh, and how do I know it's Universal that did this to me? Because all we've seen on our screen for the past 10 minutes is little spinning globe universal logo. And the worst part is, Universal has done this to me before. We have the same problem with our Despicable Me blu ray, again with the spinning logo.These are the only two blu rays we've ever had a problem with. We keep our blu ray player updated, and we have movies from several different studios, but the Universal ones are the only ones that don't seem to work.

It's a really great movie for everyone in the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurt People Hurt People, but Love Conquers All","review":"First of all, Danny DeVito is the most ADORABLE Lorax ever! ;-) That said, \\"The Lorax\\" tells the story of a young man with good intentions but a great deal of emotional baggage. The Once-ler means well, but he is caught up in the futile quest for his mother's love, which unfortunately, he never gets. What he does get, though, is a second chance brought on by an idealistic young boy in love with an older woman (which is all the rage these days ;-) That young boy, inspired by his heart's desire's love for trees embodies the essence of \\"UNLESS.\\" The two of them, with the help of the coolest Grandma ever, changed the world.

Great cast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Ugh, used to love this book, but the movie did not capture the essence of the book.

Amazon should remove the reference in the title \\"by US Government\\" as it seems to infer that the DVD is produced by the US Government - this is completely untrue.This DVD has nothing to do with 2005 other than that it may have some 2005 web pages amongst the data - I could not see any.Its title \\"2005 Complete Guide to UAVs\\" is very deceptive! There is basically no recent information off any relevance on this CD. It has old information and there is nothing that cannot be quickly found on the web using Google. It has some newer (2004) US DoD web pages with press releases of little relevance.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not what you think","review":"As the previous reviewer stated, this product is very misleading.

Great record.","review":"I love this album so much. I've heard lots of Bill, practically everything he has recorded and I just appreciate where he's taken me musically over the years as I buy albums because they have his name on them. It's hardly ever a bum steer, but this is especially wonderful because for me it's a new path stylistically and though it's top-drawer playing it's not \\"challenging.\\" You can just pretty much snuggle right up with it. The title song is one of my favorites and the above mentioned cut is literally therapeutic when I'm stressed-out: It doesn't just soothe it reaches in and validates your humaness at the same time. I had not heard Ralph Towner before this recording and after growing up with Steve Howe and Allan Holdsworth as favorites, his looser style(mainly on twelve-string) is new and refreshing for me. A gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unlikely, but terrific, unique collaboration","review":"I disagree with the assertion that this is not for Towner fans.It all depends on your expectations. I love this record becauseit sounds like nothing else I own, yet the playing is veryfamiliar. It does not sound \\"ECM\\"ish; much fresher to my ears.I missed this when it first came out and am very gladto have discovered it; a really unique-sounding record thatstands up to repeated listening.

The network is thin and doesn't even work in some major hub airports. Even if you find a city where the network is viable, you most certainly must stand in front of a window, or go outside to connect. I travel half of each week and quickly found that the purchase of this product, and worse, the pre-paid year of Omnisky service was a huge mistake. After a few months of use, the minstrel now sits unused in my closet. I still use my Visor as my primary PDA, but I recently purchased a discounted Palm VIIx, which I carry to get wireless email. One guy at Omnisky reminded me that the Omnisky network is faster than palm.net...I told him that anything that works (palm.net) is faster than something that doesn't.

Omnisky tells me they are having lots of problems with the misntrel S. I even tried two of their modums to see if it was a defect. I love it so much where it does work that I may order another in a few months to see if coverage improves. Sigh. Supposedly the coverage at the two zip codes I am having problems with is excellent.

I can only get it to work in the Wall Street area of Manhattan. I can't get a connection from my home in Brooklyn or from various areas in Queens. It didn't work when I took it on a trip to Atlanta, either. I've gotten fatal errors when removing the modem module that have caused me to lose all of my data. I've lost count of how many hard restarts I've made.I got the modem as part of a promotion, so with the promised rebates I'll ultimately only pay about $50 for it, but it's not worth the money.Find another modem -- you've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAVEAT EMPTOR!

Thought it would be great to get wireless on the Prism and tried out Omnisky.What a nightmare.The software they sent was corrupted which required hours with Tech Support and software patches to fix. Then after that problem was solved, email wouldn't work because the Omnisky email server had problems. Then the wireless coverage was *HORRIBLE!* (el stinko!). And that's here in the Bay Area where we're suppose to be the tech center of the nation. Overall, this was a real disappointment.I sent the modem back and cancelled service.Omnisky KNOW their wireless coverage is horrible and they sell you their service anyway hoping that you'll just grin and bear it. If wireless connectivity is essential, buy a Palm VII or wait until better options come out.Omnisky? That dog won't hunt."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Major Coverage Problems","review":"I purchased the Omnisky modem/service for my Visor Platinum with the hopes of checking my email during my commute on the train between downtown Chicago and the Western Suburbs. Connectivity is spotty at best. I would say I get a stable connection less than 5% of the time I attempt to connect. NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TROUBLE.Their software also crashes my Visor nearly every time I use it.I will give high praise, however, to Omnisky's technical service. They are quick to respond and willing to offer multiple possible solutions. The problem is that none of the solutions seem to work.I would recommend against buying this product until they drastically improve their coverage area and fix the software."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for dry aging hair","review":"I have been using a very high end shampoo that can only be purchased at a high end salon for several years now.

If you own few of his Stax CD's, this is a treat, since 75% of the box is Stax material.

He cared less about the critics and the negative publicity. He was one of the greatest.I missed his show in Birmingham about 2 weeks before he died in Dallas in May 2000.Forget the critics that don't give this set 5 stars. They believe after a certain period of time at Stax his stuff got dull.

Dry wit and keen understanding of mundane episodes provide an impressing dissection of how even the most chance events are in fact due to phenomena that, though easily understood, interact in such complex ways as to be beyond our comprehension--producing the supposedly \\"random\\" results we perceive.As with many attempts to popularize science, this book is very light on theory and equations, instead explaining the practical significance of its subject.

The sound quality is good but not great.I recently purchased the Creative I-Trigue 3330 PC Multimedia Speaker System on sale from Circuit City to try to get better sound (2.1 system with subwoofer that sounded great in the store),and compared them with the Gateway for a few days before returning them.While they had better highs and way better bass, they nearly completely lacked in the mid-range - where the Gateway is just fine. For normal, everyday use - computer sounds - TV tuner -internet radio - they are fine - and you can hear vocals clearly. For true Hi-Fidelity music - I listen to my high end stereo with incredible speakers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?","review":"FINALLY, A HELPFUL & INTERESTING REVIEW OF SOME OF THE HUNDRED'S OF BEAUTY PRODUCTS OUT THERE!

You may find that hand cream or lipliner of your dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GIFT!!!","review":"I ordered one of these for every woman on my Christmas list, including myself. It was absolutely one of the best gifts and most affordable. Everyone loved getting all the included samples, which were all of high quality, name-brand products. The book is very informative and is not just advertising for new products, but recommends a lot of products, which I know are well established. I would highly recommend this as a gift for any beauty gal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book with Great Samples and Recommendations!","review":"I am planning on buying copies of this book as Christmas gifts for all the ladies in my life this year. I have had so much fun with it! I love the samples and flipping through the book looking at all the different categories. Some of the recommended products are what I would have recommended myself had the authors consulted me! For me, this adds credibility to the rest of the book. The language of the book is great too, very fun and easy to read. I am 37 years old, but I still like to be a girly-girl sometimes, and this book encourages it. It would work for all age groups - the ladies I'm planning on buying it for are mostly in their 20s. I plan on referring to this book again and again. I'm glad I got it and I think you will be too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun for the money, just keep expectations in check!","review":"This book reviews a fair selection of products in a fun manner for the most part. Special sidebars contributed by guest writers seem to be nothing but an elaborate ad for whatever company the guest is working for (or owns). The authors' writing styles are conversational but I found some of the political commentary annoying and out-of-place in a beauty book.As far as the samples are concerned, the full-sized products and magazine subscription included in my package more than covered the cost of the set. A lot of the product samples are great for travel, and the box is a great place to stash all the other product samples we receive at the mall, etc. I feel I got my money's worth with this product, even though I haven't found a \\"holy grail\\" product among their recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love those samples","review":"I gave this as a gift to a couple of girlfriends as well as to myself. It was a fun gift to give and use. I've referenced the book on a couple of beauty products and tried out some of the samples as well. The samples are plentiful and a wide variety. It's almost hard to decide what to try first. Ofcourse, the items that I did like were the higher end ones that I probably will not buy. It is a fun gift though, especially for under $15.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beauty Buyble Was A Disappointment","review":"I was by and large disappointed by this book. I expected an unbiased guide that would cover more product offerings. Their recommendations were quite limited. This could have been a wonderful guide, but instead, it left me with few options for changing any beauty products I currently use. Also, their cover sheet explaining the \\"samples\\" in the box stated that one product was a \\"shampoo\\". It was NOT a shampoo, but a scalp oil treatment...something I found out while using this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Don't waste your money. This book is nothing like Paula Begoun's book \\"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"fresh and innovative approach to learning about cosmetics","review":"Paula Conway is one briliant beauty writer. She has tqaken the time to review the majority of all of those myriads of cosmetics and comes up with an organized and easily understood way to find the best cosmetics for each of us. Her writing is sharp, witty, fully detailed, and simple enough for even those of us who are overwhelmed when reading about the many brands and beauty products out there. Paula gives us a heads up on which products we need for our specific types, and a choice on how much we want to spend. Add to that samples that fit into any purse, coupons which are worth a great deal on certain consmetics all coming in a gorgeous pink box tied with a lovely satin ribbon. What a great gift to give and to receive. I hope we hear from Ms.Conway again and again in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sample gift","review":"I purchaed this item for myself and then as gifts for my daughters. Since they are difficult to buy for, it was a fun gift -- like an adult play kit. Most of the tips were basic but there are always a few new things to learn from the book.I look forward to a new edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I have other books like this and found this one very enjoyable. It deals with regular products over the counter along with the expensive one's and the samples are a great gimic. I even sent one as a gift and my friend loved it. It comes all wrapped up in a great gift box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to hearing about the Best Products of 2007, but found the book & products a huge disappointment. Most of the samples ARE sample size except for lip balm. Very little information was given about each product and many of the products are not New to 2007. The products were rated but didn't explain why. Spend your money on \\"Don't Go To The Cosmetic Counter Without Me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off!","review":"I bought this, thinking the \\"samples\\" would be of products available in my country (USA).Most of them are miniscule samples in foil packets from companies selling outside the US. A Maybelline sample for lipstick was one of those cards found in a magazine.I don't mind wasting money on make-up, but this is an absolute scam.Oh, the enclosed book is dime-store drivel. Any person who's picked up a mascara knows more than what is in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Gift!","review":"I got one for my girlfriend, who's a big \\"products\\" person, and it is such a great thing that I got one for a friend and one for my secretary for Christmas. It solves the problem of which of the jillions of products to buy and lets the women in your life pick things for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i had already purchased one for myself a few months earlier and was quite satisfied. then christmas rolled around. i work in a beauty salon, and we weren't drawing names this time.had to get something for everyone! at a decent price! that they wouldn't say \\"ohthatsnice\\". took a chance and got this for everyone. PHEW! worked like a charm. something the same that they all find something good in everyday. thank-you.(also helps with clients)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product","review":"This is the very first book ever to be published on beauty products that also comes out with more than 30 actual samples of beauty products WITH THE BOOK. I heard about it through the grapevine and am waiting with anticipation 'til the 5 that I ordered arrive at my doorsteps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype Gripe","review":"Like another reviewer, I purchased this book because I saw a segment about it on morning TV. What a waste of money! The book is a softcover edition, very short, and reviews a lot of products I've never seen available anywhere. There were very few products reviewed that most of us are used to purchasing in stores. The samples were a joke, nothing more than a small number of tiny one-use products. This was a terrible waste of money. Self Magazine did a much more comprehensive review of beauty products in its May 2006 edition and it was much cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"The reviews seemed to be limited to a few product lines; I had no sense that exhaustive testing had taken place. Funny, the authors seemed to favor the products of the guest reviewers! Advice contradicted itself; for example, on one page it said to apply SPF before moisturizer, while on the next it said the exact opposite.The $50 of free samples I'd value at closer to $10 and not the stuff you'd be wanting to try. The whole effort screams product promotion and not legitimate recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a Beauty Junkie!","review":"First off, I am a complete sucker for \\"free\\" samples, so when I saw the Beauty Buyble in a magazine, I had to buy two copies! Yes, the products are sample sized, but what would one really expect? I was, however, impressed with the fact that the samples included two full-size lip balms, a full-size gloss/liner combo, two nearly full-size eye pencils and one nearly full-size lip liner--that alone makes the samples. Other highlights of the sample pack include a free one-year magazine subscription. For anyone who counts the days until Sephora's annual deluxe sample bag promotions, this is great. I have only paged through the book itself, but I find the product recommendations interesting. Some I would consider buying, some not. However, if you are looking for a book stashed with beauty tips, you're not gonna find it here. It's mainly focused on reviewing products, not offering helpful hints (other than in small doses, such as \\"Paris Hilton's Beauty Secrets\\")..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - terrible book!","review":"The idea for this book is great and I wish more beauty books included samples. That said, this is the WORST beauty book I have ever read. They recommend products from the same product lines again and again, making me wonder if they have a conflict of interest or if they were just too lazy to try other brands. Also, the samples are mostly from really cheap brands, with a few exceptions, and not worth it. Too bad - I was really excited about the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth the price.","review":"I agree with other reviewers who said that there's no evidence any real comparison testing was done with these products. The samples were mostly packets of skin care items. There were 3 full-size lip products (not the expensive lip-plumper-it was tiny), but one caused serious irritation, one was too dark for me, and one was too old and waxy to be useful. I was shorted one product, and the product list wasn't entirely accurate. There was also a card for a free magazine subscription - I sent it in but never got any magazines (I did suddenly start receiving more junk-mail, however. I suspect that's related.) The book is so-so at best - mildly entertaining, but nothing to be taken very seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penney !","review":"lightweight ,easy to carry my batteries lasted 1 year am thinking about buying a second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book has great breadth as well as depth. I am in sticker shock over the price, however!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Long, See You Tomorrow;","review":"So Long See You Tomorrow was chosen as a read by my book club. I found it boring and a little confusing, even though others who had read it found it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatifully written and deeply moving story of redemption","review":"This beautifully written book by William Maxwell reads like a hybrid between a novel and a memoir. It's a coming of age story. It's a murder mystery. And it's a nostalgic look at a lost small-town America. Most important, it's Maxwell's attempt to right a wrong in his own past, to somehow find redemption and release from a personal failure that has haunted him for a lifetime. If you have anything in your own past about which you feel bad, something you regret that you wish you could do over, then you'll likely find this book deeply moving. And it's a darn good murder mystery, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dull and unsatisfying","review":"Somewhat dull and unsatisfying, like some other \\"literary\\" works I've read which don't hole my interest, don't resolve problems, swimming endlessly in the inner thoughts of a person with no action or only references to previous actions. I enjoyed his 'They Came Like Swallows' because it was very satisfying, but this is too \\"literary\\" for me in the sense that it appears to be more about the writer's writing ability than the actual story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Not A Review, It's A Warning","review":"I am a voracious reader, but I hardly ever bother to take the time to review a book. I'm making an exception as a public service. This is not a review. It's a warning. Don't waste your time or money on this book. I checked out many of the glowing reviews of it, and stayed up half the night reading it, waiting for something good to happen. It didn't. This book is awful. Ugly. Boring. Crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hall of Fame","review":"This book is a gem. It centers on two acts of betrayal, one large, one not--yet, the small act of unkindness has remained with its perpetrator all his life. Wisdom seeps out of the pores of this novel. And I must add that it's heartbreaking to read reviews like the one below by \\"JMack\\" who believes that the book \\"does not deliver\\"--heartbreaking to think of how many other sublime works of literature he hasn't gotten. Sad. In any case, do yourself a great favor and read Maxwell [who was, all his adult life, a fiction editor at The New Yorker]. After this one you can read, TIME WILL DARKEN IT and the volume of collected stories published near the end of his long life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant Tale of Growing Up","review":"A most compelling, though brief read. In 134 pages this stellar author spins a tale of growing up in rural Illinois. You can feel the heat and the cold, smell the rain, hear the noises and -- most of all -- feel the passions and consternations that boys experience while growing up. The characters in this delightful book run deep and Maxwell is a master at reminding us of how things once were. Maxwell does not waste words. His plot is pure and extremely well-focused. With just a few words he can set the reader off on evocative reveries or move the story along in a riveting fashion. This is a very good book and my first Maxwell. I look forward to reading others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a book.","review":"Very well written, characters are nicely drawn. A quick and lovely read, with much food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview of Decisions Made by Britian in 1930s","review":"Mr. Levy generally does a good job explaining the reasonings made by Britian during the 1930s in their dealings with Hitler. He stresses a point in the earlier chapters that is something often overlooked by people - you can't read backwards into history! If even the Nazis did not know at that time the Holocaust was going to happen the way it did, how was Neville Chamberlain supposed to know? Mind you, Chamberlain made his mistakes. However, say what you will about his appeasement strategy, he did not neglect rearmament.I gave the book only four stars because the author's writing style is a bit rushed. He and his editor(s) would have done well to include appropriate headings within each chapter as he was beginning to write on a new subject. Most decent works of history and non-fiction do this, as it makes it much easier for the reader to maintain his/her comprehension of the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumpy and Muffled","review":"The sound quality was so bad that either I was turning up the volumn or being shouted down by it. Although the material was good and effective the presentation seemed not to have been well thought out. There were constant stops in the program just when the material was getting good. By the time it started again I had been distracted and had to start over. If they had given the content twice as much time between breaks and produced the CD correctly in reference to the sound quality, I think it would have been a very good product. Here's hoping they get it right next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality horrid, roller-coaster learning curve","review":"I should have looked at reviews of other DVDs from this publisher. Sounds (and appears on presenter) like a cheap lapel mic scraping across a collar button, plus various crackling and pops. But a few lessons sound very clear, so it wasn't the disc. Solid introduction to ASP.net veers tragically off course with irrelevant intro to O-O programming in VB. Too bad, since he's a pretty good presenter, and I learned some really useful details not clear in other sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful production - deserves a minus star","review":"This is not a professionally done video course. It's just Neal Ford sitting in Front of his PC and droning on while he rapidly mouseclicks from one screen to the next.Neal Ford is not a gifted speaker. He talks in a nasal monotone which begins to grate after a while. To make matters worse the sound quality is terrible, really its below home video quality, and it's just hard to hear what he says. After one chapter I couldnt stand to listen to it anymore.IMO Amazon owes me a refund for this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly insightful","review":"I an era where nearly everyone claims to be teaching or studying the Kabbalah, Frankel is the real thing. She brings her depth of experience and of Jewish learning to her psychotherapy patients and now to her readers. I know a good deal about the biblical and Talmudic texts that she discusses and I found her approach not only authentic and true to the spirit of the texts but also eye-opening and enlightening.Frankel tells many Hasidic stories and bases much of her wisdom and insight on the thoughts of the Hasidic masters. Here as well, I knew something about her subject matter, but she went far beyond what I knew to show how insightful these thinkers were and how much they knew about human psychology. Her treatment of teshuva (repentance/return) and of finding the good in oneself and in others are particularly thoughtful and inspiring.This book embodies the best of the Jewish renewal movement. It is true to the tradition and yet goes much farther."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and more","review":"This book is kindling for an epiphany! I had to put this book down more than 5 times and wrap my mind around what I'd just read and how profound it was for me. I found this book fresh and very insightful ( your mileage may vary )."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the heart","review":"Sacred Therapy is the most acessible book I have read on Jewish Mysticism and healing. Estelle interweaves stories from Jewish mysitical tradition with the real struggles of what it means to be human living in the world. Her writing goes straight into the heart. It is a companion for all those who wish to connect with the divine and make the most out of life with all of its trials and joys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not the best.","review":"I purchased this record influenced by the good review by Beranga. I own several recordings of the Symphonie Espagnole. I didn't have time to compare it with all of them, but the recordings by Anne-Sophie Mutter, Sarah Chang, Howard Zhang and Marat Bisengaliev, which I did compare with this one by Amoyal are all better. I did not find Amoyal warmer or more energetic. He plays well, of course, but not better than the ones I mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Naughton instead","review":"This book is built around a series of dialogues and vocabulary. It doesn't have much of the other things you need for learning a language such as grammar points and exercises. Though it's more extensive (with the cassettes), you're much better off with Naughton's book. Even so, I use Letnanova's dialogues as refreshers that give me some variation. Letnanova would probably be OK if you were working with a teacher, but you can't learn Slovak by yourself from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i got bored","review":"i snagged this cd in 1997 based on a glowing review. after hearing it i was disappointed--i'd expected something much different, and better.since then, i've played it a few more times, off and on, always with the same result. today i played it and thought better of it than i expected, so that's new.unfortunately, this album is clearly an independent (meaning lower budget) version of front 242 and kmfdm, and is kind of boring. the synth sounds were a bit cheesy to me when i got it, and have not improved with age. while the programming is accomplished, it doesn't mean the songs are well written, and everything seems to go on much longer than one would expect, or like. maybe you'll like it, but i'm just bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Meaningless Opinion","review":"Not really that great of an industrial album, some of the beats are cool but there are really no lyrics in the songs, and where there are lyrics they get drowned out by distortion and beat. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste if Time","review":"The book in itself is boring from start to finish, there is no true story telling, and most of the book is used to blatantly attack the German people as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mahavidays (she of great wisdom)","review":"This book deals with Goddesses not normally discussed in other Hindu related or Goddess related subjects. The information on the Mahavidyas is well researched and correct. the only thing about David Kinsley is that for the most part according to him Kali is wild and destructive. But he does give very good information about her. Many who are into goddess religion and spirituality have no clue about the Mahavidyas. So if you are interested in the Hindu Goddesses you will be pleased with your purchase of this wonderful book. Also he includes some real nice illustrations of the Gooddesses. The Mahavidyas are independent Goddesses, if they are with a male God, the male divinity is eighter in a submissive or in a humiliating position. But usually the Mahavidyas are seen without the male deities. I have seen Kali without Shiva. I have this book and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"countryman","review":"Our favorite pen. We keep trying others but none are as good. They are getting hard to find at the local Staples and Office Depot - thank goodness for Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy of a Rose","review":"This is a great book, full of fascinating natural history. The author shows her droll sense of humor at the same time as she presents the science.I was disappointed to find, in the last chapter, a repetition of the urban legend about corn pollen killing monarch butterflies. It would have been easy for the author to check and find that the monarch populations have been increasing since the introduction of genetically modified corn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough to buy","review":"A few enjoyable tidbits.

The included CD does not include a driver for Mac, and when I emailed the company, they directed me to shareware drivers, for which there is a fee, and when I tried one (USB Overdrive), the mouse only worked as a normal one-click mouse, and the scroll button didn't work. The much-vaunted vibration effect was completely absent. The other alternative offered by the company was to return the mouse.In addition, I bought the mouse as part of a full-rebate offer in September.

Yes, it does vibrate and make itself a challenge to keep the cursor where you are trying to place it. I must admit to not understanding why this would be desirable.It is an oversize two button USB mouse that also has a plug that provides a pass through on the sound output from your computer.So when your computer makes sound, the mouse wobbles to the intensity of the sound. Hold the mouse up to your ear and you heara real tinney version of the current sound output, and of course the little wobblie motor shakes the mouse. Oh boy, If I had paid for thisI might be real grumpy, as it is, I have a gag gift, a practical joke, or something to give my 11 year old boy to disect without much care asto whether it ever goes back together again."},{"rating":"2","title":"vibbbrrraaaates","review":"I just got the mouse few days ago and experienced its vibrating power.

It feels like MS Intellimouse and will pretty much do what MS Intellimouse does. However, after prolong use, my hand began to feel funky(?) and I ended up turning the vibrating intensity to off or very low. If you have arthritis, I recommend that you do not use it.

I am a teacher, who with years of speaking across a noisy classroom, has lost the volume needed to effectively and comfortably teach.I took it to school, put in the batteries and turned it on to try it. Immediately, I noticed that there was a feedback hum that would drive me crazy. When I tested it by speaking into the microphone, you could hear my voice, but it was not loud or full enough to project across the classroom, and the feedback noise was still audible, possibly preventing the students from hearing me.I will be returning this product and trying something that wirelessly feeds to my computer and classroom speaker system instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Value","review":"Having to teach a class in a room without a sound system after losing my voice, I was at a loss. I \\"googled\\" for a portable amplification system and found the Reizen Speak N Hear. At it's price I could not believe it would do the task satisfactorily. However, I could not afford to pass up the opportunity. I am amazed at it's performance. I clipped the lapel mike to my shirt and kept the amplifier-speaker around my waist. The class could hear me clearly while I just whispered. I was able to complete 18 hours of class, without my speaking voice, in just three weeks. That's an investment of less than $2 per class hour, including shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life","review":"I picked this book from a rack in a grocery store many, many years ago. It is a fictional story, but I found it absolutely fascinating that a story could be written about having such faith in God. It really opened my own thinking as to God's abilities and standing on His word. I would recommend it to anyone having a curiosity about the Christian walk or a desire to have a deeper Christian walk. Of course, after you have read the fictional book, then you must start reading the Bible to get a complete and non-fictional understanding of God's word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I was under the impresion that I was to recieve hardware (nuts,bolts,pins exc.).

I know his mother the legendary Diana Ross who acted her behind off in the 1st breakthrough black movie, \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" where the black cast was classy & had dignified roles is beyond proud of her son as well as her daughter Tracey who is also an actor. I'm pretty sure Diana is giving them some great acting tips because they are doing their thing, especially that Evan who is absolutely shining like a big, bright star on the big & small screen & he is definitely amazing & shining like a star in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fit Well","review":"Doesn't fit well in my Kohl tank. I had to modify it so it would fit. It works so, so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"This book left me cold in every possible way. It started well enough, with Lisa and Celeste meeting and becoming fast friends when they were young girls discovering themselves but quickly decends into debauchery and drugs and eventually death. The sex scenes (and there are many of them) are disgusting with absolutely nothing to get excited about. These two young women morph from innocent children to complete sluts and degenerates and never redeem themselves. They drop out of college to major in cocaine and hardcore music and random, passionless sex. Not once do they find love, or even search for it. Lisa seems to unwittingly believe that doing ever member of a band is a badge of honour instead of dishonour as it really is.Usually I save my books and put them on the shelf in my library. This one I threw in the garbage, where it belongs. I don't want any possibility of my daughters picking up this piece of worthless filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars for a Zero read","review":"Poorly written- timeline that does not compute, imagery used simply for shock value, characters that are unformed and unlikeable, and illogical conclusions for most. Having lived - and enjoyed- the punk scene of the 80's, I found this book ludicrous. Having survived drug addiction (even to that one drug the characters refused so vehemently), I found the depiction unbelievable. Having good sense, I found the characters revolting. I cannot believe that grant money was wasted on this writer, and I hope she finds some common ground with which her characters may be based on in the future. In addition, it would be great if she washed her hands, mouth and other body parts she portrays her characters using. We have young women growing up every day that will read this and think it is 'cool'. I was there, and it was cool. But the book is far from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why write 5 pages when 250 will do?","review":"Robert Slater's writing disappoints me. It disappointed me with his recent book about Donald Trump, \\"No Such Thing as Overexposure\\", and it disappoints me in the Martha book. It reeks of the \\"let's write and publish a book as quickly as possible using secondary sources\\" school which appears increasingly common in our bookstores. Slater repeats the same points over and over again, often using the same words, and in many cases within a page or two of the previous mention. Since he didn't get to interview Martha, the conjecturing and theorising about her life are, at best, superficial, and, at worst, make-believe. I am no fan of Martha Stewart as I am not into homemaking, but read the book as part of broader reading about comebacks. Slater's work contributed little to my thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old....Same Old..But???","review":"At least this author mentions the \\"mockery\\" strategy Martha/Mdiddy tried to use to \\"fog\\" the public.

Yes, the gear he discribes is pricey pro stuff but its guide to what is best, and from there you can judge what you need or can afford. At least you know that you need a ball head, or that composite tripods are really not worth the price, and how to test tripods in a store.Nice tips on conditions that I did not know even existed, like snow, there are 3 or 4 different ways it will expose film, all different. Snow is not white like you think, it depends on the weather. Great tips through out the book. I don't read it cover to cover. When I pick it up I just open it and read a few pages on that topic.

It is a pleasant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nature Photography","review":"Let me say at the outset that this is the best book on nature photography I have ever read. John Shaw has the last word on the subject, & he primarily uses Nikon products (35mm).Besides the stunning images he produces, he covers all aspects of this subject such as Exposure, Equipment & film (digital too), Lenses, Composition, Close-ups, Working in the field, etc.I particularly liked \\"A Seasonal Guide to Locations.\\"It's all there; nothing more to say except how well this book is put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best photography books!","review":"This is one of the best books on photography. I have several books on photography, and this is one is probably my favorite. The information is abundant and very detailed. I learned so much. My favorite sections were on lenses, film, and my favorite part: John's simplified exposure system (based on the zone system). Also, I think the photos in this book are some of the best I've ever seen. Every photographer needs to own this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great book, but needs updating","review":"I've been taking photographs and reading about taking them for over 50 years, if this is not the best book I've read on the subject it is certainly close. Mr. Shaw told me things that I've not thought of in those years and will keep in the back of my mind from now on. I'm not sure reading the book will help me take better pictures but I'm confident it will help me not take as many bad ones.I would have given it a full 5 stars but the information about digital is dated. I realize digital has changed so swiftly it is difficult for books to keep up. Even with that caveat I'd certainly recommend anyone interested in nature photography read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, very thorough nature guide","review":"The information provided on exposure alone is worth the price of admission as it were. Personally I use a Pentax Pz-1p and have no problem with the discussions when he refers to Nikon or Canon, admittedly the Pz-1p doesn't have mirror lockup (the MZ-S, and the *ist do) but I manage just fine! The book is very thorough in both technical and artistic considerations and I have seen a definite improvement in my photos since using it (although i shoot print and never have shot slides and that just goes to show the power of this book) I would go further to say that while all of Mr Shaw books are great if you had to pick just one this should be it. I would also advise those now getting into SLR photography that before you buy a camera buy this (or borrow it from a library) and read the section on buying a camera system, very useful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ease of Use","review":"When you see a terrific photo, it screams \\"great\\" at you. For those of us who love great photos but have a difficult time with all the numbers, combinations, and what changes to make on the fly, this book was a breath of fresh air. Shaw tells you in plain English what makes a photo good while bouncing along in a Land Rover in the wilds of Africa or comfortably entrenched behind a tree with your telephoto lens trained on a native village in rural Mexico. He writes simply, with lovely concision. The two of you could be sitting in your living room chatting photography. I love that approach! Because the book is fairly heavy and wouldn't fit in my camera bag, I copied the needed chapters and stuffed them in. Perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anachronism","review":"This is listed as the \\"updated edition.\\" That is true but it was updated almost a decade ago in 2000, which explains why the book is based on film photography. It is also a beginner's book almost entirely devoted to hardware and equipment as is stated by the author in the preface: This is a book about John Shaw's cameras, lenses, tripods, and film. It is not a book about capturing great nature photos. If you don't know about aperture, speed, ISO, or depth of field as applied to 35mm film cameras then this book is for you. If you are looking for guidance on the techniques used to capture great outdoor photography you are advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pictures, not-so-useful information","review":"I love John Shaw's pictures (they're very inspiring!). However, I didn't find the book useful. Subscribe to a decent forum on the web, and you'll find more relevant, up to date and detailed information than what's found in this book. Check out wikipedia, or g**gle any question you may have. Don't spend your money on this one or on Shaw's Lanscape Photography.If you want to learn nature composition check out this one: The Art of Photographing Nature by Martha Hill (Author), Art Wolfe (Photographer). That one is a timeless book for budding photographers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"I must say this book has exceeded my expectations. So far the best book I've red. It is very well and understandably written. Very nice pictures. Yes, it is true that John describes usage of an analog camera, but the exposure principles are very well applicable to the Digital SLRs. I find it very useful especially for beginners. I believe also advanced users may benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"All good things end","review":"This book was in it's day a great book worthly of a 5 star rating but time has a way of making material irrelevant. Probably half the book deals with photography lessons that time won't change but the other half deals with equipment and how to use it. Having been published in 1984 all the equipment information in it has become outdated.The book was written before digital photography was even a dream,eg: TTL flash metering was the new thing, but we have gone through D-TTL and now have I-TTL flash sysems out.There is simply no reason to purchase a book that is simply so far out of date, a great book in it's day, but that day and come and gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap--cheap","review":"I purchased this music box thinking that with the music and the train it would be a wonderful addition to our Christmas decor.

Yeah, so what? Thank god Sex Noir isn't like that. It's not so much \\"erotica\\" in that sense because the stories don't follow formula.

There is no other book like it. The author has done a masterful job of bringing insight and understanding to a potentially dense topic, mixing humor and wit with explanations of each of the many dynasties and powers that controlled Naples and made it a royal center comparable to Paris and London. If one is interested in knowing more about the history of Southern Italy, this book makes an excellent companion to a book by Tommaso Astarita:Between Salt Water And Holy Water: A History Of Southern Italy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid Writing","review":"While the subject is fascinating, the writing puts me to sleep.

But it should be said that this disc contains one of the best FLA tracks ever! 'Plasticity' just grabs you and pushes you straight to the dancefloor, fuelled by an overwhelming sensation of machine-driven panic... Actually, the song is not very original as it combines all the typical FLA elements, but the formula is so perfect you just can't resist! The second track ('replicant') is more classical, an average product of the 'Hardwired' period, I would say. Finally, the 'zero' remix of the title track by Haujobb is quite cool and atmospheric, but lacks the intensity of the original. Anyway, this true genius track should be enough to make of this EP a precious collector's item."},{"rating":"1","title":"psche","review":"Plasticity seems at first a song they should have forgotten to include in Hard Wired; but the beat is more danceable and then, mainly after listening to Flavour of the weak, everything is explained, even if Fulber was still here and not Peterson yest. The problem with this song is the voice: it's weird but not cool for me. I don't exactly like Leeb's voice, but on this song I abhor it. Besides, the song is not very original; the other song is as mediocre that one understands why it's not included in any album. Not even the samples from the film 'Cronos', with Federico Luppi's moaning (one of the best actors I've ever seen) can save the song. Leeb and co were a bit stagnated at this time, actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"MF Doom opens the gates..","review":"If you loved KMD, or the subsequent releases by Zev Love X, or MF Doom, or whatever he wants to call himself, this album may be right up your alley. With chaotically sample heavy beats that are worthy of their own instrumental album (*ahem*), the M.I.C. crew takes turns spitting non sequitur/street edged raps that remain just fresh enough to keep you riveted without having to think about anything other than the gritty and seamlessly good beats that house this album.While more lyrical heads may not be feeling it, this album is a definite buy for heads who love a well produced and original sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new monster, with a completely different sound!","review":"(...)Straight out of the Wu-textbook this team of MC's take the guise of big city destroying monsters (instead of kung-fu steel-o) and proceed to FSU, lyrically. Lyrics come hard, gritty and sometimes tongue twistingly fast. I've been listening to rap obsessively since the late 80's and this makes my (slightly) jaded ears prick up.The beats are some of the freshest sounding I've heard in the hip-hop scene for awhile. No gimmicky hooks. Just wicked sounds. X-ray puts together some fat joints (in fact, most of them), with a few from King Ghidra (the masked one). Not to discount the lyricism, as they are excellent, but the beats make this album.A true 'no track skip' album.Regardless of whether the Czars blow up, which doubtless Doom will, the commercial sh*t pales into insignificance.You don't own this?

I thought the King Geedorah album boasted stellar, thematic, production, tolerable skits, and street-wise but deep lyrical content.Doom is on the boards for about 1/3 of the tracks on 'Escape...' All have the stereotypical Doom sound, with the only standout being '1,2...1,2.' The X-ray produced tracks are minimal, but generally sound stiff, lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines, few sampled melodies. I did like 'Warning (Kong),' which has a nice, minimal, dark groove.The lyrical flows have a classic New York sound, pretty good. Lyrical content is pretty bad, unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d$&*."},{"rating":"2","title":"stylus","review":"Looked for this for my husband at all the phone stores, Best buy, dicount stores.

It is amazing that Palm can have a product as long as they have had the Treo 650, and not have a good alternative for a stylus replacement. The stylists, while it functions okay as a stylus, fits so loosely in the stowage slot that is easily lost. I lost the first one within two days of receiving it. On subsequent units I have a put a gab of silicon sealant on the top of the unit to help keep it in the slot.By the way, I never use the pen functionality.

Using Atkinson's approach will turn your next boring presentation into a thing of beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Approach to Presentations","review":"I ran across this book while researching a college workshop on perfecting presentation, dealing with public speaking and effective use of PowerPoint. As one who has suffered through numerous electronic slides that did little or nothing to augment the speaker's efforts, I was delighted to see this fresh and innovative approach. I believe this process works best, however, when one's speech is primarily persuasive in nature. Although these ideas helped me set up a strong introduction and conclusion, in a recent lecture I resorted to bullet points for the material I felt the students had to master. Perhaps as I get more used to Atkinson's technique, I'll better about using it in lecture. However, the business applications seem quite worthwhile. My students' workshop presentations that used his techniques were highly engaging. I highly recommend this book and the supporting web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and Inappropriate","review":"I was hoping this book would provide insights into how to present complex information in a more comprehensible, useful format, using PowerPoint as the tool. Instead, the overall gist of this book is that presentations should be \\"dumbed down\\" as much as possible. The theme the author presents is that presentations should be story based. This is reasonable. However, the method the author recommends is that essentially *all* meaningful, complex (or, as the author prefers \\"boring\\") content be removed from the presentation. Presentations then become nothing more than catchy headlines and colorful graphics. All content should be in the presenter's notes (not typically to be provided). This is juvenile and useless and frankly reflects a complete lack of understanding of how presentations are made in a complex business environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Not","review":"For those wanting the add FX to their PP presentations - this isn't the book.

First Microsoft gives us this omnipresent program that has bullets on every slide - and then Microsoft Press churns out a book that looks at a different way of doing things. But in the real world, the bosses demand bullets. And someone should make their mind if they want to live in a world without bullets?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but ultimately disappointing","review":"The message of this book is simple: tell a story with your PowerPoint slides. Sound like a great idea---and it is---but not very practical. Most of the clients for whom I work WANT bullets and, in fact, the delivery of the type of information they supply is bullet-summary stuff.So the real challenge I've faced with clients is to take standard bullet slides and make them interesting, informative, attractive and conceptual. I was hoping that this book would bring new insights and suggestions to that challenge. Not so.Also, this book screams for more examples...tons of them, in fact. Many \\"before and after\\" examples would be extremely valuable. And a web site with real-life examples and ideas might just persuade me to abandon \\"bullets\\" and take up storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Friendly Tutorial on a Better Way","review":"The heart of connections is story telling, and Atkinson's book gives step-by-step instructions on applying this approach to effective PowerPoint presentations, including web-based templates to smooth the way.

She has indicated in her book that the bookseller said to her family to take care of the author otherwise they will be punished....this is a very common sentence used by Afghans...it doesn't mean that the author will really punish the family members.....this shows the hospitality of Afghan people, not of their brutality.

THe author had met an outgoing and ecumenical bookseller in Kabul, and he invited her to come live in his family and write about them. She did, and you'll fall in love with some of these people - but not the bookseller. Turns out he's greedy and will do anything for a buck. He's educated but sees no value in educating his children - he puts then to work in his shops instead. You'll love the description of the women going to the markets to shop, clad in their burkas - and the fancy footwear that distinguishes one blue form from another. Turns out the bookseller didn't like his portrayal and filed suit against the author - don't think he has a leg to stand on. Great book, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!!!! Life in Afghanistan, life behind the burka.","review":"Well done!!! What a fantastic view of the life of a family in Kabul, Afghanistan as they live. Seierstad, a journalist convinces Sultan Kahn to live with his family and write about their daily life. This is not a journal or diary as you may expect. The author crafts this book to read like a novel and you are there as a member of this family. Surprisingly, she does not seem to hold back in her portrayal of the male role in the family especially Sultan (father) and eldest son (Mansur). I highly recommend this for anyone looking to experience as the author did by living life behind the burka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Fiction, Questionable Reality","review":"Sometimes the best fiction is that which is grounded in some degree of reality. If Asne Seierstad is looking to write a wonderful fiction novel, a novel that reflects more of her journalistic intuition than reality, then she has succeeded.If she was attempting to write a reasoned, insightful, factual account of her time in Afghanistan, she failed miserably.This book reifies all the comfortable, consumable stereotypes about Afghanistan and the Afghan people that exist in our media. Men bad, women good. End of story. No accounting for ethnic differences across the diverse landscape of Afghanistan, no accounting for differences in religious belief, no accounting for socioeconomic conditions.Setting aside the brutal truth that this book laughably fails at being serious, it's a good story. Just take it for what it is: A nice piece of fiction grounded in the gritty reality of post-Taliban Afghanistan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully Truthful","review":"This, too, was a book club selection that I did not choose to read. It was difficult to get through due to the harshness they have to go through over there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookseller Of Kabul","review":"This book was an easy read and could be read by teens interested in other cultures.It details the life of a family in Kabul and shows the complete domination of the senior male which is the cultural tradition. It is not only the females, including his two wives, but also his sons who are completely stifled by his rule. I'm sure he doesn't perceive himself to be a bad man or even regard that he is ruining so many lives.He is simply folowing cultural tradition. But one cannot help but share their despair.I understand the bookseller is contemplating a lawsuit. I think the author was extremely fair to him. I think the real problem is that this was the first time that anyone in his personal life did not submit to his control. And it was a woman! His honor and the imperative that he not appear weak have been severely threatened in his eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"This book describes the culture of a family in Kabul. I know it's important to understand the truth about the world, but after reading about 3/4 of the book I decided to stop. I found the descriptions of violence and sexual abuse too disturbing. For me personally, is was too sad and depressing. If you are like me, read \\"Three Cups of Tea\\" for a more uplifting book about Afghanistan."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Like A Novel","review":"........A strange but well written book which reads more like a dime store novel, but manages to grip you anyway. It's sometimes hard to understand where the author reported factual information and where she may have fit the characters into her own idea's of Kabul life. Unlike some of the other reviewers I dont see it as a \\"men bad, women good\\" kind of story. All the books character's are prisoners of the crippling theology known as Islam. Where else, but in Islam, and it's, repressive Sharia laws, do you find a people so afraid of any emotions and feelings; where even children's dolls were seen as threats to their image of god. More and more I see Islam as a threat and this book convinces me that those who believe in religious freedom must confront Islam, either with ideas, or with force."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible cultural insight","review":"This is one of the best books I've read.

In particular, the plight of women in Afghan society, while originally not the focus of the reporting, emerges as the most tragic aspect of Afghan life. While other reviewers had issues with the style of reporting (reads like a story), this to me is what makes this work immimently readable. This book will stay with you long after you read it and Ms. Seierstad has a wonderful reporting style. This is a classic for the ages and I hope we see more from this extremely talented and insightful young woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful look into Afghan culture","review":"The Bookseller of Kabul truly gives a representation of an Afghan family, shortly after 9/11. The book provides information that may never have been glimpsed had the author not lived with the family. Truly an intriguing, sad, shocking, emotional book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping audio evocation of post-Taliban life in a personal vein","review":"The audio version of this book is very expressive and compelling. It could be faulted slightly for being a bit too expressive, perhaps more than the writer intended. The audio interpreter occasionally injects an edge to her rendition that may be over the top.The family life portrayed here is dysfunctional and patriarchical - with a vengeance. Both men and women are locked in a sad cycle of pre-determined roles that leaves little room for grace between the sexes, and there seems to be very few mechanisms to change things for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"a look at Afghan life","review":"An excellent book: engagingly written, and compelling in its subject. One will surely feel frustration with certain aspects of Afghan culture, but understanding the patience that the author must have exhibited in her chronicling the story of an Afghan family (though not, she notes, a typical one: rather the opposite) gives one appreciation for the real vale of good journalism in an age of sound-bytes and dreadful reporting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I was suprised to love this book. I'd bought it for my mother and she had already read it so I kept it. It felt like it was a work of fiction in that it had pace and was intersting on a number of levels.The fact that it is true makes it all the more interesting. What I couldn't get over was the incredibly tough lives women have over there, if you can call them lives. We are so incredibly lucky that we can go out of the house without an escort and can shop freely and wear what we want. I would recommend this book even for people who think they wouldn't be into books about real lives in foreign countries. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover belies the content","review":"While I \\"kinda\\" liked this book, I was disappointed. It was less about the \\"heroic\\" bookseller the cover blurb describes and more about his weary, war-torn, and ruled over family. I found him to be less sympathetic by the end of the book than I originally wanted to. I will probably never understand the Afghani-Muslim culture in this part of the world and like as not ever read this book again. I understand that Sultan Khan has printed his own \\"rebuttal\\" book about this life. When it drops down from $30 to a lot less, I might buy it. Apparently he writes his own description of the book. \\"There once was a bookseller from Kabul\\" I believe the title to be. He appears to be very angry over Ms. Seierstad's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad!","review":"The book has a good idea but executes it very poorly.

If you want a good book about this area read The Kite Runner instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed.","review":"I did not particularly enjoy reading this novel, simply because I didn't come away with anything. After finishing the book, the only thing that I gained was insight on how this particular family lived from day-to-day. I also want to clarify that this particular Afghan family was extremely oppressive and this is not how the majority of Muslim families are like-in fact, the behavior of the characters and their attitudes towards women is extremely backward and is not what Islam teaches. Based on some of the other reviews, it seems that the author did not do a good job clarifying this point. This novel is not in any way reflective of the \\"modern day Muslim world\\", as indicated in one of the reviews below. If you want to read a novel/journal about the life of one particular Afghan family through the eyes of a foreigner, then read this book, but do not expect to come away with much more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Compelling","review":"I read this book early into my year as an American military advisor in Afghanistan. I found that the picutre of Afghan family life that it painted was very helpful in understanding the lives of the Afghans I dealt with every day. Because of the insight, I felt better able to communicate and build rapport with my Afghan friends. The book discusses frankly the disadvantages of women in a cultural context. If the Global War on Terror is a campaign to win hearts and minds, then this book is a must read in order to understand the hearts and minds of the people on the front lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction","review":"...first of all, it��s quite convenient to have some geographic knowledge when your writing something; when the previous reviewer wrote that Siza reconstructed a burned out section of an Italian town, he should know that this town is Lisbon and Lisbon is not in Italy but is the capital of Portugal! I my opinion the introductory essay is very good, it presents the ideas of one of the great architects of the moment, it��s true that the book lacks some references to other important projects of Siza, but you can��t have it all��Siza has proven to be amongst the most coherent and complete of all architectural works this century. This coherence is not based on stylistic repetition: it lies in the progressive evolution of the act of designing and, as such, Siza��s work is immediately recognisable wherever it be found.

If you just a moment take a look at the crime rate in America and look at the condition of that city Tijuana, do you want to have that type of crime in this country.I am sorry that I wasted my money on this book.

I was aware of the tragedies and the poverty that the people faced in Mexico and in TJ. However, I do believe that this book was not written to inform others of the bad fortunes of its charachters. I believe it was written only to gain sympathy for those that are suffering. The book's agenda was simply to make us feel guilty for all the blessing that we have in America and take for granted.

She prods gently but persistently at themes of love, loss, nature, and the dreamlike to create a complex, luminous world all her own. Sometimes verging on a unique version of magic realism, other times plainly, intimately blunt, Endrezze's lyricism falls somewhere between Rita Dove and Gretel Ehrlich. The people in her poems--daughters, sons, lovers, husbands--merge with horses, birds, foxes, trees, stones, and sky to form raw but often poignant poems spun in a language as elegant and acute as the images impregnating it.

This spirulina is TOP OF THE LINE and makes you feel so good, not to mention how healthy this is for you. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRAND OF SPIRULINA. To me, NOTHING CAN COMPARE. If you're looking for the ultimate protein source, without causing a build up of uric acid in your body like a lot of milk based protein powders can cause, then use spirulina.

I just finished another book \\"The Domestication Of Transendence:How Modern Thinking About God Went Wrong\\" by William Placher who dealt with late medival and 17th century writings. So I needed to start further back to have a good foundation for knowledge of Christian thought.What I discovered in Wilken's book was a well-ordered, easy-to-read narration of much more than a historical account. He explores what is behind the ideas and the doctrines of the time period from the ressurection to the 7th century.This book was very enlightening and I look forward to further readings on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing","review":"Point: The era of the early Church fathers was not an age of darkness, nor even a stepping stone on the path of faith. These men were deep thinkers who sought to know God.Path: The author traces a variety of topics through the Fathers in order to expose their beliefs.Sources: He cites many of the fathers but focuses on Origen (3rd century), Gregory of Nyssa (4th century), Augustine (5th century), and Maximus the Confessor (7th century).Agreement: This is a helpful survey on the early Church and her thoughts.Disagreement: The author comes from a Catholic background so there is obvious factors which he stresses. The composition was not as easy to read as Ferguson's \\"Early Christians Speak.\\"Personal App: I need to read Augustine's \\"City of God.\\" The early Church fathers did not possess a refined understanding of everything we have today, but we do not possess near the devotion they had.It would be worth another read. I would recommend Ferguson first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent writing on the Early Church Fathers","review":"Wilken wrote an intelligent and engaging book on the early Church Fathers. He focuses on Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine and Maximus the Confessor. These fathers present much of the important material of early Christian thought, but without ignoring other Fathers. He does a good job at capturing the biblical window through which these Fathers viewed their world which at the same time included the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition.

I have read it and re-read it serveral times. I never travel without this book and my bible. Some of the arguments in this book I sensed dimly or indirectly before I read the book but this book as other reviewers have said, makes one realize what can still be learned by these early church fathers, partularly St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. Wilken has the learned authority of a C.S. Lewis and the faith of a Thomas Merton. This is a book that will be read and studied one hundred years from now and probably beyond that. I can't imagine a a better book on this subject being written in this century.Most importanly THE SPIRIT OF EARLY CHRISTIAN THOUGHT:Seeking the Face of God is an antidote to the moral confusion of our time which thinks pure reason is sufficient and that there is no such thing as legitimate authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who would know more about their roots","review":"This book provides an intriguing overview of Christian beliefs, practices and worship during the relatively early years of the Church. Much of this is ignored by or unknown to American Christians, especially evangelicals whose theological roots go back only 500, and sometimes hardly 100, years. Besides the scholarly footnotes to be expected by a university professor the author provides 11 pages of suggested additional readings broken down according to each chapter.This is a LOT of thought-provoking material for the lay reader to absorb so I need to start rereading it again already.Recommended for Christians who seeks to ponder the roots of their faith and how our early brethren thought about Christianity in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Academically Devotional","review":"Dr. Wilken's book is both historically informative and spiritually challenging.

They force me to reach too far for the mouse. This keyboard minimizes the distance between home row typing position and my mouse. It also lies very flat, so my wrists don't have to bend upwards. The Fn key does not duplicate the functionality of my IBM laptop Fn key. Also with my laptop, it seems Numlock and Fn are both needed to enable this keyboard's number pad, but I don't plan to ever use that feature anyway. Occasionally I bump the Fn key in the corner which causes some of the number pad keys to not work, but another press toggles things back to normal. I might pop the case open and tape over the Fn key.

Terrible! (I sat through the entire movie.)","review":"Gormenghast is one of the worst movies I've seen, excluding martial arts action films. Most of the characters were utterly without depth or interest, being overdramatic quota-filling morons. The cast consistently overacted. They were ridiculous, but not enough to be funny. The beginning was hard to follow because there wasn't proper explanation between scenes for those who haven't read the books. Some parts might have seemed profound in the book but were unnecessary extras in the movie, like the girl Titus decided he loved.Fuschia was a neurotic bimbo, and extremely annoying. Her drowning was instant. For the sake of accuracy, it should have been much longer and more excruciating.The only good character was Steerpike, who was evil and by the end very hard to sympathize with. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is simply beautiful, though, and it's very hard to dislike him in the role. Watching his face was the only reason I stayed to the end of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gormenghast DVD","review":"I was disappointed with the story content. It was almost silly and the character played by Jonathan Rys Meyers was too comical to be sinister. It came across as more of an adult fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor rendition","review":"I really enjoy the Gormenghast novels, and BBC movies, but this film was really poor.

SLOW , SILLY UNINTERESTING AND JUST PLAIN LOUSY. SO SORRY I PURCHASED IT. DON'T ALWAYS GO BY WHAT AMAZON RECOMMENDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Adaptation","review":"Whenever someone decides to make a movie adaptation of a book, fans of the book cringe. The tendency of directors to \\"adapt\\" the story line for the on screen version can often leave a bad taste in people's mouths. Luckily, Andy Wilson did a fantastic job staying true to the text. With no real story line changes and only a handful of noticeable omissions for the sake of time--remember it often takes Peake 50 pages to describe a 2 minute sequence--I think Peake would have been pleased.The cast did an excellent job and I was thrilled by the performance of the actors. Steerpike, the Countess and Prunesqualler all shine in their depiction of the characters. The immensity of Gormenghast is wonderfully portrayed through the use of special effects.Read the books first, and this movie will compliment them well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gormenghast is dazzling!!!","review":"Watching this movie for the first time one tends to be overwhelmed, but Gormenghast does tend to do just that but in a very intoxicating way. Every character has their own unique charms beautifully brought to light by a fantastic cast. This cast is very diverse from veteran actors Christopher Lee (Mr.Flay, dedicated manservant of the Lord) and Ian Richardson (ritual bound and not so mentally sound, Lord Sepulchure Groan)to less well knowns like Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Steerpike, Kitchen boy driven by revenge). I first watched Gormenghast to see Jonathan Rhys Meyers performance and was very pleased with all I saw including visually stunning sets and costumes, actors that really seemed to take on their roles and a good plot from beginning to end. Gormenghast does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush and magnificent rendition","review":"From its bizzare sense of humor to its deranged social structure, Mervyn Peake's masterpiece translates superbly in film. This is a wonderful satirical and poignant look at the narrow world of a dying hierarchy. Nothing is sacred, except honor. Christopher Lee's Flay enforces the great code with protective conviction. Pay close attention to the furious mutterings of Barqentine. He fires off some of the best curse-spitting tirades ever uttered. Celia Imrie's Gertrude is the epitomy of aloof negligence. Though every character is something of a caricature, each is portrayed with great attention to the affection and intention of the novel's author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gormenghast DVD","review":"I recommend everybody to get this dvd.

Superficial, fleeting, poorly directed with a pathetically shallow screenplay. Everything is wrong, the sets, the characters, the story line, the only good thing about it was Christopher Lee - basically an awful rendition of one of the Classics of 20th Century literature.AVOID this, and AVOID if you haven't as yet read the book - as it will taint you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is the most wonderful video of all time!! The actors are extremely talented, The script but funny and terrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully boring.","review":"The costumes and art direction are very good, but the characters are very stale and boring. The main character, Mr. Steerpike, is a mad ambitious conniving Hamlet-like character. The actor who plays Mr. Steerpike, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, is embarrasingly bad. The overacting in the movie is so awful, I am ashamed to admit that I watched through the entire production. I have not read Mervyn Peake's series on which this movie was based, but I can absolutely recommend reading the novels instead of watching this sorry piece of filmaking. What a waste of time, talent and money! Barf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice art direction, I'll give it that...","review":"Anything Ian Richardson does is worth full attention, but the acting by the younger leads is embarrassing & the lines sound like weak warmed-over watered-down Lewis Carroll.

Too kewt by a couple of light-years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD transfer of beautiful series","review":"I just received the new NTSC \\"widescreen\\" DVD version of Gormenghast (ISBN 1419838172). It is the worst DVD transfer I have seen. The original series was shot in widescreem (1.66:1). The Region 2 PAL version (which I also have) shows the full picture full screen (on a widescreen TV) with excellent sharpness and detail. The new NSTC version I am describing in this review is cropped heavily and has black borders on all four sides; it is also as fuzzy as a cheap VHS tape.Bottom line - do not waste your money on this new DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"No film of a book will ever, ever match up to what images have been conjured in ones imagination, with this in mind I was prepared for the let down. However, no matter how much I have tried I cannot get myself to like it. Prunesquallor for one seems more serious than in the novel, his annoying laughs are missed. Another thing, the dialogue seems so cheesy on film, it is unwatchable at times. To be fair this isnt the worst adaption of a great work of literature, some performances (Steerpike's for one) are not bad. I just think that this could have been great, if only Terry Gilliam had got to it first. A dark trilogy turned into a light comic drama, if you like that sort of thing and havent read the books then you might like it, if you have read them then try not to allow your memory to be tainted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read the books instead.","review":"For the [price] you pay for the DVD you could buy (at least) the first two, and most satisfying, books of the trilogy in hardback and own one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. As small screen entertainment, Ghormenghast fails to capture any of the scale and drama of the Peake masterpiece and you'll watch it once (if that) and wish you hadn't.This really is dross..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BBC makes an epic fail with Gormenghast","review":"The casting, acting, directing, screenplay and sets are all third rate. If you are a fan of Mervyn Peake or never read his books I failed to find one reason for you to watch this DVD. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was brilliant in \\"The Tudors\\" but in as Steerpike he is silly, superficial and all wrong for the part. Nothing saves this BBC production in my opinion. My copy is in the trash so no other poor sap makes the mistake of trying to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are people complaining?","review":"Basically its the same old Aesop Rock with better production, an improvement if you ask me. To all those who say he doesnt make sence and babbles, no duh, thats nothing new.

(The fact that I've done everything save tatoo his name on my @ss should prove my credibility.) Contrary to the above reviewers confused review, Mr. Higgins hits the nail on the head in saying the lyrics are incomprehensible. He doesn't mean complex, duh, he means you can't hear a word he says. That's the biggest dissapointment. To hear babble in the place of rich, dense lyrics of the poetic genius is a tragedy. Yes, Def Jux gets an A in the innovative department, but the noisy, lagging beats impede the momentum of Aesop's rugged,intense voice, which blockhead's beats so perfectly complimented. It's as if a futuresque instrumental was overlapped by hastened, spouted lyrics; the results being a mismatch. Notwithstanding, nothing can dillute my obsession with Aesop, not even this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Aesop Rock just stop rapping, and just write poetry.","review":"Ok, i like hip hop and this is all over the place. Aesop Rock rhymes are just fired out of his mouth. He dosn't give u time to listen to his rhymes. Also the rhymes his spittin either don't make sence or are just plain stupid.

If this is the future of hip hop, count on me to listen to oldies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of catchy beats and sharp rhymes","review":"Before I lash at this cd, all must know that I am a huge Aesop fan. This cd has a real lack of well everything.. The beats are so simple and the rhymes just do not make par. Maybe comparing this album to labor days is unfair. The album lacks a real 'good' song. Mars Attacks is the only song that stands out. This cd has little depth and his voice just isnt accented as well as it could have been. I would Recommend Labor Days instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"F**K AESOP ROCK","review":"aesop rocks lyrics, are complete and utter babble. Trash at its finest.

The cover of Aesop Rock's 'Bazooka Tooth', (an album which I have not yet heard and could be phenomenal judging by Aesop's previous outings) looks more like a pop-punk hot topic album cover than a hip hop album. I'm saying this mainly because of how stupid the album cover is. It gives the appearance of though there are songs within about being dumped after school and dreaming about the girl in biology class. I don't know, it's just that the first time I saw this CD I thought I was looking at the new New Found Glory album or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"i make noise cause i get this","review":"this album is not easily accessible. call it what you will, but it isn't meant for everyone. it is, however, genius, as, when it hits you, it knocks you senseless. aesop is at his peak here, his honesty and political stances surprising and refreshing. on \\"ny electric,\\" he makes references to \\"41 shots over par,\\" and when i got it, i felt chills. this album requires numerous listens, to catch the intricacies of a true masterpiece. if you can catch the genius of \\"greatest pacman victory ever\\" (try listening real hard 2 minutes in), understand the raw of \\"babies with guns,\\" feel the pain on the ending solo verse of \\"11:35\\" and catch the old school banger of \\"frijoles,\\" this album will never leave your cd player. props to aesop, for forcing people to think - don't be too quick to dismiss this album, as it'll say a lot about you."},{"rating":"2","title":"aesop rock - bazooka tooth","review":"I picked up this cd about 2 weeks ago and I can't stop listening to it.

On Bazooka Tooth, day does, indeed, turn night. Gone is the hopeful afternoon ballad. This doesn't mean Bazooka Tooth will leave Aesop fans in the lurch, however. While there is enough Blockhead to sustain the interest of long-term fans (3 songs), the Aesop-produced tracks hit hard. No-holds-barred bass tracks shake down the city of brick this mason built, track-by-track, over the past five albums--Daylight, Labor Days, Float, and the out-of-print Music for Earthworms and Appleseed. This is Aesop throwing open the door to your house and sermonizing without without reserve.

It's a tad too cheesy for my tastes nowadays. However, even after fresh ears I still enjoy the likes of Skinny Puppy and Dive tremendously. I suppose Dive's influence on Rudy was the where initial attraction lied. But otherwise, it's really nothing new and falls into the realm of industrial mediocrity.

Maybe if you're a real game shark you could tell from the pictures on the box.

They've provided my kids with many hours of entertainment.As with all games, eventually the wires leading from the joystick to the TV break inside, and then you lose either sound or video.

They grotesquely beefed up GYRUSS, completely destroying the charm of the original. The graphics of Rush'n Attack are done poorly and the feel of the game is entirely different. All in all, the KONAMI VIDEO ARCADE is a collection of loveless remakes, that are a lot less fun to play than even the C64-Versions of these games produced almost 20 years ago.

It still stirs my blood and I find that I can conjure up visions in my mind's eye of just exactly what exactly should be happening in the show with each song and it makes me smile each time. This music, so beautifully written by Benoit Jutras, was played to perfection on the CD and if you do make it to the show, you'll be equally blown away by just how great it is in person. From start to finish what you get on this is \\"O\\" to go. So take it with you - see what you can conjure up with it. Will it be a scene from \\"O\\" or will it be something of your own imaginings?

The ticket price may be unreasonable, but when you see the production and feats of dexterity, strength and skill you'll understand where your money is going. The soundtrack to the show \\"O\\" (phonetic for \\"eau\\" or water, which is the main theme for this performance) is a diligent sampling of the music you will hear at Bellagio in Las Vegas. I warn the buyers of this CD that the show runs approximately 90 minutes, and the CD is only 60 or so. Therefore if you were expecting extended mixes to match your \\"O\\" experience 100%, you will be disappointed. The overall music selection is okay as a stand alone. I'd use it for background music while doing something else. If you've seen the show, this will definetely spark some vivid memories.

Upon closing my eyes and listening to the music, it was if I was back at the Bellagio reliving the \\"O\\" experience all over again. The music is soothing, haunting, calming, exciting.

The author is giving a talk in church rather than a good window into the Smith family. Mostly gleaned from Lucy Mack's history with little from other sources.

The best treatments for the more obscure family members (Samuel, William, Don Carlos, Sophronia, Katherine, Lucy the younger) still remain article length treatments from peer-reviewed journals.

My guess, and this would make for an interesting investigative study, is that he stayed on the OSS/CIA payroll and was working for them, in some capacity: Dissecting the news, dealing with Communist espionage - or who knows, maybe he was working with foreign elemnets. Berg was something. He has to be considered a major hero.

KATERINE?","review":"I can say with such abundant honesty that it hurts, that this book is nothing short of literary trash. First off, the premise is, quite frankly, retarded. Some supposed former child-prodigdy thinks that he can make such a complicated algorithm, one that would require an innumerable amount of variables to consider, only to come to the inevitable conclusion that he can't. Big surprise. Honestly, I don't understand how this book is given anything other than a passing mention amongst any community. It's also written in a style that's reminiscent of a 40 year old man trying to write \\"hip\\" and be \\"in with the kids.\\" It's patronizing drivel. I hate everything about this book, and I honestly would rather eat dog feces than re-read this garbage.

No way can a person work with that, so I sent an e-mail to Berger, the manufacturer, only to receive a blizzard of jargon-filled, unhelpful e-mails in return. Berger's excuse for a possible problem? That the level may have sat too long in Amazon's warehouse before shipping. Say what? Sitting in a warehouse damaged it?

A very good and well-mounted black and white crime story with the rock-like Lino Ventura supported by the charming and under-playing Jean-Paul Belmondo about criminals who do not hesitate to pull the triggers yet a human at heart among families and friends. It is about friendship, loyalty, betrayal, tragedy and crime rarely rewards with an abrupt and befitting ending.

I am very disappointed by this DVD. The video has a home-made quality, which is not my major complaint. The content is more about a few skating tips rather than a thorough instruction from beginner skills to more advanced ones. I am a beginner, that is why I need good instructions. Some techniques such as A-turn, parallel turn, spin stop, scissors are not covered at all. The ones that do get mentioned, such as cross-over turn, the instructor does not provide information on where you should put your weight, what mistakes a beginner would typically make. Instead, he just shows you a few times. And that is it. So, if you want to watch a few minutes of a very good speed inline skater skates and shows you a few tips here and there, this video may be good for you. But if you are looking for a thorough instructional video, this is definitely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for beginners","review":"Good video to watch for a intermediate to advanced skater. There is too much to cover in how to skate properly. There was not enough time given to braking on skates.

Rather like a refined Elmore Leonard or less catastrophe laden CJ Boyle. Skeeter and Herb were very clever. Brady's take on the rural South spot on and his Quixote-esque quest, plot perfect. The battle of the sexes was skillfully rendered (great job with Beth and Tanya).

They have some influence from Ministry with the heavy guitar riffs, some from Mar Verhagen with the choice of quirky sounds, a bit of their own side projects like intermix, delerium, FLA and finally a dose from Haujobb. I love everything Leeb does and so it was like obligatory for me to buy this release. I love the sound, beat, and love how they said that \\"all tracks were conceived and manipulated\\" as if written by sounds just to lame. The cover design by Carylann is quite mysterious and I have no idea what she is trying to convey.

The Line of Beauty develops slowly, gradually and it requires time to play itself out completely. A 90 minutes long movie would have to squeeze and cut down the plot and there is a serious danger little would be left of its original charms.If you know and like AH novels and The Line of Beauty in particular you will not be disappointed.

The film is faithful to Alan Hollinghurst's beautifully written novel. I most high recommend both. As to Stevens, he is now known all over the world for his performance in Downton Abbey.

So many gems that I don't really know where to begin. In my opinion, many Pollard solo releases and The Airport 5 albums were really spotty, but this comp collects most of the songs that deserve to be saved.

Read the dissection of Gary Schwartz's methodology (or lack of one) and you'll understand that this \\"scientific\\" analysis is anything but, and that in fact Mr. Schwartz must have had a solidly established bias in favor of the existence of an afterlife before he began writing the book.The only use for such a book is in helping the public understand the modern epidemic of profiteers distorting and co-opting the entire idea of science - a good cautionary tale and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOU'RE MONEY","review":"OK, SO I READ THIS BOOK EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH IT. BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I DON'T SEE WHERE THIS 'BREAKTHOUGH SCIENTFIC EVIDENCE' IS. ITS JUST 5 MEDIUMS DOING READINGS IN A CONTROLLED ENVIROMENT. THEY DO READINGS WHERE THEY NEVER MEET THE SITTER, NEVER SEE, NOR HEAR THEM. BUT I WILL SAY THAT ONE THING THIS BOOK DOES IS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHERE THE MEDIUMS ARE GETTING THEIR INFORMATION FROM.

To be sincere, to those interested in the topic, this kind of research is nothing new: Asakof, Crookes, Lombroso, De La Roche, Kardec and others had done that over 2 centuries ago (and not to detract from the present author, much better than he has). However, it is refreshing to see the topic revisited -- especially when portrayed in a very soft, non-academic writing style that makes it easy to read. It should be a good stepping stone to other, more complete works. It also has a good last chapter, about the implications of such findings -- the most important aspect of the whole thing (which is often let aside in most contemporary works of the same kind). I would definitively recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must Read","review":"I feel this is a must read book for anyone skeptical about the afterlife.

Now the how-can-this-possibly-be-true parts of me have some data with which to deal. Although there are those who are all about the scientific method, I know how hard it can be to research an area that may be more of an art than a science. Some of the case stories are even more powerful than the data in suggesting that there is something behind the curtain of our everyday life.

Knowing it had a scientific premise, I was initially reluctant to sit down with it. But, it reads like a detective novel and you actually start not only to appreciate the scientific method, but also that psychic mediums are a very interesting segment of the human population. I'm beginning to discern that these are people who have tapped into a human cognitive skill that isn't linear and is in a liminal realm of consciousness that most of us ignore or don't cultivate. Fascinating. I plan to read Gary Schwartz's other books and the ones he's indicated in his suggested reading list. He has my respect as an open minded scientific explorer, which, unfortunately many scientists are not. Richard Dawkins is a typical example, and, quite honestly, pretty alienating and scary.

The first is that many of the songs get monotonous and 'blippy'. The same childish melodies over the same percussion over and over and over.... There just isn't enough variety to keep things interesting.The second problem is the awful voxing. I thought that the vox in Esacpe To Reality was bad. Trust me, it is better than this! Here, the voice sounds like Dani Filth on Amphetamines mixed with the sound of sandpaper on metal.What does save the album, however, are two excellent songs. These are \\"Piss Christ\\" and \\"Terminal Condition.\\" However, the rest of the album is quite boring. Try VNV Nation or Velvet Acid Christ for a more intriguing listen.

Instead, it's actually quite melodic and relaxing in ways. The beats remain at a steady 120-130 bpm for most songs, but they never approach the high energy speed of bands such as Funker Vogt or Evil's Toy. The best feature of \\"Infinity\\" in my opinion is the lyrics, which deliver an important message about individuality and human nature that many people ignore. If you are in the mood to try something a little less harsh in the ways of Industrial/Dark Wave music, you should definetly give \\"Infinity\\" a listen. If you are looking for something fast and adrenaline-inducing however, try another band such as Funker Vogt, VNV Nation, or Assemblage 23."},{"rating":"2","title":"duma duma","review":"This album is like nothing else.

Baker has the uncanny ability to write both clearly and complexly, illuminating the facts of this president's life with a careful interpretative eye and a thrilling sense of the politics of regionalism and race that beset so many of President Buchanan's decisions.I must say that among American historians, Professor Baker is one of the very best: consistently deep and probing in her analysis and archival documentation yet a fluid storyteller with elegant, neat prose.(...Of course I'm over the age of 13.

However his own biases and political machinations resulted in not only the Civil War, but in his rightfully being listed as among the worst Presidents ever.Baker is unsparing as she describes his shortcomings, yet is also fair in describing why he was biased in the way he was. She also points out how even without the looming Civil War, Buchanan had a very corrupt administration that would have tarnished his reputation.

Rock'nRoll Fantasy is as good as anything they've ever done, but the reviewers here seem to be close to rabid in their passion for the Kinks.It's a good record. A few good Ray Davies' societal watchdog things. The title track is awesome, but only Rock'n'Roll Fantasy comes close to the promise of that song. After that, it gets entertaining but pedestrian. Let's be clear here, I really like the Kinks. Something Else is an all-time Top Ten pick, and I'm a staunch defender of Phobia. But Misfits is no such classic. A fan's-only record if I ever saw one.The music's ok, but sanitized. A very thorough scrubbing was done on these tracks to make sure that no stray feedback or echo gets into your ears. I hate that.If you're not a fan, find a best-of somewhere and stay away from this. Not too great.A Kinks Krapfest, unfortunately.I'd like to be wittier, but I can't. Sorry.

I would recomend this to any fan of Industrial. EmbryoDead is one of the two good cds to start off with. Many fans say it's the best album ever created, and I even agree in cases.

And voila! I was playing NFS Shift, and Split-Second on my laptop using this device.When eventually the controller saw a PS3 and got a chance to get to its designated parent, it was perfect. I found the feel and weight of this controller better than the Sony controller (though others might argue).Overall I would rate this product 80%.

It stop working properly after about three weeks. I used it mostly for COD: Modern Warfare 2 and found that pressing the R3 toggle a while to respond. The R2 and L2 buttons are extremely sensitive, insofar as a tiny brush of the finger can set them off. Use the money and buy yourself something better.

None of the buttons became stuck; instead the L2 button failed internally. The controller thought the L2 button was being pressed constantly, thus ruining the controller.

I have been hooked on him since I heard his version of \\"Mercy Mercy Mercy\\" on a Guitar Player magazine jazz collection years ago (the cut is on the Velvet Touch cd). I am also a huge fan of the late Joe Pass, whom I was fortunate to see perform late in his career in a small basement club in Annapolis, but there is a shimmering ethereal quality in Lenny's playing that moves me in ways that no other musician does.

These imitations have a design flaw that allows your phone to fall from the holster unintentionally. On these knockoffs,the small notch that snaps into the slot on top of your phone is not long enough to snap in securely. Even the way it sounds when it snaps in tells you it is not secure. The slightest bump or the routine jostling your phone takes while you are sitting or riding in a car can release the phone. Next thing you know, phone gone.

As opposed to a history of Mexico - this book shines a huge spotlight on the sport of bullfighting. If you enjoy bullfighting and want to know a little bit about Mexican history - by all means, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a compelling work of historical fiction on Mexico (such as we're accustomed to from Mr. Michener) - do yourself a huge favor and pick up a copy of 'Aztec' by Gary Jennings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great novel ruined by ridiculous characters","review":"Like most of his books, Mexico is very well-researched and full of historical information and factoids that make for the most interesting parts of the novel. Also, like most of his novels, Mexico is full of ridiculously heroic characters that drag the book down into Michener purgatory. The story goes from fascinating glimpses into Aztec culture and rituals to stories of bullfighters who, while eating dinner, \`wield a fork in the graceful manner that only a matador could'. It's during these sections that you ask yourself why you're wasting your time reading this, but usually the historical stories of the land and cultures reach you just in time to grab your interest and force you to continue reading, albeit at times rather regrettably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you like bullfighting","review":"I have read many Michener novels, and enjoyed almost all of them. 'Mexico', however, is terrible.If you set out to read this slow-moving behemoth, then you'd better *really* like bullfighting. There are just so many long and boring sections on the topic. It was such a struggle to get through it all.The early parts on Aztec culture were fine, but after that I almost needed to tape my eyelids open. Talk about dull and dry. I couldn't wait for it to finish.If you are tempted to read this book, slap yourself a few times and go and get 'Alaska' or 'Chesapeake' instead. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason you can buy this one used for 1 cent","review":"I'm a diehard Michener fan, but this book was a pitiful effort and unworthy to sit on the shelf alongside his other books . If anybody except JM had written this book, it would never have made it to publication. It's a gazillion pages about a bullfight. Like a couple of other reviewers, I did learn a tiny bit about the politics of Mexico. The Source, JM's book about the so-called Holy Land, was like taking a graduate level course in comparative religion. Mexico was one great big yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull&boring read","review":"One of the most pathetic books I have managed to fight until page 80 or so until sleep and anger overcame me. The author isn't capable of concentrating on his (should be, if any) subject and instead lets the central \\"character\\" trying to entertain the bored reader with the fame and glory of the characters family every tiring second paragraph. The menu for rating this book is not appropriate. A three tomato would do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptively titled sleeping pill of a book","review":"I'll usually sit out a bad book just for the sense of completion, but after 300 pages of 'Mexico' I needed a twelve-hour nap next to a bucket. Flat, ghost-like characters, and a snoozer plot about a sport I couldn't care less about (who would guess from the title it's about a couple of sleazy bull-fighters?!) had me dry-heaving at page 20. . .and it just kept getting worse.

From the Mayan and Aztec battles to the Spanish insurrection, to the war with America the author takes you on a ride. This book is not about bullfighting it is about the clash of cultures, people, and history that formed a nation. This is a great read and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Read!","review":"I've read Michener before--I loved \\"Hawaii,\\" for instance, and really got a sense of place for Hawaii after reading that. But this doesn't do Mexico justice. It's mostly about bullfighting. And that would be okay, I guess, if it were an ENGAGING story about bullfighting, but it's not! Getting through it is an exercise in drudgery. Finally I gave up on the bulls and turned to the parts about ancient Mexico, but these, too, didn't do the true story justice. He shows the savagery of human sacrifices but then makes it all politically correct by adding two characters who are AGAINST that sort of thing, and then making them the ancestors of the book's narrator. I love Mexico. I actually like Michener's works. But this was a thoroughly disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional City and Civilization Drove me Loco","review":"I had high hopes for this book but I just don't understand why one writes a book about Mexico and then decides to make up huge parts of history. He could have used real history just as effectively in my opinion. Why not talk about Teotihuacan and the pyramids there? Or how about talk about the Toltecs or the Aztecs? As a plot device the fictional city of Toledo and the civilization of Drunken Builders had me in fits. Everytime the story took a turn to the past I was left hollow inside like an empty chimichanga. The dynamic of the bullfighters lives and loves was interesting,that was my favorite part. Only can give 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book is mistitled. Rather than being about Mexico, it's about bullfighting. Compared to other Michener books, it only gives you snapshots of a few historical eras, rather than the entire scope of its place's history.Michener is known for weaving fact and fiction, but Michener does a few weird, annoying things here. For instance, the Aztecs are called the \\"Altimecs,\\" and the PRI is called the \\"People's Revolutionary Party.\\" Since the names \\"Aztec\\" and \\"PRI\\" aren't copyrighted, why would he do this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Mexico","review":"I have always wanted to visit Mexico. Haveing lived in California for a while I developed a great admiration of the Mexican culture. The story is of a writter; what could be easier for an author than having his main character be a writter. As always Michener is complete at starting his epic from the beginning (a trademark I love) and bringing you up to modern times. The stories of the native indians and old Spain provide a great backgound. What I felt was the most compelling though was his providing some American characters (tourists) to view his modern day Mexico. They provide a way for him to view some of our stereotypes and misconceptions of Mexican culture. What would Mexico be without Bullfighting, a very captavating and exciting sport, despite the fact that I have never seen one in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"I use to...","review":"only use this temporary hair color.

The author spends little ink on the history of the papacy during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. The \\"selection\\" of the pope during those tumultuous years was indeed a very different process compared to the section during the 19th and 20th centuries! The authior seems to concentrate and details the process during these later centuries and seems to gloss over the middle ages when the Catholic Church ruled not only the Vatican, but also the Governments of virtually all Europe. For a more accurate and detailed account of how the popes were \\"selected\\" during the middle ages (3 centuries), I would recommend Wm Manchester's history of the middle ages \\"A World Lit By Only Fire\\".

I like being able to create road routes and am able to find my customers much easier and with much less stress and eye strain rather than using a paper map.

When I received the product I was very disappointed. The wire material used is thinner than I expected about the thickness of a coat hanger. After some additional research I found out that you can get peg board hooks in either 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thickness. No where in their product description does it say this product is for 1/8 inch peg board. I assumed all peg board hooks were 1/4 inch. I went to lowes and found 1/4 inch pegs in a variety of types of hooks for about the same price. If the supplier had just mentioned their product was for 1/8th inch pegboard it would have saved me a lot of trouble. I have bought a lot of products through Amazon and I have always gotten what I expected, Now I have to think twice before I purchase.

It could be compared with the first Intermix album as well.I wish I could write a decent review, but in a nutshell, it's catchy synthesized gobbledygook from a Skinny Puppy side project. Playing the samples is most of what you need to know of the type of sound - however the samples are a little short, and you have to trust that given the full length of the songs that there really is a flow and rhythm to it all.

You can capture video (provided your PC is fast enough to keep up). It has a coaxial input for cable, and an RCA connector for a camcorder for example.On the downside it only does mono sound, which is fine for most people, but the reason I gave it for stars instead of five is the way it connects to the soundcard. A cable is required to attach from the audio out to the line-in on the soundcard. It would have been nice to have the option of using an internal cable for sound cards that could support them, or a line-in pass-through so that you can connect something else to line-in without unplugging the TV card. The reason that this is annoying is because the back of the PC is usually hard to get at to change plugs.Still, this is something that won't affect everybody.

Without any contact whatsoever or advanced moves (entirely basic stuff), the wrapping on the handle began to come loose. By day 3 sections of the wrapping were falling off. Turns out they were just held on with a small bit of glue, and only along the front below where the sharp edge would be.

This practice weapon is used in kata, and somewhat more closely resembles a steel blade Samurai sword than plain wood bokken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"First, this is not a sparring bokken. It's not solid enough for hitting things on a regular basis, the wood isn't treated so yours, like mine, might have some minor surface cracking, and the tsuba is an ill-fitting piece of plastic with a rubber stopper.However, this really is an excellent goofing-off sword well worth the price. I originally ordered it for home but liked it so much I kept it at the office and ordered another. It's a good stress reliever to swing that thing around my desk during the day. The cording, a nice touch that most wooden swords don't have, is solid and feels great.

Bands such as Iron Maiden, and Def Leppard emerged from the same era. White Spirit is a realy good album. It is a double CD. \\"Fool for the Gods\\" on CD 1 showcases Malcolm Pearson's great work on keyboard, and highlights the guitar of Janick Gers. The bright and shining star on this album is the extremely talanted, flamboyant, world class guitarist Janick Gers. Listen to his soft and poignant acoustic on CD 2 , \\"Suffragettes\\".White Spirit was not derivative of the NWBHM bands. They had very unique lyrics and a unique sound. The album contains an excellent documentation of the history of White Spirit.I recommend this double cd album.

It follows the same formula of the others, first rate production and arrangements, fine singing from Bland, and top-notch material from the Malaco songwriters. The songs are a mix of blues (the humorous \\"She's Puttin' Something in My Food\\") soul (\\"Ain't No Love for Sale\\") ballads (\\"I Can Take You to Heaven Tonight\\", \\"When Hearts Grow Cold\\") and even country-tinged material (\\"Hurtin' Love\\"). While Bland's voice isn't as strong as it once was, he can still make fine music and \`Portrait of the Blues' is fine proof of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Survey of Apologetics","review":"This is the classic text on the broad sweep of apologetics. Dulles begins with apologetic motifs in the NT, then continues on to the patristic era, rich in apologetics classics.Each section in ended with the author's concluding analysis. He then moves to the middle ages which focused primarily on Aquinas. Then to the Reformation era, 16-18th. Ends with a chapter each on the 19th and 20th centuries.I appreciate his splitting his historical sweep beginning with the 16th C. forward into Catholic and Protestant. Lacking in my mind is the apologists of my era, the Craig's, Geisler's,Montgomery's, etc., but I didn't really buy nor use this to get a historical fix on them. What Dulles provides so succinctly in this work is so useful to gaining an overall timeframe on the apologetic topic.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"my friend told me about this band","review":"i heard of this band thru a few different people and places. i wa snot impressed. very boring and bland slow rock. nothing catchy"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Deana Carter - it is Dean Carter!","review":"Please ignore the nonsense in the review above.

Someone who wants a strongly plotted book may not be as engaged as I was, since the \\"plot\\" is simple -- how she deals with being a young single mother, and the relationship with the child's father.

Mary Morris travels West this time and gets it just right. With an unfailing eye for detail, Morris takes us on a journey through a Southern California that's every bit as pumped up with hope as it was during the Gold Rush. A single-mother and writer, Morris herself might be considered both the angel and alien of her title. There are New Age encounters to be sorted through and a true love hovering in the East that needs to be put to rest. Through it all, Mary Morris lets us into her heart with language that is both spare and poetic, deeply moving, and magnificent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clutch inorperative upon arrival; Reconditioned???","review":"Shipment of Tool was prompt.

He lies, most likely from ignorance, about many things. For exampe he has the aggressivness to say that there are two versions of the Quran: One is English the other is Arabic. Of course it's a stupid statement made by a stupid person. He has no knowledge of the Palestinians and the history of the region. He doesn't talk about the ethnic cleansing that the Palestinian civilians (1,500,000 forced out of their homes) faced in 1948 and later and are still unable to go back to thier homes and land.One Last point that he avoids is the fact that Muslims are the decendants of Abraham as well.

Yet he is hostile and racist to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book by a demagogue","review":"\\"Pastor\\" Hagee has written another book on a subject in which he apparently has little factual knowledge but lots of passion and prejudice.

My hair is dry and damaged, plus it's thick so anytime it gets wet it's just a tangled mess. I'm always tyring new conditioners trying to find one that works for me.This is it. I only need to use a quarter size amount instead of twice that for other conditioners, and it immediatly softens and conditions.

Little surprise that a fabulous line of hair care products is also made in Italy.Imported from Bologna, Terax is based on the premise of restoring luster and natural beauty to hair by extensive hydration. For me the first step was Crema, a treatment conditioner that revitalizes hair and eliminates broken ends without weighing down.For most of us the best results are probably achieved by applying a small amount and leaving it on for about 3 minutes. If your hair is really dry and gasping, leave it on for about ten minutes and cover your head with a plastic cap.Really do believe you'll be amazed at the difference Crema can make."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most extraordinary conditioner ever made...","review":"I have purchased and tried hundreds of hair products over the years, and hands down, Terax Crema conditioner is the the best one in the market.

Coconut oil is much more economical too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST conditioner ever","review":"By far the best conditioner I've ever used!

Instead, it's a cavil. I suspect that the author knows the difference between what's genuine and what's ersatz but, for some reason, has opted for the latter. I'd like to see her compose the sequel in which Jennie overcomes her fantasies of love and trades her mannequin for a man of some depth and character to be a stepfather to her lovely duaghter."},{"rating":"1","title":"paper thin","review":"I had never read Belva Plain before but needed a quick read so I picked it up from the library. I felt the storyline to be thin, the characters lacked substance and were unbelievable.

I wasn't disappointed when I got the CD and popped it into my stereo either.Blood Meridian is an album that alternates between hard and soft, and not all of the tracks contain vocals. In fact, the majority of the album is instrumental. That doesn't mean it's any less powerful. On songs like \\"Desire,\\" the usual scathing scratch of industrial music is present. But on \\"Alien Hand,\\" an eerie, almost downright spooky, collection of sound effects put to a dark electronic soundtrack makes you feel like you ARE being abducted by aliens!This is a wonderful and original work of electronic art. Be nice to yourself and get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haujobb in the Park","review":"Blood Meridian reveals a subtler, more atmospheric side of this bastion of industrial music.

Why is it that so many electronica bands seem to think that singing consists solely of screaming without any discernable melody? I loved the music on most of the tracks, but then each track was ruined for me as soon as the vocals began. Hey, I can scream too...but it takes real talent to actually sing. I'm just glad I bought this used off Amazon and I'm only out about $7. I'll try to pawn this off on a co-worker, or resell it at Amazon. What a waste. Who cares if the words are good if they're screamed at the top of someone's lungs? This is NOT GOOD ELECTRONICA.

Better places to start would be 'Embryodead', 'Bunker Gate Seven' (or even better the original 'Bunkertor Sieben'), 'MFAST' or the double EP 'Dried Blood of Gomorrha'.Most of the tracks on Mesner are stripped down, simplistic electro that are somewhat aggressive but not nearly as much so as most :W: releases. The standout track is \\"Mother\\". If you like this song then you must get the Haujobb remix version avaliable on 'Remix Wars Part I - Haujobb v :Wumpscut:' - this is one of the best reworkings I've ever heard.Anyway it is a very good album but meant to complement his collection and not meant to be a starting point or standalone release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hapless WinTV-Radio (Model 401)","review":"I got this as a Valentines Dat gift for my almost XYL.

He is the producer and recorder that gives these groups a chance to record and helps them round out a beautiful fuzzy and garage sound. The Hentchmen deliver a thick guitar and organ sound that hits you like a friggin huge Plymouth. The group is history, but these records document the tenacity and ferocity of white boys playing boogie blues in Detroit. This record never stops and we all wish the Hentchmen never would have either.

Despite the initial banner saying it runs on Windows 95 or 98, note that the spec sheet mentions only Windows 95. When you try it on 98 the software warns you that it won't work. If you try, you record only sound. Playback on 98 is limited to sound and a black panel where the image should be. Tried dinking with video settings to no avail. I agree with another reviewer who said that the product is dying. It's a mystery too, because Lotus ScreenCam was unique among video/audio recorders for packing smooth video motion and good sound quality into a comparatively small file.

So I decided I still wanted to see it so I bought the Uncut Directors Cut what awaited me was a horrendous mess of a film with poor picture quality and has also revealed to me just how terrible actors some of the core ensemble are.It is a terribly made movie but derived from an extremly interesting concept that could have turned out to be a far better film.Don't waste your time with this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaah Humbug","review":"This movie was horrible.

It was okay (not brilliant or anything)... Until the meeting of the villian. The writers of this movie have displaced the story of Elizabeth Bathory (aka the Female Dracula). From that point, I was unable to enjoy it.

It was one of the best scary movies we ever saw. My friend Alex could barely watch because he was too scared. He pretended to be asleep so we wouldn't make fun of him. My point to all that is that this movie is scary. Even if you are not a fan of scary movies I suggest this because it is also set in a video game. If you are not a scary movie fan, or video game fan, well don't see it, but I HIGHLY recommend this movie over all others."},{"rating":"1","title":"there's stuff that sucks then there's this movie","review":"I wasn't expecting much when this movie came out in theaters..so i had very low expectations.

It had some decent creepy scenes and the acting, while not stellar, wasn't as bad as the typical horror movie.The part that really ruined the movie for me was the butchering of the story of Countess Bathory. Why not create a fictional legend set in New Orleans to center the movie around? Doing so would have made a much better plot. I know many horror movies don't make much sense, but really, it could have been decent if the writers had put a little more effort into the storyline. What's next - a movie in which Vlad the Impaler has relocated to Texas, opened a ranch, and has been sucking the local cattle dry?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont See It!","review":"The problem with this scary movie is that it isnt scary at all.

Anyway, it seems like it could have been used in a certain way that would make the movie OK, but everything in this film falls flat. It seems like one of those PG-13 teenage slasher films, this time a little more \\"digital\\". Some of the video game effects are sorta creepy, but it barely keeps the movie \\"alive\\", and even the scares aren't scary. I mean, the countess at the end was creepy, and that was basically the only scary thing in the film. I did not like the one-dimensional characters in this film, either. It's OK to watch if you want to kill time, but for anything else, in my opinion, not really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Countess Elizabeth Bathory--at least an intrigue","review":"To some horror movie enthusiasts, they expect the SAME (slashings, beatings, and screamings)! However, with STAY ALIVE, that is not the case. In this particular film, several friends PLAY THE GAME, THE GAME THAT DETERMINES THEIR FATE (whether good or bad)!In reality, the movie viewer is taken on a journey through a game (in a sense--journey, that is), where he or she is...well...gonna have a good time! With Countess Elizabeth Bathory, for instance, you'll be checkin' online about her history--just as intersting as the movie. I'm not one to give it away, but at least check it out--it's worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay....","review":"This movie had a lot of potential, but it falls short. It centers around a group of teens who realize that the video game they've inherited is possessed, and if they die in the game they die in real life. The basic problem with this movie is it doesn't even have a real good plot. I mean, it is a horror movie, but it's only pg-13. There wasn't even that much gore, so you need something to keep you entertained. But since there's no mention of how the game was made or who made it you leave the movie wondering \\"What was the point of watching that?\\" And the ending? A total rip-off of The Ring. The only creepy thing about the movie is The Blood Countess, because she was actually a real person who killed over 600 girls in her lifetime. So I'm sorry to say that \\"Stay Alive\\" could barely keep me to stay awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great bag--annoying flaw","review":"I have had this bag for less than two months..

No pulling, no tugging, no stressful yanks, no nothing. Brand new and there it is: broken. And irreparable. The pieces don't snap back together, no loose screws to tighten; just pieces with nothing that I can determine will ever hold themselves together again.

The plastic flash mount broke within 5 minutes of use. Split right down the middle of the seam and sent my 580 EX flash tumbling to the ground...completely useless!When I talked with the Canon technical rep and her supervisor, I was told this is a \\"safety\\" feature to prevent the flash shoe base from being broken when the flash is bumped against a hard object. Give me a break, the off-camera shoe cord breaks and the flash is also broken because it hit the ground -- the cord is 6 feet long. Canon hasn't published the \\"safety feature\\".

There is no point of manufacturing a \\"magnesium alloy body camera\\" which takes a whole lot of beating and pairing it with this fickle accessory. I am tempted to use the term \\"cheaply made\\", but it's not. It actually looks and feels like a Canon product. After only a couple of uses though it starts falling apart and you no longer have communication with your flash - it will either not fire at all or blast at full fire.Not suitable for a working professional.And to add insult to injury, Canon does not offer any warranty on this.

The new OC-E3 is made in China (proudly stated in bold letters right on the top), has an integrated construction so that if any single component fails, the entire unit must be thrown out, has no warranty from Canon (\\"accessories have no warranty\\" according to the spokesperson \\"Marvin\\" from Canon), and is made of polycarbonate material that cannot handle the weight of the heavier Canon flashes like the 580EX-II. Titling the camera sideways (while taking a vertical \\"portrait\\" style photo) can stress the flimsy flanges and cause them to crack or break. Canon's response is \\"buy a new one.\\" You are better off looking for 3rd party attachments with better construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"If using it professionally it will break monthly....","review":"I hate this plastic crappy base with metal screws. It has problems with the 580 EX II. The weight of the flash will cause it to crack in the middle. I go through one of these a month.

Their default stance is physical damage is not covered. Unless you're willing to reinforce the OC-E3 in some way I wouldn't recommend trusting it with an expensive flash.Update: The replacement OC-E3 came.

Someone would ask a question, and boom, Bashar would come back with an answer which would frequently blow us away with it's power and clarity, and wisdom.No matter what you believed about the channeling process, you couldn't sit there with an open mind without realizing that you were in the presence of sheer genius and profound wisdom.

I guess it only meant that it was out of stock. So, I called back a few months later, and was told it was available then, so I bought it. I had a lot of problems with it, but I was thinking I got a brand new card and therefore I just needed to wait for them to get the software ironed out. So, I've been checking their site, waiting for updated software and never found any.Now I find out the card is discontinued.

Pitchfork is more into composing songs that make a direct statement compared to Skinny Puppy, who are far more interested in musical experimentation.Honestly, this is one of my favorite Project Pitchfork CDs. It isn't as heavy as some of their earlier stuff, and not as light as the newer material they've put out recently. I think that is what makes this CD so great. I can put on Alpha Omega no matter what mood I'm in, and I'll enjoy listening to it. The closest comparison I would make is to \\"IO\\" or \\"Entities\\".This is a slower album, but not weak. The songs are airy and dreamy. The lyrics are not as fantastic as on Pitchfork's later works, but are still very expressive of the frustration and exasperation that the songs wish to relate. This is not the Ministry/:Wumpscut: type of industrial. It's not dance-y like V.A.C., and it's not as (sorry) wussie as VNV Nation.

Who would want to live for eternity in a coffin filled with dirt, able to rise only when the sun is down? And was Rice's explanation of the origin of vampires unsatisfactory?Try Monahan's take on it, in The Book of Common Dread. It is quite a novel novel in the supernatural thriller genre. Other than his highly original vampire, his characters are the usual stock ones, but the action rolls on and on, the situations are uniquely believable, and he even manages to inject dry humor. This would make a heck of a motion picture. So would its sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worse Vampire Book Ever!!!","review":"I tried to finish this book, wanting to escape from the Anne Rice serials for a fresh outlook on my favorite mythos creature.Yet what I found was this garbage I can't believe I wasted a day reading half way through. The author makes an attempt to mix subtle elements of Lovecraft's Cthulu mythos, with character archetypes from that semi-awful book I,Vampire into one crappy story in which the vampire can walk around during the day and eat burgers and fries.

Using it to cover a cantilevered umbrella from B,B,B that folds fairly tightly, but not as much as a regular umbrella. This fit snugly, but worked well enough people will think it came with the umbrella.

There is a caveat however, and that is putting it together. The directions are horrible, however if you are mechanically inclined you will not have a problem adjusting the directions.

I have passed it on to my 15 year old son and he says I am driving him crazy with checking on it and 'bugging' him about it. I was surprised at how early some things should be done and considered. The comments that I am driving him crazy about it says to me that I am on the right track.

After reading that the Washington Post rated Service's book one of the \\"Best Books of the Year for 2005\\" and that it was a \\"Winner in Biography\\" in the Independent Publishers Book Awards for 2005, I thought this would be the one. Instead, I was disappointed to read a book as uninteresting as the history books that I studied in high school and college; books that turned me against history for the next 30 years. It was well-researched and full of details but so are encyclopedias.I have read quite a few great biographies on people as diverse as Huey Long and Charles Darwin; but, to me, \\"Stalin, a Biography\\" was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love biographies","review":"I never knew about the Bolcheviques, the Whites, the Reds and of course Stalin (did you know it was not his real name?) as when I read Robert Service book.

However, Service glosses over huge and momentous events, such as the Great Terror. We have all heard of the monstrous acts committed by Stalin but none of the details are given, other than numbers and names. It seems inconceiveable that a 600 plus page book would be superficial and lacking specificity but it does. One gets the feeling Service felt previous biographers had already provided the dirty details and therefore left them out. He also does not tell Stalin's story in any chronological manner. He jumps around endlessly. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Item Ever Purchased","review":"I owned a 5820 it did not work out of the box.

The controls are easy; it's a simple point and click system. The graphics are very good and the acting is good except for the main character (you control him) his voice overs and comments are basicly without emotion. A very good adventure game but heres where it gets creapy. There are ghosts everywhere and playing it alone in the dark is dangerous. You can go into the undecoritive bowels of the ship and just the sceanery will scare you. It makes you want to pass the part quickly and go back to the colorful sceans. Otherwise a great game.

He does a poor job of describing the major players on the English side and their impact on the decisions regarding the war.The only way I could recommend Weintraub's book is if you have a particular interest in the extraneous data in his book and a high tolerance for poor writing.

Since a second application half a day apart did not yield better results, I had no other option than go to the store and buy a cleaner from a well-known detergent brand. The replacement did not entirely solve the stain and smell problem, but was step in the right direction.

For the open viewer, it will provide a quietly overpowering experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and special","review":"The year is 1949, and Noriko and her father live a happy, quiet life in rural Japan where she attends tea ceremonies and he is a professor. Friends and relatives start pestering the 27-year old woman, asking when she will marry, but Noriko likes things just the way they are.This wonderful movie, called a \\"masterpiece\\" by many critics, is a quiet, subtle, and gentle look at the loving relationship between a father and daughter. It also captures forever post-war Japan when traditional manners and customs were practiced, kimonos were a common sight, and there were no tourists to be seen. The movie takes its time exploring Noriko's world and her reasons for not marrying; the final scenes are quite touching and universal-appealing. Recommended especially for fans of Japanese films, but this is a story that everyone can relate to. In Japanese with subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have enjoyed the music of John Addison in many films over the years.

What I was sent is rectangular, like those in other similar items for sale. I think this is part of the \\"not as good as hoped\\" problem: when the press is engaged, there is plenty of pressure in the central area right under where the screw is, but out at the periphery of the rectangle, the plastic isn't thick/strong enough to apply adequate pressure to the cabbage; the plastic bows upwards. I bet a round one would work better.My other complaint is that the size description is very misleading. If you fill the container halfway with cabbage, it just barely closes with a lot of work. Then it screws it down to press it further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great press","review":"I've had this pickle press for over a year - I received the round one as pictured.

Now there are other presses for sale which have a flip top, and drainage holes on top, where you can drain it easily without opening the entire press. This is the only thing I wish this press had.

It's true that the product description says \\"may not include graphics or images from the original edition,\\" but I managed to miss that in my delight at finding it available from Amazon. Easy to see why I missed it: the title is, after all, \\"Shakespeare and Music: With Illustrations from the Music of the 16th and 17th Centuries.\\" The text alone is not worthless, but the book's value is significantly reduced without the images.

This one is truly superb in every way! It's a classic example of Freeman's \\"inverse\\" mystery style...where we first see the crime as it occurs, then watch Thorndyke investigate it. As with all of the Thorndyke books, it's a period piece, very much set in its era (early 20th century). Austin Freeman, via Thorndyke, pretty much invented scientific \\"Crime Scene Investigation\\". By current standards, the science can sometimes be dated, and the pace of the novels much more leisurely than any mystery of our own era. These are not contemporary thrillers. But, Freeman's use of language is truly remarkable. He is easily one of the most gifted mystery writers I've ever found, old or new. Simply put, Freeman was a *great* writer! This novel, in particular, will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read!","review":"I am now officially hooked on Dr. Thorndyke. This one is by far my favorite.

I am assuming that Evelyn Glennie was the weaker of the two because she is a percussionist and not strictly a Timpanist like Mr. Hass, although I could be wrong. I have seen Ms. Glennie live and she is an amazing marimba player, so she can perform. But one set of timps sounded thin and I even heard some rim shots. I feel that this should have been recorded with two professional timpanist, that play every day, just timpani.

Bataille covers a number of great writers in this collection (Bronte, Genet, Baudelaire, Sade), and attempts to unveil their complicity with evil and eros. For Bataille, writing is eros in the damned sense. He inherits the Platonic legacy which has condemned poetry as that which is always at a double removal from truth. Literature is not an innocent counter-gesture to the decay of civilization, it is itself embedded in thanatos. While Bataille's own prose here is extremely cryptic, and he often subordinates the author's to his own vision, this remains a peculiar and important text."},{"rating":"1","title":"british runts","review":"we would have won the war in 1776 if those meddling brits had let us fire nuclear powered john wayne wigs at those german sob,s and there evil adolph bin von laden hussian leader.get some."},{"rating":"1","title":"revisionist myopia","review":"It is a sad day when a bureaucrat 60 years later reviews the plans of a bureaucrat < Bradley> and opines the failure of the former.

The author forgets there were 7 beaches and 6 were major successes with all the inherent challenges he argues... the other six beaches were tremendous successes as was the 82nd airborne and 101st airborne and the Brits 6th airborne parachute assaults.

I have never seen such great character development in any game! The characters are incredibly expressive and hysterical. They react to each other differently, depending on their personal histories with each other. They speak their native languages or have genuine accents (unlike many games where they all speak English or Japanese- regardless of where they are supposed to be from). The richness of the characters and their fighting styles makes the game so much fun to play.It is not very easy to pick up. You really have to practice to do well, but there is gym at which you can train your fighters. How cool is that! The characters even have their own lockers. I have forgotten how frustrating and rewarding skill development can be. This game is enjoyable on so many levels that I cannot recommend it enough. Go ahead, knock yourself out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and tedious","review":"The graphics are very good and the game is fun to play for a couple of matches, but after that it gets really boring. It's just the same old button mashing every round, and not that that's necessarily a bad thing but with this game it gets so dull. Also, the game designers tried too hard to make the characters very \\"wacky\\" and the result is that most of the characters and humor in this game is just plain stupid (but not even in a funny way).

Also in order to prevent playing the early levels each time you turn on the game you need to input an 11 letter code which is a annoying.

Bond of Blood was an intricately woven story about Leah of Pembroke and Cain, Lord Radnor, the clubfooted son of the harsh Duke of Gaunt.Leah was a terrified 15 year old when forced into this match by her parents for political reasons. She was terrified of him but determined to obey her station in life. She gradually saw the softness and hurt that he kept hidden under a mask of brutality and she used every feminine wile at her fingertips to make him completely hers. Set against the backdrop of a fuedal England at war with itself, filled with historical details, a book to get lost in and transported to another time. janieku@msn.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Medeval Marriage","review":"I have this book and the sequel Knights Honor. Gellis has a wonderful way of including accurate historical detail without detracting from the main story. This is one of my favorite books that she wrote because she is very clever about creating female characters that think and are believable. There are a few scenes deserving of a warning. There are some scenes that today would be classified as spousal abuse but where commonplace then. The relationships are complex but intense. The feudal system is clearly detailed. I enjoy the Roselynde Chronicles more because I love developing characters but this is also a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roberta Gellis' Best Book","review":"I am a longtime fan of Roberta Gellis, and I think this is her best work.

Although some of the heart of the book was interesting, most gave me a flashback to high school history class. There was very little new material. Also, the last chapter in the book was incredibly biased. Although I understand that historians are allowed to be biased, he places entirely too much blame on Ronald Reagan for part of the racial tension in America today. He almost glorifies the Rodney King riot for showing us how much racial tension there really was, and virtually claims Rodney King as some kind of hero. This riot was nothing short of immature. Overall I give the book a 3/10 because it did offer some interesting facts about the early history of diversity in America, but eventually I believe he wandered from his point in the last chapters by pointing fingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read history for all Americans","review":"I read this book when it first came out and used it as a required reading for a number of undergraduate and graduate courses that I taught ever since. This is a U.S. history book like no other. Dr. Takaki introduced us to the narratives that have been silenced and ignored, all the while providing the historical contexts through which they were shaped, and in turn, helped shaping. Most importantly, this book helps us understand how we, as a country, came to see the issue of race and ethnicity in our particular way. This book is not preachy or dogmatic but lets the readers uncover what might be underneath the usual stories that are taken for granted as THE history of the U.S. by providing cogent narratives and analysis.I just bought this book for my niece who just graduated from high school and think that it makes a great gift for young people as well as anyone who is interested in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely worthless","review":"Takaki's book is a wonderful example of how history should not be written. Takaki's attempt to portray a multicultural American history is weak and he accomplishes the opposite. He consistently describes every ethnic minority that has helped create America as nothing more than a victim of white aggression. Indeed the multicultural history of America is more complex than the simplified story of good and evil that Takaki tells. If one wishes to get a glimpse of realistic multicultural history I recommend forgetting about Takaki and instead reading Gary B. Nash's brilliant essay The Hidden History of Mestizo America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Negative and Biased!","review":"Many aspects of the book were completely vague and unfairly biased. This book is less informative than it was an attack against Anglo-Saxons of America. It is obvious that Takaki has personal issues against white people and is a flaming racist.He glorifies the bad behavior of certain minorities and embellishes, in a bad light, the identical bad behavior of certain whites.This book is a complete waste of time for those interested in a fair account of history. He simply perpetuates the problems that we have been trying to get away from. If one is looking for an unbiased account of history that focuses on facts and not agenda based rhetoric, I would suggest passing on Takaki."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"I hated this book.

But I found myself disliking this book more and more.

Rocchio, Your Child And Tests is a solidly informative guide to tests for young students, noting their uses and who can administer them, their inherent flaws, ways to help your child become a better test taker, and listings of over 50 commonly used tests as well as over 50 handy test-related Internet sites. A \\"user friendly\\" resource, Your Child And Tests is very highly recommended for all parents school-age children concerned with how tests can affect their child's future and making sense out of test scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger the Dog Yard Cat","review":"I was disappointed in this book as book rated for ages 9-12.

Lyrically, there are some silly album tracks (as there were on all the early albums), but \\"Hey, Hey Helen\\" and \\"Tropical Loveland\\" show some real range, delving into rock and reggae. I give this four stars because I feel that Abba's last three studio albums--\\"Voulez-vous,\\" \\"Supertrouper,\\" and \\"Arrival\\" really are their most complete achievements, but \\"Abba\\" is a great classic pop album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old music","review":"I really love this CD.

I am going to teach this text tomorrow and now looked again wistfully at some of the errors I had seen earlier and had forgiven. I saw a \\"new\\" one now that I simply cannot forgive! In making a crucial distinction between slavery in his homeland and slavery in the West Indies, Equiano said in the original and all other versions: \\"...they do no more work than other members of the community.\\" In Sollors's Norton Critical Edition, that becomes \\"...they do more work than other members of the community,\\" a complete opposite that radically inverts the meaning. This is truly horrible. It didn't make sense in context, thank heavens, so an attentive person would immediately be suspicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you FINISH it???","review":"I got this game over 2 years ago-and I haven't finished it yet. You ask me why? In the 3rd world, there is a level that comes to a dead end, or seems to. I just can't figure it out. The first levels are fun and Croc is really cute, but that one level is completely weird. If you are an expert gamer, try it and tell me how to finish it!

I thought it was going to be really good, since a few people thought it was a decent game. Well, I was WRONG! It has HORRIBLE graphics and I cant seem to progress in the game. I am really good at video games, and I can't seem to play this well; there are tooooo many things and places to go at once. I like it when you have maybe 2 to 4 options tops into going to a new room or place but this game has like 20 options in one place! I hate that!

I'd read one of Golden's books before, but this was FAR better. Star Trek at it's best tends to combine the action with big healthy doses of humor-Christie Golden mixes the two adroitly into a great book. I did wish that Janeway and Hrrrl's finding Kes had been documented, rather than just showing up, but Chakotay's maneuvers were extremely clever. The description of Paris's leg is not for the squeamish. Above average!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christie Golden does it again!","review":"I am in the middle of this book currently, and I can definitely say that it has met my expectations. Though the cover's line of \\"It's Paris and Torres against the wilderness, with Kes' life at stake!\\" is a bit deceiving (I haven't come across a B'Elanna/Tom moment yet), it has remained true to the characters and been an entertaining read. Christie Golden's writing style is informative yet pleasureable, making her one of the best Voyager book writers. The wonderful writing of Seven of Nine is repeated again in Marooned-I only withheld a star because I haven't finished the book yet. I would definitely recommend buying this book, it is quickly becoming one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"If you own a pace car, you need this book. This was the only refernce that had any detail on the rare 1969 Camaro Z10.Information on the breed is as rare as the actual car.It could use updating as more information is available since this was published.

Probably better than the concert.The show and the audience was great. At the time I wish I could have seen it, but I am sure this DVD is close.If you like Elton at all, get it!If you don't like Elton - get it for the sound quality! Audiophiles - This disk is great! I have a 5 amp home theater system set up for great sound and I can play this at concert levels and it sounds wonderful!! This is the benchmark in DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The sole reason that I purchased this DVD was to see the duet with Elton John & Kiki Dee.

Nice composition and 27 tracks. Picture quality could have been better. I use Frampton's DVD on my HDTV as a benchmark.Close ups are fine, but you might notice that all the long shots are not as clear. Look around the stage and you won't see any boom or roving cameras like you see at many other concerts. This might explain the less than perfect pictre quality. Overall though this is a must buy for DVD concert fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The video quality is yuk!","review":"The video quality is fuzzy and out of focus, -but it's a great compilation of his best songs done well, if only it were 'watchable', too. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Elton fans!","review":"A great venue, a great show, and a great entertainer. Tireless energy, editing and production is first class...gotta have this! Makes a fantastic weekend evening's entertainment with old friends. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton at his best","review":"Elton John has played Madison Square Garden more than any other artist in history and he clearly loves the venue; and the venue loves him. This is a great DVD -- sound and picture are exemplary. Comments about the length of the VHS do not pertain -- this is virtually the whole concert, although clearly not from just \\"One Night Only.\\" (There two nights of shows.) The highlights of both nights are well represented, most notably, \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding,\\"\\"Candle in the Wind,\\"\\"Someone Saved my Life Tonight,\\"\\"Rocket Man,\\" and \\"Come Together,\\" and the performances are powerful and vibrant. Two rarely played songs, \\"Club at the End of the Street\\" and \\"Little Jeannie\\" are remarkably fresh. Elton's piano prowess is clear as is the tightness of his veteran band, and the guests, especially Billy Joel and Mary J. Blige, are clearly paying homage to one of their mentors. This DVD is a must-have!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior video quality","review":"It is too bad that this dvd has such bad quality video - the camera work is excellent - the audio is great - the song selection is great - Elton & guests are all great - The video quality is TERRIBLE which is really too bad on what could of been a great dvd concert.With todays high tech why they ruined this is beyond.................!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE NIGHT ONLY DVD ON PAR WITH SPRINGSEEN IN NYC","review":"IGNORE THE VHS REVIEW of the VHS version. THE DVD is SPECTACULAR! 28 songs, plus the I WANT LOVE video. It's as good a concert as i could hope for - the editing, the letterboxing, the song selection (but for a few weird choices) is fantastic. out of the 28 songs, 23 of them are fantastic versions of songs we love. SOMEONE SAVED MY LIFE TONITE is outstanding. it's over 2 1/2 hours long. Elton is at top form. DON\\"T GO BREAKING MY HEART will make u cry. This is simply a must have for any elton fan. It's on par with the recent SPRINGSTEEN IN NYC dvd in the sense that it's a definitive collection of favorite songs shot superbly. trust me - but this immediately - you will become as obsessed with it as i am."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IT FOR THIS PRICE!!!!","review":"this is a great video, but shop around!!! you can get it for much much cheaper!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Concert","review":"Great songs and shots. Outstanding sounds. My only thing negative comment is that some of the shots are kinda out of focus (blurry) and I'm watching this on my plasma TV. Overall, Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am not an Elton John Fan, but...","review":"I have no time to write a proper review, but I will say if you are a fan, buy this DVD. At MSG, NY, he basically does almost every hit. The Video production is great. (No camera switching every 3 seconds, no video fluff),pure Elton John, in DTS Glory. If you are not an Elton John fan, but yougrew up hearing his songs (70's, 80's, 90's), you will know every singlesong on this DVD.I hold highly only a few DVD's, having been a teenager in the 70'sborn at the end of the Baby Boom. If you have some of these, then I can tell you it is of the same quality, only honestly the sound is higher quality as is the video at 16:9 Wide Screen.:Fleetwood Max - The DanceStyx - Back to Paradise.ELO - Zoom Tour LivePink Floyd - The Pulse"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"OMG, OMG, OMG get this DVD if you even slightly know EJ's music. I love him but my husband is a big Motown fan and refuses to believe any other music is worth his time. I put this in and from beginning to end he knew every song and most of the lyrics much to his dismay. It's great. One BIG problem was his last song. The finale is \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" with KiKi Dee. Give me a break. It was such a let down I could not believe it. What's with that for God's sake???????? Otherwise that was the only distraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful resource for any aromatherapy lover.","review":"I am a lover of scented potpourri and candles and wanted to learn more about essential oils without getting overwelmed. This book gave me wonderful ideas and how-to's without the feeling that I have so much more to learn. I refer back to it constantly and every time I enjoy the beautiful pictures and backgrounds. It's an easy read and includes a conversion table in the front that I found very useful. I would recommend this book to beginners and authorities in aromatherapy because it's such an informative and creative book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ...","review":"I hated this game I got to championship level in 15 minutes.

I actually prefer it that way as I don't like to have long curtains in my son's room in order to keep it a trouble free zone for him. This coordinates perfectly with the Trains, Planes and Trucks bed set. Make sure you note the width of the valance and make sure it is wide enough for your window. I had to order another since my window is wider than the valance. Once I had them both, however, it looked perfect! I'm very pleased with this purchase as well as with all of the Olive Kids products I have bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful","review":"The valances seem fine if you know what you are getting. They are unlined and pretty flimsy. They are tab top valances that measure 44 by 15. They are not 85 inches long like Amazon says. They are also not 88 inches long like the PACKAGE says. Also, they are blue and light blue not blue and white. I called Olive Kids directly and they said \\"gee, the packages are all mismarked. You can return them if you like.\\" Of course, I had already bought all the coordinated bedding. I then spoke to an Amazon telephone representative (in the Phillipines) who tried to explain that they are 44 inches long but they \\"look like they are 85 inches long.\\" Oh yes, that makes perfect sense. Anyway, if you want something that matches the bedding, this is your only choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice - Valence which comes with the drapes is more dull than what is shown on website.","review":"I got his along with the drapes and it was very short (didn't quite fit my window) and the print was too dull. Didn't quite like the quality of the material also"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive price but cheaply made. Valance only!","review":"Wow, this is flimsy for $20 a piece!!!! I have seen better valences at the dollar store. I should have purchased fabric and made it myself. I'm not very crafty, but these are sooooo cheap looking I'm sure I could do an equally good job.It's also only the valance even though the picture shows otherwise. That's a little sneaky. So dressing two windows would cost $40 in valances and $60 more dollars on curtains and they're paper, really, paper thin. Not worth $100!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Olive Kids Valance","review":"I had to use two valances on a double window.I paired them with the curtains with tiebacks.They look very cute and were great in my grandsons \\"Thomas\\" room. He has outgrown Thomas,so we bought the quilt to match the curtains.He loves the set! The curtains are a very light weight so they will not insulate the room at all.I felt they were a good value for the low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a Little More and Buy Something Better","review":"This product was cheap, and in every sense of the word, it shows. While the walls were fairly easy to put up, they are nearly paper thin and don't clean very well.Home Depot has a fiberglass tub surround that is thick, durable, and would look very nice once installed. The price is only double what this 5-piece tub surround by American Shower & Bath goes for and is sure to make all the difference in the world. Now that I've finished remodeling the bathroom, my next project is to replace the cheap shower walls with a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love: brighter then I expected, light weight","review":"I ordered this 2 days ago regular shipping, super fast shipping.Great condition, bright light, light weight, good size for regular size sketchbook paper.

I thought after all the good reviews on multiple websites that my search for a reasonable budget glove was over. No so these gloves were by far the worst yet.... With gloves on, finger rubber protection was twisted to the side not on top. Pinky finger, same length as ring finger making them almost a half inch to long...hard knuckle didn't even cover the knuckle 1/8 inch on both sides two small. Doesn't sound like much but the downward curve of the hard knuckle would dig in to my knuckle. Gloves are extremely tight, wrist strap would only fit a child and no I don't have freakishly wide and super short pinky having hands just normal medium size hands. I would not recommend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fox Head Mens Bomber Glove","review":"I purchased these based on good reviews I have seen in the past. My experience however has been rather disappointing. The gloves have seen light duty but seem to be coming apart at the seams. Lots of loose threads. The hard knuckles are seperating.

They don't cover your wrists, so if that's a feature you're looking for, you'll need to check out a different model, but, for me, they are absolutely perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"They really are \\"Bomb Proof\\"","review":"Fox Bomber gloves live up to their name. I have taken many hard falls while on MTB trails. Most of my riding is downhill in rocky terrain so when I take a hit my equipment better hold up. These have met and exceeded my expectations. The knuckle guards make a lot of deference. I have no doubt that on at least two of my rides I would've broken my knuckles had it not been for these gloves.

I thought the first pair dying was bad luck, well stupid is as stupid does.I recently purchases THOR IMPACT MX MOTOCROSS gloves to replace 2nd pair of dead bomber gloves. I cannot explain how much better the thor gloves are in every way; stitching, material, protection, comfort, breathing, looks, the list goes onyou would have to be literally nuts to buy the bomber gloves over those Thor, trust me, save yourself.

The variety of themes in this story are beyond awesome; they are amazing. The way Mr. Anderson weaves them all together is likewise amazing. His characterizations - from heroes to villains - satisfy the soul. The science is right on. Ronica Berkin is the most estimable woman I have ever met. Yes. I met her, in this book.

At first, it was hard for me to believe that an alien skunk could have so many adventures, but once I was finished reading the book, it seemed like there was nothing unusual at all about it. I liked the suspense and excitement throughout the whole book, because I like books that always have something happening in them.

What a disappointment! The original Pure Moods disc had been unusual pieces of music from around the world, including movie scores, techno, orchestral, and others -- usually with the only theme being that they created a pleasant 'mood' of some type. Pure Moods 4, however, seemed to me to be just a bunch of hippie-pop. Every third song is another Sarah Maclachlan piece! (Okay, okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but I have a distinct memory of listening to the disc, and repeatedly going, \\"Good Lord, who made this awful song?\\" And every time it would be Sarah Maclachlan *again.*) There was but one good song on the whole disc, the Chocolat theme as I recall, and not even good enough to bother keeping the thing on my shelf.

The worst disappointment however was that two of the flanges on one of the items were bent to the point of causing the paint to crack and peel, thus exposing the raw metal. But wait, there's more. The glue used to secure the ceramic portion to the metal flanges had oozed and was clearly visable. I did not contact the sender as it would be inconvenient to return and I had already been inconvenienced enough.

The song - with a different B-side - did not chart in the UK.The CD includes an outtake of Dear John and an alternate version of Oceans Away.The album cover is a standout in this era of incredible artwork.

Since I knew I was going to be getting a new, smaller laptop soon, I decided to keep the bag because it is roomy with plenty of pockets. When I got my Samsung NC10, the bag turned out to be perfect. I put my 10 inch computer in the padded pocket longways with the slightly padded bag I use to carry the power cords and they fit perfectly, leaving me even more room. Because I carry my laptop nearly everywhere I go, I use this bag as my primary bag. It has room for my Blackberry, my Zune, my wallet, pens, small notepad, and other incidentals without being crowded. The outside pocket is great for my keys. If you have a smaller laptop, then I would recommend this bag to you without hesitation.

The humor is dry and the acting is poor, I can't believe Hugh Grant would sign on to an atrocity like this considering the direction of his career as of late. I gave this 2 stars only because of Dennis Quaid's very humorous and satirical portrayal of the American president, it's a shame that his was the only performance in the film that made me laugh.

For a comedy, I only laughed perhaps twice in two hours. I thought it would be a funny send up of American Idol. It wasn't.

Dennis Quaid wasn't funny, Hugh Grant wasn't funny, and really I wish I had left and asked for a refund. It's amazing how a movie like that can make it to the screen.

This is one of the most funny and well done films I have ever seen. It is pure genius, clever and crafty. It comes with an important message; that for our leaders to be so out of touch with the reality of the world (ie. GW Bush) comes with a terrible price for us all. The film communicates this message with wit, hilarious comedy and cleverness. I have never laughed so hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dark ending to a slightly boring film.","review":"The ending of this film was like something from a black comedy--it was very dark and not very funny. It did not match the rest of the film at all.'American Dreamz' is a spoof on the Bush administration and the TV show 'American Idol'. The spoof of 'American Idol' is only tepidly amusing at best, and the spoof on Bush never really takes off. Dennis Quaid, as the president, has nothing to work with in the way of clever dialogue and comes across as boring and inconsequential rather than inept or funnily stupid.Mandy Moore's character is more realistic, but not very likable. Sam Golzari's character is the most entertaining of the film, but not for the runtime of a full-length movie. Maybe if this had been a sketch comedy instead of a feature film, I would have liked it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this comedy!","review":"It is so rare to see a clever, laugh-out-loud political comedy, and \\"American Dreamz\\" is just that. \\"American Dreamz\\" realizes that half of what is going on in the world right now is just ridiculous, and by just showing us that, it succeeds brilliantly. I mean, the Middle East is royally screwed up! Suicide bombers here, kidnappings there, yet \\"American Idol\\" is on the airwaves! Are we living in a crazy world or what? \\"American Dreamz\\" makes us look at the current world situation and laugh at its absurdity. A really wonderful movie. Younger people who feel dulled by the daily news barrage will find the film particularly refreshing. Older people will realize that there is humor in everything, even suicide bombers (yes, some are gay and love Hollywood musicals!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it and couldn't","review":"Great concept, lots of potential, just didn't pull together all that well. I liked it, but I really wanted to love it and just couldn't. Seemed choppy and disjointed, and for this type of film it should have flowed much smoother and had the laughs more consistent. It was pretty flat until the last 20 minutes, when they pull all of the stops and go for broke with great results. Hugh Grant was fabulously smarmy, Chris Klein played the patheticness of his character to the hilt, and Mandy Moore's shrieking was like nails on the chalkboard. Loved the terrorist addicted to showtunes angle, and yes, everything in this movie was a prime target for lampooning. Amused as all get out that people felt the need to walk out of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"More intelligent than the reviews would suggest","review":"I found this film, which satirizes pretty much everything from the Bush administration to Al Qaeda to American Idol to spoiled Arab-Americans, to be far more entertaining than the reviews had led me to believe. The humor is anything but subtle, but Willem DaFoe and Dennis Quaid doing Cheney and Bush, respectively, are hilariously on point, and Mandy Moore is quite wonderful as a composite Idol diva. Lots of good supporting talent, more than a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a reasonably engaging plot, add up to a fun couple of hours and even a scintilla of political profundity. Idol fans will find lots to enjoy, but it works even without all the Idol in-jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep","review":"I am a huge Hugh Grant fan...but even his presence in the movie couldn't keep me awake!

Marcia Gay-Harden does a dead-on version of what I hope Laura Bush would be like, having to live with such a blow-hard fool. A must see, as far as I'm concerned. I have to warn you though, I laughed through the first part, and then realized of course that none of it was funny. It was all too chillingly real to me in light of recent events.

This is the only one that has creative recipes that would inspire anyone, regardless of their dietary preferences.

Fran M. has written many other cookbooks and read even more; she is truly a gourmand. Now she's discovered low-carb! This book is a must for the low carb kitchen: A great foreword with the medical lowdown on low-carb; a section on \\"the low carb gurus\\" comparing and contrasting Atkins, Zone, Protein Power, etc; a great \\"Panty\\" section telling what to throw out of your cupboards (or give away); how to entertain non-low-carb'ing friends; this book is filled with useful sections. Oh, and the recipes! I started this diet eating cheese, meat, and meat with cheese on it. What variety I've found here! Some recipes are more exotic, and some suited for \\"weekday\\" cooking. Desserts! Strawberry gelati! Cheesecake! Chocolate mousse! (I may have to get that ice-cream maker).THANK YOU! (Could the next edition have photos please? And a longer index?)

I was pleased to note that Ms. McCullough is an editor of several cookbooks, and my faith was justified. I have made several recipes (try the Red Hot chili -- it's great!) and all have been successful and tasty. I especially appreciate the long introductory section where she goes into detail about ingredients and pantry-stocking for the low-carb lifestyle, and the information on sweeteners was extremely interesting and useful. The other thing I like best about this cookbook is the extensive list of recipes for vegetables and side dishes -- I already know how to cook the meat, so adding variety with the limited number of low-carb veggies is important. I've recommended this book to several friends, with great results for them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of only two cookbooks I use! I swear by this book.","review":"Until this book, I was intimidated to make low-carb dishes that called for more than one ingredient. Dr. Atkin's cookbook was not realistic for my budget, tastebuds, or prep time. Fran's book is a blessing. I especially love to make the smothered pork chops in my Pampered Chef mini roaster. The beef stroganoff on cauliflower is most tasty as well. This diet is critical to my health and weight goals; this book is critical to my diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many ways can you cook meat? Not worth the price","review":"Pretty disappointed with the cookbook. It really wasn't worth the expense. The low carb diet books (Protein Power and Dr. Atkins) are great with recipes included...this didn't add much. I will try the recipe for ice cream though. The diet is great...lost over 20 pounds in a month...but, really, how many ways can you cook eggs and meat, heavy cream and cheese? The recipes for eggs are truly inspiring (including how to boil eggs, scramble, fry and don't forget..poach). To be fair, there were some weird options maybe worth trying if someone cooked them for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"STORE FOR YARD SALE","review":"MY GOODNESS WHAT A TERRIBLE BOOK UNLESS YOU LIKE SOY- FLAXSEED-TOFU-BURRITO MADE WITH AN EZEKIEL SPROUTED GRAIN TORILLA (WHATEVER THE HECK THAT IS)LOL.

However, eating all the protein and fat you want and forcing the body into ketosis is questionable health advice. McCullough leans more toward a Dr. Atkins philosophy, than a Barry Sears (The Zone) balanced protein/carb low, but \\"good fat\\" approach. She clearly loves her fat and sweet, calling for \\"heavy cream\\" and \\"aspartame\\" (Nutrasweet) in many recipes. Nevermind that saturated fat has been shown to raise cholesterol levels (linked to America's #1 killer, heart disease) and Aspartame has been shown to cause cancer in rats (and feed melanoma tumors), you can now use them freely in your cooking if you take the author's advice. Weight-watchers are better off sticking to fruits and vegetables, eating low fat, eliminating sweets, and limiting portions of complex carbs.

So far I have tried a few dozen recipes and none were disappointing-- even for my gourmet \\"foody\\" husband. It has lots of great ideas that reduce the carbs in creative ways. One of my favorites so far is using ribbons of peeled zucchini sauteed in garlic and oil instead of pasta-- love it! The small size is convenient to bring along to the supermarket when meal planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an excellent cookbook!","review":"My husband and I love this cookbook. We have made several of the recipes and enjoyed every one. Our particular favorites are the Fried Chicken, Beef burgoyne and the Italian Meat Loaf. Also, the Chocolate Mousse is outstanding.

I would have given it 4 to 5 stars but for one thing. The nutritional information provided includes ONLY \\"net carbs\\". While some believe that you should only count total carbs minus fiber, there are many qualified nutritionists who still suggest counting total carbs. The author does not provide any information on either total carbs or fiber count. Therefore, this book is only useful for those who want to count \\"net\\" carbs. This reduces the value significantly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist book","review":"This book was straight up racist against white people. It argues that affirmative action based on socioeconomic status rather than race would be bad for black people... Yeah, rich black people. Also I had to pay over 70 dollars for this \\"textbook\\" that refers to the Bush presidents as \\"Bush one and two\\". If you have to buy this textbook for a class TAKE ANOTHER CLASS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book","review":"I didn't really like this book. It was for a course I was taking up at San Francisco State University. It was too heavily weighted towards the African American problems of equality.

Like I said, it was required reading for a Poly Science course I was taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric, your communism is showing","review":"Eric Hobsbawm, as a person with a deeply-held belief (communism) that is opposed to the subject he purports to carefully examine, was unable to overcome his own debilitating point of view and write neutrally on the topic of nationalism. The book is replete with his attempts to dimish or demean the various forms of nationalism, and it is only logical to assume that his animus is due to communism's ultimate denial of national sentiment. To top it off, at the end of Chapter one Hobsbawm hypocritically lectures his audience about the importance of detachment and impartiality in the study of nationalism. So read the book for a quick, interesting overview of various national movements, but always remember that what you're reading is not as scholarly as it claims to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confirmation for Marxists, but not much analysis","review":"Hobsbawn's book is quite over rated as a text about nationalism. Those fellow idiological readers who share Hobsbawn's delight in exposing the \\"myths\\" of nationalism and nations will of course find it \\"brilliant and insightful\\", but one wonders if they admire the analysis, or just agree with his conclusion? Hobsbawm's strongly implied conclusion that nationalism and nations are \\"on the way out\\" means for him that so is war and conflict. But one wonders if for all the faults of nationalism and nations if the institutions and arrangements that replace them will be any better. There was war, slavery and injustice long before the 18th century, whether systems were empires or feudal, so why should the successors of nations be any better. Oh, I forgot if we all think like Hobsbawm \\"we can unite.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre book, sorry.","review":"The seller of this book did any excellent job in packing and shipping, but the book itself is nothing special.For example, for Easter?, it gives a recipe for \\"special mashed potatoes\\"!

You can do better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes planning a party easy","review":"This cook book includes lots of pictures (I think one for each recipe) and is separated into chapters for each holiday.

It's from the director of COMMANDO (mid-80's hit with Schwartzeneger), which was also junk, and seeing how far Mark Lester has fallen is no surprise.The plot I'm sure looked great on B-movie paper, and the promise of getting the attractive Jenya Lano to shed her clothes and go at it on camera probably is what has propelled this to direct-to-dvd hit. And you do get to see Ms. Lano in all her gorgeous glory. If that's what you're after, purchase away.But the rest of the movie is basically a limp life-support system for this one commercial element. Stupid twists and terrible scene-chewing abound. To be clear, it's not horridly unprofessional in it's execution. This is a compotently made film, technically. But creatively, it's sad. Best to rent this and just fast-forward to the boobies, if that's indeed what one is after."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BE FOOLED BY THIS GAME'S BOX","review":"This is definitely a kiddy game in disguise.

The graphics aren't so hot, especially on Game Boy Advance which makes the game impossible to see in dark light.

This is, by far, the best effort I have seen which strategically presents and describes the criteria, then provides practical counsel on how to apply it. As such, it is invaluable to examiners and consultants, and especially so to senior leaders and internal change agents attempting to improve performance within the Baldrige framework. The authors' lucid explanations of the key linkages within the criteria are alone worth the purchase price. The software included is worth many times the price. If you are serious about using the Baldrige criteria, this is a book you cannot afford to be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start but great overall!","review":"We homeschool and used this book as a read aloud to a 2nd and 3rd grader.

Highly recommend. More for an upper elem. if read to one's self."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4th graders loved it. A great tale.","review":"I would heartily recommend this book to the 11 and 12 year old set. There are not a lot of books appropriate for that age level with the personality of the Red Sails to Capri. It was a bit difficult for even good fourth grade readers to get the nuances, so I would alternate reading pages with the students. That said, after reading the book, I myself want to sail off to Capri to see the island and of course, \\"the cave.\\" Ann Weil does such a wonderful job of building the characters here from the Mama and Papa to the outgoing Angelo, and then the three travelers each in search of something different in life. And, the discussions we had about finding what we want in life by pursuing them were always interesting. This was one of my favorite books to use when I was teaching. It is not particularly easy reading, I certainly would recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erroneous grouping of disco and non-disco songs!","review":"While the songs here are certifiable hits, some of them do not belong in the \\"disco\\" genre (\\"Brickhouse\\", \\"Celebration\\", just to cite two). Whoever compiled these must have thought that all songs with a dance beat from the late seventies to mid-eighties belong in the category.He/She needs a little re-education.And although it was good to boogie to, \\"Disco Lucy\\" represents basic ingredients used to make records at the time. Many a producer just assembled a group of session instrumentalists, revamped a classic tune to a disco beat, threw in three female vocalists to provide the \\"wails of ecstasy\\" and \\"VOILA!\\" a hit was born.At the time of its release, the song worked. Now, it sounds like the ridiculous little ditty that it really was in the first place.But, we didn't care. We danced to it, anyway just like our folks danced to \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good product sabotaged by its maker!","review":"The good: Nice open design, tiny, rugged construction, positive clip-in and easy release. Good price if you find them on sale.The bad: SPINDLES ARE STAKED after assembly to preclude servicing, bearings aren't sealed and turn roughly for lack of retainers to space the balls.The bottom line: DON'T BUY THESE. They work okay, but after assembling and adjusting the pedals, Ritchey mangles the threads at the end of the spindle so you can't service the bearings. I bought 2 pair of these and all 4 spindles are staked, so it isn't accidental. Ritchey goes out of their way to destroy the value in this otherwise well-made and functional product. I guess they want to sell you a new pair whenever the bearings need repacking.

Phadrea starts off calm and innocent, to bait Angel into her trap. But we soon find out that she is psycho for real. Phadrea starts cutting herself so she can \\"feel\\" better and then tries to accuse Angel of cheating on her. There is more to the stroy line, but I don't want to ruin it for you.

Because of the minerals in the water where I go to school in Alabama I like to rinse off with the distilled water after my shower. I planned on just drinking and cooking with the water I made but rinsing with it after my shower has eliminated my itchy skin and my search for thick lotions, shea butter or body cremes! That lead me to think that the dryness of my skin affected my hair also and caused it to be shorter than when I first came to school here. I distilled a couple of gallons and washed my hair and it is the softest it has been since I moved here! So there are more uses for this machine than you'd think. 3 months ago I was buying gallons of distilled water at Walmart, the way I use this machine I see I couldn't buy enough to keep up with my needs. oh and the water tastes pretty good too:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good Distiller","review":"The unit is sturdy and well made with a nice simple design.I had previously very bad classic distiller . Waterwise 4000 is a superb product ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but improvements needed","review":"Works great but has a few design flaws. The glass carafe's plastic top is made of three plastic parts which don't fit together very well.The piece that fits over the pour spot pops out easily when pouring water and is mostly useless except to cover the pour spout when distilling and difficult to replace when done pouring. The other piece covers the water intake port and is only needed when not distilling, yet it doesn't fit.Some assembly is required for the carafe handle but the instructions were vague. Also, the distiller is somewhat noisy while running, but not too bothersome. The carafe must be perfectly aligned with the distiller or water will run out over the countertop.Aside from these minor flaws, it works great, making a gallon every four hours. As this is my first distiller, I don't know how it compares to other models. I am totally satisfied so far but I can only give it a four star rating because of the design flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Foundation For Understanding the Catholic Faith","review":"This was one of the first books I read in my journey that eventually led me to realize the Catholic Church was for me. As a Protestant all my life I needed a reasoned approach to the question of biblical authority and tradition. In the first few chapters I wasn't sure where the author was going and you might not either. But stick with it, underline, take notes. Don't rush through it and you will get a good overview of the topic. I would consider this invaluable for any person needing this information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and compelling","review":"By What Authority is a wonderful read. Shea's prose is witty and his argument is compelling. He describes how as a young evangelical Christian he encountered the writings of revisionist theologians who compose the \\"Jesus Seminar.\\" After studying the Jesus Seminar's attacks on the central tenets of Christianity, Shea gradually realized that the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura could not provide a sufficient basis of authority to adequately defend his Christian faith. Shea's book marvelously describes his faith journey to the Catholic Church how and why the Church has an articulable and authentic basis of authority on which one can confidently stake one's faith. This is a refreshingly quick read (it took me a day) but the argument is timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"My beauty staple","review":"I live in Colorado, where the climate is extremely dry and it's very hard to keep skin from being an itchy dry mess.

It is great to use while kissing. This stuff is so good you should buy them three at a time. Trust me, your family will steal yours!

Installed it with no problems. In the summer, when I wanted to use the attic fan again, couldn't get the cover off. In some places, the velcro was stronger than the adhesive holding the velcro on, but not the entire length of the fan. As a result, it came off normally part of the way, and then ripped across the cover when the velcro was stronger than the adhesive, making it unusable. I wouldn't recommend buying this if you ever want to use your fan again. There has to be a better way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation Maximum!!!","review":"This product was misrepresented by the seller.

After reading reviews about magnetic tape to hold the Battic fan shutter seal in place I checked my fan frame with a magnet, it's aluminum, so I used the velcro tape. The fan frame has a 1/4\\" recess into which the fan shutter seal fits (after trimming) so the seal material is almost invisible. Too early to tell what improvement this application will have so far as energy savings but any insulation is better than (none) bare fan slats. Good product.

One should appreciate the work and there is so much to enjoy here.This is theater, this is performance, this is perfection.Truly a comic masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Collection of Novel Works","review":"The greatest strength of this CD is also its greatest weakness. It is a very diverse collection of orchestral pieces, some of which are not available elsewhere. The Airs de ballet from Parysatis and the Waltz from Ascanio stand out as triumphs of delicacy and clever orchestration. The Tarantelle for Clarinet and the piano fantasy, Africa, are also welcome, if somewhat better known. The only disappointment is the Sarabande et Rigaudon, which seems uninspired and even dull. Finally, in a major shift of tone, the Requiem justifies careful listening, although it falls far short of the Faure Requiem in emotional expression and loveliness. It is a serious, profound composition.Unfortunately, the sheer diversity of the collection works against it. It seems almost jarring to listen to the Requiem immediately after some of the lighter works. That said, the performances are just fine, and it is a pleasure to have available the lesser-known pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Lasalle Rocks","review":"I love this CD.

That is the magic of Francesca Lia Block. She has been one of my favorite authors for many years.If you can suspend your disbelief, you will find some gorgeous writing and enchanting stories. The oddly-named characters will stay with you long after you read the last word. You will feel suddenly hopeful and elated, despite yourself.This is one of my favorite collections of erotica. \\"Mer\\" is a well-loved story (featured in many erotica collections), but all of these tales are utterly fantastic. At 25, I am no longer a child, but somehow, reading Block's writing always restores that wide-eyed wonder of youth, if only for a little while."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT QUALITY LITERATURE, BUT ENTERTAINING!!!","review":"Whereas I'd never call this book quality literature, it is definately entertaining. I read it in under an hour, and it kept my heart beating. It tells several love stories (all heterosexual, except one lesbian story), which are unrelated, but each have one similar character from another to keep them linked... which is a very clever tactic. It's very sexy and magical, and great for a saturday night home alone or a snowed-in sunday afternoon. I definately reccomend this book as a light, frivolous read. Enjoy!! (By the way, the hardcover edition is pocket-sized and purple - very cute.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Francesca?","review":"Francesca Lia lock has been one of my favorite authors for years now: I count The Hanged Man, Dangerous Angels, and Girl Goddess #9 among my favorite book, but this is book fails to capture the magic that lurks inside her others. Block is not an erotica writer, and it shows: the sex scenes are out of place, redundant, too fluffy, and really not that erotic at all. Many of the characters are whiny and unlikeable, although I did find the character of Plum to be interesting. The stories are too short to really pull you into them, and when she tries to intertwine them, it comes across forced and sketchy. While Francesca Lia Block's work is without a doubt wonderfully unique and beautiful, this particular book isn't. Even her biggest fans would do fine in skipping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and healing","review":"This book is beautiful. I read it on the way to a wedding and was amazed by the poetry and the eroticism. It is a clever book with several interwining tales that do feature sex, but as several reviewers before me have mentioned, these tales focus on the healing power of sex. I think anyone (possibly even a teenager, though I would hope not yet) can understand certain situations in this book. No one other than Francesca could have written this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointing","review":"i love francesca, i'm proud to be one of the many in her cult following, and i was so excited to read this book when i got it, despite the bad things i'd heard about it. i didn't believe it could be true, but this book is definitely lacking.first off, it's the same wonderful flowery francesca prose, but then she gets to the sex parts and it's almost like the vulgarity is forced. she doesnt even make an attempt to make the sex poetic.my advice is to get this only if you love francesca, just to read it because it's her. but otherwise, save your money to get one of her other books, like echo or weetzie bat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has wings...still falls flat","review":"I am enchanted by the writing style of Ms Block, but I found the stories in this book to be a little heavy-handed.

The vocabulary is vulgar, insulting, and the stories are not for the age group in which she intends. If I were a parent, and my Young Adult brought home this book, I would be shocked, angry, and demand why anyone would purchase such a collection of vividly sexual short stories, and make them available for anyone to read!

Healing powers of sex? Right. The only time I can think of it as being healing is when two people who are committed to each other are making love and it's not simply about sex. True the book is poetic but my point that it is sending out a trashy message is proven simply by reading other people's reviews here.People want to avoid reality so much that many will want to live the fairy tales they read. Believe me that not that many people can differentiate between reality and fantasy. Look at what the movie The Craft did for Wicca. Too many people believed that the fiction they were seeing were real and wanted to act like the characters. Fortunately magick is not as simple as portrayed. But sex - anybody can have a go at it.

I'm sure there's a better racing game out there for this system.

This CD is not a complete disaster, however, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating. Quite a few 4/5 star songs however, lots of 2-3 star songs. Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.I think the people that rated this 4 or 5 stars don't own a lot of lounge/chill and are probably a lot easier to please.

Living on the east coast, it has not updated automatically even once since I purchased it, even though I dutifully put it next to a window (as suggested) before going to sleep. But this requirement brings up another poorly thought-out design: if the watch is over near the window at night, it's not a very convenient alarm clock (as I use it this way often as I travel.) And that, in turn, brings up yet another poor feature: the alarm only sounds for 10 seconds. If it was a short night's sleep, 10 seconds isn't enough to get my attention and I now must set (any carry) another alarm clock to insure that I arise promptly. Additionally, the watch is very heavy, and some of the buttons are very difficult to push."},{"rating":"1","title":"still havent recieved","review":"i have yet to recieve this item and i ordered it a month ago. i was supposed to get it while i was home on leave but that didnt happen. now im back in baghdad and dont kno when ill get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"casio g-shock","review":"very satisfied with product.

For Lady Marmalade by LaBelle, it was and still is absolutely divine and soulful. Unfortunately, the version from Moulin' Rouge with Nicole Kidman, isn't one to live up to expectations. The collaboration of Pink, Lil' Kim, Christina Aguillera, and Mya, sounds more like a divafest of knowing who is the better diva. The song also adds a rap that Lil' Kim conjured that really wasn't part of the version LaBelle made that didn't even add spice to it. Instead, it just sinks the track to even lower heights.

About 2 weeks ago, the smaller of the two escaped through a gap in the bars. We were never able to find her. I didn't remove the cage topper because I thought the other mouse, who is a full-grown adult, was not able to get through the bars. Apparently, I was wrong. Yesterday my daughter discovered the other mouse was not in the cage. We set out food, which was taken overnight, but haven't seen the mouse yet. So my daughter now has a tank topper for an empty tank. And if we find the mouse, she will not be using the tank topper anymore.I gave it 2 stars because when the mice stayed in it, it was really cute. The food goes in the upper level, and the mice learned quickly to run up the ramp. However, they then pee and poop on the platforms, which stinks to no end.

The plastic house walls were chewed up within 3 months of owning it, so there is only 1 wall that snaps together. Other than this, it works great. Perfect for hamsters, since they like to climb.

However, we ended up with the dwarf hamsters and this did NOT work for them AT ALL. They didn't escape, as others stated, but they would NOT use the ramps at all. So we had a very cute tank topper that just sat there. It might work better with larger hamsters, but I will never know. Thanks to Amazon though, I am able to return it for a refund. If you want something for dwarf hamsters I would go with the critter type trails or something like that - we just bought a set that works with a mesh tank topper and the second we had it assembled the hamsters were crawling in and out, up and down. So while I only gave this one star, it is b/c of the fact that it does not work for the smaller type of hamster - it may be wonderful for larger ones, but we'll never know.

It is a very heartfelt story about a boy that's 12 years old named Pascal. His brother, Gideon, about 16 years old, finally shows back up at the plantation after two years of being gone. He says the slaves have been freed. Pascal gets his 8 year old friend Nelly and tells her to pack up. They're going to leave to freedom. They leave their plantation and eventually end up in Georgia, where they get a land grant. They find their land and start a beatuiful home with the cotton crops flourishing. Despite the great wealth of cotton and their new home, they never get a mule. But more and more slaves are losing their homes. The book gives a great message of hope, belonging, and friendship as their family grows and Pascal learns the true meaning of freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defining Freedom","review":"Read in December, 2012reviewForty Acres and Maybe A Mule - Harriette Gillem RobinetHow does one define Freedom? That is the question that the characters in the book have asked each other. Gideon, an ex slave defines freedom as having his own land where people will respect you. Nelly defines freedom by pointing to her heart. Pascal is still searching what freedom means to him.This story takes place in Georgia during the Reconstruction period. All ex slaves and poor whites were granted forty acres and a mule. In the South the plantation owners recoiled at the mere fact that their \\"property\\" actually were being treated like a citizen and were aiming to put a stop to this. Many of the southern men started groups such as the \\"Klu Klux Klan\\" to intimediate the ex slaves into going back to their former owners, burning their towns, and farms. So the question comes back to the character or maybe to the reader.

Some people compare their new album to getting a retro feel and make it sound like it's a bad thing. There is nothing better than music from the 70's and 80's. If they draw inspiration from those eras, more power to them. I recently went to a concert in which they were an opener and wanted to leave right after they finished. I wished I did because the headliner sucked. This band will never sound repetitive and if someone is looking to hear something that blows any mainstream acts out of the water should buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened!","review":"This CD is just like all the other grunge rock bands that are out now, why did Phantom Plant mess up such a good sound they had on guest with this trash!

My only exposure to Phantom Planet before purchasing their self-titled release was their single \\"California.\\" I liked the song at the time but never took to the time to check them out. After a friend recommended their new album I took a chance and purchased it. This album is one of my favorites of 2004.Obviously there is a New York influence on this album, but there's still a California mix. My favorite tracks are \\"1st Things 1st,\\" \\"By the Bed\\", and \\"knowitall.\\" I am sure there are many comparisons that can be drawn, but Phantom Planet's sound stands on it's own. For me it ranks up with The Walkmen's \\"bows and arrows\\" and The Killers \\"Hot Fuss.\\" All three of these albums are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution","review":"Ok, if anyone is going out to buy this CD because you think it's going to sound like the Guest, it doesn't; but it's awesome all the same.

But I went and saw them live about 4 days after the release of the CD at Tower Records on Sunset in LA. Let me tell you, I am absolutely in love with the CD now. Alex Greenwald makes all of the songs come to life on stage, and I found myself actually singing along to the songs I didn't supposedly like. I especially love \\"1st thing's 1st\\", \\"Making a Killing\\", \\"The Happy Ending\\", and \\"By the Bed.\\" The band has really grown and evolved on this album, and it's for the better.

I, however, am pretty neutral about this CD. I bought the album with very high hopes. I heard that they kinked the sound a little, and I was excited, but when I listened to it, it didn't sound like they were trying to change their sound, it sounded like they were following the mainstream trend of the Strokes/Vines/White Stripes/Hives ect. ect. Also, it's... well.... not good at all really. They have almost no musicianship on the album. This CD just left me dissapointed in Phantom Planet.

Many of the songs do sound the same, and I find that within the songs, there is lack of variety. I've given it a few run throughs and so far the only song that I like is \\"By the Bed.\\" I understand that bands like to experiment to keep themselves entertained, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

I can fit more in my drawer, and I don't have loose plastic bags lying around.Since I don't buy my spices in bottles, I am not the least concerned that I can't fit a whole bottle into one of these bottles. And my spices are always fresh. And I am also staying green by not buying bottles that I will throw away after one use.Although the write-up suggests that labels are included. They are not. No Problem.

I buy my herbs/spices from a bulk store, so for the jars I didn't have already (from the grocery store, before I learned to save money by not paying for the brand, packaging, etc.), the spices would reside in plastic baggies, which quickly created a cluttered mess. These bottles arrived in perfect condition, and the caps w/large and small hole sizes are very convenient. I used a fine-point sharpie to write the names of the contents of the lid, but labels might look a bit fancier and easier to read, depending on your setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I ordered these bottles to use for my dried herbs. They're perfect--not too big, but big enough so I can store a lot of herbs. The different size shaker caps are very handy and fit tightly.I don't really care that they didn't come with labels; I just write on the lid or bottle itself with a permanent marker, or a sticky label (that I already have).I'm especially happy that they're made in USA. I had a hard time finding glass bottles made here, so I was thrilled that I could find these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I had been buying these individually at the health food store as I added to my spice collection.

She offered to credit me shipping cost ($18.47 for the heavier weight boxes - the 16 count boxes are only 5.99 to ship)if I wanted to keep the boxes, otherwise they would arrange to pick them up. She claimed that J.K. Adams does not make a 48 ct case. I responded that I wished to return the boxes (I had less than half of the bottles I needed, and the cost per bottle was now more than doubled).

Instead, I called J K Adams and they graciously sent me the caps and inserts free. They truly are wonderful people to deal with.

I was disappointed to find in place of the exam the following statement, \\"Our apologies! We have not yet developed a practice exam for the Chemical Engineering afternoon discipline exam...\\" I bought the book for the sample questions, which were extremely limited.

It continues, \\"If you are, then you were born like this, and you grow up like such, and this is how you catch your food\\" and on through the life cycle. They are very simple to read, yet very educational and very funny. At the end the book concludes that the reader is, in fact, probably not a spider, but a human boy or girl, and, thankfully, will never, ever, have to wrap up a bug and eat it! The last 2 pages contain fun and interesting facts about spiders. After reading this one I immediately went out and bought every book in the series for my niece.

Cornetists included Rex Stewart, Tommy Ladnier, and Bobby Stark, trombonists Charlie Green, Benny Morton, and Jimmy Harrison, Buster Bailey, Coleman Hawkins, and Don Redman were on reeds, and the latter also arranged and sang, and Kaiser Marshall was on drums. All 33 sides are here, sound quality is better than acceptable, and the fold-out liner contains discography, band photograph, and notes by Frank Driggs.

I think anyone who likes the movie will enjoy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Game Play, boring and predictable","review":"Technically, the camera does not follow you well, making it difficult to maneuver around. I loved the movie, but this game is not very intuitive. Compared to similar games such as Spyro, I was very let down by the lack of imagination in this game. Apparently, the movie's title changed through-out production, hence no toys. It seems as if this game was done just to complete what little punch the movie itself maintained. The game does have funny things in it, but the movie is very hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you'll be expecting","review":"The emperors new groove may look fun but its a rip off.

Yes, I know, the characters go back to their respective spouses at the end, but with no absolute guarantees of fidelity. Anyway, the plot, in this case, is not the point. What did attract me was the brilliant score by Cy Coleman, jazz man turned Broadway composer. He has turned his sharply tuned ear for jazz chords and variations to original, high calibre songs. There are warm, tuneful ballads such as the title song, \\"I Love My Wife\\" and the bittersweet \\"Someone Wonderful I Missed\\", as well as the melodically fascinating \\"Hey There, Good Times\\". These songs are both musically and dramatically well-rendered by a game cast: James Naughton, Lennie Baker, and Joanna Gleason.

The author did a massive amount of research and shows an understanding of the deeper underlying labor issues.

Even though Mr. Metzgar did not drive the point that all of us--even those of us with comfy office jobs--have better working conditions because unions have demanded them, his recitation of working conditions in the 20th century, made me realize this is so.

I was informed that I could not get the order re-shipped. Then again, I have had several shipments screwed up lately, and quite frankly, I am beyond tired of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"you won't learn to draw people from this book","review":"This book is mainly a group of images with the author discussing how to draw them step by step. However, there are very few tips about \\"how\\" to successfully draw them. The biggest tip in this book, which is repeated several times, is the number of head lengths in an adult or child's body, which IS a good tip, however I'd have expected manymore. The rest of the \\"tips\\" are more like: \\"draw this and be careful not to...\\" or \\"when sketching this use the negative space to find the shapes\\" - these are all good tips, if you're in a classroom with a teacher who is pointing at your drawing, but not helpful or useful in a book. This book is light on information.Finally, the thing that made me realize this just wasn't going to work was the fact that the author's drawings aren't really that good, in particular the faces are not drawn accurately to the photo images.I'm sure there are better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother","review":"If you cannot absolutely draw a line, maybe this book is worth it, but for the decent beginner drawer, this is a joke.

The book arrived on time and in great shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of unrealistic action scenes & contrived comedy, acting","review":"This movie has the same, typical lethal weapon plot. There's an \\"impressive\\" beginning, lots of ridiculous comedy in the middle (Chris Rock is annoying as a loose frog on a flea farm), they get ambushed by the bad guys, and then the lethal weapon ending when Riggs and Mertae single-handedly out-duke the bad guy whipersnappers. That's to be expected. Each \\"actor\\" just seemed to be reading the lines. The action scenes were unrealistic, to say the least. I think that 1 and 2 are much better. #3 was worse....this one beats #3 by far (in being poor)."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time and money renting this one","review":"Why did they even bother making another Lethal Weapon movie? Did they have some explosives and pyrotechnics left over and want to use them up? I guess Chris Rock was added to the cast so that Joe Pesci had someone to swear with. Was Rene Russo even in this one? No plot, an overabundance of extremely fowl language(you won't want the kids near this one) and lots of noise. I watched most of it on fast forward so I only suffered about 1.5 hours. If we are lucky, maybe this will finally be the last one before it becomes a real farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"attention les francais!!!","review":"la version francaise de l'arme fatale 4 de la region 1 est en fait la version canadienne ce qui ne pose pas de problemes mais peut surprendre car les voix ne sont pas les memes qu'en france,mais ne vous inquietez pas on n'entend quasiment pas l'accent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst of the Lethal Weapon Series","review":"The stunts and action scenes are good, but the PLOT!!!

Get the NEGOTIATOR, you'll be much more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it zero stars if I could","review":"Danny Glover is one of my favorite actors. I loved him in Predator 2 and all of those movies. Then Lethal Weapon 1, 2 and 3 came and I loved them. Mel Gibson was great with Danny Glover. Then in 1998 they had to pull that Chris Rock and put him in it. My friend likes # 4 just becuase Chris Rock is in it. They destroyed all the lethal weapons when they added these fools. If they left it at 3 everyone would look back and see Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. One Physco and one nice dressed cop. The only thing that Chris Rock and Joe Pecci can do is curse. Please don't get this movie becuase you won't like it unless you like a movie with a bad plot and a lot of cursing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Why a number 4? Instead of trying something fresh with the series, we get retread material. It's so obvious throughout this marketing-scheme of a movie that the only intention is to give the audience what the filmmakers believe they want. The results are gratuitous scenes of Joe Pesci being loud and unfunny, playing faithfully on the beaten-to-death \\"They #$%! you at the drive-thru\\" bit, along with Chris Rock throwing in his motormouth, all featuring dialogue that isn't nearly as fresh as the first two films. Give credit for the taming of Riggs' character and to Jet Li, a truly talented martial arts expert who steals every scene he is in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of action/Comedy by a landslide","review":"Lethal Weapon 4 combines action w/ great comedy! the movie itself is hillarous and a great pleasure 2 watch!

What r u waiting 4 get it already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending to the series!","review":"When I first heard that there was to be a Lethal Weapon 4, I was a wee bit skeptical. However, when I finally saw it I was definitely not dissappointed! Glover and Gibson were still the perfect team and the addition of Jet Li (my personal favorite) enriched the experience immensely.The only reason I didn't give the film 5 stars, was that Chris Rock's performance was a bit annoying at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lethal Weapon 4 was my favorite","review":"This was better than the first 3!

Mel,Danny and Joe are at their best and Chris Rock is a good addition,but Jet Li is the powerhouse presence in this film.Great to see Jet come out of those silly,staged Honk Hong flicks and get to show the skills that made him a consecutive 5 time Wu Shu champion in China,his speed is blinding,and will leave your mouth gapping open wondering,\\"How did he do that?\\"Go for it and enjoy,then demand to see more of Jet Li in American made movies!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"This movie is soo awesome.

I was laughing so hard in the theater that everyone looked at me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie too far","review":"Lethal Weapon was great, so too was LW2 and LW3 maintained the spark. Sadly/strangely, it looks like the creative team ran out of ideas and no wonder this one is believed to be the last of the series.An attempt to \\"soften\\" the movie with elements of unasked for \\"moving human drama\\" detract from the light escapism of the earlier movies. The trend for the writers and actors to take themselves increasingly seriously has now become impossible to ignore and is incongruous in what was never intended to be a serious themed \\"shoot em up\\" cop/buddy movie series.Fans of LW 1-3 will probably watch the movie anyway, as did I, but they'll be disappointed at the end, as was I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already!","review":"The Lethal Weapon series should have stopped at the second movie. The last two was just a comedy show to me, and I didn't like how the script sort of mocked the Asian culture with a couple of tasteless jokes. However, I did enjoy watching Jet Li showing unbelievable martial art skills and I am looking forward to seeing more of him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a truly terrible movie","review":"I agree - this was a \\"long verbal assault\\", full of \\"inane trash-talk.\\" I'm glad I'm not the only one that nearly winced at the \\"unnecessarily racist\\" jabber (supposedly Gibson's charachter trying to psych out the bad guys). Pesci and Rock were utterly useless. And what a waste of Jet Li's talent. Yet, he did more acting with his cold stare than Glover and Gibson could do in all their asinine yammering. What was the point of Russo's last scene? Glover, Gibson, Russo, Donner and Silver should be ashamed. I'm glad I only watched the rented DVD at someone else's house."},{"rating":"1","title":"This headache-inducing junk is for diehard LW fans only!","review":"This was such a verbal assault on the viewers--two plus hours of screeching, screaming, shouting, arguing, swearing--come on guys, good actors all, lost in a way-too-long self-indulgent farce. This could have been a decent, timely story if the producers/writers had taken a bit of care. There were some truly interesting effects, some genuine moments of humor, and a few cases of true suspense. But all the good stuff was overshadowed by inane trash-talk. This is a mockery of the original Lethal Weapon, and continues the three stooges aspect of LW3. Only the stooges were honestly funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price!","review":"I usually go for Blu Ray, but I don't mind a bargain on DVD. I had to own the whole series. It arrived quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the series, the actors, the \\"industry\\".","review":"Had this been Lethal Weapon I, there would not have been any sequels"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"I really enjoyed the first 3 Lethal Weapon movies, but this one is a snoozer. Chris Rock is funny as a comedian, but as an actor he's in need of some serious help. The whole movie was so overblown that it's just ridiculous!Don't waste your money. If you really must see it borrow it. It's not even worth the time to watch really, much less the cost to rent. Even Mel Gibson can't save this one from the trash heap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie to end the series,","review":"I like all the Lethal Weapon movies, and this one is no exception. I don't see why anybody wouldn't like \\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" because it's everything most people would expect it to be. It has a lot of fast paced action, good special effects, and a lot of laughs. What made \\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" one of the best two of the series in my opinion is the comedy that's in the movie. Without a doubt, it has more comedy in it than the other three movies in the series by far. Some of the funniest parts are when Joe Pesci makes friends with a shark, and the laughing gas scene at the dentist's office. Like always, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover put on great performances, and Joe Pesci is hilarious. I'm not crazy about Chris Rock's stand up comedy show, but he was actually pretty good in this movie. Jet-Li also shows off some of his awesome fighting moves at times in the movie.If you like movies with a lot of action and a lot of comedy, I recommend getting \\"Lethal Weapon 4.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better, but overall not bad.","review":"I can agree with P. Burdette's review to a certain extent. Lethal Weapon 4 could have been better, and I do think this film is vastly inferior to any of its predecessors, but overall, it isnt too bad. I appreciate comedy, even in an action movie, but I think they went way overboard with it. Like that scene where Murtaugh gloated that he was boinking Ebony Clark DURING A GUNFIGHT!!!, like any normal person would think about that while being shot at. The acting isn't as good as in the first 3 movies, but not bad enough to ruin the film. LW isn't a bad way to kill a few hours if you're bored, but nothing worth making a special effort to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll laugh but that's about it","review":"The Lethal Weapon movies have all offered their share of action, drama and comedy, Part 4 however is high in comedy but low in everything else. Riggs and Mortar just come off as complete bafoons this time around. In the other films it has been obvious that Riggs has a thing for the 3 Stooges it's very obvious this time because he never lets up, don't think their is one scene where he acts serious. I've always enjoyed seeing Riggs and Mortar beating the bad guys but this time for some reason I enjoyed seeing Jet Li kicking their butts around... Plus the only drama it actually offers is Joe Pesci talking about his dead frog named ....froggy that he accidently ran over with his bike. It's obvious that this one was just made in the sake of just making another one. Mel's so not in the part that he doesn't have the long hair this time around either and what is Riggs without the hair ? A wimp actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favortite movie of all time!","review":"This movie fit the rest of the Lethal Weapon series, but I think it was the best of the series. This movie had action and humor, to me that is what every movie should have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good movie.","review":"If you're a LW fan, this movie rocks. Lotsa comedy and action. The crazy stunts and car chases are all back and better than before. Unfortunately, you don't get to see Jet Li that much, who is a wicked cool villian. He kicks boo-ty. A great movie, A great DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same...but you should know that by now.","review":"For those that think that this is a pan and scan...TURN IT OVER! It is a two-sided disc. Other than those idiots, I think that anybody buying this movie ought to know what they are getting. Jet-Li should have had more scenes, and I do like seeing Mel get his butt kicked. He takes it well...An extra star for the extras, including that awesome scene from part 1 in the schoolyard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combination of comedy and action.","review":"Leathal Weapon 4 had me laughing from beginning to the end. It was a great movie. The people out there complaining of the foul language just shouldn't watch it if they don't like it. All of the Leathal Weapons were the same, seems to me if they didn't like the language they wouldn't of watched all of the LW movies. I guess some people just need to bitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fighting and terrible ending","review":"The people who knew Jet Li did not like the ways it ended. I like to watch him as a good guy and not as a villan. He is the best kung fu fighter I watched, even better than Jackie chan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet Li Stomps Mel Wimpson Into Nothingness!!!","review":"This movie stunk! The only good part about it was Jet Li. And what made it even better was watching him beat the snot out of Mel Gibson on more than one occasion. I laughed everytime. Jet Li is the true star of this flick. Mel is a weenie, predictable and pretty much an idiot throughout the entire film. Go watch \\"Fist of Legend\\" for some real action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrits in action","review":"Danny and Mel at it again. This time a weak plot smacks of PC and the Anti NRA poster wrongfully blames the NRA for child related firearms deaths. I would not own this peice of pronaganda if it were a gift. The hollywood elites Make billions with Gun movies and then pull this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was laughing at the movie not with it!","review":"Oooooh,this movie was silly! Now, Danny Glover and Mel Gibson made the best interracial screen pair in the last 15 years. Watching the first one, even on TV, is still entertaining. But this one: it is way over the top and too unbelievable! Really, the only thing worth seeing about this movie is the interplay between Glover and Rock. Glover and Gibson don't seem to have that magic. Maybe because Glover seems to follow Gibson's every command-- remember, from the first movie, Gibson is a certified nut! I hope this is the last! What this one will make you do is run to the video store to get the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IDIOTIC!","review":"How could anyone possibly claim that this fourth \\"Lethal Weapon\\" is \\"decidedly better than the first and third chapters\\"? The first \\"Lethal Weapon\\" was regarded as the \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" of action movies! \\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" is repeditive, macho action rubbish! The plot is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen. The whole premisis is just reason for explosions, martial arts, and gunfights. If you want an intelligent action film, get the original \\"Lethal Weapon.\\" If you want marred crap get this unoriginal wannabe."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"4\\": hopefully the finale in this fading series","review":"\\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" has three things going for it: the cast's excellent chemesitry, the emphasis on humor, and the amazing energy put out by the cast and crew. Now, plot and logic has never been the strong point of any of the previous \\"Lethal Weapon\\" films, but in this movie, the plot is a ridiculous excuse for car chases and outrageous action sequences. Chris Rock is an appreciated addition. He and Joe Pesci steal the stage everytime they're on screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours wasted","review":"Although I loved the first Lethal Weapon, #4 seemed to me to be nothing but two hours of force fed politically correct bull-oney. Sure, there was a lot of shooting, crashing and exploding -- but for no reason other than to have shooting, crashing and exploding. The action and comedy, unfortunately, were smothered by the political indoctrination. I'll pass on Lethal Weapon 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Weapon 4","review":"When are the boys of the LAPD going to realize it's time to hang it up?? This movie was 2 hours of complete stupidity and I think I'm dumber for sticking it out through the credits.Not only are the storylines getting cornier, the acting is far and away the worst of the entire series. Don't get me wrong - I think the Lethal Weapon series was very entertaining, but they've performed the cardinal sin of movie making by going one sequel too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are getting too old for this","review":"I thought the plot was flat and Chris Rock's role was totally redundant. He didnt seem funny in the movie at all (this movie wasnt very funny)! The only thing different from the previous episodes was Jet Li's actions, which is quite amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"Lethal Weapon 4 is a silly film.

This movie has a lot of laughs. All of the stars acted well in this movie. Love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"offended at the language","review":"It is amazing that actors like Gibson and Glover would work in such trash! Is this is the best Hollywood can do? Do they actually think that their foul language adds something to their otherwise lame script. All the \\"positive\\" reviews I've read are unbelieveable, but then again so are Bill Clinton's approva ratings! Must be from the same group."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Lethal Weapon movie.","review":"The first two films in the Lethal Weapon series were excellent! The third was pretty good. They should have stopped there! Lethal Weapon 4 is a tired retread. The beginning scene with Danny Glover in his underwear doing a chicken imitation? PLEASE spare me! Did we run out of good ideas here? Gibson and Russo had some real chemistry in #3. They looked like they were just going through the motions in this one.Joe Pesci was hilarious in #2 (now there's a movie!)with his complaints about take out, the way he was \\"abused\\" by Riggs and Murtough; #3 only slightly less funny with his hospital experiences. In #4 his monologue is old and contrived. He seems unable to work up any real energy.This movie is some old friends making a home movie -- more for their benefit than for ours. They never sell us, and I never forget that these are a bunch of actors. It doesn't move or touch you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of cinema","review":"This movie is representative of Hollywood decline. It is full of racial cliches : the chinese is a bad man. The violence is gratuitous and there is neither plot nor acting. Mel Gibson with this stupid movie only wants to earn a lot of money and he does it very well. I don't understand why people want to see gratuitous violence in that sort of \\"movie\\", don't they think there is enough violence in the US ? what is the moral of the movie ? It could be resumed like that : I don't like that man so I shoot him, in another way, violence is considered as the essential way to communicate for a man. The formula of the movie is simple : you mix violence, explosions, car crashes and you make a blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is RACIST","review":"There is a part where Danny Glover shoots an unarmed oriental man. The oriental man is Jet Lee's brother. Jet Lee holds his brother in his arm, consoling his brother as his brother bleeds to death. After a short moment, he dies in Jet Lee's arms.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover walk over seeing Lee's brother die. Mel Gibson says to Danny \\"oh look, now you made him (Lee) mad\\".The 2 American cops just gunned downed/killed an unarmed oriental man, and their instant reaction is to make a very sarcastic remark.They don't say \\"we're sorry it had to turn out this way\\". No, they only look at his life as not being worth squat !!!But I guess that is the norm for movies about American cops. The same thing happened in movies like Bad Boys where they were killing Haitians, even shooting one Haitian directly in the face. Killing immigrant foreigners is acceptable in American cop movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet Li is the only good thing in this film....","review":"This supposedly \\"last\\" Lethal Weapon film has little to offer in terms of entertainment. If you've seen the first 3, then you've seen this one.The ONLY notable thing about this film is the incredible stunt work by Jet Li; if I am not mistaken, this was the first time Americans were exposed to this incredible action star and his debut was quite impressive (It made me a big fan).The other cast members are a real drag, especially Chris Rock doing his step-n-fetch-it routine as a rookie cop. Blech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Action pornography","review":"I waited years before finally renting this video because I knew that it was going to be bad. In fact, I got it for free because I rented a new release at the same time. I was fully prepared for the badness of the movie, friends had told me, \\"It's bad, but Jet Li is really cool.\\"Strangely enough, I was still surprised at how awful the movie was. The reason that I call this movie action pornography is because every scene is contrived to show action. There's almost no pretence at a real plot, it's just action scene after action scene with some veneer of story written in as an aside. That sounds like pornography to me with action subsctituted for sex.All of the jokes have been done before, even in the last few Lethal Weapons movies. They're funny but I heard that in the last movie.If you liked this movie, you might want to take a look at Armageddon, it's about in the same quality category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Rock and Joe Pesci are hilarious.","review":"This movie is the bomb. It is better than all the other lethal weapons combined. You have to watch Chris Rock and Joe Pesci."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lethal Weapon 4","review":"I got this for my Man Boss for his birthday. He likes all of the Leathal Weapons & so do I. I have watched them serveral times myself over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Action!! A Excellent Movie!!!!","review":"I have this on dvd and its by far the best of the series, I haven't really seen 1, 2 or 3 but I would say I favor the 4th sequel the most. Mel and Danny tells us too in the movie that \\"were not to old for this s***\\" I believe thats true, your never too old to play in action flicks. Of course Pesci returns as Getz, the funniest man of the series, this was his last movie but from what I have read it ain't exactly his last, he's playing in another movie coming up with De Niro again in 2006. But anyways.... I have too add that everytime I see this movie I'm looking forward to the part where Mel and Danny fights Jet Li on that harbor, that was an awesome fight, very raw!! But hey don't expect to see peacefulness in a action flick like this! This movie rocks and the action in it is brilliant! 9/10 ST*RS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and great fun.","review":"If you liked the previous Lethal Weapon movies, this will not dissapoint. The trademark bantor between Riggs and Murtaugh is as sharp as ever as the humor is at full tilt. The plot is so-so, but does anyone really care? The fight scenes are excellent as always and I liked Riggs' coming to terms with his own immortality, realizing that he was not as young as he used to be, and may have lot a step or to. My big complaint with the third installment was what I considered a weak bad guy, but this one more than makes up for it, with a smiling chinese martial arts expert that rivals the best of the Lethal Weapon bad guys. Entertaining, exhilirating, even engrossing, this movie was one of the few you don't complain about paying six to seven bucks to see at a theatre. Frankly, if Lethal Weapon 5 came out I would be the first in Line. Enjoy!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Par for Lethal Weapon, but with 40 times the punch!","review":"Richard Donner and his crew have perfected the art of combining raw action, strong plots, and comedy suspense relief into an \\"explosive\\" movie. For about an hour and a half you get to envelope yourself in the good and humble (and too old for this ****!!) vs. evil action and talently witty dialogue. The explosions are even bigger (if you can imagine it), and the evil is menacing. My hat is off to Mr. Jet Li. I would never have suspected that he never played a true bad guy before. This information was learned in part of the wonderful DVD extras you get. The talent of everyone involved with this film has truly created a new higher standard of action films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet saves last LW installment","review":"What do I have to say? Jet gave Hollywood a sample of what real martial arts talent is. Although, the ending fight scene could be improved. I enjoyed this movie -- chemistry between Mel and Danny, Pesci vs Rock. I am a die hard Jet Li fan, and only wish to see more...but again, with so much talent casted, it's difficult to allocate enough film time for everyone. The fight scenes are good, and the humor never stops. A good overall kickback movie to watch over and over..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definitely the best Lethal Weapon!","review":"I think Lethal Weapon 4 is the best Lethal Weapon movie ever made. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover still make a great team together especially with their sense of humor. Joe Pesci and Chris Rock are very funny together even though there was a lot of profanity from them two. But perhaps the best addition to the new Lethal movie was the martial arts sensation Jet Li. His moves throughout the entire movie had me interested in the movie alone. I would like to see him in other American made movies. He probably will be in other American movies sense he did so well in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"JET LI IS NASTY!","review":"This movie was very entertaining for 1 reason only.....JET LI!

Not worth the price of admission. Talented casts gets wasted in this sorry excuse for an action movie. For diehard Mel Gibson fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't say anything good about this one!","review":"jismblast@hotmail.com from Grand Rapids, MII'm a big fan of the first two Lethal Weapons. (In fact, I just bought both of them.) Lethal Weapon was an action film with some comedy. Lethal Weapon 4 was trying to be funny with a lot of over-the-top action sequences. I nearly shut it off twice while viewing it. I swear the producers must think the typical viewers are morons to release this movie. (Judging by the reviews on this page, they found their audience.)

Banal jokes, dialogue liberally laced with profanities, black cop-white cop interacting - done to death, and almost de rigeur for movies of this genre as if it produces a heightened sense of comedy and action. The depressing monotonous formulaic movie and don't overlook the greedy movie-makers who cater to the lowest common denominator in taste - whose only real priority is a new Gulfstream V"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lethal Weapon 4 DVD Review: Fully loaded!","review":"The cast of Lethal Weapon 4 is back and the DVD is truly awesome!The video and sound quality demonstrated in this DVD is superb and one thing that will make you love this DVD even more is how Warner Bros. loaded this DVD up with extras. Trailers for Mel Gibson movies (Warner Bros. related only), Interviews, Extended/deleted scenes from the previous Lethal Weapon series, trailers for all Lethal Weapon movies and so much more.Just watching these trailers now makes me want to purchase the others on DVD.What can I say...this DVD should be called a Collector or Special edition because it's fully loaded!If you enjoyed the Lethal Weapon series, this DVD is a must get.

This happend to 3 separate dies: 1/4-20, 3/8-16, and 10-32. These are NOT alloy steel, but cheap carbon steel, not heat treated but coated to look like they're annodized. Upon inspection, the die threads aren't even deburred. I'm afraid to try the taps because I'm sure they'll either snap off in my parts or bend.Overall impression: typical of Great Neck tools - minimally acceptable at best, dangerous to use as a primary tool. Better to only buy quality taps and dies as you need them or deal with a reputable company's products. The only parts of the tool set I use are the tool holders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Not good at all, item is not made of good quality, cannot perform the way is needed to be.

He loves trains so much that I am sure he will still enjoy them on the floor, I just didn't read anywhere that the this kind of train was smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid release","review":"Moore's Misty Blue is a classic. She owns that song. I really had not heard much from this singer since that release. I took a chance on this CD. It is a solid release of pure southern soul. No knockout punches, but a strong, consistant work. Her voice has matured into a deep, husky bluesy richness. A voice like Mavis Staples that honey drips with soul. I loved Kathy Mattea's version of Knee Deep, but Ms. Moore gives it a rawer, more gospel tinged rendition. I play this cd from beginning to finish because all the material is first rate soul and blues. Discover or rediscover this fine singer. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"[...]Although \\"Railroaded!\\" is an excellent concept for a novel, [...]It was a very slow read for me; primarily because the author spends too much time telling and not enough time showing. The story reads like a transcript of a trial instead of a creative exploration of the many issues raised in the novel. While I think I understand what the author was trying to accomplish - i.e. write a story featuring a well educated, professional black athlete and role model who is victimized by a corrupt judicial process and racially motivated sexual desires - he employs none of the tools of effective story telling in his efforts to achieve that goal.

Once I heard the soundtrack on CD though, my mind was completely changed. Its a very hip, very cool show that perfectly captures the sounds and feel of its time (the early '70's) with plenty of memorable songs; likewise, they each sound crystal clear thanks to their availability on the CD format. As for purchasing it from Amazon, here too, I was especially pleased--it was much less than I would have paid in a record store (if you can even find one in my area) convenient (I knew right away that they had it,) and it arrived fairly quickly.

The flimsy feel, the way the two legs overlap makes stripping the wires a little strange, and the overall feel left much to be desired.For $20 I guess you cannot expect too much but I was hoping for more due to the brand recognition and it being made in the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visual Feast, Audio Letdown","review":"While this is a wonderful production visually, the recording was simply terrible.

Since there is no sizing information on Amazon or at Athletica's site, I decided to send it back for a refund rather than take a chance and exchange it for a larger size (I sincerely doubt that a \\"large\\" would have fit either, given the cut of the product). This is the first time that I have ever had to send anything back, and am very disappointed. In addition to the size issues, Athletica did not report back to Amazon that it had received or fulfilled my order in a timely fashion, so Amazon sent me an \\"alert\\", encouraging me to contact the vendor directly.

I found the story woven through the music fun and beautiful. However, it is a little heavy on the synthesizers, making it more \\"New Age\\" than native. The vocals are beautiful and the melodies contagious. I'll hum them for hours after I turn the music off. If you are looking for flute music or more traditional music, try Mary Youngblood, Alice Gomez or John Winterhawk.

I cannot imagine one more frightening that for everyone around you to consider you crazy when you're scrambling to find your kidnapped child.

Debra Webb never lets a reader get complacent, never allows one to think, \\"Aha, I know what's gonna happen next.\\" Nick, the hero, is my favorite kind of guy, a go-getter who never gives up and never gives in, and his feelings run deep.

When you listen to this CD, however, you will be convinced of the fact that Shirley is truly just as good a Soul Diva as Aretha, Gladys, Patti and Chaka--what sets her apart from the above-mentioned legends, however, is that Shirley does NOT give in or succomb to whatever the contemporary trends are. Yes, this CD was recorded and issued in 1995 but its material and overall musical approach are pure early-'70s Memphis Soul and Shirley sings with truth, honesty, conviction and a raw soulfulness notusually found in today's music.

Apparently, not only characters but the sources of the most interesting information are transparently fabricated, as I learned when I tried to track down the Zelle source and learned it was only Mata Hari's real surname. So I suppose the book amounts to a parody of other authorship writing. Post-modern cool?

This is the silliest thing I have ever heard. The writer spent a lot of time making comparisons when there are none to be made.Marlowe wrote only seven plays in his young life, 'Dr. Faustus' the best known, and his poem \\"Hero and Leander\\" the only poem to outlive him. Perhaps with his interest in the occult and Satanism, a rumor has run amok that he returned in the adult human form of a famous playwright and literary figure, the prolific William Shakespeare. It's the darnest thing I ever saw. The majority of the fiction is about Shakespeare and very little about the man himself.Having been murdered at such a young age, there will always be speculation as to the cause. \\"Afterlife\\" -- I don't think so!

They simply love the name Jesus. And while I too love His wonderful name (Isaiah 9:6-7), I also have come to appreciate many of the divine names found throughout the Scriptures in the original languages. Our English translations miss the power of God's names but an in-depth study of the Hebrew and Greek show the power of the names of God.In this short book David Wilkerson takes the reader on a devotional journey into the heart of God by studying the names of God as He revealed them in the Bible. From Adonai to Elohim to Yahweh to Jehovah-Rapha, Wilkerson challanges his readers to do more than just grasp God's divine names but begin to pray them and put your faith into action. By the end of the book you will fall in your face in worship as you see the power of God's names for our every need."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST of its kind!!!","review":"There are SO many books on the names of God, but this is one of the best I've ever read. David Wilkerson writes with authority and yet so much heart, and he is no doubt divinely inspired. He goes beyond merely listing or explaining the names-- he gives actual personal revelation of what God is telling us through His names... in a way that is obvious could only come from walking intimately with the Lord. This book will deepen your understanding of God's character and put you in awe of our mighty God. And really, you can't go wrong with any of David Wilkerson's works!

Going back as far as the days of Double Dribble on the NES, I'd have a hard time finding a basketball game I'd consider to be less fun than Shootout 2001. However, there was a bright spot or two.

Two weeks after this omission was pointed out there has been no response from the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginners","review":"I disagree with the negative comments given to this book. Even if it IS simply a rewrite of Books Online (a complaint of other reviewers), it's done in a very easy to read style - and the order of topics covered worked well for me. I've been programming with VBA for years, but was totally new to stored procedures - and this book has me tackling stored procedures with confidence. I'm impressed. I'm guessing this is NOT a good book for the person who has been working with stored procedures for a long time and wants fine-tuning - some of the examples are a bit simplistic - BUT it IS a good book for the beginner. Maybe even more important, unlike most \\"beginner\\" books, the author includes solid conceptual foundations - explaining the why as well as the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know whether to laugh or cry...","review":"I've got over 300 technical books on my bookshelves and this is probably one of the worst. Apparently the publisher/author wanted to be 'first out of the gate' in order to cash in or something, because this is just a rehashing (sometimes verbatim!) of the Books Online that comes with the program. Anyone can copy-and-paste, but it takes a true master to take an oftentimes dry subject and make it understandable as well as enjoyable. If you're looking for just such a master, Grasshopper, than leave this page immediately and go look at Ken Henderson's \\"The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML.\\" Trust me -- you'll be glad you did.

For those of us who want the performance instead of spending $$ this lamp set is good. Clearly more visibility than a pair of stocks lamps when new.

You just plug these in, so installation was easy, but I guess that would depend on your vehicle. I was impressed with the improvement over regular yellow bulbs. They might not necessarily be much brighter, but the white light makes it seem that way. It also makes your car look a little cooler too. Now side by side with luxury cars or a car with HIDs, it will not compare. So if you are looking for that improvement, that should be something to consider.

It contains fascinating personal viewpoints of what it was like to be involved in the D-Day activities on Omaha Beach, as well as an overall perspective of the planning and execution. It focuses a spotlight on approximately one-quarter of the entire D-Day operation, so it gives the reader a perspective of the tremendous complexity of the whole operation. I'm currently reading the follow-on book by the same author on Utah Beach, and finding that it is just as good as this volume. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent D-Day account","review":"This is one of the best books on D-Day that I've read. The author used sources that date from much closer in time to June 6, 1944 than some other works. Many of the accounts are from unit histories/interviews written days or weeks after the invasion. The amount of time and effort taken to knit together reports from different units into a seamless chronology was impressive. The maps were quite good and supplemented the text well, but were difficult to read with a Kindle 3G. I ended up reading with a tablet, which is more of an observation than complaint. I thought one of the appendices that addressed Medal of Honor recipients (only 3 and all from the 1st Division) and theories of why there weren't more was interesting also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omaha Beach","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the best books on Omaha Beach that I have read. It is much more authentic than many of the heroic perspectives one often reads. I learned important details about the planning and execution of D-Day that were absent in other books. This gives a much more balanced appraisal of D-Day than often appears in other books. One gains a perspective on the mistakes and near failure of the whole Omaha Beach invasion. This book is written from the documented perspectives of soldiers who participated in D-Day. I believe one gains a greater appreciation and almost a sense of awe for the initiative, quiet competence, and dedication to duty of many but not all American soldiers under trying combat circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative","review":"In a readable manner the author brought to life the people involved in this great undertaking , the grunts as well as the commanders without having to give everyone's life story. I was more interested in the overall strategy than in the specific tactics, and why decisions were made, for instance the reasons for a certain type of bombing, pre-invasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omaha Beach: D-Day, June 6, 1944","review":"Students of WW II strategy must have this analysis of the seminal event of the European Campaigns. Joseph Balkoski cuts to facts and avoids both the glorification of Allied leaders and the second guessing that is so common among many \\"critics\\" of the invasion planners. Bedford Forrest summarized it best, \\"War means fighting, and fighting means killing.\\" Success in warfare depends, usually, on the soldiers who make the least errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"P Parkinson","review":"Thought not a single first person account, this book gives one of those rare comprehensive understandings of what it was like if the reader had been present in the early hours of the D-Day landings. The author's account is credible because of the armed forces reports he used throughout this book to support his narrative. I've read several WW II books that include the D-Day landings as part of a bigger picture of the war and of course I've seen the usual WW II news clips, movies and TV specials regarding D-Day, but never anything that focuses such detail on the very first hours of those landings. If you want to get an honest, well-documented impression of what took place on this harrowing day in history, this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much owed to so few","review":"I'm not exactly a history buff, but a friend pointed this book out to me. I found it very interesting from the planning of the operation to the execution. The mission was plagued by countless human failings, especially in the initial air raids. I watch the same root problem plague business decisions on a daily basis. Fear often keeps people from doing what they know needs to be done. Bad decisions should have destroyed the operation but the troops were relentless. They were the heros of the story as they refused to give up even against great odds. From the ground there was great reason to dispair, but they pushed on. Eventually they found a place they could fight their way off the beach and began silencing the big guns. I enjoyed reading the details of such a difficult campaign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omaha Beach","review":"The writing style chopped up the main subject.

The central conceit of the book involves an error of self-persuasion: namely, that the author's own vicissitudes over racial issues in the post-60s decades are historically reflected in some empirical fashion in the history of Jewish people in American society.

It fails to leave any sort of impact on the reader at all, and skims over important information. It is also an extremely boring text. So much so that I am considering burning this book when the course is complete. Except then I wouldn't be able to return it to my teacher and I would be fined.

The story makes no sense. It is about the century old war between good and evil, although I have difficulty telling which side is good. CG was way overdone. The few action sequences are ridiculously derivative. It makes Ultraviolet looks like a masterpiece.Like others, I got sucked into this for 2 reasons.1. Hey it is a foreign movie. It took studios a great deal of effort to import it, then it's gonna be good. WRONG! It is beyond my rational understanding why Americans choose to bring over these foreign trash.2. The movie gets great press reviews and endorsements from Tarantino. It must be good. WRONG! (As a matter of fact, stay away from any Tarantino endorsed movies. 9 out of 10 times, they are garbages.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"English Version Quite Interesting","review":"First viewed the trailer in a hotel in Moscow then in a few theaters in Cherepovets, Russia. Took a few months to get a version in Russian and loved it. Since I study russian, I'm able to appreciate much of the movie. With an English version, my friends can appreciate it also.Best film from Europe I've seen in a while. Great action and cinimatography. Better than most of the US movies I've purchased over the past few years. Hope next two are as good or better. Little confusing first time I watched it but I was able to catch a few things more each time I've viewed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stagering.","review":"Stagering, visualy lush, these are just some of the words to describe \\"NightWatch\\". featuring an all russian cast and crew, it was released into the united states with a small box-office but a huge new fan-club and hard-core cult followers. this film is one of the best i have seen in a while.In the early times of good and evil. a pack was made to split the world of man into to kingdoms, one of light, and one of dark. to the light went the day, and to the dark went the night. in this treaty, a new group was forged, the night watch, to observe the treaty and to enforce its laws. this is the story of one nightwatch member who must stop the dark forces from breaking the sacred trust and defeating the light to cover all in the shadow of darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"Watched this on a lonely Saturday night on cable's \\"On Demand\\" and damn glad I did. Like pulling a winning slot handle. Cha ching! The movie's plot is not hard to follow but perhaps you need a few more brain cells in order to do so; I didn't have problem one with it but I'm accustomed to watching foreign and indie films on a regular basis and don't generally get bogged down with the standardized and seemingly required plot plans that seem to be de rigueur for today's movie goers.It was pretty, it was fun, the special effects were thoroughly enjoyable and not overused. The subtitles were the best, though, what a cool concept and I like the earlier reviewer's reference to ADD. No kidding. Really great!I can't wait for the next two and am adding this baby to my personal collection. If you have an IQ over 117 and are not too impressed with your own art house opinions, then absolutely see this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"No English subtitles, bad english dub","review":"I saw this movie in the theaters in Russian with their neat English subtitles.Unfortunately, the dvd only has hearing impaired English subtitles, and the English dub is really, really bad. I had to stop it partway through the scene with the witch because the English dub was so different from the feeling I had when I first watched it. The first time, in Russian with English subtitles, it was really good. This time, with English dub, it was cheesy beyond belief.I want a DVD with the theater English subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I really thought this film was going to be something special. After it first came out and the fairly positive reviews it received I filed it into my memory as a film I wanted to see. Now that I've seen it I'm rather disappointed. I found the story to be pretty flimsy, with characters who I could find no relevance to and plotlines that went nowhere or went somewhere and then made no sense. Overall I'd avoid this film unless you want to see a few neat visual effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires in Russia","review":"When young Anton goes to an evil witch to win his girlfriend back, he ends up striking a bargain with her which includes the death of the girlfriend's unborn child. Not believing in the curse, Anton is shocked to discover the witch's powers are real. Stopped by a group of good vampires, Anton (who turns out to have mystic powers himself), joins forces with the good guys and becomes a lead player in the battle of light vs. dark.This was a surprisingly entertaining film. I rented it, and despite the sort of grim premise, I really loved it. The special effects were interesting, particularly the birds and spiders, and I enjoyed the world-building. (Both dark and light powers were portrayed in a sympathetic way). The ending was a real shocker.If you like vampire films, this one is for you. Be aware, the film is a Russian import."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly confusing","review":"Ok, I am Russian and I watched this in Russian, not dubbed, and I swear this was the most confusing film I've ever seen. I was actually intrigued by it after seeing so many good reviews. But no matter how hard I tried to pay attention and to figure out what the heck was going on, I was completly lost. Maybe on another viewing I could have 'got it'. However, I wasn't even interested in what I saw the first time around and I could never picture myself actually watching that again. My husband agreed too. I don't normally give up so easily on a film I didn't understand, but all I saw was a visually cool, but messed up film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, so ignore my rating of two stars!!!!","review":"I gave this rating not realizing the russian audio with english subtitles was on side B.

There are a bunch of different stories in the movie that have no connection like the damned lady, the vampiress, the young boy.....the movie is hard to follow.It's a half-decent movie that could have been better like others here said before. It manipulated me into wanting to see the second movie in the trilogy with a cliffhanger ending, but I think I'll wait till they come in DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch it if you've read the book","review":"Don't watch it if you've read the book. This is a total disappointment. It was only about 40% true to the original book. It has a totally different feel from the book itself. So if you were fascinated by the book, don't watch the movie, the personalities of the characters are different from the book (Gesar a fat middle-aged man wearing cheap suits, Zabulon a punk playing video games, Anton a hysterical coward, you get the idea), the story line is also different from the book, the whole exotic feel , mystic feeling is gone. Either the director was not good or the actors were not good enough, the acting of almost all the characters feels very forced and unrealistic. Cannot be compared to either the LOTR series or even the Harry Potter series, just can't, not the same level at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This is a beautiful and amazing story that combines the best from Constantine, H.P.

Lovesey sets up an English actor, who has just transited the States doing Vaudeville, as his hero. The actor, whom Sennett dubs \\"Keystone\\" falls in love with a Sennett actress, who is endangered by \\"real\\" villains on the set. This period-piece book wonderfully recreates the Hollywood of 1914, and the mystery takes many twists and turns before the hero ultimately prevails. Lovesey once again proves his versatility, and he seems to have had fun writing this book. If you like it, check out other Lovesey works, especially The False Inspector Dew."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books ever","review":"if this is your subject of interest and you don't already own this book....GO BUY IT ALREADY!!!

We also have a very light quilted bedspread, and we're more than toasty. We were so happy with this blanket, that we purchased one for my elderly parents. The best part is that it keeps us warm without being heavy on our feet.

This is definately not worth the trouble nor the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This electric blanket is junk","review":"I bought one of these electric blankets and it didn't seem to get very warm so I returned it for another. Had the same problem with the second one so I called customer service and they told me that I should try a different color. The color I bought may have been a \\"bad batch.\\" I tried a different color and after two days I got an error message (E4), which translates to \\"return the blanket and controller to the company.\\" At this point there is nothing the company can do to satisfy me. Just like baseball - three strikes and you're out. I'll just put a second comforter on the bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"It's really soft and fluffy, however, the heating part stopped working without much use.

Different manufactures and different models and most of them have been very similar in the way they were made and the way they operated. The Sleepwarmer Automatic Blanket (King size) is by far the best we have ever had! It is made of the softest microfiber material, which makes it very light, comfortable and easy to care for (it can be put right into the washer & dryer). The easy to read dual controls allow you to maintain the temperature of each side of the bed separately and the sensors in the blanket can detect where you are cold and send more heat to that area. We like that it has an automatic shut off feature for safety and inaddition to everything thing else, it comes with a 5 year warranty (which is one of the best in the industry). The cost of this blanket is higher than most but I'm a firm believer in \\"You Get What You Pay For\\". In other words, this blanket is worth every penny we paid for it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is really generous","review":"I bought TWO of their blankets.They lasted one day & Two weeks before the error message started flashing.I contacted the manufacturer but they DO NOT stand behind their products.WestPoint HomeP.O.

Others will equally benefit from it as it explains the struggle to assimilate into a modern culture yet retain old customs and traditions. Some of the aspects it captures is the struggle for independence; yet maintaing the dutiful daughter personna; the struggle to excel academically and professionally; yet never be threatening to a man. It's a wonderful book for the female struggling with these issues and those who love and care about this person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for your support!","review":"Great design! Up and down movement is very easy to use, puts load directly onto the jack and avoids tilting and rollseasily.

I love the dynasty, I love the controls, and I love the created schools and players, but I especially love the recruiting. You can practice plays, put yourself in tough situations. The other really good thing about the game is the momentum meter, It makes such a big difference in the game but none of the other football games have it.

And yet lacking. If you could take where they went with their Self-Titled CD, throw in some White Pony Quirks (Especially on Beware, simply the best track on the album), and mix in some of Chino's left over ideas from Team Sleep, you'd have an idea about this album.On a few songs, Chino's \\"offset\\" lyrics seem to get a little TOO offset, and the off-rhythm or whatever he does that is so gorgeous seems to be lacking a bit.In my personal opinion, not quite as amazing as White Pony, but definately a step ahead of their self-titled, I think we are only seeing the beginning of the evolution of their sound into something that is just short of bliss.If the guys ever top White Pony, people will be dropping to their knees and weeping at the sound for its sheer beauty. This album shows that they are headed there, but not quite at the peak.Just my opinion though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took me by surprise, in a good way","review":"I shoulda known - after having discovered Deftones just before White Pony hit, that the whole experience was going to be about stuff catching me off guard. Saturday Night Wrist, in addition to having snuck up on me, was a shock the first time I heard it - it didn't really make sense.A week later, Deftones came to Tucson and I got to see them. Saturday Night Wrist suddenly gelled.As much as I hate to use the 'play it loud' cliche' on ANYTHING, Deftones (and this album perhaps moreso) deserves to be listened to, if not loudly, in such a way that there are NO distractions. Riviere for instance is just a beautiful wall of sound. Live it bordered on a religious experience (in the same way a choir or organ just fills all the spaces with sound).anyway, some of the tracks might seem like knockoffs, but on the whole this album is precious.Whats more, now I know about Giant Drag because of 'Pink Cellophane, and that has turned out to be a Very Good Thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't the Deftones","review":"What a letdown. This band has been going down hill slowly since White Pony and they've finally hit bottom. If I wanted to hear Team Sleep, I would have bought that record. I don't like Team Sleep and now I don't like the Deftones anymore. There isn't one great song on this album. The only reason I gave this more then one star is for the Songs Beware & Combat. Besides that, it's terrible. I don't care that it isn't heavy. I just care that is plain not good. I usually don't write reviews on here but I'm so disappointed that a band that used to be one of my favorites is now garbage that I had to let it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Blew It Hard With This One","review":"This album has MUCH to be desired. There are only three good songs worth anything on this album. The rest is just scream-o/thrash junk. I really don't know what they were thinking here, or what they were trying to pull off. Tracks 1, 3, and 4 are all that make this album worth spending one red cent on.Abe's drumming is just as brilliant as ever, the only hi-lte to the album. These guys seriously must have written this album in one week. Only a hardcore devoted Deftones fan could fall in love with what has been laid down here. Frankly I'd rather dust off their old albums. B-Sides and Rareties was much better a release.I listened to this album 8 times over, each time was a disappoint(however 'hole in the earth' is beautiful single). If they could just grow up and stick to the emotive/passionate songs and throw away the macho trash they really could be a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's one thing to recreate yourself but...","review":"This album does not do it. I've been an avid Deftones fan since Adrenaline came out, never really had a problem with any other Deftones album except this one. Even though some people claim self-titled was a \\"step back,\\" I hardly do not think it was. This album goes on to explore more \\"electronic\\" areas where there are no guitar. Sure it's a \\"soothing\\" album but this is not Deftones. This album sounds more like Team Sleep than it does the Deftones minus the very, very, few heavy tracks.Sure, White Pony had an excellent mix of both but the soothing tracks and the electronic tracks on this album are just plain boring. Recreating yourself by putting more electronic sounds in the music just does not seem to fit right with the Deftones. I'd almost rather have another ATF or White Pony recreated than listen to this bland album. Oh well, rumours are flying around saying this is their last album, who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones does it again!!!","review":"Wow they keep getting better and better. While this is not my favourite album by Deftones (White Pony is of course) they still managed to live up to the hype. I'm excited for the next album that should hopefully be released within the next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, it growing on me. Definitely takes more then one listen.","review":"Sounds alot like Team Sleep. If your looking for the heavy deftones sound, well, this is not the place to find it. Some good stuff, but \\"Pink Cellphone\\", uh, not sure what they were thinking on that one. I'll say my 1 star is a little premature, will give it 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!","review":"I love the CD It came in it's original case all songs play great not scratched. This seller delivered A+ service. Thanks again ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones are still the best","review":"This CD was worth the wait. The group still has what it takes to put out a great album that I can play from begining to end. It reminds me somewhat of the Around the Fur album! I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"The Deftones had dropped off my radar after the 2003 self-titled disc, which, while competent, was cursed simply by the fact that it followed White Pony. So it was a real treat to pick up this disc after hearing the lukewarm single and find a really great album. You can think of it as almost a perfect union of White Pony's exploratory soundscapes and the crushing straight-ahead riffs of the rest of the band's catalogue. Standout tracks include Xerces, Beware, Cherry Waves, and Mein. I'll also go on record saying that I enjoy Pink Cellphone, although the juvenile ending almost kills it. Bottom line: a great disc. Side note: see this band live. I hadn't sustained such lasting ear damage since Pantera ages ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deftones","review":"I love this one. I haven't taken it out of the cd player since I got it. I've been a fan of theirs since around White Pony, and my favorite cd of theirs has to be Around the Fur. But this one is a close second. It proves that Deftones is the one band that I can always count on to release a cd I won't be let down by. They always evolve in a way that keeps them fresh, yet true to who they really are. My favorite songs so far are Rats!Rats!Rats! and Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT!","review":"The Deftones have come a long way to create this sleak, hard, mind blowing sound! It took me a couple listens by the time I had listened to the album the second time I was hooked! From bone crushing sounds from RATS!RATS!RATS! to the epic sounding CHERRY WAVES, just beautiful! This album easily hits a high mark on my top ten albums of the year!The only downfall for me was PINK CELLPHONE. To me it did not fiT with the feel of the other tracks and I did not really care for it. While listening, that is the only track I skip over!The deftones continue to grow with a new surreal sound that blends all of their amazing albums into one!!!GREAT WORK! Very memorable music! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Deftones absolute BEST!!!","review":"\\"Saturday Night Wrist\\" is nothing short of stunning!Filled to the brim with the dreamiest, most breathtaking, ethereal guitar-scapes and Chino vocals that you could pack into a single 'Tones album, these songs have been knocking me out every single time. The production for these tracks is ridiculous and, to top it all off, they're ALL catchy as hell!A band this powerful, writing with this much heart, is so incredibly rare and this album captures it all.I first heard \\"Hole in the Earth\\" on Myspace before the album's release (like everyone else) and was blown away, but figured it'd be the only one of its kind that would appear on \\"Wrist\\".NOW its the song that actually gets played the least considering I simply cannot get over \\"Cherry Waves\\" (what a title), \\"Kimdracula\\", \\"Xerces\\", \\"Riviere\\", \\"Mein\\", \\"Rats!Rats!Rats!\\", \\"Combat\\"...

I was just a little disappointed :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Get Lost in the Dream","review":"First, I am not a serious opera critic, so I cannot address the quality of the voice issue in the way that some other reviewers have. I am, however, a regular consumer of opera. I attend the opera a couple of times a year and at the best of them, I am transported to a different place, lose all sense of self, time and place. - A few weeks ago I was at the Met and heard Flemming sing Violetta, for example and was nearly moved to tears.This production is disappointing to me because it has the feel of having been shot by a camcorder from the back of the room. Having seen Terfel and Flemming's DVD of Don Giovanni, I know it can be done much, much better. The problem here is that the set is enormous and the people are small. The camera takes too many distance shots where you can't see the singers and so it feels tinny.If I want opera for the musical quality alone, I will buy a CD. For a DVD, I want film-like production values and camera work. This DVD is a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Millo is INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"For many years the pomp, pagentry and beauty of Met operas like Turandot, Nabucco and Aida have been among my favorites. The music is always superb, the sets simply amazing and the orchestra without rival. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have never found any fault with Levine or the Met orchestra or chorus in any production I have heard or seen.This performance of Aida is no exception. I loved everything about it but I was simply blown away by the incredible voice of Aprile Millo. I honestly don't think I have ever heard any role in any opera sung to more perfection than this and her acting was superb as well.This is a five star recording of a VERY enjoyable live performance. Millo's curtain calls should have gone on all night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, you'll love it!","review":"Trust me on this one, folks. This is as fine a production of Aida as you will find.Verdi wrote Aida to help celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal, so he wrote a Spectacle, and it is as a Spectacle that it should be judged, not by the number of blockbuster arias. You will not find a greater Spectacle in all opera than what is in Act 2.Every member of the cast, the chorus, the ballet dancers, are perfect, and James Levine does his usual fine conducting of the orchestra.So my advice is: Buy it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eurotrash production","review":"Eurotrash is generally applied as a term by US commentators to criticise adversely European Regietheater productions, We in Europe think of Eurotrash as signifying vulgarity, over blown, ostentatious show. As such this Aida is a prime example of Eurotrash. What is Aida about? What does it have to say to us NOW? Verdi's seriousness of intent is lost in a sea of literalness, ridiculousness and vulgarity. Opera for those who believe opera is a show, without meaning for the 21st Century. This great work deserves the seriousness of attention we apply to Shakespeare. This is a totally empty spectacle with posturing puppets (who can sing,albeit well!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the surtitles","review":"The music is fine, but why can't we be told before ordering whether there are surtitles (yes, in English please) before we order an opera?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Disconnect telephone and doorbell, sit back and be transported to ancient times in a symphony of splendid decors and music, sung by performers who know how to tear your heart out with perfect renderings of Verdi's well known, but always moving, melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This was a test to see whether I could finally appreciate opera. I still don't, but it's not this recording's fault!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aida From the Late 80s","review":"This is an excellent video. You've got Placido Domingo as Radames, Aprile Millo as Aida, Sherill Milnes as Amonasro, with James Levine conducting the Met Orchestra and Chorus. I enjoyed this one, and it comes with subtitles available in several languages; just push your Menu button. The Triumphal March scene is very impressive, as is the Temple scene at the end of Act 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the VHS tape instead","review":"I'm reviewing primarily for the DVD production quality (not performance). Great performance but picture/audio quality comparable to VHS. Doesn't utilise any of the enhancements offered on DVD. The picture quality has not been remastered nor the sound -it is Dolby Stereo! A real disappointment, what a wasted opportunity. DG could have really showcased opera on DVD. If you must, buy the video instead (you'll get 90% of the audio/video quality). I for one will not be wasting any more money on DG's DVDs. I hope they get their act together soon -I'm sure I'm not the only classical music fan who has spent thousands on home theater just to play movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true spectacle!","review":"This production is surely the most lavish AIDA ever recorded, should be the cornerstone of any DVD opera collection. From my high horse, I can only fault the soft video image in 4:3 (only 'cause the newer, particularly the European productions are in 16:9 HD & 5.1 audio) and an above average PCM stereo audio mix - that's just quibbling. DO NOT HESITATE _ BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward performances ; poor viideo quality of the dvd","review":"While the sets are detailed and impressive, the production lacks \\"atmosphere\\". everything seems as it should but there is a clinical quality about it which makes it all a bit dull. Add to that an overly melodramatic performance that border on being comical.Worst of all is the utter poor video quality of the DVD. look elsewhere if your in search of aida for your dvd/bluray library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible performance","review":"5 stars for this DVD? You can't be serious! The production and stage settings must have cost millions, but the artistic content? I was a great admirer of Domingo when he was at his best, like in the video of La Traviata. Here in Aida his voice is flat and lacking in warmth. I can accept a fat Aida with shoe polish in her face if she sings like a goddess, but such is not the case here. And if you have heard Cossotto sing Amneris, a performance such as we have in this Aida falls flat on it's face. There is a feeling of coldness in this production and you feel strangely dissatisfied after only a few minutes of viewing. I was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews here because I somehow trusted the taste of the reviewers. If I see 5 stars awarded to another opera DVD, I can no longer be sure that it is a DVD I can order with confidence. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pam Myers' sublime voice !","review":"Not only does this recording have brilliant and undiscovered melodies and lyrics, but it includes the amazing vocal talent of Pamela Myers who brings so much to her interpretations.

This was an amazing game that provided nothing but hours and hours of fun. There is just soooo much content in this game and at points it is very challenging. One problem with the game is that some of the other characters are not the most developed so their controls are a little funky and take time to get used to. It is probably one of the best games ever created for ps1 so I highly recommend you buy it. My social life did come to a little bit of a halt for about a week because of this game but it was worth it and stuff is on track now."},{"rating":"2","title":"so much fun","review":"This game is so great, I love it.The only annoying thing is when the characters \\"teach\\" you how to do stuff. It kinda interrupts the flow of the game, but that can be easily over looked.Its great for people who dont like seeing a lot of violence, blood, and sex in their everyday life. When Spyro dies, he just looks like he faints so there isnt much gore to be found which i really appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spyro the best","review":"This game is one of the best games I ever played.Especially all the codes I found for it are also cool.I had it for almost three years.I'm even playing it right now,and is still one of the best.I reccomend you buy the game.GOOD LUCK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spyro: Year of the Dragon","review":"This has got to be one of the best games so far of the Spyro series!

I highly recommend this game for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Brilliance","review":"I just got this game 3 months ago, and it is fantastic. It is very challenging to get all of the treasure and eggs. I found a bug in the game also, on two of my speedways, and the only way to get around it is to send your memory card into Insomniac. I love the skateboarding levels, and if you want a bit of a laugh, type this code in when you are in a skateboard level to make your skateboard a squid: Press pause then press: Up, Up, Left, Left, Right, Right, Down, Down, Square, Circle, Square. I have found all the skill points, and I have 15,000 treasure, and 147 dragon eggs (The bug made me miss 2 of the speedways racing eggs).

In Spyro 3, I don't know whether I'm just bored of Spyro, or if it's the game, but I didn't really care to play it. The mini games weren't as hard as in S2, neither were the speedways/flights, but the actual levels could be a little tough. The new characters were cute and fun to play as, especially the kangeroo. But one thing I don't understand is that the graphics weren't as good as S2! What's up with that? I guess I'm not really surprised, but just don't expect them to be all that great. So, should you buy the game? Yes, I think you should. But if you're trying to decide whether to buy S2 or S3, get Spyro 2. Oh, and not to mention Spyro 3 has a little bug, so you can't complete the game, which kind of ticked me off, but oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gamer","review":"All the spyro games are all fun and Exciting.

While being basic can be fun, it can make the game somewhat dull also. My opinion is that it helps the game, while some others may not thisnk so. This is overall a excellent game. 89 B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best video game ever created","review":"Im being verrry dramatic but this game is absolutely wonderful.i truly reccomend it. im being as sincere as sincere can i get.who ever created spyro is a genius. I looooove getting the green toad, spike, scorch and the sorceress. It's cool. My favorite characters are Hunter and Bianca. Their cool. Im addicted to spyro and so is my little sister.PS. I PLAY IT LIKE 10 HOURS A DAY IT SO COOL. I KNOW IM EXAGERRATING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recycling is a Good Thing","review":"Which is how Insomniac, developers of the Spyro trilogy, feel. The first Spyro was definitely great. The second was also a good game, but didn't chnage much from the original, other than the collection of orbs and a new setting. The third is a hybrid of both-a little collecting (eggs-which, like the first with stone dragons, can simply be found, or, like the second with orbs, can be earned through different tasks), some mini games (Spyo 2 featured a few, but these are better), and of course the \\"save the world\\" element, which is true of all three. I love Spyro, but with each sequel, it seems I'm playing much the same game. I do recommend this for any Spyro fan, but don't expect any big changes, which, don't get me wrong, isn't necessarily a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spyro year of the dragon","review":"This game does not work. I would like to exchange it for another one or get my money back. You can't get to other worlds because it goes blank.

You rescue 150 eggs and 15,000 gems. I have 96% so far. I beat the Sorceress. You play as other characters too: Sheila the kangaroo(you can jump sky-high!), Sgt. Byrd the flying penguin(with rocket launchers!), Bently the yeti (super-strength!), Agent 9 the monkey (with a laser-blaster!), Sparx the dragonfly (he can breath fire!) and even Hunter the cheetah (only in speedways)! A MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spyro 3 Rocks","review":"Spyro 3 has some ups and downs. Its easy to complete and get all the skill points except the yeti race.. But too easy is not fun right?Though its not as imaginitive as spyro 2 theres only like 10 diffrent kinds of fodder unlike in spyro 2 which had the cutest fodder that squealed oh so nice lol.Also the return of hunter really sucks as he is just a PAIN.and money bags returns to bilk ya once again. But you get to have fun with him in the end hehehehe (evil grin)The extra charecters are cool but can be a pain to control. But they add some diffrent stuff to the game. The mini levels are a-pleanty and alot of fun. Spyro can actually ride skateboard!The levels are easier to follow the the other 2 spyros so you don't get lost as easy. Also at the end of each world they provide you with a way to get to the end without having to repeat the whole level (such as a bridge ect)Any way buy this game if you like spyro its totaly cool and lotsa fun :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation","review":"There was a letter sent that said he had listed on his review that there would be a transponder, and he changed his story in his email to me.

You can see ... for all of the details on it. But in short, if you enter a 'Speedway' round and don't finish it and get your egg, you never will. The game has been fixed and a newer version is available, but if you have the broken version the only way to finish the game is to send your memory card to Sony. Since Sony won't replace the defective version of the game, I rate this one ONE star and recommend Spyro fans avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game ...!","review":"I was pretty disappointed in this game.The game play feels like Spyro1, which had a pretty poor menu design. The grpahics looks a bit improved but it would have been a lot better if it played like Spyro2. Guidebook is hard to navigate and other options are not very organized.The new playable characters are hard to use and the other stuff like skateboarding isn't very well designed. If you want to try Spyro, then get Spyro2: Ripto's Rage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for kids","review":"As an adult I find this game extremely boring. Basically you are a little dragon and hop around to recover dragon eggs stolen by some evil beings. Your primary weapons are your body and the fire coming out of your mouth. The graphics is very simple (ok, maybe because I have a PS2 I keep forgetting this game was designed for PSX), and the controls (like most Sony games) are more complicated than necessary. The gameplay is repetitive and very tedious. And the characters, when they talk to you, talk in text, not voice. Very lame.If you want to play this game, rent it, don't waste your money buying it. It's pretty easy to finish all the levels in a day or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Spyro","review":"My son and I have beaten both Spyro 1 & 2 and got 3 this Christmas. We love it. Spyro can do more things and the \\"areas\\" are great. We haven't tried Spyro 4 yet and after reading many reviews I am tempted to not try it at all. This game was worth waiting for the price to drop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good cd","review":"I have seen Stanley Jordan live at the Scullers, and his performance does not get better than this cd here. His appearance at Scullers failed to impress me, but this cd did it! Track 6, Willow Weep For Me is an excellent tune that he goes all out. Though a slow tune, his solos are unbelievable. Personally, I think that he is better than Joe Pass, though less consistent. Impressions, Autumn Leaves, and basically 1-6 are all good, but you lose interest after these songs, however, I would have bought the cd if it had just these 6 songs. A very good cd. I DO NOT recommend his other cd's, and his DVD Live in Montreal is so so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad history","review":"I bought a number of Carolly Erickson's Tudor biographies with a gift certificate; I hope that the others impress me more than \\"Mistress Anne\\" did. Miss Erickson uses about six main sources and quotes endlessly from them--the number of quotation marks on each page grows tiresome--which is a sure sign of lazy writing. The picture section in the middle, for some reason, includes pictures of Catherine Parr and Mary Queen of Scots--important figures in Tudor history, to be sure, but, historically, they didn't even show up until after Anne Boleyn's death; and they appear nowhere in the book, as well! Talk about sloppy! I was completely unimpressed with this 'pop history' of Anne Boleyn, but plan on reading the other biographies I purchased. If I'm happier with the others, maybe I'll post a more positive review of one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I started reading this book at the same time I was reading another biography of Anne Boleyn(eric ives) and the difference is striking. I confess that I didn't finish Carolly Erickson's attempt. That's how utterly I disliked it. This is popular history at it's lowest, full of clich��s and stereotypes with Anne a sex pot on the loose in Henry VIII's England.Do not read this book if you want to get a clear, complete and true image of Anne Boleyn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Something Better","review":"I expected a bit more by an author who's done several such books in the Tudor period. Sadly, the book reads like it is simply a high school student's history notes (not even the 'final paper'). The style is jagged and choppy, with so many 'we really don't know much about this woman' comments that I almost gave up on finishing it. I understand not wanting to embellish history and keeping a book historically accurate, but there are ways of doing it without driving one's reader batty. If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this history?","review":"I read this book for school, but I chose it because I am interested in the Tudor period. I was hoping to gain a little more insight on the character of Anne Boleyn. This book was very disappointing. It hardly even mentions Anne at all. It seems more like a novel than a history. I do not recommend reading this book if you are wanting to learn more about Anne Boleyn. It's one of the worst, if not THE worst, biography I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The subject was interesting, however","review":"I read \\"Mistress Anne\\" after finishing Hilary Mandel's \\"Bring Up the Bodies\\", because I wanted to learn more about the Anne Boleyn. It took me a while to get used to the biographical format, but I found the subject fascinating. I only gave the book 2 stars because of the inordinate amount of typographical errors (words run together, incomplete paragraphs, etc.). I started bookmarking the pages and found an error on almost every page. I found this distracting and it took away from the flow of the story. We also have another book by Caroly Erickson on our Kindles, \\"Bloody Mary\\", I hesitate to read it because my husband tells me that there numerous editing errors in this book, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dull","review":"I have to agree with the other reviews I've read. I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I bought it because I am interested in anything having to do with Anne Boleyn/Henry VIII, and Elizabeth I.While there was some good factual information in this book, that's all it really was- information. The book itself was very dry and had no real substance to it. I've never read a book by this author before, so I don't know if this her usual delivery or not. But, she took what could have been an outstanding book about a very intriguing period of history and basically wasted a lot of good paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mistress Anne","review":"Very well documented piece on Boleyn. Fairly neutral in presentation, as to Anne's character; etc. Entertaining, and it contains info on Henry, Mary and Elizabeth (as well as the entire host of Henrican supporting actors) that is unique to this book. In other words if you read all of Erickson's works on the Tudors, each book offers different info, as well as being historically written in an engaging way."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's on my list of worst \\"historians\\"","review":"I am a specialist in British Renaissance literature and history. This book made me so angry that I literally threw it at the wall--before I threw it in the trash. As others have noted, Erickson is biased and the book is full of stale anecdotes and cliches. Worse still is her nauseatingly florid writing style. I'll never read another book by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 3 Songs Are Awesome","review":"Most of the CD is filled w/ songs you'd never wanna hear.

Also the entire saga of Pent Prism books is just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading for fantasy fans!","review":"The world of Dark Sun gets better with The Crimson Legion. This is by far the best fantasy series I have ever read. From the characters to the action to the unique magic - Dark Sun will never stop surprising you. Rikus, a former gladiator, wages war and allies himself with a variety of creaures unlike the classic elves, dwarves, and humans of most fantasy books on the shelves. Although this is not the best book in the series it is a must read for any serious fantasy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have My Time Back Please!","review":"I was told by a friend with similar tastes in books that this is good series.I read the first book, and was underwhelmed. Denning has great difficulty developing his characters, and plots.While they are extremely imaginative, and may work well as a movie, they are terrible in book format. The number of plot holes you have to ignore, and assumptions you have to make is ridiculous.I was hoping that the second book would be better than the first. It is not. I will read the third one just because I want to see how it ends, but suspect I will also dislike it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than the first, there was no grab","review":"I didn't mind the first book of the series too much, I thought it was mildly entertaining and the characters were just like the \\"ultimate PC\\" in any Dark Sun setting, but that was about all it had.I made my way through the first 1/4 of the book and the writing style remained the same as The Verdant Passage. Still too wordy and self-indulgent and the characters were still pretty stiff and hollow and the flow of the plot was still jerky and fueled by battles.Nothing captured my attention in this book, so I gave up. I moved on to the Dragon Prince series by Melanie Rawn, a story- and character-driven series.If you like long written battle scenes and don't mind stereotypical super-characters, I would recommend this series. Or if you just want to read a tounge-in-cheek unwitting parody of RPG players."},{"rating":"1","title":"this phone is NOT headset compatible !!","review":"This may be a perfectly good phone, and I've had great success with other Uniden products.

Eventually the 'B' side stopped working completely. Without much hassle, I contacted the seller and they were very willing to send another switch. Well, after about a few weeks I finally had my new switch. Once I started to use the new switch I had the same exact problem. The customer service was good, however the product was awful.

While it contains some interesting facts, such as a timeline of events that took place before the game and facts about each character's personality, it relies heavily on the Japanese version.However, the main drawback to this guide is not the quirky translation but the dated style. It is black and white and mostly text, like some other guides from the 80s and early 90s. The maps are hand-drawn outlines that are too general to be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly terrible.","review":"Terrible. A complete waste of paper. Mostly lists. Claims to know the characters favorite foods, height, weight, ages, etc. even though the game never mentions that info. Says Edgar and Sabin are twins even though the game makes clear they were born a year apart. Incomplete weapon and armor lists. A walkthrough that acts more as a list of places. Recomends taking Gau instead of Cyan to Kefka's tower after it says high end weapons are better than magic. Can tell they picked Ragnorok sword over the shard. Get Peter Olafson's guide insted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written Quickly","review":"The writer's name is given as \\"Hayaku Kaku\\", which is most certainly a pen-name as it uses the Japanese words \\"hayaku\\" (quickly) and \\"kaku\\" (to write). That certainly explains a lot! The guide was quite obviously written using a Japanese version of the game, probably so it could be published in time with the English release of the game, but it means that their best-guess translation of some items, locations and characters could be confusing to some players.Fun as a bathroom read, but better information can be found elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"This is a great product that AMD has put out.

Please Fox , and or Tracey, get the red tape worked out and give us your best work to enjoy again and again ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello, mummy, this is Kay!","review":"This show is hysterical!

Unfortunately, I can find little to no information on this band. I downloaded several songs, and have pretty much pooped my pants with each download. Back then, my internet was only 56k... and downloading some tracks from this band at a measely 3-4kbps rate was well worth it (these MP3's were and still are being hosted by AudioGalaxy and are legal, for your information). This band is fantastic from what I've heard, and it's a true shame their music isn't virtually everywhere.I highly suggest this band to fans of space rock-- or really, to anyone who enjoys music that simply kicks an unhealthy amount of buttex. I'm not even really a fan of the 'Space Rock' genre, but this band is top-notch. Beautiful female vocals, excellent grooves... God, some songs really do bring a tear to my eye. Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pool Float, Spongex","review":"I was replacing a float that had lasted a few years. This one arrived...and it's not the thickness of the \\"original\\".

He is a very talented saxophone player. However, the music is just not interesting. The sax line on the title track grabbed my attention because it was an amazing line. Other than that, I was not impressed by this album at all. The drums (excuse me drum tracks) were very generic and it just sounded like any other \\"smooth jazz\\" album. I really thought his album would be different based on all the hype he has been getting. It just goes to show what a little marketing and publicity can do for a musician. I saw a live show of his too...I was highly displeased. He made every song long and drawn out and made me want to go backstage and unplug all the monitors. He will have a lot of fans because the average person is not a musician and will not be as critical as I am. As for me, I do not recommend buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"STEP TO THE MIKE","review":"I was so amazed at the smooth brilliance of this Young Sax Player, he just blew me away, every single recording is better then the next.

I am a while behind in buying this, but I had heard it a number of times before. i love the energy of the CD. Jazz inmy opinion was built upon different styles merging into a genre.

This is a great addition to anyones library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike is the best thing since microwave popcorn :O)","review":"This CD should bring the Hip Hop nation and new jazz sensations together for a sound that is so addicting you will play it all the time.

Mike Phillips ain't nothing but a black Kenny G. First off you have to unserstand that just because it is instrumental doesn't mean it's jazz. This music belongs in the SMOOTH JAZZ section. The only reason why I am being so hard is because I play the sax and what he is doing anyone can do. He needs more and better supporting cast on his next CD and he needs to use a band next time,studio stuff ain't cuttin' it for me and I know it ain't good enough for a lot of other musicians.

I'm in sixth grade and reading this book was like reading a guide book. It's an easy book to relate with.The showers in gym and the hormonal rides are all too real! Like Cindy, I do not think showering at school is a good policy for middle school. I can't understand why so many people and polls, such as misterpoll com 1335548515 html, support them. People who encourage or support these forced shower policies are helping to violate student's right of privacy. More parents need to protest the lack of modesty some schools require of us kids in PE! Mz. Kassem, through Cindy, explains middle school life better than anyone else. Cindy goes through real life issues and reading about them, seeing how she deals with them, helps me work through simalar struggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Interpretation of Two Beautiful Clarinet Sonatas","review":"Here are presented two Clarinet Sonatas, the first by J. Brahms, which was one of his last works, and the second by M. Reger. And they are both very beautiful! I might say I like Brahms a little better here (more melodious), but both are delightful. And this disc offers the individual an opportunity to experience the work of one of the last great Classicists, Max Reger! Some critics believe his work is unduly ignored, or unfortunately by-passed; but one can make up one's own mind. I think he deserves to be better known; virtually unknown outside of the classical music world... His clarinet sonata is professionally done, and very handsome. The disc finishes with a couple of short pieces by Reger. Recommended. [The clarinet, btw, makes a beautiful accompaniment with the piano.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Touching Book","review":"I don't think it is appropriate for young children.

I just want to give the heads up to everyone that it does contain cartoon drawings of naked people's private parts.

I think the book really does a good job of explaining good touch, bad touch, and \\"secret touch.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely shocking","review":"Okay, so this is NOT the way I would want to go about talking with a child about preventing sexual abuse. The author advises for everyone to gleefully repeat words like vulva, vagina, etc. What is most disturbing is the illustrations. One features a happy little girl and her gleeful grandpa soaping up each others privates in the shower. Another illustration shows a long line of stark naked, anatomically correct people at the grocery store. These shocking and gleefully happy naked people appear over and over through the book. All the adults that saw this book agreed that it was bizarre, disturbing and definitely not for children. I cannot recommend it to anyone and will be sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost pornographic!","review":"I was shocked to find so many illustrations of blatently naked people.

The characters are: Crash, Coco, Tiny, Dingodile, N. Cortex, Rataroo, Carl, and Dorio. My favorite character is Dingodile because he can throw boxes with his hands, wack enemies with his tail, and wack boxes with his tail. He also can jump very high to avoid enemies and jump over holes. My Sister's favorite is Coco because she is the only girl character in the game.

In short, Crash Bash is dismal. The graphics are less than the quality of the first Crash Bandicoot, the music is a watered down version of previous games excellent scores, and the games are completely unimaginative. Even smaller details like the control of the characters is very poor. One series of games is similar to the original ping-pong games that came out on Atari in the 1970's. You will clearly see through the thin vail of this version's attempts to duplicate aspects of previous games, and come to the conclusion that Sony has utterly 'failed' (just like the repeated 'you fail' instead of 'game over' that appears on Crash Bash). Sony should pay the price, and get Naughty Dog back ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash Bash is anti mod chip","review":"Unforetunately I wasn't able to experience the boring repition of levels that my friends have complained about. MY particular problem was with the game even running, Sony has made sure this won't run on a PSX with a mod chip, even if you have purchased the game. People use mod chips for more than just piracy, some like to get advanced Japanese versions of games before they hit US stores, others contest their rights to make software backups. In either case new or backup this game detects the mod chip after booting and puts up a nice unfun stop message.

While he does recognize that leaders exercise power, he goes on to highlite coercion which is only one and the least used of three tools of power and fails to identify the foundation of power.Finally his subtopics lacklogic and his case studies are exercises in management and not leadership.

Further, I have never seen any other mention of Su Kong Tai Jin or Ie Chang Ming, whom the authors claim to be past Shaolin grandmasters.

This book gives step by step details of some high level meditation practices and you all are passing it up because you are biased against SD. I use this book as a manual for the advanced meditation classes I teach. It is like we are casting our pearls to swines dealing with you people.

This one could really go lower than that. I'm not exactly sure where the author gets his history, but any respected author backs up his claims and I would like to see documented evidence from sources \\"outside\\" of shaolin-do on the following items: the existence of Su Kong Tai Jin, the association of the different styles listed with all the particular temples, the claims of knowing over 900 forms, the ability to master all of that in 10 years, and the list goes on. There's too much good stuff out there to spend time on this. I'm just sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way out there","review":"I'm not sure why the author keeps 'upping' his claims over the years, but they keep getting more and more extravagant. In this book he makes claims that cannot be backed up, they are silly and without foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time better spent on other works","review":"Without even getting into some of even the more questionable things claimed in this book, one simple thing should be enough to ward off people: a lot of the historical background on the temples is wrong and is apparently created just to back up the claims of the author. Giving an obviously wrong accounting of happenings is enough to completely dismiss this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time better spent elsewhere","review":"This book is incorrect on a number of things. None of the stories or claims can be backed up at all. An important note, these things cannot be backed up by anyone 'outside' the system. That is very important. Of course the students and teachers of this style will back it up (not to mention send in a flood of five star reviews), so find someone to objectively view it that is from outside the system.

This is not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaolin-Do : Secrets from the Temple","review":"I just started training at a Shaolin-Do hall. I have several years in both Chinese Kenpo and Wing Chun, although I'm not an expert in either. This is a very strong system and has a great deal of depth. I have met the Master once and he is a very competent martial artist. Part of what makes martial arts interesting are the stories and the history. I don't think any of his claims or stories are unbelievable when they are viewed in the light of all other martial arts \\"origons\\". The training that is done at these schools will make a person stronger, quicker, and will build you into a good artist as well as a fighter. This system would also be of interest for people who want to see a variety of styles. You definately won't get bored.As for the book.... It is a good read and has good information in it. I don't think it is really ment to be a stand alone training manual. It is very good supplemental material, especially in regards to the internal arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book can be judged by it's cover","review":"Very uninspiring and usless information. There is no practical information in this book and honestly, it was fairly nauseating to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is full of lies and falsehoods","review":"Anyone who *really* studies martial arts and their history will certainly know this book is full of lies and falsehoods. People who study this style may say they are the last true lineage of shaolin but that is a joke. I ask these people to really study the history of martial arts as well as the reality of martial arts and they will quickly understand how Sin The' is nothing but a marketing machine. I'm returning this book as soon as I get the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This book is bad, the 'facts' are bad, everything is bad. Read something else. I'm ashamed I paid money for this, I'm returning it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Wow, this book has gotten a lot of responses. I have seen this man and his students and they are of little consequence. Now Idon't mean that bad really, just that there's nothing special. They aren't horrible, and they aren't great. But the author and his art certainly isn't everything he makes it out to be. His stories and 'mythology' also are certainly false, I'm surprised his students actually take that part seriously. If you can get a hold of a copy without actually paying for it, it can actually make a funny read, or good stock for the reading collection in the bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is insulting to one's intelligence","review":"As a martial artist living in Lexington I can assure you that this book, like the history of Shaolin Do is utter malarkey. Anyone who has seriously studied the history of Shaolin, Chinese martial arts or China will realize that this book has nothing of value to offer one in search of the truth about Shaolin Do or genuine Shaolin martial arts. As an earlier reviewer said, I'm sure Shaolin Do is as good as any kickboxing or American karate McDojo but if your interest lies in genuine Chinese martial arts then I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"put your boots on","review":"I would suggest anyone reading this book to put on a pair of good high top boots. the BS gets pretty deep Sin The proclaims himself to be grandmaster of, as near as I can count, 40 or 50 styles of kung fu.

I repeat wear your boots when you read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaolin Do is not what it claims","review":"This book might be something for Shaolin Do students to enjoy, but if you are looking for REAL information on the history of martial arts, (including Shaolin Do itself) you will not find it here. This book is a fabrication, just like the system's history itself. Granted, if you want to learn how to fight, I'm sure Shaolin Do will be just as effective as any other kickboxing school, or American Karate McDojo, but it's not a traditional martial art. Look into this for yourself, find outside sources, you will turn up a lot more truth than you will readin this."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many ways can you say bad?","review":"Ok let's see, incorrect history, false unsupportable claims, delusions of grandeur, and on and on.

The last review suggests that those with negative reviews go to a shaolin do school to see if it is the real deal. What this person fails to realize is that the majority of the bad reviews were FROM those of us that HAVE been in Shaolin Do schools and found it NOT to be the real deal. That should tell the world something in and of itself. The book is an interesting read, I will you give you that, but it is not truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of no-importance","review":"Well, after just finishing reading a friend's copy of this book, I have this to say about it, it's pure hogwash (pardon my redneck terminology). If one were to compare this 'work' with other books and that of history, it would almost be funny as to the innaccuracies contained therein. After having seen the author perform before (and being summarily unimpressed whatsoever) and knowing people that trained in it, I was interested in seeing the responses to the book on here. It is clear what the defining line is: All of the good reviews come from students of the art and/or the grandmaster, and all the bad reviews come from people outside the system. Obviously, being in the system does not allow for objectivity and leads to an almost cult like behaviour. This book is as one reviewer put it, only appropriate as a student manual for someone in the system. It doesn't contain any truthful or real information about real shaolin. Skip this one and go read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge without knowing?","review":"Ok, a five star review from someone who asks, why judge without knowing? Well, I do know. I have experience with this system, under one of the author's students that has been ranked a master. It is a joke. Students leave all the time because they think its a hoax. If they say otherwise, they are denying the truth. The classes are no more demanding than other martial arts classes. Now this particular book is simply a manifesto promoting the author's ideas and claims. It really should be a student manual instead of a published book. It would work in that context, but when it is put out there alongside well written respected books and authors, it deserves every bit of scrutiny it gets. To put it simply, and there is no nice way to say it, this is a load of bunk. The author can no more back up these claims than I can prove the sky is green. While on the other hand, there is lots of real history out there that would say the author is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically inaccurate","review":"This book is probably a great read for shaolin do students. All others should stay away. It doesn't lend anything helpful or the last bit truthful for martial arts, it is a tool to promote shaolin do. It is filled with historical inaccuracies and downright lies. All of the positive reviews come from students in the system. That should say something right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a former student of Shaolin Do I must say that . . . .","review":"Shaolin Do is comic book karate. This book, however, is far less interesting or truthful than your average comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent with Chinese history","review":"This is a fanciful playland, geared to those naive in martial arts. The author takes himself way too seriously. The 'facts' presented in here are not consistent with known history. And the claims are outrageous. A reader's money is much better spent on other works. I had no prior knowledge or experience with the author or this style but I have to say I can't believe people are still falling for frauds like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fantasy world","review":"Sin The' may know some good stuff and may at one time have been proficient, but I, as well as many other people I know, have seen him perform personally and were left very unimpressed. His claims are far fetched and his current teachings consist of watching other people's videos and then copying it and producing it as his own. This book reflects all of that, it is a fantasy world that he is the ruler of and his students blindly follow him without question, never realizing there are real martial arts out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of an authentic Shaolin martial art","review":"If the reader from Mississipi had actually read the book he would have found the answer on page 10 as to why this system adopted the superficial Japanese name, belt ranking system and uniform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets Revealed","review":"As a student of Shao-Lin Do (under Sifu Jason Knapp of Parkersburg, WV) and having attended several seminars wherein Grandmaster The has spoken, I was shocked to see how much of our secretive art was revealed in these pages. Although it's true you could not learn the Way of Shao-Lin from this book, it certainly contains a good bit of the truths within our system. The book is a must have for any student of the Grandmaster and would definitely serve as an attractive teaser for anyone even remotely interested. I think it is a great enhancement to any student of the martial arts' personal library, right up there with Bruce Lee's The Tao of Jeet Kune Do, even moreso."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"I live in Kentucky and have met Mr. The and his estranged brother and many of their students. Folks....the man is a legend in his OWN mind. There are incident after incident of embellishments and malingering comments that have been made by The through the years. Mr. The is about one thing...and one thing only...his profit margin. His claims are laughable...his historical accounts hilarious. Unfortunately, he has quite a following of students in the Lexington area who seem to be suffering some form of mass delusion and brainwashing. Most of the Shaolin-Do students I have encountered are sorely lacking in true knowlege and skill...and it is a shame Sin The has been allowed to stay in business. So if you are planning on buying this book...treat it as a light comedy. It isn't worth much to you as anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another point of view","review":"I think the best thing this book has to offer is a different point of view! I do agree on certain things that the author is bringing forth and I do agree as well that there are many things going wrong in todays world, however there are other points I do think he is a bit too radical, or it seems he is giving way to his frustration!

For example, no distinction is made between war victims, and those deliberately murdered by a government--Genocide. While much of it is certainly true, one must realize the context in which it is written. The best way to put it might be like this- Mr. McCarthy writing this book, would be similar to: a revisionist historian, who denied the Holocaust, had testified before Congress (to deny the Holocaust) at the request of an unrepentant German government, then writing a book about German exiles and immigrants who were the victims of a great Jewish/Bolshevik conspiracy. If you know this first, then it may be a book worth reading.

It is no secret that he officially works as an adviser to the turkish government and therefor entirely reflects the turkish denialist position in his works on the Armenian Genocide.Due to the fact that the denialist position of the turkish government today is nearly entirely based on McCarthy's works, he has become the most important figure in Turkey's denial campaign. He can therefor be considered the 'David Irving' of Turkish revisionism.This book is definitely a perfect example of historical revisionism and Genocide denial. It can only be recommended to readers who are interested in Turkey's denial-campagin and want to take a closer look at the denier's argumentation.For everyone who wants to get acquainted with the facts of the Armenian Genocide, there are plenty of reliable books on this issue written by various prominent european and american historians."},{"rating":"1","title":"reversed!","review":"The only right thing about this book, is the date!between that dates,1821-1922 , Armenians were massacred by turks and kurds,There are many proofs.recently French government admitted that the Armenian genocide took place. this book says the opposite.It is like saying i can live without my brain and heart! if you think that is possible or believe that, then you can believe this book.There are even photos, taken by a german traveler, and these photos are availabe in many websites.In my opinion, the benefit of this book is that, like this, mr Justin McCarthy can sell more books(80-90 million Turks and kurds compared to 7 million armenians).Armenians were not the only Victims, hundreds of thousands greeks, bulgarians, lebanese,... were also massacred .This is just to mention few..."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCarthy fails to examine the dynamics of ethnic cleansing","review":"Justin McCarthy fails to analyze the true dynamics of ethnic cleansing accurately. First, he has not arrived at an accurate definition of who Muslims were in the Ottoman Empire. Many groups such as the Druzes of Lebanon or the Shi'a Arabs of Iraq, or the Alevis of Anatolia and Syria existed on the fringes of Muslim society. Second, McCarthy fails to note that a significant proportion of the Muslim casualties he lists for the wars of 1821 to 1922 were actually caused by the Ottoman army, not by \\"Christian\\" rebels or aggressors. Finally, McCarthy did not cite Ottoman Turkish sources for his statistics in any great abundance, relying mostly upon European diplomatic accounts.

It was baffling to me that after making such a great case for mistrusting the media's reporting, the author then goes on to use similar methods he criticized others for, to prove his own arguments.There is a solid 100 pages of excellent, inquisititive writing.

As the line, Its the Guns, stupid...well, by characterizing the issues of suicide or teen school shooters, as a problem with our gun policy, trivilizes the issues- there is something clearly wrong with an individual who would go shooting around some of his classmates-and to blame it on the guns, negates this fact.

However, he does seem to fall into his own trap sometimes, citing a number of things that Americans should fear instead of the bogeymen that he cites. In many of these instances, he provides no supporting data and gives somewhat nonsensical conclusions. The book also jumps around a lot from topic to topic and never seems to tie everything together at the end--as if you were reading a collection of articles with the same theme but on different topics.

(It is pretty strange that Glassner picks the same topics and the same title as Furedi two years have Furedi's book. Glassner apparently doesn't have enough imagination to come up with his own book idea.)

The first type of discussion fortunately involves much more of the book than the second one, but it significantly detracts from the overall quality of the effort.There are other similar books (indeed strangely enough some with the exact same title and same list of fears) that do at least as good of a job.

I can only imagine how this book would have turned out had it been written after 9/11 and out new \\"Terror scare\\".My one and only complaint: Its anti-gun stance. The author seeks to blame most crimes committed with guns on the fact that we're so \\"lenient\\" with our gun laws(Britain, with laws preventing the ownership of guns has a very healthy gun violence problem). Other than that, it's a terriffic book.I recommend this book for any healthy skeptic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scare tactics rampant","review":"The Culture of Fear is a well researched look at how the media misreports and misinterprets statistics, overemphasizes anecdotal \\"evidence\\", and creates unwarranted scares and policy changes in regards to a variety of topics anyone living through the 80's and 90's is familiar with. The media's job (from their shareholders' perspective) isn't to bring you the news out of a sense of duty, it's to keep their ratings up so their parent company can make advertising money. This unfortunately often leads to unjustified sensationalism.The book is seven years old now, but still as relevant as the date it was published. If you're subjected to family members who are always forwarding emails to you about the dangers of everything, get them this book to help them develop some critical thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sign of the Times","review":"Great insight from a great observer. Glasner captures the sad and unfortunate essence of American media, hype, and culture. This book is a must read for those of us concerned about how fear is used to manipulate the message -- for whatever purpose. It's a scary world, but not for the reasons we are made to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"For someone who debunks fear, Glassner seems very fearful.","review":"Having read the introduction, and noted his attention to detail, I was amazed that he suddenly changed his tone on the hot button issue of guns. After admitting that crime rates have gone down, yet crimes are overreported, he turned around and repeated every statement the fearmongers use about guns, as if they were fact. These statements are the only ones in the book not refuted or challanged. His obvious bias taints the quality of the book. I cannot trust his research, if such a well documented topic as firearms was so badly handled due to his personal bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important topic, flawed study","review":"Glassner addresses an important topic: US media makes a big deal out of, probabilistically speaking, unlikely dangers, while largely ignoring much more likely ones. An example of the former are plane crashes, while workplace injuries represent the latter. Unfortunately, Glassner decided to write a political tract rather than a balanced study. Readers who adhere to the leftist American liberal point of view are likely to shout \`\`Hear, hear,'' while reading this book, others will find it flawed, biased and, occasionally, succumbing to temptation to do a little fear-mongering itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- Uninspired and Hypocritical","review":"I had heard pretty good things about this book but was disappointed in it (and actually gave up on it with about 60 pages to go.) The chapters each cover different subjects but they all are making the same point: media plays up a new fear periodically by bending statistics and using sensationalized reporting. Even with new subjects as examples, the theme was repetitive with no new insights.Also, the author does have his own pet fear: he is afraid of guns. And he is willing to use the same type of incomplete (and/or discredited) statistics he accuses media of using in other subjects in an attempt to inspire his fear in readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated","review":"This reminds me of the sort of out-of-touch logic we were taught in college and graduate school. Truly, the mainstream media is biased (is there really anyone out there, in the internet age, who hasn't caught on to that, lol?) But in some ways the msm understates things that the author complains about. The violence shown, after all, is real. And Americans, in some ways, should be MORE, not less worried than they are. If you've lived in major cities ---and centers of media--- the manipulation of fact is even more noticeable. However, it's mostly selective manipulation--- up-playing and down-playing certain things. In some areas, there is more violence, more to be afraid of, and those things don't even make the media at all. So, it's NOT that the media is hype (though that too)--- but WHAT KIND of hype. As with most academics who've received no other real influences, this writer is not sophisticated to look beyond where he is, and start asking that question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggy Prozac??","review":"I got to thinking about people who pay to have their dogs on doggy Prozac...Or whatever it's called...They must have a FEAR that their dog is mentally ill I guess..Anyways...This is a really good book..I would put it in the \\"media watchdog\\" category...It's even better post 9/11....Tons of examples of fears..How they are created...By which so called \\"experts\\"...The real facts are then presented...Hey look..It's young black males that DIE the most...Not the ones you should FEAR about getting killed BY....You will never watch Dateline NBC the same again after reading this book....Isolated incidents made out to be sweeping epidemics.....I think the culture of fear is here to stay...read this book and learn how it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Analysis dammaged by Left Wing Biase","review":"Any book that defends political correctness and shows the far left anti right to bear arms bias is going to lack objectivity.

Your first tip off should be his status as a sociology (race and class-baiting indoctrination) professor at a left-coast university.

Fear is what motivates us far too often, and it's what convinces us that a country that never attacked or threatened us is dangerous enough to invade and occupy. Until we recognize the power that largely irrational fear has over us, we are vulnerable to the demagoguery of Washington D.C. and advertisers alike. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why news channels in the US are a joke","review":"Whatever the author discusses has been the subject of numerous books and movies. So its not earth-shattering in that respect.Crux of the book is that a few powerhouses controlling the media filter out just enough information to misguide the general public. The media might not be lying all the time but not telling the complete truth either. Can the media be resposible for mass hysteria and propaganda? Can the media control thoughts of general population? If you are unsure of the answer, you'd be startled to find out. It resonates what Noam Chomsky says in his Manufacturing Consent documentary.Although the book is not a bad read, but if you know all this, you can simply skip it. If you want proof then go ahead and get this book. If you like it, I suggest you rent out Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent DVD too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The replacement of an Agenda","review":"Very simple. This is a good book, but the author ruins it by replacing his own anti-gun agenda with the media. Is true we worry about the wrong things, but this man shouldn't have the right to tell us what to be afraid of any more than other entities.

Throwing Muses' harmonies, lyrics, ironies, humor, and sound?I'm not a music critic; I simply listen to music and have been for decades. I saw, and with every audience was mesmerized by, the Throwing Muses and Belly and Kristin Hersh and used to smile as my then three-year-old son, now 21, sang along in his car seat to Hunkpapa's \\"Devils' Roof\\" with the mistaken lyric \\"I have two dads\\" instead of \\"I have two heads.\\"Repeated playings of Annie Hardy's \\"Hearts and Unicorns\\" bring all that and more back to me.

The role of Carmen is sung with a fiery passion by the very powerful mezzo of Agnes Baltsa. Her interaction with Carreras is emotionally powerful as well as musically satisfying. Special mention must be given to the wonderful interpretation of the role of Don Jose by Carreras- the best interpretation available in audio today( note the brilliant recording with Karajan). He is vocally poweful in the finale of Act three as well as exquisite in the Flower Song with a soaring B-flat sung pianissimo. He totally identifies with the character( as in all his roles really). James Levine and the Orchestra provide impressive accompaniment, providing a pillow for the principles(Levine's interpretation is less rigid than Maazel but not as creative as Karajan). Regardless of this , the performance is indicative of what a night at the opera should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The star 'Jose'","review":"This MET production in 1987 is in many ways illustrious: two top opera stars in the lead roles, big staging and festive choruses plus good dancers.Agnes Baltsa shined vocally here, but really, Carmen is a bit of a stretch for her in 1987 visually.I have heard Samuel Ramey elsewhere, and must say that his Escamillo is somewhat mediocre in this production. His two big arias lacked charisma, especially when you have Jose Carreras as Don Jose. It would be difficult to convince the audience that this toreador is the man that Carmen would prefer over Don Jose!Jose Carreras is in his absolute prime here - big arias sweetly sung, physically convincing, ardent in acting (he is not consistently passionate elsewhere). Most of all, he has the right characterisation for this weak-minded Don Jose. Rather than ranking him behind Domingo in this role, I would rather opt Carreras as the best Don Jose of his era."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Carmen\\" the Opera","review":"For ages I have been familiar with this opera, and once upon a time designed costumes for it, too. This version was somewhat different, but very good. The settings didn't always appear as though it was the cigarette factory or the caf�� of Lilas Pastias, but the acting was good and the singing excellent. Not a recent production, it still shows how good Jose Carreras is. Unfortunately Samuel Ramey didn't seem as convincing as Escamillo as he could have. Though a smaller role, it is nevertheless very important to the story.The music of deutsche grammophon has always been well known and looked for and overall it is hard to fault the Metropolitan and these performers. James Levine leads the ever fabulous orchestra as well. I give it at least 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"These lights are amazing, the best set of lights I ever installed.

Gameplay is straightforward to anyone who has played pinball games before, and what few questions I've had were easily answered by the manual. There are plenty of things to play for, and the board progresses at a pace so that it is very hard to get bored. Physics are very realistic. Only two complaints, one minor, the first more of a deal: The first is that the vibration function for the controller seems to have no rhyme or reason--it just seems to vibrate whenever it feels like it. The second complaint is that it can't handle multiballs very well: with two or three or more balls in play, the display gets jerky and uneven (oddly, this is true even when some of the balls are locked away and aren't moving!)

The voices are prestine, even if the audio is not. Tight harmonies, amazing arrangements, its professionalism that should have landed them in a better studio with better recording gear.

It turned out that the best part of this volume was the introduction by the editor explaining why most of Mark Twain's travel books aren't very good. Indeed while I have read \\"Roughing It\\" a couple of times and enjoyed \\"Life on the Mississippi,\\" I found Twain's other travel books, such as \\"Innocents Abroad,\\" unreadable. I had hopes that this volume contained gems that had been mined from Twain's otherwise intractable travel volumes. Alas, this is not the case. This book only demonstrates further that most of Twain's travel writing isn't very good. Save your money for other Twain books, such as \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" or his \\"Autobiography,\\" that have stood the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book, beautiful poems!","review":"Hi Kurt,My name is Kim Lee Rodesney /Hradency/.

The other pockets are great for filters, film, batteries, and the manual. The only caution that I have is that the 200mm lens doesn't fit as nicely in the dividers as I would like.

The big disappointment is the dispenser for the cleaning fluids. First, it does not integrate with the wand so each time you want to dispense you must disconnect the dispenser and attach the wand, then remove the wand and reattach the dispenser. Second, the dispenser pressure is limited to 110psi which means to get cleaner fluid very high on a wall you must use a ladder. Also, it means you can't clean while you apply cleaner-you must disconnect the dispense and attach the wand to get any pressure. Otherwise, it is worth $80 for small jobs around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk-Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this powerwasher thru Amazon as it was a good price for a 1500PSI electric powerwasher.

I called Powerwasher, Inc's 800# and it was an automated system that did not solve my problem but directed me to their website for live chat.

Beside picture quality I still will not buy it due to time delay when switching from one mode to other. Much better spent money somewhere.

The CD subtitle: \\"Music for Contemplation and Reflection\\" is true in the sense that you will be contemplating and reflecting why you bought this CD. I find it really hard to say anything nice about the cd because the packaging/product seems an an attempt to trick you. However, it can be said that the music is soothing and the recording clear. The tracks are delivered with an oriental feel but you can tell its a small studio production with electronic instrumental backup.

They are absolute junk. You will be lucky to get a few months out of one of these things before the housing splits and the thing sprays water all over the place. PUR will replace defective products. And the replacements will be defective also. Whoever runs this company should be in jail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this water filter as a replacement to the one I had that developed a crack. The crack is just near the use indicator. This one has developed the same crack. It is just over 2 months old. I wasn't even able to use one full cartridge. Beware! I've read of other people having the same issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until it breaks","review":"The filter worked fine at first. However, after about 2 months, the casing started to crack. The device still filters water, but water squirts out of the cracks all over the place. I tried to fix it with glue and tape (which might actually be a very bad idea since some of the residue could wind up in my water), but it still leaks. My 2 brothers have the same filter and the same thing happened to them. If you go to the [...] website you will see that many more people have had the same problem. I recommend that you look for a filter with a more sturdy casing."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst filter ever- do not buy","review":"I have used this filter for 2 months now and had to replace about 3 filters in such a short span. The filter works good but you have to spend more than any other filters. The manufacturers are clever to lure the customers by the easy mechanism initially but the speed slows down and so does your patience to wait atleast an hour for your water to get purified. If you want to buy a filter that works good to 2 weeks this will be your choice but if want something to last longer \\" do not buy it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome ... For the First 6 Months","review":"I got this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas last year. I live alone in my apartment so this simple Pur filter was perfect ... or so I thought.At the beginning of June, not even 6 months after I got it, the side of the plastic had cracked and a small stream of water was spraying from it. I stopped using the filter, but now even the point where the filter attaches to the faucet's nozzle it has began leaking.I hate leaving bad reviews, but 6 months of having this product and it's leaking in two places is ridiculous ... especially considering that I live alone and it gets minimal traffic.Next time I will invest the money in a high quality filter of a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracks Quickly","review":"Length:: 0:07 MinsAfter just a couple of months, the filter developed a crack so bad that couldn't even be solved by duct tape.

It must be faulty or water could not magically get to the filter and drip.Those claiming it cracked. Maybe you hit it with a pan or something?!? Fess up. I know it takes a bit to get used to the filter being there. You now have 1 inch less clearance taking large pots, etc in and out of sink, but, without an under-sink installation, whaddaya gonna do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed After 7 Months","review":"I have to concur with other reviewers; I have been a user of PUR filter systems (faucet mount) for many, many years - the product has degraded in more recent years. I am tired of being sprayed with water when the unit falls off - it has now happened 4 times in the last 30 minutes and I am NOT a happy customer! Led me to write this review and look for another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!!!!","review":"I bought the PUR Filter after years of using Brita products (pitcher and dispenser). It got annoying to have to refill them over and over, so I thought the faucet mount was an easy transition. God what a waste of money. After about 4 months of normal use, the mount would no longer stay on my faucet. It was constantly being knocked off and consequently would start spraying water everywhere. Before that, the light indicator stopped working even though the filter still worked. The faucet mount is flimsy and cheap, and definitely not worth the $40 or so dollars Proctor and Gamble charges. My fiance called Proctor and Gamble to complain and they sent us another one. Unfortunately we had bought a box of refill filters at costco, but once those are all used and finished this will be our first and LAST Pur product we buy.Buy Brita instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price but poor quality","review":"I decided to purchase this because it was cheaper than buying filter alone.

I recommend STAYING AWAY from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Water, LONG Wait","review":"This filter worked great for about the first week of use. Our water tested better in a blind taste-test and seemed cleaner.Unfortunately, after one week, the filtration process got slower and slower and SLOWER. At first, a glass of water took 5 seconds, then 10, and then like 20-30 seconds. It got so bad we started putting a 1 gallon jug under the filter and waited 1-3 hours for a gallon of filtered water! Not only that, but the filter replacement indicator says the filter is just fine and doesn't need to be replaced (as it shouldn't, being only 1 month old).Also, the filter does take up a bit of space on your faucet, so you may want to consider an alternative if you have a small sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once great, PUR has completely gone beyond bad.","review":"I used PUR faucet-mount filters for at least ten years in the wilderness with surface spring (dirty) water without mishap. When the filter was dangerous, it stopped running. We got about 300 gallons per filter. The device worked for many, many years without replacement. But in the last year or so, PUR is a complete disappointment, even just on city water. We've spent a fortune on filters that run out far short of 100 gallons, apparatuses that fall apart or break. The latest joke is the one-click easy attaching filter. It leaked into the clean water, it blew off repeatedly, and finally completely blew apart, breaking a plate in the sink. These are complete rip-offs. Now I'm going to invest in a counter top Aquasana brand filter which makes really \\"pure\\" water for about 10 cents a gallon. I will never buy another PUR product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new one Is Junk!","review":"We have used the older model with the little window in the filterhousing for many yrs. It finely started leaking so we replaced itwith the new and BETTER model! BS doc. Its a piece of junk, itleaks all over the place, you can't put a sprayer on it, and theflow thru the filter is a whole lot slower. we thought we hadfound some on here but when we got them they were the new junkwe called the seller and complained they had the old pictureand were shipping the new junk model and they gave us creditfor them but didn't want them back, I guess they know how badthey are? So were looking every where for the old model, butno luck, going to look for different brands now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me too...","review":"Ever wish you had read the reviews first? Like just about everyone here, I bought this \\"PUR 2-Stage Vertical White Faucet Mount\\" and had it work just fine for about a month before it developed cracks and started spraying water all over me.The problem is with the design. The filter is just too heavy, and it slowly puts pressure on the side connecting to the faucet. Eventually little hairline cracks will emerge, and the water will start to seek out those cracks, widening them and spraying you with a faceful of water every time you try and use it.These side-mounted vertical faucet filters seem like a great deal, but the design is fundamentally flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I have yet to replace a filter in one of these. The outer shell over the filter cracked on the last two units I bought; probably due to the water pressure as it is forced through the filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"hairline cracks","review":"I've bought a pur filter years ago, and never had a problem. I've bought three in the past year. One broke at the valve where it mounts on the faucet, and the other two developed hairline cracks on the body of the unit within a month or two. I guess the quality has gone down quite a bit. I highly recommend you buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic will Crack Quickly!","review":"I have owned two of these units in the last two years. The first one was the more expensive 'chrome' unit, which is identical to the white one but comes with one 3 stage filter instead of one 2 stage filter. Both filters fit in both units, so its really disingenuous that they advertise the chrome unit as somehow different or better.The first (chrome) unit I had lasted about ten months, at which point it developed a leak in the see through indicator and would spray you with water when you used it.We moved, so I left the old unit behind and bought a new unit (the white one) in July. Now, only four months later, it has developed three seperate cracks, this time in the white casing. I find it unbelievable that Pur did not use stronger plastic. Now we are left with a box of filters we bought expecting to use, and a broken water filter. I have mixed feelings whether to buy another Pur unit or just throw the filters away and start with a new brand. Horrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"This is possibly the worst product I've ever bought. Other reviewers have mentioned that their units cracked after replacing the original filter. I am SO ENVIOUS !!!I never got to replace the filter, as mine cracked before it was time to replace the filter. The first one cracked on the display housing. I tried to repair it, but it leaked and sprayed again. I thought perhaps I had accidentaly swung the faucet over and hit the filter unit against the window frame, cracking the unit.I bought another system and the second unit developedthe same problem, spraying water all over from the cracked window housingNow I can get a drink and take a shower at the same time.My advice: Stay away from this product, buy something else.This item gets one star because that's the minimum Amazon requires to publish a review, otherwise I'd give the PUR 2 stage water filter ZILCH !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many leaks after only 3 months","review":"The indicator window will leak!!!!! ...and leak everywhere. I have had two of these things and they both leaked badly. My current one is being held together with a pip clamp which extended its life about 2 months. How hard could it be to develop a system that doesn't leak under normal household water pressure? I do like what it does to the water but come on, make the thing last more than a couple of months. Arghhh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprung two leaks","review":"I had owned one before for years and it worked great. After it got misplaced after a move, I purchased this one. Worked fine for about a month and then it sprung a leak in two places.UPDATEWhen I contacted P&G; on their website, they sent me a coupon for a free PUR filter. Great customer service! However, the new filter I purchased had something wrong with the gasket that tightens against the faucet and I couldn't get it to stop leaking (this wasn't a problem with the first one). I meant to return it but forgot and now it's been a few months so it's too late. Oh well.I would lower my rating to a 1 star from 2 since both of them were bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Housing Cracks Quickly","review":"We are only on our second filter in the until and already the housing has several cracks. One next to the replacement indicator window (leaking), another where the unit mounts to the faucet. This unit is so easy compared to some Brits units (really, it is), but having to replace the unit once a year is ridiculous. We'll be getting another Brita."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product!!","review":"I am an avid water drinker. First I had Poland springs delivered in 5 gallon jugs...That was cumbersome! Then I started buying distilled water by the gallons...that was also cumbersome! Then, my dear sister told me about her Pur water Faucet purifier and that she loved the taste of her water! Where was I all these years! Eureka! This is one of the best products I have purchased in years! It is easy to use, the water is superb and I will never go another route in getting my aqua again! You have a customer for life in me! Great product! Keep up the purifying! You rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never buy PUR again!","review":"If we had something below 1 star I would give that rating to PUR on-tap filter. I bought PUR 6 months back and now I am very disappointed with it.Why? 3 reasons...1. It leaks at the mount point in both situations whether you want tap water or filter water.2. It costs more than what its worth3. The mounting knob if over tighened cannot be easily opened as it is very inconvinient to push and hold it for a good grip to open it back.I would say this is a waste of money. Will never recommend it to anyone. I am looking at Brita now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the one click design!","review":"The new design is cheap and garbage. The plastic adapter that screws on to the faucet has to support the weight of the unit, it doesn't. Within the first week the threads on the adapter have failed because they are cheap plastic and the filter no longer will stay on. Last time it fell off it squirted water all over the kitchen counters up the walls and window treatments. Done. They should have spent another 50 cents on metal adapters and had a relatively decent product. Pinch pennies, lose customers. I've had Pure on my faucets for at least the last 15 years. No more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vertical Model is the Worst","review":"I bought two of these vertical models (one for me and one for my parents) and they are the worst because they only last a couple of months. After that, the filtered water hardly comes out of the filter even after you put in a new cartridge. The first couple of months, a small stream of water comes out of the filter and then the stream becomes small drips and never quite function the same. At first I thought it was just my mount, but the other mount did the same exact thing, so it's the model and not the individual mount. However, I later bought the PUR horizontal models, and they work well for at least a couple of years before those crack. So, don't bother with the vertical models, get yourself the horizontal models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another member of the cracked housing club","review":"I bought this to replace the water pic one that my roomie left behind.

Thought maybe I got a bad one and bought another. Same thing again and now there are cracks appearing all over the housing.I've sent an email to P&G; but I'm not expecting much. All I can do is let other people know that water spraying from the indicator window is NOT unusual.Read the other reviews to hear more about this problem. I'm going to research other units and get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice","review":"I am in agreement with the other individuals that are experiencing the cracked housing. Less than two months use and it's cracked and leaking. Combine that with the price of the filters and this entire system is a waste of money. You can buy a countertop unit by another manufacturer and get a years use out of it for what this thing will cost you in a few months. For the price of the filters, the faucet unit should be free.I am really disappointed in PUR and I won't ever consider their product again. I am NOT going to buy another housing and continue this farce any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky, expensive, poorly made","review":"This filter was constantly in the way and took up way too much space in my smaller kitchen sink. The switch that you use to turn on the filter breaks off easily, leaving you with a useless device. Also, it seemed like the red light came on too soon, regardless of how frequently I turned the filter on. Too expensive for a crappy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"DO NOT BUYThe \\"quick\\" disconnect will quickly cement itself to the unit, and removing it from the faucet will instead strip the threads on the cheesy plastic adapter. Removing said adapter is impossible, making the unit useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage","review":"The filter continuously falls off of the faucet, and everyone that I speak to says the same thing about this product; i wish I had asked them all before I bought it.

I have a water tester and after installing the filter per instructions the ions in the water did not change . . . at all.

So, it's doing nothing for me but collecting dust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musty Smell to Water","review":"I've been using Pur filters for a long time - I used to love them. But now they always leak - even new units, and this newly designed snap-on one snaps off if you touch it wrong. But EVEN WORSE: I have to run the thing for 5 to 10 minutes to get rid of a musty smell that comes from the filter, not from the tap water. At this rate, I'll have to replace the filters every few weeks. I think it's time to move to an under-the counter model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I've used PUR faucet water filtration systems for more than 10 years. The first unit lasted several years and was great! I've raved over how great it is to be able to just have the unit right on your faucet. Over the years the units have deteriorated in quality to the point where the last three units didn't through 2 filters (I've tried different models). I've had this model for less than a month and it is squirting water all over my kitchen - it hasn't even made it through one filter. I won't buy a PUR product again.The filters are still great.I'm going to try the Culligan faucet mounted unit - I'm seeing great reviews for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Originally, I had posted a favorable review. However, after two months of use this faucet system cracked and became unusable, unless I wanted water sprayed all over my kitchen each time I used it, due to two cracks in the casing. At that point, the water was also cloudy after coming through the filter, so I am not sure what the filter was actually doing. After reading another review, I realized that the filter system that I was shipped was not actually the system pictured in this listing. This week I purchased the filtration system that is shown in this ad, and I am hopeful I'll have a better experience with it. Seems much sturdier and more well built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pur junk.","review":"This is the worse product of this type I've seen or used. In very short order it is leaking from the connection where it joins the spigot. Tightening it to stop the leak strips the plastic threads. When you get past this, it leaks out of the upper housing where the filter is inserted. Learning to live with that leak, you shortly find that the filter plugs up very quickly. I'm on city water that is very clean except for the chlorine taste. No sediment at all. The light comes on red in no time and the flow slows to a trickle. I made the mistake of buying three replacement cartridges, so I'll be with this miserable excuse for a filter for a while. For free this wouldn't be worth it. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid,."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learned a lesson...","review":"I purchased the white two stage system and like so many on here, the plastic housing cracked and started spraying water all over the place after about 3 months.I also bought two replacement filters, which now will go to waste as I won't be buying another PUR product. Lesson is don't buy extra filters until needed, in case the product is junk. Like this one is. What a waste of good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"but the company stood behind its product and replaced it with whatever one I wanted so I tried again and it happened again. It would leak through the indicator window. So, I again called and they again sent a coupon for whatever one I wanted.

The only good thing is that it still works as long as I barely turn on the water pressure. Our water pressure isn't even that high at full blast, but it was enough to crack it. If you buy this, do not turn up the pressure all the way when using it. Actually, just don't buy this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrage","review":"In line with many posted comments, the mounting assembly is an inferior product that it is being pushed on the public by a \\"reputable\\" brand. This is unconscionable. PUR should be ashamed of themselves.....and I think they know the hoax they are perpetrating, as their customer service is impossible to get service from. I am a lost customer and I am sure that I am not alone. Their strategy of selling the hardware at a low cost to hook you into continuing to buy a string of expensive filters needs to be re-thought before they go out of business. The hardware should have some modicum of quality. These do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you use an adapter....","review":"I purchased both the horizontal and the vertical, after the horizontal fell off..still have both of them. What a crock, I hope they take them back. Bought locally, fortunately. After the filter gets heavy with water it just falls off in the sink when you go to turn it on. When you use the adapter it's suppose to just click into place and it does click but it will..., grrrrr, fall off, my experience anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product Design","review":"I have the same problems others have had with the filter housing cracking and leaking. It cracked around the window for the indicator that let's you know when to change the filter before I even had a chance to change the first filter (1 month). The water from this leak rides down the side of the housing and into the filtered water stream. If you have ever seen the dirty side of a filter imagine water from that leaking into what you are about to drink; not very sanitary. Also the faucet attachment started to leak which would spray a tiny stream onto the counter.It's products like this that doesn't help the economy. Who wants to give their hard earned money away. With every bad product like this I grow more reluctant to spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction","review":"I have beeen disappointed with PUR.

But honestly, this is just too much. Everyone else has commented on the filter cracking, but we never got to that point - because the stupid thing slowed to the point where it was USELESS before we'd had it more than 3 weeks. Everything I read said we needed a new filter, even though the indicator light still blinked green. I refused to buy a new filter - because the only reason I bought this was to save money on buying bottled water. Instead, we left bottles under the dripping filter to fill overnight. I was glad when we moved and I could toss this.

The bag is durable, light weight, and the construction is top notch. There is plenty of protection for your gear - lots of foam and the bottom is hard under the foam to protect against penetration from underneath. Getting to your gear is easy with the single front clip, yet you can make also make it more secure with the zippers. All zippers are covered for protection from dirt. Even fully loaded the bag is easy to carry with either the handle or shoulder strap.

It is high quality and maybe some of our problem is the newness to this type of device."},{"rating":"1","title":"good while it lasted","review":"I purchased this particular low priced nailer because of good reviews it received on other web sites. The nailer worked really well for maybe 200 nails then started mis firing more frequently to the point where it wouldnt fire a nail anymore. I tinkered with it a bit, not a good idea. I'm going to call it a loss. The 3 times I used it paid for itself in HD rental fees.Just wish it wasnt such a disposable tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nailer for the price!","review":"I have not had this nailer for very long, but it is definitely a worthwhile investment. I am using it to build a storage shed. The documentation that comes with it is not very good. No where in the user manual does it tell you what nails to use. I found that it works fine with 16D, wire-weld nails and 8D plastic sheathed nails I picked up at Lowes. Having the ability to use 3 different degrees of nails makes for a lot of options. I did have a bit of a challenge finding 3.5 inch nails.The nailer works great hooked up to my little Porter Cable pancake compressor. If your not careful it does \\"double shoot\\" nails at times, but with a little practice that is not a factor. Overall a great nailer at a great price!"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-5abbdc3d"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/64.md","filePath":"guide/64.md"}'),L={name:"guide/64.md"},G=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
