This book is extremely verbose, and the information is consequently rather poorly organized. If you're looking for a crib, for instance, what you need is clear listing of the selection criteria, and how each manufacturer/model measures up. This takes a couple of pages in a tabular format. Instead, the information is spread over 70-80 pages of verbiage, and it's up to you to dig out what' you're looking for.Another thing I noticed is that the authors keep referring to the Consumers Reports recommendations, especially when it comes to safety issues. It turns out there is a consumer reports book for baby products. I thought it dishonest to copy someone else's work in this manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information, not precise or well researched","review":"Found this book to be overwhelming with too many choices and ideas. Not ideal for the parent/grandparent who is clueless on what to get. I didn't find the descriptions very helpful and MANY products are unavailable and no longer made. That is frustrating.

I wished I could go out shopping to look at all of the items I would soon need. I read the book from cover to cover. Did some more research online. I marked all the items that we should consider and my husband went out to do the bulk of our shopping. Baby Bargains allowed me to be part of the prep process without leaving my bedroom. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO NEW PARENTS. By the way, one day I did get the green light from my OB to do a little shopping as long as I had a wheelchair, we went straight to BRUS and I DID BRING MY BOOK ALONG. Buy the book. Do your research.

Contact information they give is wrong as well.The fact that they ask $17.95 for this book is abhorrent and it is a shame that they recognize an expectant parents hunger for information and exploit it.

That's for sure.","review":"I find this book to be nothing more than a glorified magazine, and those are half the price.

What the h_ll do they know about baby bottles that's better than the advice of a new mother or any parenting magazine you get free at the hospital or OB/GYN office. Most of the reviews are outdated.

They are on the money for what's expensive and looks good as an acessory to your baby. Most reviews in this book is for the clueless parent who does not give a s___t on what they really need.. they just want crap to add to their baby shower list so their friends and family can pay for it.. (Hence the expensive not needed and not functional strollers) Skip the book and check websites instead for FREE. Also, there is no credibility behind the reviews.. it's just the opinions of these people trying to make a buck off you."},{"rating":"1","title":"authors are not experts","review":"The ratings on all products in this book are based on opinions.

There is a time and a place for \\"tranced-out\\" tracks like these, I feel they should have been done under another project name.You cannot fault the creative output of an Artist, you can only hope that as they go along in the years, they get better (see Killing Joke). This would be a better album if I was not expecting Front Line Assembly....If you like the watered-down output of alot of other industrial artists these days (see Front 242...), maybe this will be right for you.

Goodbye FLA!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"F.L.A.- Civilization- a great new release!","review":"Having both Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber back together is a great thing in itself, and I find that their new release, Civilization, is a truly great cd. I think that fans of the Epitath and Implode cd's will be pleased. I know that many FLA fans yearn for the days of Tactical Neural Implant, but I also do believe that it is necessary for bands to evolve over time, and this cd is a good continuation of that process. The production is typically flawless, and the music sounds great. I find the music to be uplifting, powerful, inventive and deep at times. I highly recommend this album, you will not be dissappointed. I cannot see how anybody could be bored with music like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uhm, WOW!","review":"I'm a huge fan of Delerium but I'm not too familiar with FLA's work. The only other album I own by them is their last release, 'Epitaph', which I was very disappointed in. This, however, is absolutely mind-blowing! Leeb and Fulber must have had some real inspiration while making 'Civilization' because it contains some of the best industrial music I've had the pleasure of hearing. Unlike 'Epitaph' there's not a lot of futuristic sound blips and far less static distortions. The hypnotic rhythms seem to smooth out the unnecessary roughness they've been known to generate in the past. And while some might be chagrined by that fact, I couldn't be more thrilled. This time around they gave the beats a trancier feel with melodic overtones and even some ethereal vocals now and again, yet the overall feel remains somewhat gritty, setting this apart from their Delerium project. This is much more accessible but it's also more experimental... To sum this up in a word, I'd have to say: Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Marvelous!","review":"I just got finished listening to this CD for the first time today and I must say overall I'm very, very impressed. Bill Leeb & Rhys Fulber are back with a vengence creating a wonderful & mature industrial album. Its exactly the kind of album I was wishing they would make(mostly slow & moody). If your a fan of dark electronic music you should be on your way to purchasing this right now without hesitation.

This book is clearly the weakest of the Sloan Technology Series to date for a number of reasons.The author frequently delves into ridiculous levels of detail about trivial events, and then glazes over larger technical issues. There is no in depth explanation of the chemical and physical explanations which enabled Land to develop Polaroid into a successful company. There is no rhyme or reason to the flow of the text, and it appears largely to follow the thought stream of the notes that the author used to put the text together. There is almost no quality treatment of the business aspects of Polaroid, the author making passing references when it so suits him.This is a very thick book, which is quite laborious to read. Unfortunately, the thickness does not translate into quality, or even quantity, of useful information located within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Accurate","review":"Having been an employee of Polaroid for 15 years in the 60s and 70s I found this biography to be spellbinding and full of great details I never was aware of. Without being overly critical the author provides a balance of Land's brilliance and shortcomings set amidst the business world and its demands and pressures. Land was one of those leaders who was able to withstand many of the pressures of Wall St with his strong beliefs and self confidence. A good example for leaders today. He had his faults, most notably a poor selection of the management that suceeded him, leaving the company leaderless and clueless. But for all that, he was an incredible genius, business leader, inventor, project leader, scientist and inspiration to the thousands of Polaroid employees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative But Remain Unconvinced","review":"After reading the reviews of the book, I was really excited to read the material for myself. After reading the book, I must be frank and honest in admitting that Stafford was enjoyable as well as informative. I could admire his zeal and passion for what he believes to be true. Yet at the same time his arguments in refuting trintiarian theology were for the most part not entirely convincing. I've written a response in relation to some of his major points as well as presenting the evidence for what I believe to be the true biblical christology and am offering it to anyone who's interested free of charge, including Stafford. Hopefully my review with my e-mail will be posted for others to read. He also convinced me not to invest in Ron Rhodes book, with all its hasty generalizations and assumptions. I do look forward to any future works done by Stafford, since his work was informative and enjoyable. And this coming from a Trintarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting and lively examination of the NWT","review":"The book covers the major areas of criticisms aimed at JWs with regard to the trinitarian doctrine and the NWT. The level of research from other non-JW sources is astounding. The defence is thorough, clear, and concise. The most interesting point that Greg Stafford raises implicitly and needs clarification from the major JW critics is for them to state acceptable Bible translations and which one each critic recommends and reasons for this choice. An area for further research would be the historic background and motivation of the major bible transalations available today. It should cover the religious organisation, if any, that the members of a translation committee belong to and the doctrinal beliefs that it adheres to. This would then tackle in more depth if bias exists in other translations."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do animals dream?","review":"What do animals dream? Some possible answers are given in couplets. Humorous mixed media artwork accompanies and enhances some absurd dreamlike ideas.

Ok, I can resize it right? Only if I want it to be very blurry. Creative Photo Albums took the same clip art and resized it great. Another problem: The image I was importing was a chess piece. I wanted to place it on top of a border. My Scrapbook Edition would not place just the chess piece but would add a white box around it. Creative Scrapbooks would place just the chess piece.

The only thing I liked was the photo editing features which were pretty limited. (I guess you get what you pay for!)I agree 100 percent with Software User from Tampa. It is difficult to maneuver around in, prints badly and tech support was pretty unhelpful. In addition, after I installed it one of the features (paint/clone) would not work at all, even after I unininstalled and reinstalled.

I have searched for years to find a product like this because I was feedup using store brand cubes, flakes and powders. Thanks to Amazon.com, I found exactly what I was looking for. The low sodium vegetable, chicken and beef bases are execellent too. I use them to add extra flavor to sauces, gravies, rice, noodles, and the vegetable base to enhance the flavor of tomato-based products. I highly recommended Minor's Soup Base to all of my friends.

I just saw the movie last night, put it off for a while because I was afraid I'd be disappointed. Definitely NOT the case. I was most impressed by Joaquin's & Reese's renditions of these songs. Several artists have done Cash covers & most of them I like just as much as the originals - not AS the originals, but as covers. Just take Social Distortion for example - NOTHING like Cash, but a great version of an old favorite.

Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A for Effort, C for Sound","review":"Phoenix can carry a tune better than Johnny, but he sure can't carry the depth of Johnny's vocal emotion, resonance, and presence. Johnny Cash was an artist that used raw attitude and edge over musical talent and performance gloss. Phoenix's brave portrayal of a flawed yet likeable man was admirable and Oscar worthy. His singing is not. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, is not even close to the pure Appalachian soul of June Carter Cash. Goes to prove you can act your way through...to a point. That point ends where the real and honest artistry begins. Nice try, but no 5-star cigar. For music, there's no substitute for the real deal. Buy Johnny and June discs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original!!","review":"A Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits would have been better.Reese Witherspoon cannot sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk the Line soundtrack","review":"I am very dissatisfied with this cd.

They did an amazing job, and although I definitely plan on purchasing some actual Johnny Cash cd's, I will be purchasing this one too. The film and the music were incredible, this is the first movie that I will see again in the theatre- 5 stars for the film, 4 for the CD only because I haven't listened to the music apart from the film yet.

All I can say is that it isn't anything like the movie soundtrack on DVD. This could have been a really good CD, but the music is flat and lifeless. It's too bad that I can't play my DVD in the car disc player because it sounds great. Why the CD music is not good and doesn't include all the music from the movie is anybody's guess. It's too bad.

My favorites are \\"Get Rhythm\\" and \\"Walk the Line.\\"I strongly reccommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are not singers.","review":"It always makes me laugh how critical others can be. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are not singers, they are actors. But I thought they did a fantastic job singing the songs on this soundtrack. Obviously no one is going to sound exactly like Johnny Cash or June Carter...and that isn't the point of the soundtrack. Phoenix and Witherspoon give it their own sound and should be appreciated for that. I give them complete respect for actually learning and singing the songs and learning the instruments. Some people don't realize just how difficult that can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rules!","review":"I love listening to these versions as much as the orginals. Joaq and Reese sound magnificent!

They were not impersonators, they were the heart and soul of Johnny and June, and that comes across so clearly.They were so incredible.See this movie, own it, and watch it again and again-you will be so glad that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty darn good","review":"I really liked the cd. The fact that these two actors did all their own singing and did it well is very impressive. Don't get me wrong, no one can really compare to Johnny Cash, but Joaquin came pretty close. If you like the music in the movie, this is the cd to buy. It sounds a little different than the original recordings but I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. I didn't realise.","review":"Two things that I didn't realise was that firstly, Johnny Cash's music wasn't too bad and secondly, that Reese Witherspoon could sing. Wow. This is a very good cd with some fun and cool songs on it, and the vocals from the two actors are way above what you might think they'd be. The two of them do a very good job and do Johnny's songs justice with a lot of respect. Good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best song is missing from this soundtrack!","review":"The soundtrack does NOT have the best duet of the movie, 'Time's a Wastin' so make up your own mind if it's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't get these tunes out of my MIND!!!","review":"First, I'd like to say that I REALLY dislike country music. Never cared for it. Unfortunately after watching \\"Walk the Line\\" all I wanted to do was listen to these songs on my iPOD. The last tribute to a country music singer that I listened to was THE THE's \\"Hanky Panky\\" (Tribute to Hank Williams) Joaquin Phoenix does justice to Johnny Cash's music. So DAMN this soundtrack!!! It BURNS, BURNS, BURNS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding quality!","review":"Its amazing how much two actors can sound like two real people. Witherspoon and Phoenix (I'm not sure how to spell it...) do an awesome job of singing these songs. They put a lot of effort into making the movie itself, but the actual singing took way more effort. Both of them went to music school for multiple months to make sure their parts are to the dollar. Witherspoon actually looked through June Carter's closet to make sure she knew what to wear! But thats just the movie. Seriously, this CD is amazing. One of the few soundtracks I listen to. An easy 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want More Phoenix and Witherspoon!","review":"This soundtrack is fantastic, BUT... I only wanted the songs by Joaquin and Reese. Who cares about all the bit songs in between. I wish they would have dumped those songs and included the other songs in the movie by the two stars. Leaving \\"Times A Wastin'\\" out of the soundtrack was a MAJOR dissapointment. HOW COULD THEY DO THAT?! I wish they would've corrected this error by at least coming out with an extended soundtrack including all of the other songs the two actors performed in the movie. They did such a phenomenal job singing! How many actors today do their own singing?! I'm not sure why the producers of the soundtrack chose to leave out any of their songs, but they did, and it truly is a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack!","review":"Great soundtrack!

Joaquin and Reese Witherspoon had to learn to sing and play their own instruments in order to portray the characters and did a fabulous job of it. Reese's joyful, bubbling personality is a wonder to behold. The director's choice of T-Bone Burnett to produce the music was a real masterstroke.I just saw the movie last evening and haven't had time to get the CD yet, but I will at the first opportunity.A great job by all concerned.

I absolutely love it! I made mine with almond milk, egg white and 2 tbsp of natural applesauce rather than butter and it came out fantastic. This tastes like *real* gingerbread. Not overly sweet and with the perfect amount of spice. I was impressed by the texture also. Usually when I substitute applesauce in baked goods, the texture tends to get a little too sticky and heavy, but the gingerbread came out very fluffy and perfectly moist! I also added raisins which was a nice addition. I baked mine in an 8\\" x 8\\" baking dish and cut it into 8 decent sized servings which came to about 215 calories each (and is virtually fat free.) Perfect with a cup of coffee for a quick, healthy and filling breakfast. Will absolutely buy again!

I think it might be ok if you add powdered spices to it when you are mixing it.

I've only used it 3 or 4 times, but haven't had any of the problems mentioned by others so far. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the short time I've owned it. The heat control works fine. Because of the complaints about the nonstick finish, I've avoided metal utensils - no big deal. As suggested by the manufacturer, I oil the nonstick surface after every use. I've used it to pre-brown meats on the stovetop and have not had a problem with warping. The capability of browning in the pot on the stovetop is a major selling point for me - who wants to dirty two pans when you can dirty just one?

The heat is only at the base of the pot and therefore cooks the food differently than a crockpot where the heat surrounds the food. Also, the lid slips off the lip with just the slightest bump. I liked the thought of browning meats on the stovetop with the removable portion but on my glass top stove, the pot was shaking so violently that I had to keep a hand on it the whole time to keep it from falling off.

I have owned possibly 10 of the older models over the past 30 years, and I liked them all way better than this model. This model is more pleasing to the eye, but that's about it! I have recommended the Westbend Slow-cookers to just about everyone I know, and now I feel obligated to tell them all not to buy this newer model! I am very disappointed in mine!

The story plods along, motivated by smoke and mirrors. Nothing really happens except a lot of driving around and getting loaded. Philip's big secret shame couldn't be more ridiculous, or boring.

Most of the wives are stupid and alcoholic, self-pitying and whining. The evil guy is into S&M, finally doing himself in. The children touted as wonderful are prissy and self-righteous.

It's a waste of money because they won't let you return them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has a terrifying central idea!","review":"I always go to Mr. Koontz for a good read, and I went for this one. And surely, it was a good read. I enjoyed it tremendously and the main idea of the novel haunts me till this day. Another well-deserved success for your growing pile, Mr. Koontz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop","review":"Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through. Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.' This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread. I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger. I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction. And the afterword by the author seemed smug. I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Koontz Novel I've Put Down","review":"I like Koontz as an author, and I've read his other works. My favorites wereOdd ThomasandThe Face. If you've read other Koontz novels, the story in Mr. Murder will be a distilling of the 'standard' Koontz archetype. It could be said the book is a self-parody of Koontz, but it is clearly intended as a serious work.A typical cornier-than-the-Brady-Bunch American family are stalked by the typical Koontz psycho-killer who's a sexual predator. For Koontz, the pacing is slow (50-75 pages could be cut easily), and the prose limp. The main character being a horror novelist uncomfortably reminded me of Stephen King's \\"Misery.\\" Overall, it felt like I was reading about caricatures (gutsy horror novelist protagonist {biographical?}, bombshell wife, too-smart kids) and not characters.I found 'Mr. Murder' narrow and too similar in plot and events with other Koontz novels. Predictable. I recommend you read a different Koontz novel instead, as this was his worst effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious reading","review":"Even with the cheesy plot this might have been interesting as a short story, but no way could it keep my interest as a full length novel. Mr Koontz has written much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid Koontz","review":"Koontz is a writer who delivers consistent, well-crafted and well-plotted stories, and he's pretty reliable. You know what you're getting. Here you get his usual formula--\\"ordinary guy thrown into extraordinary circumstances, forced to be self-reliant in solving his problems.\\" Koontz has astute insight into human nature, even if his fantasies are rather high-minded and the protagonists are just a bit to perfect and the rest of the world just a little too suspect and grasping. This story unfolds in a well-paced manner as the writer protagonist deals with the horror. The showdown segments are a bit by-the-numbers, but Koontz's command of craft keeps you turning pages even though you know where you're going. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifico Mr. Koontz","review":"Good start...but not so good Closing. Maybe too easy and guessable End.

That's why this is a great book. It's one of the best books of the century."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Novel","review":"I thought the Dean Koontz novel \\"Mr. Murder\\" was an excellent book. It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The story line was great because in the world today you never know when somebody could take over your life like this. The book had the main character Martin Stillwater having his life and everything he had worked for ruined because his \\"evil twin\\" claimed he was Martin. The story has Martin's family running for their lives until the dramatic end. The book deserved about a 9 from me. The only problem that I had towards the end of the book is it started to get a little bit too long for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality and Fiction - keeps you thinking it could be true!!","review":"Koontz always gets things going, and never lets go.

The plot has an \\"evil twin\\" element to it, and it also has some quite futuristic but \\"could happen\\" elements. You've also got the world conspiracy element weaved into it.The thing I was not all that thrilled about is his writing style. I'm sure this is an element, which you either like or dislik, me being in the latter category.However, the story itself really kept me intrigued and guessing to till the very end, and I would definitely recomment this book as a whole. Therefore I'll rate it 4 stars - mainly because of the thrilling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Maudlin","review":"Oh, I screamed all right...because Dean Koontz has descended to a new level of bad writing. He tries so hard to make us care about the main characters, but they're so sweet he could package them and get into the saccharin business. 'The Fabulous Stillwater Parenting Machine'...'\\"They are very kissable...So's your tush\\"! Give me a break, even the Brady Bunch wasn't this bad! The antagonist, by the way, is a genetically engineered guy (I am so tired of evil scientists being the cause of all known sorrow in the world) who isn't even given a chance to reform, just shot. Bang. Then, in a scene borrowed from Dark Rivers of the Heart, the main characters change their names and live happily ever after"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard cut-outs for characters, movie-of-the-week plot","review":"Another one-star effort by Dean Koontz. \\"Mr. Murder\\" is a somewhat interesting story that succombs to a plot written to be the movie-of-the week. The characters are dull and one-dimensional. It's impossible to care about such contrived characters that are just soooo sweet. This is the third (and it will be the last) Dean Koontz novel that I've read. After each book I'm left with the same empty feeling that I have after watching some mindless TV movie, and that is regretting that I've wasted my time. After a good novel I find myself running through scenes in my mind and thinking about the characters. After reading Dean Koontz I'm left with nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read!!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down. Right from the start, you are pulled into Koontz's world. I must have looked like a starving maniac while reading this book. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is an odd book","review":"This is my first time reading a novel by Dean Koontz. I didn't really understand what point the author was trying to make in the book. It simply seemed to strange to me. It is not really a Sci Fi novel, but yet \\"the killer\\" has super human strength and can fully heal from bullet wounds in a matter of several hours.I just did understand why \\"the killer\\" was pulled to Marty Stillwater. The psychological part just did attract me.It was very confusing to me. Dean Koontz seems like a write that can make exceptional descriptions of his characters, but he doesn't do a great job of explaining the plot very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite works by Koontz.","review":"Dean Koontz is the master of suspense and the King of creating Alter-ego type characters. Koontz doesn't sugarcoat his plots with amazing escapes and death-defying stunts by your average citizen......some people live and...some people die; just like real life. The story is told in two point of views and I think that lends a greater insight into what the counterparts are scheming and plotting throughout the book. A great read, easy to comprehend, and overall satisfying and novel's end. I highly recommend this book along with every other title by Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful \\"supernatural\\" thriller","review":"Just finished reading Mr Murder, the first (and so far only) book written by Mr Koontz that I've read. I must admit that I was pretty hesitant because his books are marketed like airport thrillers. Also, he's written so many books that I wondered if he churned them out without care for quality. Well, I'm impressed! This guy is good, very good. Not only is it well plotted, its scary and develops a suitably icy ambience. The characterisations are more than one dimensional and he has a handy way with words. While I call it \\"supernatural\\" (and I don't know much about this genre) the premise is in fact believeable. I'll definitely be reading more of Dean Koontz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even wet around the ears, Mr Murder was good","review":"Upfront, I'm not a murder-mystery novel maven.

So rich in detail. Well defined characters. Such a good pace. It made me scour every bookshop I knew looking for the second and third books. When I found them, I got a distinct feeling that something or someone was rushing Ms. Hearn to finish the series...or she got bored with Japan....whatever the reason is it is to the detriment of the plot.

I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed. After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.

Picture a day at the farm, walking through the stables ... now picture picking up some straw and shoving it into your mouth ... that would be preferable to chewing craway seeds.The best parallel to eating caraway seeds would be if you went to woodshop, picked up the carvings, mixed it with dirt and pepper and chewed.Now that doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy them, but be aware they need to be an ingredient ... like if you want to bake your own rye, although, that seems foolhardy since Rye bread is cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiper Blades","review":"This was stated to fit my 2011 Chevrolet Equinox ltz.

The book has McGarrity's easy-going style that brings in a lot of the New Mexico atmosphere. That style was the strongest thing about the book. The plot (you can get summaries of the plot in other reviews) is convoluted. That is not necessarily a bad thing in a mystery novel. But it is a horrendous thing in a novel that seemed to be operating under limited space requirements, as if the author were under pressure to keep the book under 280 pages (it's 278 pages in hardback). The ending was rushed. Not all of the loose ends got tied up, at least not to the satisfaction of this reader. Perhaps McGarrity will revisit some of these plot elements in a later work.

I've washed these 5 times already and they're still so stiff. The Merlot 500TC only results in thicker sheets but not softer. I haven't tried another brand and I had the impression that higher threadcount meant softer and smoother sheets. These do fit deep mattresses though which the Wamsuttas seem to have issues with. But my main priority is the feel of the sheets and these are a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for children, but...","review":"Not one for adults, really. It's well illustrated, but the text is very basic. It's a good book for beginners. But if you're even an average railfan, you'll probably find this book dull. You won't find anything in the way of new information.I was disappointed in this book. If you're looking for something with some meat in it, look elsewhere. The really sad part is that some of the best books written on steam locomotives in general and American Railroading in particular are now out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my money","review":"I waited and waited for this unit's price to drop so I could make a case to myself that I should buy this unit to replace my Canon i960 Photo printer, EPSON 2580 Scanner, and old HP 4L Laser Jet that were clogging up my desk. I especially wanted this one to scan negatives and slides. Well, that feature is especially poor. Every slide contains diagonal lines through it (the same slide scans perfect on the EPSON) so I had to break out the EPSON again for slide scanning. Photo printing quality is no where near as good as my Canon so that is now back on my desk. The only thing I use this for now is standard printing and scanning and now I have a fax machine (which I have to manually scan each page), but in the end I have 3 units on my desk again which defeated the purpose of this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP Photosmart C7180","review":"Great scanner and printer. I have not used the other functions yet. Received very quickly and easy to setup and use. Only frustration was trying to find out what maximum size memory card the unit could, since all I have are 2MG SD for my camera. HP Technical support told me the maximum size it could use was a 1MG and I was ready to send it back, but have been using my 2MG SD cards and they are working just fine. Keeping the screen is tricky with old photos leaving fragments, so a good quality lens cleaning cloth is a must if you are planning on such activity or you'll get a bunch of spots on your scanned photos.May want to price ink cartridges as there are four and I have not done this yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of cr**!","review":"this is the second hp all-in-one i've purchased and both have had the same problems of poor paper feed, paper jam and carriage jam errors to the point it is just absolutely unusable and a major headache. very poor quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time !!","review":"I first bought this printer 3 days ago and have returned it to the store (circuit City) three - yes 3 !! times.

The first one powered up with an error code on the LCD which HP Tech Support in India, no less, told me was a major hardware issue and I needed to replace the printer.The second one powered up fine - but - would not print with any black or pink inks. Again tech support, this time online chat, told me that they had exhausted all options and that the printer had a failed print head and needed to be returned.So - now I have number 3...and guess what? This one has the same error code on the LCD on power up as the first one did !!!I am computer literate and the HP install instructions are idiot proof (unless I'm an idiot) - so now I'm thinking of going with Canon.PLEASE be careful with this printer...it has issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a wireless printer","review":"We are impressed. Purchased the four in one to upgrade from an HP 490 photo type printer. We had tried several wireless print servers during past several years and returned them all.

She has scanned and faxed from her lap top with little effort. I have to spend some more time to get my computer to scan and fax. I'm sure this will take only a little time.Overall, the unit has a lot of nice features and operates very quitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"AIO -- yeah just try it.","review":"I bought this printer for its features and the name HP. Now I have little opinion of either. You can get it to print wireless and the fax works well. When you venture into wireless world all bets are off. It won't even install correctly. I have a belkin N router which works fine. I use the wireless wizard on the printer to connect to the router and then the trouble starts. This printer won't scan and it won't print from another wireless computer. There is no patch or fix for this you are stuck with it. I am sorry I bought this POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid: endlessly awful","review":"When it prints it works well. But the supplied HP Solutions software is needed for all but the most basic printing, and 'loses' the printer every time you really need to print something. This generally means uninstalling and reinstalling the printer, a procedure which has become depressingly routine. I called HP support and was charged 30 in total for a premium rate call. All that was finally established was that I needed to pay a further 30 for a 'Smartfriend' support call. This took more than three hours and failed to resolve the problem. We have a network and use two M1330 laptops. There is nothing unusual about the network.PLEASE save yourself aggravation and buy another printer. I HATE HP.

My pictures(using HP premium plus photo paper in satin/soft gloss) come out better than any local stores prints. And unlike other Hp printers I have had in the past, this one does not jam paper or \\"get a mind of it's own\\". It is suprisingly not too bad on ink.

I did that knowing that wouldn't help. and it didn't every time i try to print checks (again 8.5 x 11 size) i get this stupid message that i'm using the wrong size of paper. so what should take me two seconds takes me ten minutes. Also sometimes it prints really fast (like 2 seconds) and other times it take 2 minutes to print something. and i'm talking about checks again so it isn't that complicated just name of place, date, and amount.

However, the constant need to replenish these tiny ink cartridges is leading me to seriously consider dumping the printer, about a year after I bought it. I can't give you an exact metric like so many ounces per print or whatever, but, take my word for it, you will be replacing cartridges on this thing every couple of weeks if you do any small amount of printing at all. It is incredibly frustrating.Update 5/2009 -- the ink situation on this thing is just absurd. If you have any substantial sized project (like a few drafts of a 20 page document), be prepared to buy a whole new set of ink cartridges halfway through whatever you are doing. This thing is just useless if you want to use it for light business purposes once in a while. Do not buy this as your \\"home office\\" printer.

My pilot husband uses of one while flying for accurate timing when needed.This is a great little unit with many uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use, loud","review":"The title of the review says it all. Any idiot can use this timer without messing it up. It counts up or down and is easy to use, and loud enough to wake me up. Small enough to carry around easily, with a magnet and a clip. This timer works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timer that works well","review":"The timer on the stove broke. First we tried a traditional timer with a dial. It worked fine for long time periods but wasn't totally reliable when set for a few minutes. This one is great. You can set it for hours or minutes and it's totally reliable (as long as you remember to hit the start button)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relieved to find an excellent product","review":"A few years ago I shopped for an additional timer and was discouraged by the not-thought-out features. But when my 20-year-old West Bend died recently, I shopped on line and found this one. I am thrilled with it. It sounds loudly enough to hear in the next room; it allows for a longer timing; and it sits securely on the counter, not falling over easily as some do. Thank you, West Bend, for renewing my faith in new products."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 out of 5","review":"Our company has 3 West Bend Digital Timers over 8 years old. They work great and have never failed us. We needed more timers so I purchased 5 new ones of the same type and model. Saddly, only 4 of the 5 worked when I received them. The Alarm for one of them does not sound. The clock portion works fine but when the time runs out there is no alarm to let you know that the time has expired.I do like this timer but am dissapointed in the quality of the newer ones. The older timers we have had for 8 years and are still going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great style timer","review":"I have had timers like this before and I prefer them.

I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Office Timer, With Easy Modification (Mute to Turn Off Sound)","review":"This timer beeps LOUDLY every time you start or stop it. I wanted to mute it so I could use it in my office without annoying everyone.This was an easy fix. I unscrewed the back with a #0 philips head screwdriver. Then I carefully snipped the black wire leading to the speaker (a saucer shaped tin thing about half an inch across). No more chirping!Took less than ten minutes, and it was so easy, anyone could do it. Note: only cut the wire leading to the speaker, do NOT cut the wire coming from the battery!

They should be able to count up, count down, beep when the timer is done. They should be durable, easy to read, easy to use, and stable. Lastly, they should be nice enough looking that you won't want to keep them hidden in the drawer. This timer is all of those things. I use it mainly as an espresso shot timer, and it works rather well for that. I start the timer before the shot, then adjust the target time accordingly (e.g. adding 5 seconds). Instead of timing down to a beep, I use the stopwatch feature. It's got a magnetic back, so it can attach to the side of my machine when not in use, but also has a fold-out kickstand so it can stand up. The angle when using the kickstand makes it easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best timer ever!","review":"I have had one of these timers for years, and just bought two more on Amazon. Everybody who sees them in my kitchen wants one. They are the most convenient timer I have ever used (and I have had MANY!) Quick and easy to directly enter hours, minutes and seconds -- no repeated punching a button to get it up to the desired time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Electronics, Terrible Quality Housing","review":"The timer's ELECTRONIC parts, function, and design are excellent. The loud beeping alarm is particularly valuable. However, the mechanical housing, particularly the plastic hinge assembly, is terrible. The frail plastic hinge broke after only a couple weeks of very gentle handling. We will end up gluing a magnet onto the back of the timer so we can continue to use it, as it spends the vast majority of its time magnetically attached to the front of the hood over the stove. It's a shame to see such a useful, simple to use tool be so badly handicapped by an atrocious mechanical design and execution. Shame on the manufacturer and their quality control engineers for producing such a badly flawed product."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Bend 40005","review":"Very happy to have found in this timer exactly what I was looking for.Unlike the timers I have found around here, I can put in the exact amount of time (hours, minutes & seconds) I want by using the numbers on the keypad.

It worked fine for a timer in the beginning, but now it shorts out while running at times and often I have to take the battery in and out to get it to work again for me (even after putting in a new battery). I should have just put the money into another Pampered Chef timer and got what I really wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I had a timer similar to this for years.

When you hit \\"stop\\" then \\"start\\" again, it just continues from where it left off. It doesn't remember the time you last set it to -- so you have to type 100 again to time for another minute. I need a programmable timer that will remember several settings -- so I have to buy a different timer -- so that our business meetings aren't full of people trying to type 100 into the timer. I thought it would be nice to have 10 buttons on the timer -- but it wasn't the right timer for my purposes. Also, the magnet doesn't seem strong enough for the fridge, and it doesn't seem sturdy enough to take a fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, uninspired design","review":"As others have said, if you use the magnet to attach this timer to an oven hood or a refrigerator, it's nearly impossible to use with one hand because you can't push any buttons without knocking the timer off. After a few falls, the clip has broken off and it now lives, face-side up, on the counter until we find a replacement.It also has no memory. If you set a time on it, let it finish, then push the 'restart' button, the timer goes back to 00:00. You get the same behavior when you push any other button as well. There is no means of telling how long the last timer session was.It makes a nice, very loud beep that's difficult to ignore. I'll give it that much.I'd expect this from a $3 timer in the bargain bin but I paid around $13. No, $13 isn't a lot of money but when there are plenty of other timers for much cheaper, you can do much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great and Easy to Use!","review":"We have had this timer for about a month now (01/16/10).

What someone else didn't like was exactly what I was looking for - a loud beep!The \\"beep\\" is loud enough to hear in a different room and it beeps for one minute! Both are features that I need!I also like having the key pad with each number and not having to use up or down arrow keys to set the desired time.It's a great timer for us so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but fragile","review":"I like this timer because you can press one button for each hour/minute to set it, in other words, you don't need to press the minute button 30 times to set it for 30 minutes.

One had a chip in the back pane of glass, and on another the molding on the frame in one color is loose and a crack had developed. But both frames are still usable.

For some of the 11x14 frames, the glass was really wedged into the frame, and I was afraid that I was going to break the glass trying to ease it out. Sure enough, one of them broke. For the others, I was able to ease it out.Otherwise, they're perfectly OK frames for the value. If you're hanging them, note that the way the hooks are attached to the frame, the force the frame to stand out a little bit from the wall. Also, when you hang the 13x16 frames sideways (landscape instead of portrait), the top edge frame (where the hooks are) bends slightly, causing a slight curve. I think it has to do with the fact that the frame is made of firm but slightly pliable material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Stylish Frame","review":"I really like this frame. I got two for my diplomas and I think that they look very nice.

This is unbiblical and dangerous. The Bible states when we are adults we are all accountable to God. It doesn't say unless you're a woman. Priscilla also seems very fond of bashing career woman. Ms. Shirer, the 11th Commandment is not 'Thou Shalt not be a Working Mother.' I think that it is best for moms to stay home with their kids at least when they're little. However in a sinful world1. That is not always possible and2. A loving working mother like I have is better than a lousy stay at home mom.Submission is one thing of course and I do agree with that. BUT to say a woman is not responsible for her herself-- and her sin-- is dangerous. Priscilla's teachings, in my opinion, are like good water with a drop of poison. The good water is there but the poison makes it toxic. Please stay away from this one ladies. I would, however, recommend her study on Jonah."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This book is absolutely amazing!

Awesome job & God bless Priscilla Shirer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Jewel in His Crown","review":"This book is well written and entertaining. However, I felt like the author does a lot of name dropping causing the reader (who may not know all those \\"famous\\" people) to wonder if the author is genuine in who she knows or if she is overly proud of who she knows. And although the book quotes a lot of scripture, keep in mind that the entire book is the author's INTERPRETATION of those scriptures. Some are more stretched than others, but it is based on opinion. But with all that said, if you can see past that you will pick up a few tips on self esteem and seeing yourself as God sees you. I do think there are better books out there though, at least I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"This book was ok. Seeing all the reviews here on Amazon made me have high expectations, since it was all 4 and 5 stars. Some people said it was life changing...I wouldn't go that far.

She says similar things but in a fun, uplifting way that actually makes you feel good about yourself and have a renewed zest for the Lord. I don't think I'll reread this book. I gave it two stars because it has a positive message that women should hear, but there are other books that can say it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

Although any woman can benefit from reading this book, I thought it would be more helpful for single women. It is an inspirational book for building one's self esteem and realizing that as a woman you are valued by God and you should value yourself as highly as God does. Then you would not accept circumstances in your life that are less that what you deserve. I sent this book as a gift to two young single women."},{"rating":"2","title":"God made us just the way He wanted us to be.","review":"Priscilla has really captured my attention as someone who speaks from her heart. She has created a book that should be read by every woman out there that has doubts about her purpose in life. Although I am a Christian and know that my Heavenly father loves me, reading Priscilla's book reminds me of this and truly gave a beautiful picture of my role as a female in God's world. This book did wonders for my self esteem, reassuring me that through thick or thin I am a \\"Jewel in His Crown.\\" What a wonderful thought to think about when things aren't going as I think they should.

I like that they preserve what belonged to their parents and grandparents and older generations before them. Their style of decorating is something I'd like to apply myself because there are certain things that are very important to me and I like to show them off.

Nothing to do with the book itself, but the fact I had already read it under the name of \\"Red Ball\\".Why publishers insist on releasing books under different titles in different regions is beyond me. Anyway, this is a cracking good read, a slightly different take on the vampire story and full of Gideon's usual confronting graphic descriptions. I've read all of his books I can find, (only four unfortunately, five if you count Red Ball & Kindred as two seperate books)and they have all been very good. However he seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth just over 10 years ago, and as much as I google him, I can find no info beyond the books I have.

It does have the heart-stopping horror you look for in a book of this type, as well as having some deep sexual overtones neither of which is gratuitous or overused.

It's the initial book of her Joanna Stark trilogy, introducing one of her three heroines. The other two are: \\"There Hangs the Knife\\" and \\"Dark Star.\\" I think this is the best of the 3. It's certainly interesting to see Muller write of protagonists other than Sharon McCone--demonstrates her breadth of talent. Also, the Stark trilogy is heavily into the world of art and art theft as well as a series of books (like Sherlock Holmes vs. Professor Moriarty) with a continuing struggle between two characters (Stark and Parducci). Muller slowly and teasingly provides detail after detail to fill in the prior relationship between the two characters--considerably enlivening the tales.

Plus, the characters do not come across as being terribly serious, this isn't bad if the movie is a comedy, which this isn't.

(there goes 22 bucks I could have put toward a new coffee maker) Turns out the lever arm that pushes up from the bottom part was cracked and looked ok (did not break off completely so appeared to be working).

Also, freshly brewed coffee was not brewing hot as it had when it was new. For the money paid, it wasn't worth keeping, so we moved on to the Cuisinart DCC-2000.

I contacted Hamilton Beach who only agreed to waive the $14.99 cover charge after I talked to a supervisor. The third replacement broke on the second day!

I brew 4 cups everyday. The pump stopped sucking the water, and so after making a little, the coffeemaker would turn off. Then I'd have to turn it on again, and again! Up to 6 times to make what I needed. I think any appliance should last at least a year. Luckily, I was able to return it to the wholesaler I purchased it from, but otherwise, it would have been trash.

Im a younggun, and started listening to Hendrix 6 or 7 years ago and loved it so; but to be honest I didnt know much of his life, but I guess I didnt care much either. Hendrix's music exists in like this capsule away from his actual physical person and self, writers have no problem calling him \\"the greatest guitarist ever\\" or praising his songwriting but dont ever bother with him.So, maybe thats why I liked this book. It gave some weight and depth to the person behind the great music but also showed him to be a mortal who fell to his base pleasures. It's a well-balanced, smooth read, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Biographies","review":"I have been listening and playing his music for over thirty years. These biographies add nothing to learning about the man. Listen to the music. If you wnat to read something that reflects a different side of him, read Monika Dannemans book.

But I am definitely more fascinated with Jimi's music, and not the minute details of his life. Yeah, his background and his history helps us understand him and his music a little better. But I'm sure there are several other interesting facets of Jimi than what're mentioned here. Just like his biography of Kurt(which I loathe), Cross' writing feels like a novel, like a fictional story even if it's all true and real.

I say this from the perspective of guitar playing. The author believes that Hendrix's past is all represented in his playing. A nice idea, but really dumb. Hendrix, like Clapton, is an enigma.

Cross didn't anticipate that (...)would post the actual discharge papers from 1962 in which Hendrix was actually discharged for behavioral problems and need for constant supervision.

He wasn't discharged for claiming to be gay.Nice work Charles R. Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope.","review":"Reading a book by Charles Cross is like eating a handful of vomit. He is nothing but a sensationalist hack who uses stilted, rudimentary language, makes up juicy tidbits (how Jimi was discharged from the army, etc.) and has very little regard for the facts if they don't conform to his agenda.

Probably a 5% to 95% dialog to singing ratio with a disjointed storyline based on Life of Brian where the five main stars never made any costume changes and there were no sets. They didn't even perform the Life of Brian movie theme song. Michael Palin definitely stole what little show there was. Terry Gilliam had a funny bit. Terry Jones pretty much just sang a song.

The lighting is stunning, the costumes are perfect, the staging is wonderful, the singers are brilliant and it's vintage Python. I'm in professional theatre (a stage manager) and I was absolutely blown away.The only dissapointment I had - and I know this is my opinion only - was that I wasn't impressed with Rosalind Plowright (the lady wearing the blue dress who plays Brian's mother). I don't happen to like her voice, but that's just me.I won't spill any beans for those of you who haven't seen it, and for those folks who were lucky enough to be in attendance - it captures the excitement, passion and love of Python.

It takes a while for the two to both get past their misconceptions and to realize that along with the games that they were playing, that they had both truly fallen in love. I adored this one and finished it in a day and a half simply because I could not put it down.If you're looking for romance with a twist, that is full of humor, good fun and a great deal of wit, you'll love this one. Again, Chase has come through and did not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":";0)","review":"This was a nice read. Griffen I must say was really out there it started with a conversation he overheard with Brandy and her boss. After this everything was a bundle of misunderstandings between Brandy and Griffen. Griffen is that take charge hero. He did judge Brandy a lot that's why it's never good to always assume. I also guess his assumptions lead him to be harsh at times. Brandy is a talented architect who just wants to design and be taken seriously. These two together was pretty explosive. All in all for me a nice light read.

They consist of a series of pictures which are too small to read. In addition, they are printed on a reflective surface which makes things even worse. The manufacturer's website is also not helpful, so you basically have to figure out how to do it yourself. The key is you need to realize that the oval white strap adjuster (which goes behind your baby's back) has tabs with a gap in them. You can slide the straps out through that gap. Then you can install the cushion, run the straps through the cushion slots, and finally reattach the adjuster.Other than this, we like it!

It's soft, chewy, the crust is thin, and it tastes delicious!The only other bread I've made is Krusteaz because that's all the local grocery store sells. The biggest difference I've noticed is that Krusteaz bread has a really thick crust, the softness/texture of the bread doesn't last as long, and the bread seemed to shrivel up a bit after I took it out of the bread maker, cut it up, and let it cool down.

The animals that hang down off the arch are very sweet, especially the hippo which plays 3 lovely tunes when the baby hits it. The animals detach easily and can be attached to the playgym for more variety. The only negative is that the arch doesn't attach with great stability and tends to need to be readjusted frequently as it detaches easily from the infant carrier or flops forward onto the baby.

As soon as I think I've attached it well enough for it to stay on at least for a short time, my baby touches one of the hanging toys and the whole thing falls down on the baby. It's also supposed to play 3 tunes but 99% of the time it plays the same tune over and over no matter how many times you press on the hippo. The only time I've heard the other 2 tunes is when the car seat is being moved and the toy plays music without being touched (mind you that it's still not attached to the car seat and u just leave it on top of the seat while the baby is not in it).

He wasn't fond of the toys on it, but when I used baby links and attached other toys he loved it. We put it on the RnP so that I could rotate it back and keep the toys above his head to get him in and out easier. It helped so I could get things around the house done as he didn't really care for his bouncer or swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design, doesn't attach to car seat with any stability","review":"We bought this because our daughter hates riding in her carseat and we were looking for a distraction for her.

The old lid is solid molded glass, the new looks like plexiglass with a plastic knob screwed on. The old base is hefty bakelite, the new seems to be some cheap and flimsy molded plastic.

It's rare to find this type of quality today, but West Bend seems to have done it. The current price was more reasonable than I expected and I'm planning to buy another as a gift in the near future.

I do not understand why the food is moist and tender. When it was always dry and tough when she used her old crock pot. I know that the cooker is the only thing which has changed. I cannot give 5 stars because the cooker has no off position on the switch. The other night we found the pot still hot 3 hours after I thought I had turned it off. In reality I had just turned it to the lowest possible setting. With an empty pot, this is still too hot to touch. The only way to turn it off is to unplug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Item","review":"I don't understand what the other person was talking about when they said it doesn't work like a crock pot. Of course it doesn't work exactly like a crock pot. This is a slow cooker not a crock pot. A crock pot usually gives you a Low & Hi setting. On the slow cooker it's adjustable and that's why I like it. I have used a West Bend slow cooker for 19 years. I still have it and it works great. With the holidays right around the corner I wanted an additional one and Amazon has the best price when buying through their store with the free shipping they are offering. When you work at a job all day, it's great to get home and find dinner is about ready. I cook about 4 meals a week in the slow cooker. Because it works so well, I decided to stick with West Bend.

The ability to brown the roast before slow cooking is a strong PLUS. Overall, I am well pleased but I am keeping my old crockpot for a while just to be sure of the volumn, as I like to make tomato sauce in the crockpot and want to check this unit for volumn before trashing the old one. So far very pleased"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"This slow cooker is very versatile. I sautee my onions and peppers and what have you on my gas stove top, and then move the unit to the base and add the rest of my ingredients. I have had the cooker about six months and am very happy with it overall. My only complaint is that the plastic handle on the glass lid is starting to loosen. Also, the lid is rimmed with metal, which has bent just a bit, and now I have to push down just right to get the lid to seal perfectly.

I had a very old crock pot (from the '70s) that was too small and hard to clean. While researching to purchase a new slow cooker, this West Bend oblong one caught my attention. I just love the features on this model, these in particular -- the oblong shape allows for ribs, roasts, etc. to fit very well; the fact that you can remove the cooker from its base and brown meats on the stove is a big plus; it is very, very easy to clean. I have not used the griddle yet, but that is a nice feature. I am truly enjoying my purchase.

I used my old WB cooker for over 10 years and it still works great but I cracked the plastic lid so decided it was time for a replacement. This 5 quart model uses the same size base and lid (glass) as the smaller 4 qt. but has taller sides which work well for larger soup dishes. What is great about this slow cooker is that you can put the pan on the stove to brown roasts and later make gravy. It easily washes up with the non stick surface. The $35 Amazon price was a real bargain. You won't find one cheaper anywhere else including ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow cooker","review":"I have been hunting all over for this slow cooker.

And the glass lid makes it easy to view contents. Did I also mention it is non-stick.

Clean-up is a snap and it's not heavy like the traditional stoneware crocks. I prefer the oblong shape to the round slow cookers because it accommodates larger cuts of meats such as roasts. Since purchasing this item approximately three years ago, I have rarely used my other two crock pots. Convenient to use, easy to handle and clean, and less storage space than other slow cookers. A+++!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops. Nonstick interior is Teflon...","review":"I don't use Teflon anymore since discovering its potential health hazards. I'm sending back my unused cooker because I didn't read the description carefully enough. Yes, the container is enamel on the outside, but I should've seen that the interior is non-stick.

It is poorly written and wordy. Don't get me wrong, there is some very good information in the book but extracting it is like pulling teeth. For example, early in the book the author uses a day chart of Walmart to explain changes in the market. Too big of a leap for me. If you do buy this book I suggest skipping the body and going directly to Glossary A which contains images of the various patterns with short explanations. Then if you have any questions you can wade through the relevant section of the book. This book should be considered not much more than a very expensive reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete ripoff in big font and double space type","review":"Steve Nison is desperately trying to fill pages.

I did extend its sensor ranger by placing it on a paper towel. Not a bad buy for the price and they can save you a lot of money if does find a leak in your water heater or plumbing.

I put them by my washer, under toilets (we have had a leak and the toilet overflow which flooded the basement before I got them. I guess they won't help when I am at work, but maybe if it was overflowing before I left, I could have stopped it), by the sump pump, and the air conditioning/humidifier unit whose pipe tends to clog and cause a leak.

I can't hear it from across the basement, let alone from upstairs. Thinking that maybe it wasn't as loud as adverstised might have something to do with the brand-new battery not being up to strength, I changed to another new battery. No better. Completely useless for its intended purpose.I might suggest re-branding it as an anti-sleeptime drool biofeedback device. Put it on your pillow, if you drool at night, it'll sound.

However, the three locations at which I intended using had previously had falling water, one from a poorly machined water valve for a clothes washer, a second from a leaking pump seal on the dishwasher (GE, 8 years old), and the third, a leaking shaft seal on the disposer (8 year old In-Sink-Erator).

(Just beating out No Country and There Will Be Blood) Casey Afflek as Bob Ford is visually the most captivating character I have seen in a long time. Never once during this movie was I at all bored. The story progresses at a timely but necessary pace. It lets you dive into each character especially Jesse James. Like no other movie this shows James' character in a new light with compassion and remorse. I can't recommend this movie enough. If you have a shred of patience nothing is wrong with this movie, it is not nearly as boring as There Will Be Blood. And Blu Ray only makes the experience that much better.Essential Viewing in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend","review":"The service was excellent.

The film moves along at a glacier's pace, which wouldn't be that bad if the story gave me something to grab on to. I could have read the book in the dark faster than watching this film!On the plus side, I give the film makers credit for trying to make a serious western although not nearly as truthful as they would like you to believe. The acting is very good, with a strong cast and the film looks beautiful, but in the end, I knew where it was going and I didn't learn anything new, I didn't know at the beginning of the film!

There are attempts to give the guy some soul, but it doesn't work. I don't know why, maybe Pitt simply can't help being himself, and brings to the screen a very confused man who tries to be cool, cocky and depressed at the same time, but you feel it doesn't make for natural viewing at all. Even the way he speaks sounds very unnatural. He finds it very hard to play anything but himself.The only redeeming feature, and the only engaging character in this film is Robert Ford, played by a magnificent Casey Affleck. He's the only guy one can connect with, even though he's a misguided, delusional youth.That's where the compliments end. Because the film sets out as a deep character study of people without character, and cares not a iota about thrilling or entertaining with plots, it turns out to be one loooong failure. 3 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cure For Insomnia","review":"A plodding, self-important, bloated cure for insomnia.If I wanted therapy, I would have paid to go to a psychiatrist -- not a movie.

I loved it!","review":"The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford, Brad Pitt's 2007 Western, was mostly ignored or panned, as it isn't the usual sassy gunslinger. If you're looking for thrills, this won't be your cup of tea. In fact, the film is a slow, meditative unmaking of the romantic myth of America in the nineteenth century. Pitt as Jesse and Casey Affleck as Ford, supported by appropriately melancholy music and cinematography, strip bare the heroic images to reveal immature young men walking the edges of sanity. If you appreciate thoughtful, elegiac imaginings of what might have been more likely, this is indeed a film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Hood of the Old West","review":"Movie sticks closer to the truth about Jesse than other movies. It had it's own agenda though. In all honesty, there is there not any real knowledge Jesse being depressed or to what extent. The movie shows the writer's opinion rather than openly stating it. A lot is a good representation of part of the story leaving the viewer with plenty of room for making up his/her own mind.Definitely a movie I will watch more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will never get the 2 1/2 hours of your life back...","review":"While Brad Pitt gives a tremendous performance, the movie rambles and is much too long.

Most people won't like \\"James\\" because of this.However, I'd encourage anyone who typically avoids these types of movies to give it a chance. The soundtrack is haunting and the characters etch themselves into your memory. Casey Affleck, who plays Bob Ford, steals the movie as James' deeply flawed devotee. You don't need any background in the period to follow the movie - a narrator explains the background as the movie progresses. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This film blew me away!","review":"What a little gem of a flick. If you are a Brad Pitt fan or a fan of westerns or a fan of American History - do not miss this one! Terrific acting, you feel as if you are right alongside the characters. Nice to see Sam Shepard as well! Was not too familiar with Sam Rockwell before, but he stole my heart in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You watch it for the experience and for the beauty","review":"Yes, it's long, and yes, you know what's going to happen. That's why it's so amazing that this film is so good. It's absolutely beautiful to watch. The cinematography was fantastic. Casey Affleck really made the movie work. What a fascinating character. Brad Pitt did a nice job.Make no mistake - this is a long movie, and slow. But if you don't mind a movie that takes it's time and settles itself deep inside you, then you should like this one.It's by no means a traditional action Western, and much of it takes place away from the frontier. But it's a fine film if you appreciate scenery, and long, thorough character development.I can't speak to the historical accuracy of the film, which I guess isn't all that great. But on some level it doesn't really matter. Also, I think that many of Jesse James' ancestors are happy with the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brad is the pits as Jesse Lames","review":"snore......, what a waste of time and film, occassional glimpses of an \\"authentic\\" west made it tolerable, the dialogue a muttered mess, I had to fast forward most of the last third of the movie. Michael Cimino's Gates of Heaven shines next to this muddy mess of a movie. I would have walked out of the theater had I went, as it was, this was the most disappointing over-hyped movie in a long while for me, comparisons to The Unforgiven are hard to understand, perhaps it was all the darkness and low illumination. I was hoping for something along the lines of The Long Riders, sorry, this one missed the mark. Brad Pitt trying to expand his repertoire and add an art film western to his repertoire doesn't cut it.

This movie would not make the top 1000. I like Brad Pitt as an actor, but the thinking of anything he's in is a 5 star movie is a falcity. This movie is way too long and way too boring. I thought none of the actors put forth an effort worthy of the subject matter, and the lack of action worthy of the subject matter was very disappointing. I have put this dvd aside to trade in. For a much better film on Jesse James, see The Last Days Of Frank and Jesse James with Johnny Cash & Kris Kristofferson. It stands head and shoulders above this one on the subject of Jesse James."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...boring....boring","review":"If you enjoy counting the number of holes in the ceiling tiles of your office or enjoy watching paint dry on the wall, this movie is definitely for you.This was just about the most boring movie I have ever watched.

It is indeed a moody film and there is a strong period flavor to it. Those interested in American history and its portrayal in film will most likely enjoy this film. We know what happened to Jesse James, but have you ever wondered what happened to Robert Ford? This film will tell you in stark terms. The acting, directing, narration, screen play, cinematography are all excellent. In an era of superb sound tracks on many DVDs, this DVD is outshone by the competition so much so that I venture to say that the sound track fails, even fails miserably. Perhaps the blu-ray version is better on this score and on the chance that it is and you have a blu-ray player, I recommend you purchase it rather than this regular DVD version. Five stars on all counts but sound. One star at best on sound for an average of four stars overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film Redeemed By a Terrific Second Half","review":"At times watching this film seems like a chore for, say, the first hour and a half. Stay with it because it rebounds nicely in the end. The film goes at a deliberate pace. Some would say it drags. By the film's midpoint it's themes of good and evil, truth and fiction, real and unreal start to cohere. Brad Pitt is terrific in conveying the multi-facets that was Jesse James. He terrificly encapsulates a man who could be a loving husband and father and also a cold-blooded killer. The revelation here is Casey Affleck as Robert Ford. In a complex reading of the character we are left to wonder whether Ford was a hero-worshiper, cold-blooded killer, or an avenging angel. Affleck plays his cards close to the vest so his motives remain an enigma. It makes for a little irony in the film's title. I recommend this film despite the slow going at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assasination of Jesse James","review":"I bought this DVD because I loved the movie when I saw it in the theaters.

I think it was trying to be an art film and make some kind of moralistic statement. However, I am not really sure what that statement is? This movie should be avoided. I couldn't wait for it to end about half way through it. I almost turned it off before it was over. This movie is a real stinker.

It does so beautifully, too. They picked the perfect narrator, popping in from time to time to further explore what was myth, maybe true, or whatever. The Blu-Ray transfer is also beautiful and adds to this captivating tale. My only disappointment was the lack of extras - it does have one good, half-hour documentary, but that's about it. Maybe another edition is on the way, as I believe that there was a much longer cut at one point, and maybe they're saving the extras for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse James the Human Being","review":"Just like the incredible book by Ron Hansen on which it is lovingly based, The Assassination of Jesse James is a lyrical and poignant look at the last years of the outlaw's life. James is portrayed as ornery, dangerous and unpredictable but also as a weary and tired man who realizes too late that the life he is living can only last so long. I was a bit uncomfortable with Brad Pitt in the role at first, but he comes to inhabit the character quite well. Beautiful cinematography too, and excellent acting all around. This will be one that I will purcase and keep. Too bad there are no special features - this kind of film deserves them."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN THE FUTURE, THIS WILL BE VIEWED AS A LOST CLASSIC","review":"In the style of the great Seventies films that studied character and motivation rather than the number of times a gun was fired, this is a thoughtful meditation.This film also has much to say about the power of legend and the amorphous concept of heroism. Themes that ring as true today as they probably did at the time.Expertly shot and expansive in its visual range, I REALLY wish I'd been able to see this on the big screen.One day, there will be a 2000s Western Film Festival which tours the world, allowing discerning viewers to see how the genre was taken forward at the beginning of the new century. This may include 'Hidalgo', '3:10 To Yuma', the ill-fated 'Alamo' and 'September Dawn'.'The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford' will tower above all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, deliberate, fascinating, sad","review":"This is a very artful film, deliberately paced and beautifully shot, which simultaneously deglamourizes the Jesse James of legend, and makes his final days into a rich aesthetic experience. The cinematography is beautiful (although it verges on the overly-artsy) and the paceof the film is reflective and sombre. Casey Affleck is stunning as the twitchy, shifty, calculating, craven Bob Ford, a wretch who had the sad fortune to be James' assassin, back in 1882. Affleck's performance is a real doozy, creating from whole cloth one of the most complex, pathetic, unnerving character portraits in recent memory. A niceaddition to the growing genre of postmodern Western films.

If i I saw it in a movie theatre I would have walked out. the best thing about this movie is the title. downhill from there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful cinematography, but too long and too slow","review":"The movie looks great on Blu-ray, but it is far too long and far too slow at getting to the meat of the matter.I can't say the first 2 hours (give or take) of the movie isn't needed. A fair amount might be required to help give background on the events that led up to the meeting of the players involved, their motivations and interests and such, but sadly those initial 2 hours seemed to drag on and on without purpose or possible direction.The movie gets better in the last 30 - 40 minutes, but by then you may have fallen asleep and decided it's just not worth sitting through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture to sit through. Terrible.","review":"While Brad Pitt was an inspired choice to play Jesse James, and does a great job, and while the sets, scenery, acting and cinematography were all wonderful, I'm with the reviewers who thought this movie was an interminable, unbearable bore. One might ask how it's possible to ruin a movie about Jesse James, and the answer would be to let Ridley Scott anywhere near it and shoot the movie as a 2 hour and 40 minute post-modern lecture on media celebrity, masculinity, obsession and self-esteem, all focused not on Jesse James but on the weasely Robert Ford. Come on people- just because a movie is long and boring doesn't mean it's a work of genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lengthy docu-drama","review":"This movie would make an exceptional 45 minute docu-drama. It explores Jesse James, his killer's, and secondary characters' personalities and motivations. The acting is superb. Unfortunately, the story dragged on for 160 minutes with no new revelations or action to keep the story moving forward. The story shows Jesse as a heartless killer yet adoring father and how his paranoia drove him to kill his accessories. The movie also shows how Ford, who idolizes Jesse, ends up killing him and trying to cash in on his newly found fame, but there's only one problem and the movie gets to this point about 2 hours into it.The movie put my husband and daughter to sleep so that's why it gets such a low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's John Ford when you need him?","review":"I gave this movie the one minimum star, which I feel it legitimately earned for its fabulous cinematography.How can you take a fascinating character like Jesse James -- the subject of many terrific movies like \\"The Long Riders\\" and the Tyrone Power/Henry Fonda classic -- and turn it into a boring, turgid, slow-moving and static yawn-fest like this?It seems to me you'd have to purposely set out to find absolutely the most uninteresting things you can about the guy, and make a movie about them.It would be like making a movie about the culinary skills of Attila the Hun. Who cares?The movie actually picks up a bit in the last 20 or so minutes when it focuses on the aftermath of the killing in how it affected Ford, but other than that, it was an overlong two and a half hours that seemed like three days.Get \\"The Long Riders\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"David McCullough imitation by narrator very creepy","review":"This movie would have been much, much better, had the filmmakers not opted for a narration that was obviously intended to sound (exactly) like David McCullough narrating a historical documentary. The effect was eerie, as the narrator nearly succeeded in sounding like McCullough himself, yet was obviously not the historian. Rather than enhancing the experience, this imitation was very annoying and distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesse wasn't shot he died of boredom watching this","review":"This movie was beautiful to watch but a big bore. So overlong and tedious that it took two days to finish it. I woudn't bother unless you really need something late at night. The acting is good but that's never enough by itself. It's too bad. If they had made it in 1 1/2 instead of 2 1/2 hours and at a human instead of glacial pace it could have been a lot better, maybe even good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shot in the Back Again!","review":"Two stars for excellent cinematography and fairly good acting. However, that's it. From there on, the two and half hour story-line is drab and slow - a story that could have been told in less that 30 minutes!Also, unless the viewer is totally immersed in the fable of Jesse James, chances are you will get lost within the first 15 minutes. Too many characters who are not well defined, much less introduced. No background. The mumbling dialogue leaves much to be desired.Sorry I wasted about $3.00 renting it. It is certainly not worth buying, unless you suffer from insomnia, in which case it will put you to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So realistic, there are no likable characters...","review":"The good - the cinematography is wonderful - the movie is beautiful to look at. Probably historically accurate, since the characters are dour, grim, ignorant, annoying and lacking in charm or charisma. Jesse James is described in the narrative as charismatic, but Pitt plays him as a cruel, paranoid, self-absorbed guy who works his mouth frequently as if he were wearing poorly fitting dentures. I'm a big Jeremy Renner, Paul Schneider, Sam Shepard, and Sam Rockwell fan - if these guys couldn't raise it out of the mire no one could. And mired it stayed for me - slow, dull, unredeemable.

The actors in this movie do the best with what they have. It took me 3 tries before i actually got to sit down and watch the entire movie. Mostly, because i kept getting bored and cutting it off. Brad Pitt carries this movie most of the way but it's entirely to slow paced. This is not a movie, this is actually a documentary pretending to be a movie. They should have made a documentary about the Life and Death of Jesse James. Brad Pitt could have even narrated. That's basically all this is anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring...","review":"I always enjoyed the stories of Jesse James until I watched this movie.

We started the movie over again to get the names down half way through and had a much better understanding of the paranoid relationships developing later in the movie. A tremendous character sketch of Jesse and Bob Ford. Action but not an action flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film of 2007","review":"This film is a breathtaking account of the life and times of Jesse James. I am in complete awe that this movie wasn't more widely released because it was the best film of the year. Brad Pitt, Sam Rockwell and Casey Affleck give astounding performances, but Affleck's portrayal of the tormented and obsessive ally to James is beautiful and absolutely unforgettable. It is a shame that movies like this can come out and be mostly ignored...it should at least be nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Cinematography.This is a must see and once you do yourself the favor of indulging in this epic, you will then know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse James revisited","review":"Brad Pitt does a great job in this somewhat different look at Jesse James. He comes across as a bit of a psychopath, even scarier for being charming too. Casey Affleck is a revelation.

It's only redeeming value was some occasional nice cinematography of pretty western scenes. The plot was so slow that several times we'd thought it ended, but we didn't shut off the machine quickly enough and discovered...there was more.

We've used this product every night since she was two months old (it was too hot where we lived to use it her first month).

I'm not saying the fabric is thin or anything, which it's not, but the hat is thick felt and there is no support for the tophat's tall part.

I trimmed mine down so it looked reasonably beard like. Even in that state, it's comically bad.However, it went over very well. Better than any costume in my adult life, actually. And I just wore a black 3/4 length jacket and a dress shirt with it. My favorite joke while I was wearing it was when people would ask, \\"Are you Abraham Lincoln?\\" I would answer \\"No, I'm Abraham from the bible.\\" :DIn it's unmodified state, it would be better suited for a hillbilly moonshiner or something.

Even if i weren't, i wouldn't. Just reading the summary has me ticked off and insulted - the author obviously didn't do an OUNCE of research on the topic of transgenders/transsexuals... or even on Brandon himself. Brandon was transgender - he was a male in all but body, and was trying to present as such.By not recognizing this, the author is no better than the people who shot him point blank OR Brandon's family (who buried him as a \\"her\\" with female descriptions.) Makes me sick to my stomach..... I was looking for an ACCURATE account....."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Brandon Teena, not Teena Brandon","review":"Many people are referring to Brandon Teena as 'her' as does the author throughout her book. It's clear by doing a little bit of reaseach Brandon preferred male pronouns. People are also to comparing this book to Boys Don't Cry. Boys Don't Cry is not a documentary, it's a work BASED on actual events. That means that it does not follow the actual events of Brandon's life in Falls City, the creators had the freedom to add and subtract details and facts. If you want a good documentary about the life and death of Brandon Teena try The Brandon Teena Story."},{"rating":"2","title":"All She Wanted is a Fascinating and Deep look at Brandon","review":"I knew so little of the facts about this story until I read the book All She Wanted. Aphrodite Jones gives vivid details of the lives of Brandon and all those involved in his life and those who murdered her and Lisa and Phil. You feel as though you can hear the people talking and you sympathize for Brandon because of the agony he must have been enduring.

Did Aphrodite Jones have an editor? Was this book proofread? There are so many grammatical and punctuation errors; I can't believe that this book made it to print. Jones writes as if she is trying to hold the attention of your average eight grader. This book contains every cliche ever invented; it is insulting to the readers' collective intelligence to read this horrendous writing. In Jones' introduction, she endlessly praises herself as if she has written a Pulitzer Prize winning novel. The only saving grace is the subject material.

This book sorely needs both copyediting and proofreading. Jones includes too many dull details of peripheral characters and events that do not propel the story forward. Also, there is an appalling number of spelling and grammatical errors. A reader should expect that the purchase price of a book includes the publisher having made the book readable and free of silly errors. The life and untimely death of Brandon Teena are fodder for a fascinating study of human nature. It's unfortunate that Jones did not exhibit any depth or insight whatsoever. This book is a huge disappointment on many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better articles in Parade magazine","review":"The book is terrible. Terribly written and terribly edited, not to mention horribly researched.

But this book doesn't even seem to make an effort at being correct...one minute Teena's grandmother is called Francis, the next she's called Frances, the next she's called Francis again.

I have given lectures on masculinity and assertiveness skills for over five years and this book is by far the strongest of all. It permits a man to feel his masculine power as a trueFire in the Belly: On Being a Manas the great Sam Keen would put it, without resorting to any \\"macho jerk\\" type cop outs.

Then they belittle people who \\"behave that way,\\" attracting the respect of judgmental readers who love to share criticisms of third parties.Maybe in some ways the faulted behavior can be situationally appropriate. This possibility is never raised. I lost patience with the book after 30 something pages and flipped through the rest of it. The writer enables a critical audience to reinforce essentially irrational negative thoughts about people. Why should anyone be surprised to find the victims of that criticism responding to its irrationality in ways the critic does not want to hear?Some people will disagree with me, but that's because they like to be told they're oppositional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraught With Contradiction","review":"I was absolutely astounded that so many absolutely horrible ideas could be packed into one book.

By the time I finished, I was seriously pissed off.There were a few good ideas here and there, but it seemed only a few pages later that you'd read as strong an assertion to the contrary. And if you take out all the references to pop culture and old movies, you'd be left with about half as much book.

The entire first half of the book repeatedly refers to the bible as a book of myths and then draws its conclusions based on that position.

Personally, I like the \\"all the different theories fit together\\" feeling it gives.I would not say that this is a self-help book.

It really soothes and makes the pain of her arthritis go away and makes her life more livable. We gave the other jar to another person with similar pain and they experienced the same relief. After trying so many products that do not work well or do not work at all, this is truly a great find!

No one likes change but the shift from Sherona to Natalie offered a new perspective. Although I liked the cast the way it was; Sherona had a slight trashiness to her, comparatively, Natalie offers more of a sweet wholesomeness. Monk also seems a little less needy to Natalie, if you notice he is less trepid and more open to change 'as far as Monk is concerned' after the switch. I am still an endearing fan and will continue to be so. Like when your favorite football team has not made it to the play-offs in years, are you any less supportive and switch to the winning team of the year. If so, you are not a true fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always good for a great laugh","review":"A friend of mine gave me season two as a gift.

The first episodes are still brilliant but the changes in cast and writing in the second half on the season change the show dramatically. The replacement of Sharona is inexcusable and Natalie Treager can't fill Bitty's shoes acting or chararcter wise, but the writing has suffered as well. The mysteries have become second rate and watered-down and the writing as a whole has become less clever and more hokey. The bizarre episodes without the Captain and Lt. are weird and leave you questioning whether this is really the same show. Hopefully for season four they have brought the writing back to par or it will be a miss in my book. A monk fan will appreciate this DVD especially for the first half but the second will not make a monk fan out of someone who hasn't seen the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monk Season 3","review":"Came quickly and plays perfectly.

It seems that his personal love life is put on hold. I predict that Natalie will be the love interest of Monk later on. It's a classic story that's been done-Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Moonlighting. I love Sharonna's fiery personality but it didn't seem fit that she would stay there longer when many audience wants to find out if Monk will ever fall in love again and Natalie sure fits the bill. But first, the producers and writers will solve the murder case of his wife then some kind of chemistry will happen between Adrien Monk and Natalie.

The picture quality is terrible (so grainy!!!)and the DVDs are individually packaged rather than being part of an attractive and sturdy fold-out case.

Unfortunately out of the thousands of stories to choose from they picked the dregs from some of the best writers (Ellroy, Goodis, Thompson, ..), and the best from a great many (deservedly) unknown writers. It took me a long time to slog through the dozens of stories contained in this volume.However the only positve aspect of the book are the commentaries before each story, giving a bit of background on each author and their placement in the history of 'hard-boiled' short fiction. Clearly Pronzini/Adrian have done their homework in this regard. But this only made me more frustrated with the all the mediocre stories they amassed.Bottom line: a missed opportunity.

I learned something minor about this-- had tried another compact hub before (Targus) assuming that when it said \\"FullSpeed\\" it mean 2.0 compatible. \\"FullSpeed\\" refers to the faster capacity of USB 1-- To get 2.0 compatibility the hub needs to say 2.0 compatible or High Speed.

If you plan to put a USB Flash memory drive on one of the ports, the heat from the LED can heat up the flash drive and fry its memory. It happened to this author.

She was not able to make the animals sound by themselves, but she played with them anyways. Both of us loved the water mat; although you do have to change the water in it frequently. She did become disinterester when you turn it into a cone shape, but we got our moneys worth out of the playmat value alone. This was actually a toy that i did not want to part with.

She was immediately bored with all the other activities - couldn't make the animal sounds herself, didn't care much about the small water area (we had another larger water mat that cost $6 from walmart!!). I thought this would be such a cute, fun toy, but nope. I ended up giving it away to a friend when I was pregnant with my second daughter, and haven't regretted it for a minute!

The fish pond segment looked like it could have been a lot of fun, but I too never managed to fill it with water. Lastly, my son did enjoy the three round shapes which mooed, etc. However, yesterday our baby was gnawing on the red cow shape for ten minutes or so, and when my wife took it away from him, the red dye had run and completely ruined his shirt. Now, we're not only out 40-some dollars for this completely useless toy, but his shirt is ruined as well.

The fish pond sprang a leak within two months of use and so we are unable to use it now. Also, each time one of the velcro shapes is pulled off the toy, it causes the entire mat to be lifted off the ground and causing it to twist and bend.

He is only 6 months, so perhaps he will find it more interesting in the future (my 3 year old played with it for a little while). As far as filling the fish tank goes, there is a very small slit on the side of the inside of the valve. You have to hold that small slit open to fill the tank. It is hard to do, but it is possible.

(And yes folks, I managed to fill the fish pond, only to discover later that it leaked out all over the rug.)

She would only look at a few of the forms but after a couple of months, she didn't want to have anything to do w/ it. From a parent's perspective, I didn't like it for these reasons: 1. it's very difficult to fill and drain the fish \\"tank\\". you have to squeeze the opening so hard that my fingers would hurt. also, the plastic started to leak water after about 5 times of use. 2. the chicken stopped croaking after 2 months of use. 3. in the funnel position, it wouldn't hold up, so you could never \\"throw\\" the ball into it.

Well, I had my baby in what I thought was a kid friendly safe area while I was cooking dinner. That was until my baby threw up and in the middle of his puke was a piece of that PLASTIC-PAPER sticker.

Otherwise, works as advertised and confirms another test kit we use as our go to measurement tool (it uses titration of a solution to more accurately determine pH and has an interval of 0.2 between 6 and a bit under 9.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use & read","review":"Not much to say, they're easy to read and they do the job. Just make sure you don't jiggle the strip as you pull it out of the water since that can throw the reading way off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leisure Time test strips are great.","review":"These worked the same as the more expensive brands, they worked great and cost less! What more can I say. Buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have ordered this product before...","review":"We have always bought these Test Strips for our hot tub. Imagine my disappointment when I finally opened the package today and found that the bottom says 'bromine'. NOTHING in the description stated this and I clicked on the strips in my Amazon History that I purchased in November 2011 for 45010 Chlorine Test Strips. They may work the same but the color chart is harder to read than the original ones. Disappointed. Not sure where we went wrong this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good indicator of PH","review":"This is the second \\"strip\\" tester I have tried after running out of ones I received with the spa. The PH reading is not accurate and does not give you an accurate enough indication of PH level. I find that I must use the test kit now instead of being able to rely on these. Do not buy these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Geological History","review":"The descriptions of how the islands were built and of the influence of their structure on their variations in climate are very interesting. This book is not a quick easy read but the geological section is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning Tool","review":"My daughter is three months old and loves to play on this mat. I took some of the hanging toys off because there too many. Now I just put up a couple at a time and change them out every few days for variety. The activity mat is fun and colorful and there are lots of educational phases. My favorite feature is that it folds over and snaps making it flat for easy storage. And the arches can be removed as well if you want just the mat. The part that lights up and sings is also removable.I would highly recommend this product :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"On April 23,2002 I became a first time Grandmother. When my new Grandson was only 4 days old, his Aunt bought him the Gymini 3-D Activity Gym. I was a little sceptical that a newborn would be able to benefit from such a product but from day one he literally would respond to the busy pattern as he tried to focus on the many hanging objects. Playing on the Gymini mat has since become one of his favorite activities. I have no doubt that he is being intellectually stimulated by this fantastic product and I highly recommend it to anyone with a newborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this priced so high at Amazon?","review":"Why, oh why, is Amazon selling this for $99 when most retailers (Walmart, et.c) carry it for about $40? Am I missing something? It's only the deluxe versions of this simple model that run above $60...."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked!","review":"It worked like I wanted it to. Problem is that he didn't like it at first. He also doesn't like the music it plays. Other than that, he's totally mesmerized by the colors. Keeps my High Need baby perfectly content for at least 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the baby and for me","review":"My baby started enjoying his gymini when he was about a month and a half old. He has so much fun in there! I sit next to him while he bats at the toys, grabs them, or just looks at them. I climbed in under there with him one day just to see what he was looking at, which he thought was hilarious. Great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great toy.","review":"My son loves his Gymini. Like other parents, I added other toys, and even though he has outgrown the Gymini, he still loves the toys from it. Especially the worm rattle. It is also durable & easy to clean. And extreemly portable. I have bought one for every friend and family memeber that has had a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Active Baby","review":"My child has never been interested in this color combination, and the toy she enjoyed the most on this gym, the mirror toy, she out grew in 3 weeks. Also the musical toy is hard to operate. She has been turning over since she was 3 months old so by the time she could reach the toys and play with them, 4 months, she prefered to be on her stomach crawling. This mat is too small for her to crawl on. If you have an active baby who doesn't like to be on her back or one who crawls early, get something else like the 1-2-3 Discovery Lane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep them playing","review":"My daughter is 4 months old now and this has been her favorite. She loves to grab hold of the toys and scream. I can lay her down and she usually ends up falling asleep after she is finished playing. We have a two year old and it has helped me keep her entertained while I play with my son. I highly recommend this toy. We didn't have one when my son was born and I'm sorry I didn't go out and get it back then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Okay, nothing to write home about. Baby did not stay in it long enough to enjoy it. I think it bored him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!!","review":"I bought Tiny Love Gymini when my daughter was 3 weeks old. She was intimidated by the colours in the beginning but soon she began to enjoy playing in it. She occasionally would go to sleep in the gymini. She is 8 months old now & still loves the gymini. I would definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red, white, black and fun!","review":"My baby loved this play-mat for the first six months of her life. She liked to study the hanging toys and, as she got older, learned to reach for them and bat them about with her tiny hand. The musical flower was a particular favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haley LOVES this item!","review":"I registered for this Gymini and received it as a shower gift--it has been one of the most used \\"toys\\" by my baby girl, Haley. She's 5 months now and still gets a kick out of it. It super-easy to fold up and take with us to Grandma's house, too. Tiny Love makes great activity toys for babies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baby Gift!","review":"I bought the Gymini for my daughter 8 yrs ago and have registered for the same one this time around. My daughter smiled at 2 wks and continued to coo and laugh weeks after. The colors stimulateand develop baby's brain since those are the only colors they are attracted to in the early months. Definitely worth the money even if they lose interest when your baby gets older. It's really meant for newborns and up to 5-6mths. That's about when they discover other colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL FOR BABY!!!","review":"We got this for our baby when she was a ocuple weeks old, and we would put her on it everyday for a half hour or so and she LOVED it. She would just stare at the toys in total amuzement. She is 7 months old and is getting bored of it because she would rather be rolling around and sitting-up. This was a great toy to buy for our baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST","review":"Definitely be sure you have one of these........it got me through my child's infancy. He used it up until about 8 months old."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"My son is now 6 months and used this all of maybe 2 weeks. My friend had the Gymini Super Deluxe Light and Music and while over there one day we put him on it and he loved it! They grow out of the blk and white quickly and need color. He's never even liked the hanging toys that come with this even hanging from the Super Deluxe, which we tried. He never paid them any attention. He's still playing on the Super Deluxe once in a while. This one has nothing for them to play with once they get good on their tummy either. Spend the extra money and get something that will interest your baby for 6-8 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"three kids and still going","review":"We were given this mat second hand from a friend. Both of her boys used it and now our daughter is having fun with it. We first laid her on it at about 4 weeks. She liked the black & white arches and would stare at them for a while. Now she is 4 months and she bats at the toys and likes to look at the patterns while she's on her tummy. It folds up nicely for trips also. I don't know if I would have paid full price since you really only get about 6 months use out of it. It would be a good thing to keep at grandparents' for all the grandkids."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll use it every day","review":"This toy grew with our son and kept him interested. He's not as interested in it anymore now that he is almost 6 months, but we definitely got our use out of it. It packed great too, in a big suitcase, so we were able to bring it on vacations. Ours didn't come with the octopus, but we bought that extra it was what our son loved most to grab and stick in his mouth - I highly recommend adding that piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits my Toy description list- great toy","review":"I look for toys that are versatile, fun, encourage exploration and creativity. I look for toys that do more than just let the child push a button. This toy fits most of my expectations in a toy.I particularly like how you can contact tinylove for replacements- if the music stops playing, contact them and they will replace the flower at no cost to you. Very nice.This washes well, folds up easily and is as versatile as you make it. You can switch toys around and put other toys up on the hooks. I like that. It is easy to take places because it folds up- the blanket part on the bottom makes it fun to take to the park.My only comment would be that you can get other toys that hang over the baby for a little bit less money. However, you do not get the quality assurance, replacement parts, and versatility that you do with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful product","review":"I had registered for the Carters butterfly playgym and recieved this one as a gift also. I'm very glad I did because while the other one is very nice, this play gym is far superior for stimulation (It definitely hold my daughters attention for longer period of time). She just loves it. The accompanying toys are very interesting and each one has something special to offer. An added benefit is that it is easier to fold for travel - this is the one I bring with us when we visit friends or relatives. The arches can be moved out of sight easily as well in case she gets overstimulated or needs a nap.I would definitely recommend both gyms (can't have too many of these!), but the Tiny Love gym is the better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"toy\\" for newborns/ infants...","review":"My daughter is not quit 4 weeks old yet, but the is her first \\"toy\\" (she doesn't really play w/ anything yet.) We didn't buy one of these w/ our 1st daughter because it wasn't pretty to me, eventhough many people say infants love the contrast of black and white.Our new daughter was constantly staring at our white walls w/ my husbands red and black guitar hanging on the wall. So we decided she would probably like this product. She does. Although I agree it's a little pricy, it's worth it. Really if she only uses it for 3 month, that's only 10 dollars a month, which isn't that bad.It has a mirror hanging from it, and you can take the links from the other toys and interchange them to make the toys hang short or long. She likes to look at herself already!It's also good for tummy time, since the mat has black and white design too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter Loves It!","review":"My daughter is 2 months old and has loved to play with the Gymni for weeks already. At first she just loved looking at the hanging toys, but now she has started to bat at them. I highly recommend this toy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need this for the early months","review":"We have twins and bought 2 different activity mats and this one was great. We were able to put different toys on the cross bars and change the visual keeping the babies interested. They learned very quickly how to reach and grasp at what they wanted and I was able to have them entertained (and learning about their world) for a short time without having to hold them continually. Having twins meant one had to be put down often in order to take care of a need with the other and this toy was a must for keeping them happy while doing that. While the colorful mats caught my interest, the babies loved this black, white, and red model the best. I used this until 9-10 months old when they started to \\"toddle\\" around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not truly washable!","review":"Overall I like this gym. I like the B&W contrast that stimulates babies. However I was so disappointed when I washed it(per manufacturer instructions) and it FADED!! It is now a very washed out black, not the strong contrast it was before. If I had know that would happen I would have been more careful not to get it dirty!As for entertainment, it holds my daughter's interest for a little while, but she's only 3 months, so I don't expect miracles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a while (!!!) . . . but becomes a bore.","review":"For the first few months after my baby brother was born, he loved to look at the red, black, and white colors. Soon enough he could hit the hanging toys and kick and bite at the (as he thought) interesting material. But after a while, the song didn't make him laugh as much and the toys became a bore to hit. He still plays on it, don't get my wrong, but I have to put other toys on the mat to keep him occupied. I'll put him on his stomach sometimes and let him try to comprehend what is going on in the television, but that is about all he likes to do now. I don't think I'd recomend this toy to anyone just because after awhile, children get sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"second time around . . . .","review":"I received a Gymini for my toddler when he was a newborn. He wasn't crazy about it--he was a VERY high-need infant and just not all that interested in being put down when he was awake. I am happy to report that not only is his new brother obsessed with black and white patterns and dangly toys, but my toddler now loves to \\"hide\\" in his Gymini tent (we put a table cloth over it). He also enjoys swash-buckling with the dome-poles, but we try to keep that to a minimum. (Hey, at least they're soft!)My new little guy also enjoys his Lamaze crib panel, but his true love is the brass-trimmed lighting fixture in our living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"A newborn may enjoy black, white and red, however, ours didn't. This play mat is boring. Our son didn't respond to it at all. We thought maybe he was too young at one month, but when we placed him under the Baby Einstein one, he went crazy with smiles. This play gym doesn't come with many fun toys, and isn't worth the money in my opinion. Save your money on this product and go for the best one...baby einstein!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sick to death of black white and RED!","review":"Okay, I know they're supposed to be stimulating to a newborn, but newborns can't really even see that well at first. When i put my triplets on this, they liked it okay for a while, but after a few months they liked my other playmat, that has jungle animals way more. I get sick of baby gear that is an eyesore, and this is. My kids would stare at the lion and stuff on their mats when they got older, and I like having something more cheerful and not as depressing around.The playgym itself gets 5 stars, I have no problem with the way it works. I just hate black white and red!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hhhmmm... it's OK","review":"I had a Fisher-Price version on these playmats which I gave 5 stars.http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Songs-Smiles-Discovery-Gym/dp/B000OONJBO/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleIt was really great and colorful and came with a heap of hanging toys and a mirrored, music-playing dog.After lending it to a friend and getting it back bent out of shape my hubby bought this one as a last minute xmas gift for our Baby #2. It was the only one in the store he had ducked into. It only has 3 hanging toys. Every other similar playmat has heaps of toys and most have music and lights as well. My main dislike of this one is that the arches are quite low, lower than the Fisher-Price one, so it seems like the toys are right in Baby's face. Other than those deficiencies, the mat is reasonably padded and the material is soft, not silky but soft enough. I would not recommend this to anyone but I do recommend the Fisher-Price one."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby loves this!","review":"This is one of my baby's favourite places to play. Since she was a few weeks old she has loved to lay and look at the toys, and the black, white, and red colours really keep her attention. The only thing I would wish were different is that the musical toy would play constantly!! It only lasts a few seconds.I purchased a larger rectangular mirror and tied it to one of the extra plastic loops, and my baby loves to look at herself in the mirror. The mirror provided does not really reflect much. Since it folds flat, we are taking it away with us at the holidays - it will be great entertainment for our baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Toy We Purchased Yet!","review":"This is a fantastic item! Initially placing too many toys was overstimulating. At first our son could only tolerate lying down and looking at the black and white lines and dots. As he became less sensitive we were able to hang up some toys. This toy is great for improving his attention, vision, and coordination of his arms and legs. He always plays with this toy after every feeding/nap. We would highly recommend this item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is wonderful","review":"I wanted to get something just to keep my son occupied when he was too little for the walker. He now is old enough to sit up and roll over but he still loves to roll under his 3d gym. He gets so happy when I put him under it. I just wish there was a larger mt for him to play on with the same picture on it. He really loves the black, white, and red bears and clown scene. I only hope that he doesn't get mad when he is too big for it. He's almost at that point now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy that can be used in many ways!","review":"My Mother in Law bought this for our twin boys at birth. They loved staring at the toys and such as newborns, they were very much engrossed in watching them. As they got older, I took the toys off of the bars (easily done!) and attached it to their stroller when we went out and about. They loved the toys and being able to still play with them. I loved how it kept them entertained. They especially enjoyed the mirror with the ball inside that makes noise. Seeing themselves in it amused them very much!We used this item and it's toys for many months. It is still in wonderful condition and we are going to use it for our daughter that is due this August. The mat is easily washable in the washer as well! Loved that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby really enjoys this!","review":"This is a great toy for babies! My little one really enjoys looking at the toys, and I like the toys that came with it. (Plus, there's room to hang other ones, which is nice). This fits in the full-size bassinet of her playard, so that's really convenient and makes her playard more fun for her. The only \\"con\\" to this item is that the mat fades out very quickly from washing. If it weren't for that, I would have rated it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too great.","review":"My daughter wasn't really interested in this toy. She's nine months, and she still ignores it. I think she only enjoyed it for two or three days when she was five months old. The individual toys are great, though. Just buy the toys and forget the mat. You can also hang them on your bouncer."},{"rating":"2","title":"the single best toy for babies","review":"this toy was the best item i had for my twins. I could put one in there while nursing the other and know that it was educational and fun too. make sure to buy an extra set of rings. most of your rattles and small stuffed toys will have loops or other means of attachment so you can rotate toys to keep baby's interest. Incredibly durable - we used it as a crawl through tunnel when the babies were older and crawling by draping a crib blanket over the top (well supervised, of course) and got another 5 months of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Favorite Toy","review":"This was my son's favorite toy as an infant.

Easy to add additional toys. Probably the best toy we owned for the young infant stage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best investment in infant entertainment/development","review":"I LOVE THIS TOY AND SO DOES MY SON!! I bought this when he was 10 weeks old. At first he liked looking at the black & white patterns (he would follow me with his eyes as I carried past him). Within a couple of weeks he started getting the hang of it. He gets so excited now batting at the toys and his little legs kick with excitement. This is excellent for tummy time too (and might offer him the incentive to roll over to play with the toys overhead as it did for my guy). EXCELLENT CHOICE - WELL WORTH THE $$!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"This item is a must have for newborns. My son loves this toy. He is 3 1/2 months and it is still his favorite.

He is 3 months now and continues to enjoy it. It is so easy to change and add different toys (I really recommend the Tiny Love Wind Chime kick toy).

Wrong for our baby! She showed NO interest in this gym, I tried adding more toys (because for the price it does come with VERY FEW), moving the bars up and down to make the toys \\"dance\\", all to no avail. She hates this thing, I would recommend instead the Tiny Love Deluxe Gymini with Lights and Music, or one of the Fisher Price Kick type gyms.

Which made housework so easy for me because she was very happy under her play gym. Great toy and I recommend it for any newborn.

The standard controller always forced me to use full throttle and max brakes.I hated other wheels, but this one has a 900 degree spin, and auto centers just like a real car.Here are the problems:The shift knob is too close to the wheel, but the paddle shifters are more convenient anyway.The wires are a little too short.The wheel is a little too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Driving Force Wheel","review":"Great wheel for Play Station and PC gaming. Force feedback is better than the MOMO, but overall comfort of the wheel and control layout is not as good. The shifter is very easy to accidentally bump, or shift up and down when you go to grab a gear. I liked the MOMO wheel far better, but the force feedback effects had all but disappeared over the years I owned it. If you want a good wheel to move between PC and Play Station, this wheel is a great high quality, low cost choice. Force feedback is very powerful, and realistic when you get it set up correctly. Keep in mind that quite few games require reversing the feedback effects, or entering a negative values in order for the wheel to work properly. I think Logitech could do a better job of promoting the wheel for use on the PC, it really wasn't clear to me when I made the purchase, but was very happy to find it actually works great on the computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly Enhances The Gran Turismo Experience","review":"First off, I have read many reviews on this product.Yes the learning curve is a little steep at first, but I've devised a tip for this.

For those of us who can't wait and want some real information on what's taking place and how we can help, this book is completely useless.It also seems to be written from another time and place in some imagined history. Advising us not to drink in front of our wives, not to look at other women or to comment on her weight. We're actually given such gems as to hide the liquor until after the baby arrives - just in case she can't control herself in private, and to ask that gentleman at the bar to not smoke in front of your wife!There are a few descent tips but your time would be better spent on another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too much","review":"This little book is amusing enough, but my husband found it sexist.

Barron's frank (some would say blunt) look at pregnancy through a man's eyes was soooooo refreshing. I was so happy to have found a book that would clue my hubby into what was going on without being preachy or boring. Sure, there are \\"woman generalizations,\\" but it's lets the reader in on an honest look at pregancy, which was a welcome change from other books geared toward daddy to be's.

This was the third or so similar book I had read that claimed this, so I'm not so sure this is an accurate claim.Even if I choose to believe the author wrote this in good faith, I found it juvenile and condescending. There is little useful information within, and I found much of the information purely subjective (or misleading) and therefore useless for the most part. There are MANY better books out there for the father to be, that treat you as an adult (for example, see Curtis and Schuler).The humour in this book is premeditated, and many of the little anecdotes seem to be designed to prove the manhood of the father to the reader (although it comes off quite neurotic).Good points: It is short (although I wish I had that hour of my life back)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its horrible!!!","review":"This book was absolutely horrible.

I definitely don't suggest wasting your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The reviews both by the author and other readers make this sound like a humorous and witty book. I, however, was offended by some of the insensitive and profane humor. There are other books available that make light of the sometimes tense but often wonderous experience of pregnancy without debasing either of the future parents. It certainly didn't teach me anything and I was embarrassed to share some of it with my partner. This is not a book to be proud of owning. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"If you are a first time father to be and have absolutely no inkling of sensitivity towards your wife and no clue what pregnancy is all about, then maybe you should get this book, but do yourself a favor and check it out from the library.

This is mostly a Steely Dan record and sets the stage for the masterpiece \\"Two Against Nature.\\" Lots of great sideman appear on this one, and it is very slickly produced by sidekick Walter Becker. I like the clean sound, especially in songs like Snowbound and Florida Room. When I first got the cassette almost 20 years ago, I couldn't stop playing it and made myself tire of it. Reordered it and after all these years its still fresh. \\"A virus wearing pumps and pearls\\" what a great line. If you like your rock smooth and jazzy: Check it out, its worth the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fantastic!","review":"I just saw Steely Dan in concert and they are as good as ever!

I think \\"Kamakiriad\\" is only a mediocre follow-up to the great \\"Nightfly\\" and isn't worth the press-hype at all. It suffers from songs that sound far too similar, and especially the nerve-rackingly sharp drums aren't varied. The arrangements are too overloaden, and the songs are cold, hectic and sterile. Certainly I feel that there's a lot of work and perfectionism in this record, but there also should be a minimum of humanity in these futuristic surroundings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Isn't Steely Dan, But It's Still Okay!","review":"When I first got this CD I thought it was quite good. Actually, the more I listened to it the less I liked it. Maybe, it was just what I was going through at the time...But, I listened to it again recently and only really like 3 songs.

Save your money and buy Aja, The Royal Scam, or about anything else from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Steely Dan and the Nightfly","review":"This was really an awful effort by Donald Fagen. The once brilliant composer/arranger/vocalist fails to present any inspired material on this disc. There is a monotony and reduncancy to the material that eventually leaves the listener disinterested. The musicianship is also sub-standard. The drums in particular are stiff and annoying. On Nightfly and previous Steely Dan efforts Fagen (and Becker) were wise enough to surround themselves with the finest (mostly L.A.)musicians. Pity they didn't invest a little more effort in recruiting here. Give this one a miss, stick with Steely Dan, and the Nightfly...Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lesser Known Donald Fagen","review":"Nobody doesn't like this CD.If you're driving from Maine to LA - this is ONE of the CDs you gotta have..Show up to the next great party with this as the undiscovered gem and every one will think you're quite the audiophile.This CD is every bit AS GOOD as Nightfly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donald Fagen Establishes Himslef as a Solo Artist","review":"The secind installemnt if the Travel Trilogy, Fagen with the help of producer and Steely Dan mate Walter Becker expolres new arrangments in Fusion.

Sophisticated engineering and mastering by Becker make for an almost Steely Dan experience, but it's more than just that. It's truly a work of art. Fagen's imagination drives you to unknown destinations. Another audiophile must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a couple of classics but well-done nonetheless","review":"This album, the sophomore effort by Steely Dan alum Fagen, is not nearly as enjoyable asThe Nightfly(his first effort) but there are a couple of flashes of brilliance on this album; Snowbound and On The Dunes are truly great songs that strike deep. Springtime, Tomorrow's Girls and Florida Room are most definitely enjoyable. The remaining 3 songs are good listening, especially if you are a danfan, but they lack that special something that I have grown accustomed to hearing when I listen to Fagen, Becker or Steely Dan.Overall, a good album and a must have for any Steely Dan fan; Nightfly would have been hard to beat, so I cannot really take away from Fagen on this album, but rather just state that he set the bar a little too high on his first outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO L.A!!!!!!!","review":"THE BEST DONALD FAGEN EVER WROTE!

I can't recommend it highly enough.Unfortunately, Return to Eden (and to a similar extent, Winter in Eden) isn't anywhere near as interesting a book. The story, while well written, just doesn't go anywhere. It seems to me as if Kerrick and the other humans do a lot of wandering around around the continent, and the Yilane spend a lot of time talking rudely to one another. Though the prose is excellent, the content reads like C-Span."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Muddle","review":"Illich is faced with a problem. He deplores modern civilization as dehumanizing but recognizes only subsstence existence as an alternative. Unfortunately subsistence existence and other historically based cultures prensent strongly based sex roles. This flies in the face of feminism which denies the value of culurally defined sex roles and thus denies the values of Illich's ideal culture. Since feminism is a powerful political force, Illich must find a way to make his views compatible with it.Illich overcomes this by defining modern sexual roles as sexist but historical cultural roles as gendered This is the book. He overcomes the challenge to his ideal by a linguistic definition. His history of social roles is spotty and biased to prove his point.The book is a sophistic muddle. Mnay many better books that the social history of the home are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for effort","review":"I read about a third of it and then quit. I couldn't keep track of the characters or what was even going on. Ullman wanted to give us a character portrayal, but what she gave us was a jumbled mess.

While reading, I found myself thinking constantly: what's the author's point? I also did not really like the way the author jumps from one event to another without a real time-logic. Often the author gets lost in describing lots of details, too many for a reader that has not really a clear idea what is the point of the narrator. There are some good ideas but they get lost in a sea of words and non-sense. All this makes the reading from interesting to real slow and boring. It never took me so long to read a book and I have to confess that I had a hard time in finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I gave this book a shot, but by the end I was too confused and tired to care what happened to the characters. The deception, rambling, and exaggeration proved to be too much for my little mind to take. In some ways I guess it was stimulating (since I spent so much time struggling over whether I should believe the narrator), but not in a way that I found particularly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of a family","review":"This book took me several pages to get involved, but the story kept pulling me along to discover what was going to happen next. A typical dysfunctional family, most people will be able to relate to this wacky group. Through a sort of stream of consciousness writing style, Ullmann does a beautiful job describing a variety of intricate, intimate family scenes, from a wedding to their drinking habits. This is a good absorbing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody and atmospheric","review":"I can't say that I've ever seen an Ingmar Bergman film, but I've often heard them described as cold and sterile, bleak and despairing. If those words truly describe Bergman's style, then we can safely say that his daughter successfully captured on page what her parents captured before her on film.Our narrator, Karin, tells her family's story in a bluntly honest way. Hardships are neither embellished nor glossed over; they are what they are. Ullman's prose is spare and almost harsh, like the landscape of her heritage. You don't feel as though you're entering her world as you read, it's more as though it's being shown to you from a distance. This makes for a very absorbing read, though not necessarily an enjoyable one. The story told in BEFORE YOU SLEEP story is not happy, nor terribly plot driven, but if you're looking more for atmosphere than story, you won't go wrong reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good debut book","review":"I would encourage anyone who is interested in Scandinavia - to grab this book as soon as possible.

Here is strong meat and good medicine for our cynical times. By singing cynically about the ups and downs and low-balling empty materialism, fragile failings and triumphs of our collective human nature in our day, the Dan 'do it again.' If you have to ask why, don't bother. If you cannot figure out the lyrics, buy something else. 'Gaslighting Abbie' is brillant [cut 1]...'Janie Runaway' [cut 4] is brazenly sneaky & seductive...'What A Shame About Me' [cut 2] is introspective brokenness with ironic nobility ...'Cousin Dupree' [cut 7] is incredibly & interestingly bodacious.

When I first heard Steely Dan in the early 70's, their sound seemed far ahead of it's time. Amazingly, they still can capture audiences of all types because of the diversification of the music. This is a masterpiece, from the funky beat of Two Against Nature blending with the soulful Jack of Speed to form a complete package. Buy it now, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Against Nature","review":"Steely Dan's harmonies, great lyrics, and tight musicianship are still kicking in this new and inventive CD, which isn't a re-run of their earlier stuff. It just gets better and better the more you listen to it. If you're stuck in the 70's and are looking for top-ten-type hits, then maybe this isn't for you, as the intelligence of jazz is present. As far as musicianship goes, check out the personnel on these tracks: Vinnie Colaiuta, Lou Marini, Gordon Gottleib, and Chris Potter, whose tenor solo on West of Hollywood is amazingly outrageous, modulating all over the place, and so descriptive of that driving, frenzied-but-cool energy that is LA.

I first saw them perform tunes from 2vN on a PBS special. Needless to say, it's classic Steely Dan at its core, but it has a much jazzier and perhaps softer overtone.

Okay, so we learn that Don and Walt are not perfect and neither are the rest of the bandmembers or the editor or the cameraman, but the whole package is just so entertaining and the music sounds so great (in surround 5.1) as a whole that it makes me swing in my chair every time I listen to it. And that for a guitarplayer who is nicknamed \\"the Sphinx\\". I also like the interviews in between songs and anyone who says otherwise just doesn't get it.Most of the \\"old songs\\" are played with more groove then ever. especially \\"Black Friday\\" and \\"Green Earrings\\".Again; Wathing this DVD and listening to its music just lifts me up !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Becker and Fagen return with a vengeance","review":"One almost wonders what to expect when a 70s group presents a new album.

Yes, the 70s trademark Fagen/Becker sound is there, but the jazz riffs and intricate rhythm patterns are some of the finest you will hear of any album released in 2000. Best of all, their off-the-wall, sly-wink lyrics are better than ever.There really isn't a bad cut on this whole album.

There are so many good things to say about Steely's ability to remain air-tight, maintain their trademark flavor, without ever sounding like they had to \\"recapture the feel\\". If you want to talk about a band that embarrassed themselves by trying to regain their old flavor, try \\"Yes\\" or \\"Pink Floyd\\"! Listen to all these bands, and their \\"return to the ring\\" albums... Realize that Steely is a band for adults. The other guys get tired because they are geared toward day-glo teens, not savvy adults. \\"We don't need no education...\\" hardly cuts it as intelligent lyrics to any listener over the age of 17!Listen to \\"Two against Nature\\", kids, when you grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Disappointed - Too long a wait for too little","review":"Back in 1996 while on tour Fagen commented about the upcoming CD, and how they hoped to \\"finish it before we die\\". Well three plus years later they are still alive and the Two Against Nature result is a mild disappointment of this 30 year Dan fan. I can only guess now that the 4 years spent making this CD is a result of lack of inspiration for Donald & Walter, and it became a \\"lets just get it over with\\"! With the exception of but a couple tracks, the CD for me is quickly forgetable, and destined to collect dust rather than be dusted off and played again & again like that of Aja, Gaucho, and Fagen's masterpiece Kamakiriad. Such a disappointment is this that even the upcoming tour holds no interest now...especially after their lackluster performance at the Gorge in 1996.

I do have a few suggestions: Add Larry Carlton as the 3rd permanent member of Steely Dan; Keep Walter Becker's guitar playing restricted to rhythm parts; Hire a real bass player; Give the drummers some air that the grooves become deeper and more intense; Hire the same horn section (they are doing an excellent job on this album) and hire Gary Katz and Genji Siraisi as producers for the next album that we are hopefully more thrilled the next time an SD album comes out.

They release a album, \\"2 Against Nature\\". This superb album kicks of with \\"Gaslighting Abbie\\" a tale of fire works and solitare. They come at you next with \\"What a Shame About Me\\", one of the best Dan songs ever. \\"Janie Runaway\\" is also a incredible song. The best song is track 7, \\"Cousin Dupree\\", a song Steely Dans calls a \\"country narative\\". Every song is great, \\"2 against nature\\" is my least favorite track, but all the songs have excellent music, but what makes this album so superb is the lyrics, lyrics of gold.

Having said that, this album is a continuation of the style found on \\"Gaucho\\" as opposed to the funkier, less slickly produced \\"Aja.\\" My only complaint is that \\"Two Against Nature\\" doesn't \\"rock\\" or \\"funk\\" as much as some of the Dan's older albums.Still, a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope for better","review":"With a new Steely Dan CD due this summer, it probably isn't worth expending energy to pan their last one. But as a hard-core fan for almost 30 years (scary) I found this effort to be tedious and predictable. To my ears, they wrapped their sound around itself to where there was little left to distinguish each song. Every trademark Steely Dan element -- memorable guitar solos, snappy horn arrangements, clever melodic hooks, oblique lyrics -- is a weak imitation of former works. I look forward to the new CD since I wouldn't want this to be the capstone to a brilliant catalog of works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better Part 2","review":"My original review \\"Could Have Been Better\\" gave this DVD three stars.

We should expect all concert DVD's (filmed currently and in the future) to show the entire uninterrupted show, multiple camera angles, good sound in 5.1 & stereo, clear video, with interviews and other \\"filler material\\" as extras and not put between songs.The only thing that redeems this DVD, besides the band, is the audio during the \\"concert footage\\".

I was 11 when their last Studio album \\"Gaucho\\" came out, and 31 when \\"Two Against Nature\\" was released. Between those years, Steely Dan was always the most unique, sensual, well-crafted, melodic and most harmonic band I have known. Two Against Nature continues in the classic Steely Dan tradition.

The remaining song is certainly not up to classic S.D. standards, and is not good enough to carry this lame album.Disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta buy this","review":"My wife thinks Donald Fagan looks slightly insane hunched behind the keyboards with the ever-present shades and vampirical incisors but I say SD is still the best band out there.The interviews are a little quirky with all the angular shots, but hey, if it aint quirky, it aint Steely Dan right?The band is as tight as ever with Walter Becker even picking up a lot of the guitar work himself. Cornelius Bumbus is still amazing on the sax.Standout: stellar version of Pretzel Logic as the closer.If your into the Dan this is a must-have. Oh yeah..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-priming the pump","review":"Steely Dan needs to follow up quickly so that this re-entry is quickly overshadowed by a more formidable effort that we all know they are capable of producing. Speaking of producing, they need Gary Katz back (or someone of similar calibre). Becker should stick to producing lower profile projects. Fagan has proven he is capable of facilitating some of the greatest music made in the last half century (e.g. The Nightfly, The Royal Scam, Aja, Gaucho, etc.) Kammakiriad was forgivable. This one will be harder to forgive if they don't give us something to forget it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"SD Fan","review":"Making an album is alot of hard work, yada, yada, yada. Long time since they recorded, yada, yada, yada. Kamakiriad Two, please don't tell me it's not, yada, yada, yada. Becker's \\"11 Tracks of Whack\\" was much more interesting/enjoyable/innovative, yada, yada, yada. Did I buy it? Sure. I'm a SD Fan, man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call It \\"Aja II\\"","review":"It's vintage Steely Dan. That's the good news and the bad news. The cuts are interchangeable with the Aja album--Same beat (sounds like it's being kept by an electronic \\"sideman\\"), same backup and typical melody lines. So that leaves us with what?--New lyrics? I spent the whole disc waiting for something new, some evidence of musical growth or evolution, and walked away disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the melodies, stupid!","review":"I read, in some newspaper, an interview with Donald Fagen where he said that the melodies in his songs where no longer important to him. Unfortunately, unless your into words, or more directly, his words, then this CD is a big disappointment. No, the melodies do not have to be like their album \\"Aja\\", but it would be nice to here something like \\"The Royal Scam\\". All of these current offerings seem to run on like one endless song. There is nothing catchy. By that I don't mean funky, but catchy like \\"Kid Charlemagne\\" or \\"Green Earrings\\". I used to think that \\"gaucho\\" was their worst album. That album is great compared to this. 20 years and this is the best they can do? Very depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Desparately in need of some new music, I was very glad to find a new Steely Dan CD while on a long driving trip. However, this CD is just an uninspired collection of tunes. All of them are awful; none have a distinct hook as per earlier SD efforts. I actually just threw the CD away; it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"THE REAL SCAM\\"","review":"Let me start by stating that I really dig Steely Dan, but Ihave to be honest: this album stinks. I bought this album withouthearing any of the tracks. I made the mistake of assuming that any new Steely Dan album would rock, but this doesn't even roll. Shame on you! END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me More!!!","review":"The only Steely Dan Live DVD worth owning. Sort of a strained definition of Live since this was recorded in front of a small audience in a TV sound stage. As good as it gets for fans of the Dan for now. Some day, we can hope that Walter and Donald will gift their long-suffering and very loyal fans with a full-length concert DVD with the kind of production values we've come to expect from their meticulous recording career. Til then, we have this disc to remind us of their absolute greatness. If you cannot see them live, this is the next best thing, and the best part is that you can watch this tight set list over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Steely Dan!","review":"I've been an SD fan for many years and was disappointed with this effort. Put it against their earlier stuff and you're immediately struck by the loss of the biting guitar riffs and melodic lines. It's a well done effort, but for them not up to par."},{"rating":"2","title":"they're Baaaa-ack","review":"Wonderful album. Full of the subtle (and not so subtle) evil humor that made Steely Dan famous. Gaslighting Abbie and Cousin DuPree are instant classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOCAL BOYZ","review":"......Glad to see the local boys can still shine the silver bowl......What took you so long? This is a great comeback CD and needs another one real soon to keep the momentum going .... I dragged out my collection and listened all over again and realized how great these guys are ...my memory machine was in overload. The two standouts are Jack of Speed & Shame About Me........Donald and Walter please keep shining the bowl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden Daniel","review":"The lamely deadened, 20-years-waiting comeback disc finds the once challenging, jazz-influenced rock elitists settling into a more modern lull. Steely Dan's signature lyrical humor and melodic grooves are overhauled and placed neatly into spaces that all too often feel corny and restrictive. The production is too shiny and only elaborates some horribly implemented musical ideas, particularly in the forced vocals. If the title track were a poor example of the album's feel, we would be in good shape. Sadly Two Against Nature remains one of the stiff disc's only mildly engaging (ie naturalistic) tracks amongst rare glimpses of songwriting talent. When they do strain for musically rewarding passages, it is apparent they have become bloated on their own questionable mythology, confusing the interchanging of a bunch of snazzy jazz chords with thought out transitioning..a veritable comatose caricature of what once was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to be so negative","review":"I'm a huge Steely Dan fan. However, while the sound and musicianship are here, the songwriting is terribly weak. There simply aren't any good melodies. I can hardly distinguish the tunes. Prior Steely Dan was an unbeatable combination of great musicians and wonderful songwriting. Not here, to my taste. I wish I could say something better, but if you don't have any of their other albums, go buy those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaajor disappointment.","review":"Steely Dan is my favorite band of all time. After loving Aja, Countdown to Ecstasy, the Royal Scam, Katy Lied and Pretzel Logic, I was immensly disappointed by Two Against Nature. Donny and Wally seem to have lost their creativity and just sort of threw the album together to keep the fans from dying. Most the songs are quite boring.But it's still worth a buy, for three songs: Two Against Nature, Jack of Speed, and West of Hollywood. And this isn't a slump, just a little bump in the road--Everything Must Go has the quality of all seven classic albums. I think they should've canned the six bad tracks and kept the aforementioned good songs, then put them on Everything Must Go instead.I'd reccomend any one of the 70's-80's albums (Can't Buy a Thrill, Countdown to Ecstasy, Pretzel Logic, Katy Lied, the Royal Scam, Aja, and Gaucho) or Everything Must Go instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T BUY A THRILL","review":"BECKER GO HOME!IF ANY ONE HAS SEEN THE BOYS LIVE YOU KNOW WHEN BECKER PLAYED HIS STUFF, THE RESTROOMS WERE PACKED.

NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE LEVEL WE HAVE LEARNED TO EXPECT FROM SD.DO IT AGAIN , DONALD, ALONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment with a few highlights","review":"\\"Disappointment compared to all of the Dan's other studio output. This CD is flat-out boring. There isn't a single tune in here that has the same individuality as almost anything else Steely Dan ever did. Every tune is a loping mid-tempo beat, with wordy lyrics and extremely annoying vocals. Not a decent groove in the bunch. Walter Becker's guitar solos are all eighth-note wonders with no particular distinction. He's improved in the ten or so years between Dan albums, just not enough to make a convincing front-line guitarist in the Dan tradition. Great studio production can't make up for mediocre, enervated songwriting. The exception is the mid-tempo number (again) \\"Jack of Speed\\" which was basically the breakout hit off this disc, and which I covered in a band once. Good song. I'm glad they're back, but I wish they'd get their harmonic edge back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"Yes, I too ordered this CD weeks before release in the hopes of hearing a new \\"destined to be a classic\\". Instead I was the first kid on the block to be disappointed. This release is a rehash of Fagan's \\"Kamakiriad\\" rejects (Granted Kamakiriad took some getting used to). I dare say no song from either that or this release will ever be played on an oldies station of tommorow. This is Two Against Natural musical sensibilitiesMonotonous beats, repetitious lyrics, uninspiring harmonies and lack of riffs have never been part of the Steely Dan appeal. Please fellas, if you can't make the magic don't sell out your name. What happened to compassion and wisdom? To me there is no new Steely Dan album just disappointment. This disc has no place in my collection and is for sale to the first person who thinks the kings have new clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of Steely Dan. I think it is inexcusable that they are not yet enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of fame. However, this new CD will definitely not help their chances of getting into the Hall. The best word to describe the music contained in the new CD, \\"Two Against Nature,\\" is bland. After having listened to all of the nine cuts twice now, so many of them are incredibly similar to each other.The melodies are for the most part flat-out boring.The production and engineering qualities are still top-shelf, but when you begin the recording process with extremely boring melodies there's not much you can really do to dress-up the problem. After having waited 20 years since the release of Gaucho for this, it pains me greatly to say that this CD is best used as soft, background music for dinner or as listening music in an elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why did I buy this album? I have my CD \\"wish list\\" and somehow this got onto it. After listening to it, I cannot imagine why. Don't get me wrong, I do like Steely Dan (Aja is a classic). But this album really misses that mark by a mile. Sure, it may be good elevator music, but it has none of the spark of the other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'LL PASS...","review":"Are the lyrics there? Yes. Is the music there? Hell no. And when did Fagan forget how to sing?Sorry, but what gets me about an album like this (or a group like this) is how many Dan fans are \\"groupies\\" - these guys could come out with a pile of pure drivel (not that I find that likely) and people would be lined up talking about how amazing it is. Blech. Musically speaking, I think this is their weakest album ever, by FAR. Even their solo efforts (some great stuff but not up Dan levels) surpasses it without even blinking. I'm glad I got to listen to it before wasting money on it.By ordinary standards there are things to like, but by \\"Dan standards,\\" it's not worth the buy. Sorry Dan groupies. Peace, you crazy diamonds. (OOPS sorry wrong group)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I've listened to this CD a couple-three times now and Steely Dan fans who are looking for another quantum leap recording like Countdown to Ectasy, Katy Lied or Aja will be disappointed. Fagen has not moved on from the Kamkatriad sound and only two or three of the tracks here are have the liveliness and energy one associates with Steely Dan. You get the feeling they could have done much better -- All in all a pretty poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope I die before I get old...","review":"I may be a hardcore Dan fan, but to me, this album lacks a pulse. I miss the raw urgency (and energy) of this group as displayed in the vocals of \\"Don't Take Me Alive\\" and in the horn arrangement and playing in the \\"Royal Scam.\\" For those of you unfamiliar, listen to the pleading horns in this signature track of the Royal Scam album.T.A.N. may be sophisticated and \\"mature\\", but it lacks the edge of their early work (pre-Aja). The bottom line is that these very talented musicians have changed and matured, and their music has also changed. These are different people now, and their music is different. Better? I think not. I may be almost as old as these guys, but T.A.N. IS NOT FOR ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Steely Dan?","review":"I hate to trot out the \\"what happened?\\" cliche but what happened? Fagen used to be able to write songs. This is a collection of grooves with indescriminate words tacked on and thus is indistinguishable from his last solo album and will probably be indistinguishable from the next Steely Dan album. Can't Buy a Thrill and Katy Lied were collections of superlative songs performed by exciting musicians. Two Against Nature is Donald and Walter cooly jamming for 45 minutes, or an hour. Who knows; I stopped paying attention after about ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed...","review":"I've enjoyed Steely Dan's music since I was a kid. It had smooth melodies and a real \\"feel good\\" quality about it. Unfortunately I can't say the same for this new release, I did not enjoy a single song on the entire CD. I guess I'll just keep hearing their classic stuff, it's good enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry","review":"Sorry, I just couldn't get into this after a few listens. It's not the Steely Dan that I came to enjoy over the years. Nothing kept my attention, and I found myself moving on to another disc prematurely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Against Nature: \\"...way deep into nothing special\\"","review":"I have always been completely fascinated by Fagan and by the magic of Steely Dan; yet,after repeated listenings, the painful truth is that this album is rambling, flat, and totally missable. There are no catchy numbers that stay with you ... but while playing, the songs go on and on, pointlessly. I recommend that if you passed over \\"The Nightfly,\\" occupy your senses with that. It has the musical integrity and deliciously ironic lyrics \\"Two Against Nature\\" lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The changing of the guard redux","review":"This is one of the most amazingly disappointing cds I have ever bought.I have been a Dan fan almost since the inception. While the sound of this anemic collection of tunes is Steely Dan, all the wit and brilliance that once gave this band its unique appeal is gone. There are no soaring insturmental solos, no polished satiric lyrics. While the additude of ripe debauchery that this band espoused in ts early work appears rakish on one still in youth, the very over indulgent lifestyle celibrated by this band has dulled the razor sharp neural edge that made them so outstanding. The cd is dull and witless, not quite a stinker but almost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money - Get The Classics","review":"This is just junk. If, like me, you're a fan of their classic CD's, then don't waste your money on this, really, you're going to be disappointed.I wish someone would have been this honest with me before I bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is Becker doing?","review":"I am a bass player who used to play in a Steely Dan cover band. The SD's older work offered me and the rest of the band quite a challenge. Their sound, quirky harmonies, rythmical changes and their general sophistication were very hard to copy. They also had quite a great line-up of guitar and bass playersNot so on this album. Becker's bass and guitar chores are bland. The guitar is repetitive and lacks depth and refinement. Becker's bass work is better, but also here there is too much repetition and lack of inspiration. I found it very disappointing that I could actually play most of the songs on this album in one go, whereas on previous albums the songs often offered me quite a puzzle.Furthermore, this is a Fagen album... and not even his best. The Nightfly and Kamakiriad were much better. So yes, I am disappointed. There is no material on here that I would like to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly awful","review":"What a shame about Steely Dan. The immaculate production and stellar musicianship that Becker & Fagen and their various cohorts are known for are present in spades - but the album is junk.Steely Dan albums are not usually boring. Two Against Nature is. Only \\"What A Shame About Me\\" and the catchy, hilarous \\"Cousin Dupree\\" are even halfway decent. Everything else on this album is insubstantial, colorless wallpaper - tasteful, but bland.Some folks have compared Two Against Nature to Donald Fagen's last album, Kamakiriad. I would have to agree. When I first heard that album, I thought, \\"Can you say 'no musical development whatsoever'?\\" Two Against Nature answers that question with a resounding \\"NO\\".What a shame.P.S. - Okay, it's not quite that bad. Two Against Nature does make for decent background listening once in a while. But, I still wish it were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic New Release","review":"This disc is superb. The sound quality is unmatched. If you are new to the Steely Dan catalogue you might want to start with AJA or Katy Lied because this disc is very deep. There is no group like Steely Dan on this planet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Can Still Get You Spellbound","review":"This is the first original Steely Dan album I listened at full length. I got hooked to Cousin Dupree or Almost Gothic which still got classic Steely Dan allure. It is nicely organized. On the whole I like this album a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 Stars","review":"Well well well, look who's back. It's been 19 years since Gaucho. Big-hair arena rock, electronic pop, alternative, grunge, and pseudo R&B have come and gone (or will soon... hopefully). Now Becker and Fagen return to prove that their complete disregard for trends still continues. Thank God. On the plus side, TAN seems to pick up with their sound right where they left off. On the minus side... same thing.Comparisons with past works aside, let's take the album on its own. A couple tracks (\\"Jack of Speed,\\" \\"Almost Gothic\\") seem flat without much life in them. Becker's leads are repetitive and somewhat uninspired at times. But there are enough spirited tracks where they come together (\\"Abbie,\\" \\"Dupree,\\" the title track) to make it worth the price, especially if you like SD or just jazz/rock in general. Even if you don't, it's worth a try.. you just might start to like something new by accident."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We've got to have some music for the new frontier\\"","review":"With \\"Aja\\" and \\"Royal Scam\\" as 5 star SD standards, this effort is a very close 4 stars in terms of quality/content. I see 2VN as a great stylish mix of \\"Aja\\" and \\"Kamakiriad\\". And the musicianship of Donald/Walter and Company is simply outstanding. Its also nice to see the trademark dry, worldly wit and wackiness surface on tunes like \\"Cousin Dupree\\" and \\"Gaslighting Abbey\\". My other faves include \\"Jack of Speed\\" and \\"Almost Gothic\\". This CD gets better with each listen, so crank it up and enjoy. Lets hope they dont wait 20 years to do another one(again!). Donald...where did you get those shades?"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's more Becker in this one","review":"Here you get a very spellbinding funk riff in most of the songs, which shows that bassist and primary guitarist Walter Becker hasn't been idle for the past two decades (if you're like me and already own his \\"11 Tracks Of Whack\\" album, it will come as no surprise). I'm not going to duplicate the efforts of other reviewers by rehashing the most noticeable songs like \\"Cousin Dupree\\", but you will notice that the longest number (\\"West Of Hollywood\\" at a bit over 8 minutes), is a bit of an anomaly. In the past, the longest cut on a Steely album was one of the slower songs--this one might very well be the bounciest. People who don't like long songs because they seem to drag might find a pleasant surprise in that cut. Plus, as you might expect in an album built for CD, it's about an hour long. Which is to me prima facie evidence that anyone who calls them \\"dinosaurs\\" is blowin' smoke--Jurassic albums are only 40 minutes. So freakin' there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If your going on a Cruise,or at the Beach,get this CD","review":"This is a mellow,fantastic CD. There's no \\"Hey Nineteen,\\" my favorite song of all time about getting old,but there's alot of great stuff on this record.I love the song,\\"Cousin Dupree,\\" about having the hots for your relative.This should be the West Virgina State song. \\"Janie runaway\\" has a great line,\\"You be the showgirl and I'll be Sinatra way back in \\"59\\". Every song has a different beat,and your body starts moving for no reason,with horns coming in,and Carolyn Leonhart's great backing vocals with each new number.There's only one song,\\"Two Against nature,\\" that could be played on the radio,even thought I love every song on this CD.If your going on vacation,and want to relax,put this CD in your head phones and enjoy your well deserved rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"DTS system explosion!","review":"Well what a treat this format is. And a superb disc to test it. DTS has to be the best thing that happened to me since I got into music! And on a good system this Steely Dan dvd is just great. Whether your a big fan of this genre or not you'll love the quality of the reproduction. Particularly good is the facility to flick between regular stereo (pro-logic), dolby digital and DTS, and boy what a transformation the DTS track makes! The room leaps into life as you are surrounded by the various elements of the mix, and you can sit there and enjoy picking out all the different layers of the music, and the crowd applauding the various instrumentation... a classic for the shelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK...............with a vengeance!","review":"20 years is far too long to wait for new riffs from this extraordinary duo, but they have delivered the goods - and then some. Fresh, funky, jazzy, bluesy,and cynical, the Dan have created an entirely new cast of satisfyingly sleazy characters. The music is crisp, full of hooks that I cannot get out of my head, and is meticulously, painstakingly crafted so that not one note is wasted. I strongly recommend several listens as often as possible. The true appreciation comes with the headphones on and the volume UP. There are amazing complexities and subtleties throughout that make this a work of genious. Alas, it is not for everyone. Most of my acquaintances just don't quite \\"get\\" these major dudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dan leaves them all behind","review":"I have dreamed for a long time for a new Dan album, one which would match up to aja, katy lied, and pretzel logic; well, this is it. There are few hooks, great instrumentation, and fabulous jazz inflected melodies. In a time when a baby boomer can barely find anything new to listen to, this is like manna from heaven. I only hope it's not another twenty years. In many respects, songs like Almost Gothic, Cousin Dupree,and West of Hollywood are better than anything on Aja. I hope everyone buys it and enjoys it. Great musicianship, which filters much of the different American music styles into one is rare to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Dan music a dream come true!","review":"I wish I could write a review as well as the Dan crafts albums. I have listened to the album exclusively since it came 3 days ago and I'm thrilled with the effort. I bought Can't Buy a Thrill in the summer of 72, so of course I go all the way back with these guys. We are so lucky that they took the time to give us this bank of music! It seems the people and places populating these latest gems are more beat up, heartbroken and forlorn, COOL! The music is outstanding as always, but the lyrics are what I am enjoying the most so far. \\"Goddess on the fire escape\\" is someone I hope we all have in our past, and that section of the song \\"What a Shame About Me\\" is the perfect melding of lyric and music. All songs are growing equally with me so far. LONG LIVE THE DAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert DVD!!!!! Audio A+++++ Video B-","review":"This is a great concert DVD.That being said, the video is filmed in 4x3 and not of very good quality.The audio is outstanding and is reference material.I say that having bought over 300 concert DVD's and having a state-of-the art home theater system.You will not be disappointed once you get past the video.DO NOT BUY the supposed 16x9 version \\"Steely Dan In Concert\\"...it is the same 4x3 concert, poorly stretched to 16x9, and looks even worse!If anyone in Tulsa wants it I will put it out on my porch for you to pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"some strange comments here","review":"its strange that some people find this record disappointing because they didn't change and some because they did. I think they've matured musically as well as showing a stubbon commitment to the unique jazz, rock, soul, funk idiom that they were always interested in. As a performing band they are playing better than they ever did. The burned out comment is really silly - nasty actually. They are remarkably fresh compared with most of their generation and obviously very happy to be still playing. Sure these songs reflect their age but they are full of wit and narrrative and more than a little ageing melencholy. Its full of tight rhythm construction, great arrangements and great playing, lyrically they are as sharp as ever - and its really beautiful sounding... its a treasure, its not Aja of course, but then what the hell is? that would deserve 7 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"The same and different","review":"The first time I listend to it I was disappointed. I was hoping for Aja. I gave it a second chance and started to appreciate it for what it is, what they were trying to do. I started to hear the familiar arrangments and unique use of instruments and vocals in a new setting. The more I listen the more I like it. It's not Aja but the heratige is there. This IS some of there best work. The horns are GREAT! More pure Jazz I think. Almost Gothic has a flow to it that sucks me in and won't let go. Now I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Haven't Missed A Beat","review":"The new Steely Dan studio album is in the Aja/Gaucho vein, with nothing to disappoint, and nothing to surprise. If you like Becker and Fagen, you've already placed your order; if you're just curious about them, I'd suggest starting out with more vintage material (recommended: Countdown To Ecstasy and Royal Scam), and work your way to this one. For those of us who've heard it all, we now have nine new songs that haven't yet been absorbed by the Muzak Corporation; most on the strong side (the losers: \\"Gaslighting Abbie\\" and \\"Janie Runaway\\"), and at least one, the title track, a classic. All the Steely Dan earmarks are here -- subtle hooks, cynical lyrics, tasty guitars and horns -- which will likely lead many to rediscover the best American band of the seventies. I hope I won't have to wait another twenty years to hear new material.A welcome return, unlike most other \\"reunion\\" albums that have found release in the past decade. These guys still sound fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like 1981!","review":"Where Steely left off in 1980, they roll back in, seamlessly, 20 years later! I have friends that just HATE these guys, but I consider them to be the most intelligent thing about post 1960 jazz! Unlike other \\"fusion\\" acts, Steely understands the meaning of a hook. It's really the only jazz fusion that doesn't seem like futile, endless-scale noodling! \\"Two Against Nature\\" is as clever and infectious as anything they've ever delivered. Much more cohesive than Fagen's \\"Kamakiriad\\", this record proves that these guys need each other to really make things gel. I love it. I might call it my favorite, but Steely Dan is one of the few bands where it's difficult to pick a fave. Love em' or hate em'. Most folks do. Few are indifferent. J."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Disappointment","review":"For anyone who sat on a bar stool in the 70s getting happily buzzed to Steely Dan on the juke box after a long night of disco dancing, this CD is for you. Sure, it sounds like their old stuff, and thank God for that. It's working-class jazz, and it never goes out of style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Concert DVD Ruined By Interruption.","review":"CONCERT INTERRUPTUS- The senseless interruption of a quality concert performance on DVD with silly interviews and clips rendering the dvd to the quality of a tv show. If you are looking for the \\"live concert\\" feel, forget this title. Hopefully in the future, producers of concert DVDs will wake up and stop the butchering of these shows and include the \\"extras\\" in a separate section of the disc. \\"TWO AGAINST NATURE\\" could have been a great addition to my collection of \\"live\\" shows but I'll probably give it to a friend. By the way.....the sound quality was incredible and the camera work was pretty good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is unwatchable","review":"The concert portions of this DVD are absolutely 1st rate. The camera work is excellent, and in DTS mode the sound is incredible. The band is extremely tight. This could have been one if the best concert DVD's I own. (And most of the DVD's I own are music DVD's and concert's.) They cover all of their really great works. If this DVD just played the concert strait through I would have rated it 5 instead of a 1.Unfortunately the layout of the DVD is such that it is unwatchable. They took interviews with band members and stuffed them in between each of the songs. What should be in the \\"Extra's\\" section of the DVD to be watched when you want is instead crammed down your throat every time you try to watch this DVD.I hope that no band ever uses this format again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those that \\"get it\\". Get it.","review":"Great album. Travelling back in time already. Got the old surf team together, waxed down the boards and juiced up the tape deck.Don's voice lacks of the anger and bite of old and I miss some of the melody but when warmed up, the songs cook like the old Dan. Esp. \\"Shame\\", \\"Jack\\" and the Cous', which hooked even my two year old. The others take a little more work but somehow all songs hit the groove about 1/3 in.Re: the re-union, the whole IS greater than the sum of the parts.Don and Walt, if your reading... We still love you ! Dont forget to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Timeless","review":"Steely Dan (having survived heavy metal, disco, new wave, and grunge) offers us another album of their own unique brand of music that continues to defy category. IMHO part of their snappy appeal lies in Fagen's trademark keyboards and vocals. \\"Cousin DuPree\\" alone is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Against Nature","review":"If it's these 2 against Nature, Nature would lose. These guys do it right every time. I was really impressed by the title track, the groove is way cool. You can hear touches of the 90's in there as far as pop influence, but you will NOT hear a typical \\"90's pop song\\" on this album, they stick to their jazzy roots, which is why I love the Dan."},{"rating":"2","title":"STEELY DAN COOLS DOWN TO A SIMMER WITH 2vN","review":"This latest DAN album is not for the uninitiated. This is not the \\"CLASSIC\\" HEY NINETEEN Steely Dan, that one can still hear on the MOR stations.Rather, this latest venture is an evolution basically on some of Fagan's solo work.If you are new to this pair's work, buy the definitive Aja album or some of the earlier ones. The genre here is mostly funky-cool,with a somewhat dark aura---listen to the lyrics! As a drummer,some of the the tracks lack the typical fills and dynamics and sound more like a drum machine.All in all however,an engaging and worthwhile album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe no Pretzel Logic, but very good.","review":"Some Steely Dan fans have expressed disappointment with this new release, but I can't see why. It's as good as almost any of their earlier albums and better than some (particularly the last two.) Musically there are no real changes from the seventies except for an increase in funk; in that respect it could be said to continue a trend started in Gaucho 20-odd years ago. \\"Cousin Dupree\\" and \\"Janie Runaway\\" are as good as anything they did in their heyday, as far as I can see. The strange thing is that Two Against Nature makes it seem as if they've hardly been away rather than taking an extended hiatus through most of the 80's and 90's. I look forward to their next album in 2020."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steely Dan Does It Again (Ho Hum)","review":"The good news is here's another Steely Dan album. The bad news is it's another Steely Dan album. If you're a diehard Dan fan then you'll like whatever they churn out. After so many albums, though, the music is becoming formulaic and predictable. The lyrics are still bizarre as ever, but the rythms and oddball harmonies are just warmed over. There's no excitement on this album, as in My Old School, Bodhisattva, Between the Raindrops, or any number of old Dan and Fagen tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the Grammies, Man","review":"Since Donald was hideously overlooked by the Grammy people for TheNightfly and Kamakiriad, both works of unfathomlable genius, maybe he thought that if he wrote something more ordinary he'd get their attention. Long live Dan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better on CD than DVD","review":"Steely Dan sounds great on CD but is boring to watch on DVD as there is not much stage presence. I will stick to their CD's which are great and not any DVD's. They also omited their best songs like: School, Rikki..This one is not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried and tried (tired and tired too)","review":"I listened about once a month for four or five months, trying to GET what won this album a Grammy. Can't listen no more. I'll keep to the vintage Steely Dan and to Donald Fagans more recent efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album of the Year???? Yeah right","review":"I am listening to this album right now, and in my personal opinion, it is terrible! When I watched the Grammys and saw that it won the 2001 album of the year I was quite surprised, for I was rather partial to Radiohead's Kid A, Beck's Midnight Vultures, or even Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP. Anyway, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a good listen. Biggest waste of time of my life. The recording academy or whatever it's called it obvious throwing darts at a dartboard when they pick who is going to win. This album is something they would play for the credits of a Police Academy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to the good old Steely Dan","review":"A very disappointing offering from such a talented bunch of musicians. Where have the instantly accessible melodys/riffs/lyrics and, dare I say, \\"music\\", all gone. Compare this with any one of pre Aja albums. These were all albums with songs you wanted to listen to again and again. They seem to have completely abandoned their rock roots for some sort of jazz - I think. No beautiful and inventive guitar work. Nothing to hold your attention. Incomprehensible lyrics. This album would fit perfectly in a \\"Jazz Club\\" sketch from The Fast Show. If only I could return this album and get my money back. I strongly recommend you to listen to this album before you buy it. Come back Steely Dan and produce something as good as Royal Scam or Pretzel Logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY FOLKS, THUMBS DOWN","review":"I have waited twenty years for this album and I must say I'm dissapointed. A few of the songs satisfy this S.D. fan, but the rest sound like a band trying very hard to sound like Steely Dan. I got lost in the boring, lackadaisical attempts to match that original Fagen/Becker genius. Steely Dan haven't grown up, they've grown old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Against Nature---Too Similar","review":"Tunes too similar--album lacks the diversity in sounds of their great ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspiring song writing","review":"Of course Steely Dan is perhaps the greatest band of all time. However, Two against Nature is perhaps their most uninspired album. It is about as boring as Fagen's second solo album. The Nightfly was truly exceptional work. I don't mean to be harsh with my 2 star rating, but the true proof of great Steely Dan is how many of their songs I sing during the day: Your Gold Teeth II, Any World, Aja, Black Cow, Gaucho. Dirty Work, Kid Charlemagne... I could go on and on, and at no point would I get to a song from Two Against Nature. Perhaps time will prove me wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walter's guitar failure sinks cd","review":"This disc suffers from dreary guitar work by Walter Becker. The sparkling electric guitar all-star contributions that have been the jewels in the Dan's crown are missing in action.Weak-sounding and unconvincing riffs halt and stutter repetitively, ranging from blues-like to jazz-tinged. He never lifts or carries these songs, not even for a moment.Imagine Third World Man or Kid Charlemagne without the transforming and riveting Larry Carlton solos, or Bodishattva or Your Gold Teeth II without Denny Diaz's facile and melodious artistry and you get the picture.When I see the name Steely Dan, I expect emotional and technically brilliant guitar playing along with the usual smarty-pants attitude and sophisticated songwriting.Can't Walter just play bass?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifelong Steely Dan fan sez: Don't bother with this album","review":"I lived in California in the 70s when Fagen and Becker worked their magic. I actually wore my \\"Aja\\" LP out and had to buy a new one. I had high hopes for this album when it came out and I just put it on my iPod and gave it another listen. Still underwhelmed. Easy to listen to, technically precise, but where are the hooks? Each song is as forgettable as the one before. Do yourself a favor and listen to Royal Scam or Aja."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC","review":"One of my all time favorite groups, STEELY DAN, should have ended with \\"Gaucho\\". The two solo albums by Donald Fagan,(The Nightfly and Kamikiriad) after \\"Steeley Dan\\" broke up, are awesome. But this reunion album by Steely Dan is awful. It will be very obvious to any die hard Steeley Dan fan, that all the cuts on the CD are out takes from other Steeley Dan albums.One of my favoite groups of all time, made one of the worst CD's of all times with this effort. Some groups never know when to retire, or are too greedy to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is no Gaucho","review":"I'm a SD fan but this one's just awful! There are only 3 tracks worth mentioning: Gaslighting Abbie, Jack of Speed and West of Hollywood. The rest of time SD is just struggling for a tune. I'll give it 1 1/2 stars. If you want to listen to vintage Dan, you won't be disappointed with Aja."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment","review":"Sounds hollow and without emotion. Songs don't say a thing to me. Actually, they do: they sound like somebody whining about something. Love his old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annus horribilus","review":"If this was the Best Album of the Year (according to the Grammy Awards) it must have been a really awful year. Repetitious, rambling, dull, tuneless...shall I go on? For die-hard fans only. And even they will most likely be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid, pale, monochromatic and forgettable.","review":"A disappointing and insipid and lacklustre and very forgettable CD. That was how \\"Two Against Nature\\" came across to me. I have long been a fan and admirer of Steely Dan but I have concluded that they reached their zenith with Aja circa 1977 and have been on a long day's journey into night ever since. It has been downhill for these erstwhile \\"trend setters\\" ever since. I have listened to this album a good five times trying to like it but alas, I cannot. This CD might make a good Frisbee. Steely Dan's unique combination of puckish sarcasm and satire coupled with exquisitely beautiful musical strains and melodies and arrangements were ubiquitous in their earlier albums yet are nowhere to be found in this latest work. Thank you, anyway, to Becker and Fagen for your timeless and beautiful works of the 70's. Great artists are judged more severely when they err and turn out a real stinker only because they have been so deeply respected in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring sounding record!","review":"Every song sounds EXACTLY the same-Steely Dan sure has gone downhill over the years. Don't touch this new release with a 10 foot pole!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst CD I've ever purchased","review":"In a long history of loving Steely Dan, and with a large portion of my entertainment budget devoted to purchasing music CD's of all types, this ranks as THE WORST CD I've ever heard. There is only one track that is worth listening to, but even that is not worth the effort of loading the CD in the player. I can't believe this CD was ever produced, performed -- and worse -- purchased by me. Don't waste your money as I did by buying this complete waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"HATS OFF TO THESE GUYS","review":"I CONCUR WITH MY FELLOW REVIEW-IE. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT MR. BECKER PRODUCED 'KAMAKIRAID'. I AM SURE HE HAD INPUT TO THE WAY THE ALBUM SOUNDED. THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM FROM TWO 'UNUSUAL' WRITERS. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN STYLE & THE SOUND IS GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO 'OLD' SD LISTENERS & ANYONE ELSE.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to listen and genuflect simultaneously","review":"Okay, class: here's today's assignment. Take out your pencils and make up a comprehensive list of all the musicians capable of even approximating the work in question. When you're done with that list, create one that enumerates every artist offering incontravertible evidence of having reached a creative apotheosis thirty years into a career that began at one. Time's up. Pencils down. Any reaction to this CD that isn't dropping to your knees and weeping with joy and gratitude is-- what's the word I'm searching for here?--dumb. This is Received Wisdom. Aural Manna. Send the kids out to play--the grown ups are here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamakiriad II, plus some Aja","review":"This disk blends pop and jazz so perfectly, you don't know where one ends and the other begins. All the songs are worthy and benefit from trademark lush production and elegant backup vocals. I sense a \\"dirty old man\\" theme on this disk, however. Songs such as Janie Runaway, Almost Gothic, and Cousin Dupree all have a get-the-little-young-girl theme (Too bad the Dan failed to include a jazzy sendup of \\"My Sharona\\"). There's nothing so incisive as Black Friday, or lovely pop like Dirty Work; instead, you have well crafted pop/jazz with interesting lyrics, beautiful horns/sax, and Fagen's wry nasal musings on later life. The bottom-of-the-barrel fin-de-siecle of 11 Tracks of Whack has been softly transformed into a reminisced horniness. Bottom Line: A worth addition to your Steely Dan collection, unless you hated Kamakiriad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully harmonic - their best album yet?","review":"This album is getting under my skin. It's a lot like Gaucho - or even better.Every song on the CD is very good and I've made up my mind that my favorite 2 songs are the last 2 songs : ''Negative Girl'' and especially ''West of Hollywood''.West of Hollywood has GOT to be the best song I've heard in a decade or two - maybe since ''Third World Man'' from their Gaucho album. ''Slick tune''.Awesome awesome album - some of the very best music of my lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do It Again, Not","review":"My nine-year-old daughter remarked the other day that all the songs on this disc sound the same and she's right. Sad to say, this is a boring album. All the Steely Dan trademarks are here: quirky time signatures, arcane lyrics, flawless sound and recording. And these guys still have impeccable taste when it comes to picking saxophonists: witness their choice of Chris Potter as featured soloist this time around. What's missing, however, is the melodic genius of days gone by, and what's left is little more than elevated elevator music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steely Dan great music and great live performance","review":"These guys are know for perfectionism in the studio but the live performance is equally superior. They perform many of their great songs. Aja is good but not quite as good as the original. They are musicians' musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dan are still DYNAMITE","review":"This CD is SENSATIONAL!!! Having been a Dan Fan since teenhood (I really \\"discovered\\" them in the 80s, long after they had disbanded,) I shrieked with delight upon learning they had reconvened -- and unlike some other bands that disband and then reconvene, the Danny Boys HAD NOT CHANGED THEIR SOUND! They still have that great jazz-pop-rock sound they treated us Dan Fans to on AJA and GAUCHO. The Dan are pop -- they're rock -- they're jazz -- THEY'RE GREAT!!!! Every song was excellent and I cannot choose a favorite. All of them have a tendency to stick in my brain for a long time. I just wish I could give this CD ten stars. I recommend it highly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down from a Dan fan","review":"I'm a big Steely Dan fan with all but the Pretzel Logic CD in my collection, as well as Fagen's solo efforts. \\"Two Against Nature\\" has been thrown into my \\"rarely listen to\\" bin. Maybe it'll grow on me, but I don't think so. In my humble opinion, this is their worst effort and the fact that this is their only Grammy winner is the biggest insult. Yank that Grammy away and give it to \\"Gaucho\\" or \\"Aja\\", where it rightly belongs. In conversation with a friend, I mentioned that I was disappointed with \\"Nature\\". She used much harsher words ... While I only own the 2-channel CD, the music content is the key for me, so no multi-channel magic could pull this rabbit out of the hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back, Steely Dan!","review":"Of course, they never really left us, but this album is excellent! One track on \\"Two Against Nature\\" -- West of Hollywood -- is the highlight of this CD, with a long soaring tenor sax solo from Chris Potter than is unbelievable.I've been a Steely Dan fan for almost 30 years. The first time I heard \\"Dirty Work\\" I was hooked, and hearing \\"Rikki Don't Lose That Number\\" as a friend and I moved up to college in September of 1974 imprinted that music on my brain. Now Steely Dan is the only music I listen to other than classical...I was dubious that they'd be able to continue the amazing success that they've had over the years, but Fagen and Becker proved that they deserved the Grammys that they got in February. What a wonderful work of music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every song sounds the same, to bad too because they are dull","review":".OK,I really wanted to like this album but it was just not good in any way. A big time flop.Just to let you know, I have every Steely Dan album, plus the Citizen Steely Dan box plus 7 bootlegs of their live concerts so I am a big fan.But this album was just a bore from start to finish. Nothing interesting, nothing special, just the same old drum beat and processed Fagan sound in every dreary, lifeless offering.The only song that has even a 5% change is Gaslighting Abbey which wouldn't have made the cut on any other Dan album. And that one may be the highlight. Sad!Don't buy this record, but if you still feel the need, try to pick it up in the used rack or you can even pick up mine because I am taking it back.Never done that before with any Steely Dan work but this one just isn't worth my time. Hopefully they will return to the interesting, quirky sound that made them great."},{"rating":"1","title":"lounge music at best","review":"way to much like fagen's 93' release...awfull! i have been a steely dan fan forever and this is very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product","review":"You sent me the wrong product.

Kamakiriad had a lot of catchy tunes. This album however deserves no credit. Hopefully none of the songs on Nature will be played on the next live tour. Of course, it is always possible that I'm simply to stupid to grasp the underying \\"finesse\\" of Nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, Pathetic, Pitiful","review":"As a long time fan of Steely Dan, I pre-ordered this way before it was out, excited that they were finally releasing another album.Unfortunately, I ended up with 2 copies of this dreadful CD. Perhaps one song is tolerable. The rest stink (putting it mildly). If I could I'd give this less than 1 star.Don't waste your money. But if you must I'll send you 2 copies for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatta bummer","review":"if you've heard anything at all by this band, you've heard everything on this disc. when, halfway through the first cut, i started humming \\"hey 19\\" i knew something was wrong. this is the biggest disappointment since the eurythmics \\"comeback\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can go home again guys...","review":"Like Gaucho, from any other band this would be a good CD--intelligent--thoughtful--and obviously a lot of work. But, after Countdown to Ecstasy, Aja, and other Dan albums, it's a letdown. I know it must be hard to go out after years of living on the laurels and craft a new and FRESH project. But as recent efforts by bands like XTC--long out of the music mill--show, you can't always go home again. I'm taking my fresh copy to the used CD store around the corner to trade for a vintage English Beat or John Coltrane CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Against Nature wiill satisfy smooth jazz fans","review":"The new Steely Dan record is pretty much in the same vein as \\"Aja\\" and \\"Gaucho.\\" Fagan's vocals and horn section are just as good as ever.Most of the tenor sax solos are by Chris Potter,he stands out on the easy \\"Gaslighting Abbie\\", and a more upbeat (more of a Steely classic)\\"West of Hollywood.\\" Other standout tracks are \\"What a Shame about Me\\",\\"Cousin Depree\\",and \\"Almost Gothic\\", which recalls \\"Deacon Blues.\\" Though Becker's guitar work does the job, I kinda wished they added muscians like Richie Sambora (Bon Jovi), Mike Campbell (Heartbreakers) or Robert Cray. Because this record doesn't contain any rockers like \\"Reelin'in the years\\", \\"My Old School\\",or \\"Black Friday.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience,Give this Great Album a Couple of Listens to Snk in","review":"Look, this is an album that rewards repeated listens. At first its a little cold, too much like Kamakiriad (not such a bad thing but...) Sometimes when you need to listen to an album a couple of times to warm up to it, it just means it wasn't that good and now at least you're more familliar with it - this is not the case here. The melodies and instrumentation are complex and require several listens, SD's lyrics have always taken a couple of spins. So.....don't discard this so fast, as others have, you'll soon find that TvN has some songs that will surely rank among SD classics. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"picked up right where they left off","review":"This new disc is a delight. All the old Steely Dan elements are there--- the somewhat enigmatic lyrics, the quirky Fagan voice, the sparse guitar/keyboard/horn arrangements, and even that distinctive drum style that they've managed to project through a variety of drummers over the years. The opening bars of \\"Gaslighting Abbie\\" quickly let you know the boys are back and in top form.Disk run time is 51:30. The liner notes contain the lyrics to all the songs. No extra tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back!!","review":"After a 20 year hiatus (OK, a 7 year hatus if you include Donald Fagen's solo CD's), Becker and Fagen are back together and they came back strong indeed.They show their musical genius as always with different musical influences. They especially shine with the delightfully catchy \\"Cousin Dupree\\". Ironically, their diversity has become one of their trademarks. A trademark you don't get tired of. However, the songs on this CD as well as \\"Everything Must Go\\", are more subtle than their songs of the 70's and take a few listens to appreciate. So don't judge this one until you've heard it at least a few times. Then listen some more.In closing, they finally received a long overdue Grammy Award in 2000. It's a shame it took so long for this awesome duo!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I please have a MUSIC ONLY version of this!!?","review":"Damn I hate intermixed interviews. I sent this DVD back because there was no way to just listen to the music and ignore all the chatter. After you've heard the chatter once, you never want to hear it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been 5 stars but...","review":"I am in complete agreement with some of these other reviews. The audio of the live music will set the new standard above the Eagles, but the interview footage is quite intrusive. I really enjoy the music, but this dvd fails to capture any momentum of the preformance due to the constant interuptions. I would love it if this were rereleased in a more appropriate layout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performance and audio/video are good but production suffers.","review":"This is a must have for us Steely Dan fans but I have 2 gripes with the production: 1. Misc. interviews are between every song. Using chapter skip on your remote will take you to the start of the next song but gets to be a hassle. Why didn't they just bundle the documentaries seperate from the concert? 2. Certain passages during the concert don't sync with the audio. Some are barely noticeable while others are painfully obvious. Why, or how this was overlooked by the production/QA folks who put this together baffles me. Overall, a good job by Becker, Fagen and Co."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a show, what a band!","review":"Witty, and hip with a groove so deep I'm still trying to crawl out of it. Excellent selection of tunes with \\"Bad Sneakers\\" from 75's Katie Lied a nice surprise for me. Production is rich with respect to both video and audio (you are THERE baby!), with long time Dan producer Roger Nichols twisting the knobs on the audio side. This band is tight! Having Ricky Lawson, Tom Barney, and Dan newcomer Jon Herington on drums, bass, and guitar respectively, everyone else just has to show up to be absolutely stellar,...and they do. Interviews with audience members waiting on line to get into the show, shot at NYC's Sony Music Stages are both interesting and funny. Becker and Fagan's \\"community access\\" TV show with the non-stop mic boom has some of the best humor I've witnessed in quite some time. If the Dan is your deal, buy this DVD now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AFTER 20 YEARS, STEELY DAN IS STILL INNOVATIVE AND UNIQUE!","review":"With this being the first new release since 1980's \\"Gaucho\\", Steely Dan have not missed a beat! Actually, Becker & Fagen are even more innovative in this release. \\"Almost Gothic\\" is so good its almost hypnotic in the smooth relaxing delivery as only Donald Fagen can sing it. \\"What a shame about me\\" is a unique song as the lyrics are as enticing as the music. \\"Negative Girl\\" shows an even deeper jazzier side that was prevalent in the Fagen solo albums. My favorite release on the album as most of the fans who have written reviews on this CD has to be \\"Jack Of Speed\\" as Steely Dan gets really, really FUNKY! Also, \\"West of Hollywood\\" brings back some of the classic Steely Dan flavor on a new track. THERE IS NOT ONE BAD SONG ON THIS CD! THIS CD IS UP THERE WITH \\"AJA\\"! This is a MUST HAVE for all Steely Dan fans. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Against Nature","review":"This is a positively wonderful album! For what ever reason I largrely missed this album when it was relaesed. From my point of view DVD-Audio is the only way to go. The sound is so lush and full it's hard to describe. I also have come to like the surround sound version. Please note that the quality of the Music is only limited by your system - particularly your speakers - any weakness here will result in less than ideal sound. The last song (West of Hollywood) has become a favorite - I can't stop listening. The sax solo by Chris Potter is magical as well as the complex melody, vocals and lyrics - you'll see Ibet you gert hooked too. Easy to see why the album won the Grammy for best of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Surround Sound","review":"I don't think I've ever watched a finer sounding concert video ever. The mix of the 5.1 Surround is truly spectacular. This DVD is a must for any Dan fan or audiophile."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SET,INTERVIEWS WAY LOW IN MIX....","review":"YEA,THE PICTURE,SOUND AND PLAYING DURING THE SHOW ARE TOP-NOTCH.ONLY DISBELIEF IS HOW YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM DURING THE TALKING SEGMENTS SOMETIMES AND YOU HAVE TO TURN IT UP!YOU'RE LIKE,WHAT IDIOT DID'NT MIX IT?DID THEY EVEN LISTEN TO IT BEFORE MASTERING?WER'E THEY FIRED AFTERWARD?!OCCASIONALLY I GET A DVD WHERE CERTAIN TITLES ARE MIXED WAY LOUDER OR WHATEVER BUT ITS NORMALLY DONE BY PEOPLE ON A WAY SMALLER BUDGET THAN THE DAN HAVE.THIS DVD IS STILL A GREAT PURCHASE THOUGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch performance.","review":"I had the privlidge of seeing the original Steely Dan band in Boston back in the seventies.This band had original members Denny Dias, Jim Hodder, and Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter on stage that night. Also with the band was Mike McDonald and the late Jeff Porcaro also playing drums along side Jim Hodder( also deceased). The concert wasn't even sold out, but I had these guys early records and knew they were destined to greatness. The music on this DVD is about as flawless as can be, and the musicians assembled for this recording are top notch players.Another reason for me personally buying this DVD is that the drummer on this DVD, Ricky Lawson, was the original drummer of my favorite Jazz fusion group The Yellowjackets.So if you're a DAN fan this is a must buy. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sells well in my shop that doesn't sell music","review":"I own a small art gallery and whenever \\"What a Shame about me\\" plays people say \\"Is this the new Steely Dan\\" and quickly go down the street and buy it. This album renews an old standard of highly refined music leaving the last decade of amateur sounds from the Pacific North West behind us. Yeah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY BOTHER?","review":"The sound is fantastic (on DTS) but the video coverage of the band is ludicrous - full of crazy angles, wrong editing and - let's face it - it's just not a band that's great to watch no matter how it's shot/cut.But I give it one star for great DTS sound. Still, I think you'd be better off simply getting a greatest hits CD and listening to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"FM - Fairly Mediocre","review":"This much awaited album was a disappointment to true Steely Dan fans. The boys lackluster tunes having nothing memorable about them. Sad they came out of hibernation for this the hype easily outshined the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a lesson here...","review":"Listening to Two Against Nature I realized that really good pop music MUST have a hook, a riff, a catchy melody, something! They can duplicate the sound of Aja all they want but the tunes just aren't there. And let's be honest. Few guitarists can play over Fagan's changes--and Becker certainly isn't one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited all this time for THIS?","review":"I'm a huge fan, I think all of the old music is brilliant. I couldn't wait until \\"Two Against Nature\\" was released. I couldn't have been more disappointed in the redundant songs that grinded on endlessly. Only two tracks were mildly interesting, \\"Cousin Dupree\\" and \\"Two Against Nature\\" My copy of this CD is up for sale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spunky, Slick, And More","review":"Without a doubt the first highlight of the Year 2000. These sounds have very delightful jazz flavorings and some catch hooks which sink in after a few listens. This recording rocks a little more than Gaucho, which seems more appropriate as background as background music. Two Against Nature and Cousin Dupree display some high energy while maintaining some slick jazz colorings. The fade out solo on West Of Hollywood is quite ellaborate as well. Even slower tunes like Janie's Runaway work well with some stedy bass playing. Overall, this recording shows that the stylings of Steely Dan still fit in quite nicely in the new millenium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, terrible video and likely on purpose","review":"1. The one star is basically due to the poor video; ie this is a DVD and thus you're getting it for the music / video combo. Definitely get the CD version of this but this DVD is just a joke. The video seems as if it were done via some of the roadies... at the very last minute. Now the disconcerting thing is that the producers of this DVD wanted to get that... crappy video look... but yet spent a lot of money in the process. ie somewhat akin to those folks who spend a lot of money on jeans that look all beat up... but they're not... which is somehow why it's trendy?2. Steely Dan has never been about the visual performance; I mean Fagen and Becker are like two wooden men out there on stage, but their music is superb. Again, get the concert on CD because there are truly great new versions on some of their classics etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a case of dynamite.","review":"A wholly weak and unsatisfying effort by these long-ago burned-out musicians. It's not good enough for Fagen and Becker to stay close to the old Steely Dan formula. Sure, this new stuff sounds a lot like the old stuff. So what? What is missing is any sense of inspiration or innovation in these pieces. These songs come across as pale imitations of Steely Dan tunes. They could pass for Goucho outtakes. Some of them are incredibly annoying. Janie Runaway has to be the most irritating tune I've heard in a long time.I wanted to like this CD, I really did. Unfortunately, I will soon be relegating it to the dustbin along with my Jewel CD (what was I thinking there?). This album will soon be forgotten by not just FM radio but by most of the fans currently praising it as worthy of your attention. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the overpraise.","review":"Those who claim that true Steely Dan fans will consider this among the group's best efforts are seriously deluded. I have all of their material and have considered myself a big fan of these guys for more than 20 years. This is their weakest effort by far.

The good news about \\"Two Against Nature\\" is that it's the haunting, unique, restrained quality of their music & message that set them apart from all other groups since their start. This album preserves that quality--the SD sound we've known and loved all these years; no sell-out to current musicality. The Bad News is that there seems to be little life in their new material; it's just uninspired, bland. The SD franchise is still powerful; I hope they do better next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"shameless self promotion and no new news","review":"this book is packed with (annoyingly repetitive) case studies that have appeared in business books for the last ten years. if you are in marketing and don't know what this book has to tell you, you shouldn't be in marketing. i saw this as a way for the Boston Consulting Group to sell themselves and their brilliant thinking (notice how chock full the book is of made-up marketing words like \\"questing\\"). the main redeeming feature of the book are its facts and figures about American spending and economics, however NONE of the facts are sourced, cited or otherwise grounded in reality. very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better as an HBR article","review":"Though the authors touch on some curious trends, they don't ever get to a level where they are explaining the theoretical causality of the \\"trading up\\" phenomenon.

It cost almost as much to ship as it cost to purchase, then it arrived with the bottom of the container split apart in several places, and more than 1/4 of the product gone as a result. In addition, the packaging did not contain any traces of the product, so it was broken and missing product before it was packaged.

I play primarily FPS, but also RTS. I have yet to find a game it isn't worth using in. They keys are a lot better lined up for your fingers than the keys on the keyboard, and with the \\"shift\\" capabilites you can have each button do multiple things. I have been a user of the speedpad since the original n50. I love that I can create macro's that will do things I can't do in the game, like the dodge move in original UT.I also found that since my hands are always in the same place, I can create a template to use and apply that to each new game without having to remember what the keyboard key is for that action. (ex. button 5 is always forward, regardless of the game.)Just be sure to follow the install instructions as it can get tricky and not work if you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes gaming easier","review":"The speedpad makes playing online games alot easier.

The only issue was that the buttons were really stiff to begin with from being new. After a few days of playing with it, they freed right up. Some said it would take a little while to get it programmed... about 15 mins. Nice contour for the hand and takes up WAY less space that a gaming keyboard. Takes a minimal time to get used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"n52 Is Not Compatible With Intel Mac's","review":"Inspite of it's claim to be compatible with Mac's it only works with pre Intel versions. I called Belkin and they seemed not to be in any hurry to write the needed drivers. Very Frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother if you have an Intel Mac or use Windows Vista","review":"Apparently Belkin doesn't support the Nostromo Speedpad n52 on Intel Macs, though there's nothing anywhere on the packaging, or on their site (or Amazon, for that matter) to let you know that before you buy it. Also, they're apparently not writing drivers for Windows Vista, leaving anyone who upgrades out in the cold.This seems like a nice product, it works OK on my iBook G4 and seems to have a lot to offer, but it's worthless on my Intel iMac, which is what I play games on. Customer support doesn't offer any remedy. You'd think they would at least mention, somewhere, that they don't support Intel Macs or Vista, but I guess they just don't care enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I purchased this speedpad for my husband.

It should be just a little bit higher with a small rest for your thumb to set against when not hitting the key."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac users beware","review":"I bought it because I wanted something for World of Warcraft. I never get the hang of WASD and wanted to have arrow keys available for left hand use. Most USB number keypads are not Mac compatible. The Nostomo Speedpad n52 worked as desired when I used it with my Windows PC, but I bought it because I knew I was getting an iMac and it was listed as Mac compatible. Well, instructions for Mac users are useless, and apparently, my new iMac isn't supported despite the support for OSX. Tried using ControllerMate to get it to work, but the layout for that program made zero sense to me - and I work in IT and hack my equipment - both PC and Mac - all the time, so it's not because I'm computer illiterate.Belkin's web site is so horribly designed as to be useless, and like the manual, the online support is PC-centric. As it stands, it was money wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pad, Just Not Many Profiles","review":"Got this a few days ago, having a great time with it. However, I wish Belkin would have more/newer profiles on thier site!

I've had the one i have now for about 4-5 years, and it has worked great, until recently when it simply stopped working. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, i've had it for almost 5 years and that's a lot longer than i really expect anything i buy to last, at least with stuff like this.I have to say though, this did spoil me, as i am no longer able to play games without it, the thought of trying to play with classic wsad, and number keys is horrifying to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best device for gamers.","review":"I am a wow player and that device improves my game playing.

I've got larger-than-average hands, and it fits really well. None of the components feel particularly cheap, and now that I've been using it for a year, the keys are \\"broken in\\" quite well. The only caution here is that when you rest your hand on the unit, your thumb will have a bit of a stretch to do, going from the \\"space bar\\" down at the bottom to the D-pad on the side, all the way up to the red button. I seldom use these, simply because I find them cumbersome. Other than that, it's an excellent piece of gaming hardware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to its predecessor...","review":"I have used the N50 for almost 4 years now. I thought the n52 would be a step up... more buttons have to be better right? Unfortunately that isn't the case. The D-pad was EXTREMELY sluggish and unresponsive compared to the n50.

I then found it to be completely useless and annoying to use. I will stick with WASD keys with number and function keys in easy reach OR an analog game pad for other games. There are many free utilities out there for creating macros for button/key combos.... so even that is no big deal for Nostromo.

The weight is nice and the bezel has a very nice positive feel.Cons: I've noticed that the watch will periodically lose several minutes to several hours over the span of a couple days.The problem is so bad, that I have to re-calibrate the time about once-a-week, and I check the accuracy several times each day whenever I do wear it because just don't trust the watch. I'm planning on returning it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch","review":"This Timex watch is a good watch that feels comfortable and looks nice. It has easy to remove links and the features for the price is good. One thing, the ratcheted outer bezel seems slightly loose on some of these, but they appear to come from the factory that way. Overall a nice watch that I wear almost every day. Also has the brushed stainless steel case. I would recommend this watch to anybody that wants a sturdy clean looking watch. My wife really likes the looks of it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"great everyday watch","review":"Great everyday watch. Nothing too fancy and not too much money that you have to feel bad if something happens to it. Surprisingly, band was too large for my husband, who is a big guy.

Still, I highly recommend this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a useless watch","review":"I bought this watch for my son as a Christmas gift this year. It worked for about three weeks and stopped for no reason. Amazon replaced it with another. This version lasted 64 days and then stopped working again for no reason. I hope that Amazon accepts it and refunds me. I remember buying Timexes when I was young and they were durable. Unfortunately the brand has really deteriorated. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"The watch arrived today. Although it looked exactly like the picture, and appeared to be brand new, it would not run, nor would the face light up. The battery must have been exhausted. In addition, the bezel was frozen and could not be turned. Considering the positive reviews of this item, I must have received a real clunker, but, you only get one chance, and the hassle of returning the item and waiting for a refund means that I'll not buy from this manufacturer again. As it looks brand new, I'll bet that someone attempts to resell it, so be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks and feels great, but can't keep time!","review":"I really wanted to like this watch. Problem is, even with replacing battery with a new one, about every 5 days I look at it and realize it's 5-10 minutes slow. I should have returned it but frankly it wasn't worth the hassle.I should add that I know many other people with Timex Expedition watches who love them and have no problems. Maybe I just got a bad one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this watch to replace very similar model which I liked very much. I had it for a few years and was very happy with it. But recently somehow I lost the crown, probably pulled it out by a backpack strap.So I decided to buy the same watch. I compared my old watch with the picture of this model and was sure it's exactly the same watch.When I got the watch I was immediately disappointed by the fact that the bezel on the new watch was fixed and couldn't rotate. I am not a diver, but I find it very handy to time activities using rotating bezel.Oh well, I can live without rotating bezel. But just about a 3-4 weeks after I bought the watch I lost the crown again!Now I am going to buy Invicta watch with screw down crown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bezel does NOT rotate","review":"Its a pretty nice looking watch for the price, but the \\"unidirectional bezel\\" does NOT rotate... it will not even budge!There are alot of other reviews stating the same thing about the bezel being defective.If you can locate one at a local store, I suggest you try rotating the bezel first."},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta love a timex","review":"I have always had great experiences with Timex products, paricularly theIndiglo watches. It is always hard to shop for a watch online but Timexalways meets or exceeds my expectations.

Overall if I was going to purchase another watch it would be a Timex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look at a great price!","review":"I bought the Timex Men's Expedition as a birthday gift for my son-in-law. While I liked what I saw on line, I wasn't sure it would look as terrific in person. As it so happened, I was with my son-in-law when he opened the box and the watch was perfect! It looks like a high end watch (my husband has decided he would like one now), has not only numbers you can actually read but the date is easily read as well. The stainless steel wrist band is substantial but not too heavy and has polished links on the outside of the band and a matt link inbetween which gives it a rich look. My son-in-law removed a couple of links so that it fit him better and he said this was very easy to do.I have looked at a large number of watches on-line as well as in department stores. This watch surpassed all that I have seen and none of this quality came anywhere near this price.I believe you'll be very satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Watch!!","review":"I wear this watch for work.

But I was quite envious when it arrived - it surprised me how nice it was. I had the band adjusted down and it looks terrific on his arm. Not too heavy or bulky and he really enjoys wearing it.Other features like scratch resistant mineral crystal, 10 year battery, day/date, excellent indiglo night light and a very practical stainless steel clasp/band are a few of the things that make this a great watch for adults and some very fortunate children alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking, quality problem","review":"Love the way this watch looks and its glow-in-the-dark hands/markers, but it has a problem with keeping accurate time. I haven't totally figured it out, but I know that one problem is with the stem pulling out into the time set mode. It appears that sometimes it just keeps time slow. Whatever the case, I am going to return it and seek a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this watch but...","review":"This watch had everything I was looking for in a watch. Great looks, Indiglo, long life battery, all steel, water proof, very good reviews by others. The one thing I really needed was a rotating bezel as the description states. Strange how some reviewers state the bezel works great and others say it does not turn. Mine did not turn no matter how hard I tried. Sounds like there is a quality assurance problem at the factory. I sent mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing Wait","review":"I was excited to order this watch. I currently own a Timex expedition with a leather band which is wearing out so I was looking forward to the metal band.One problem right off the bat, which really upset me, was that the bezel ring did not rotate. One Amazon image show the bezel rotated. I requested a refund immediately.Everything else seemed to work fine including the Indiglo (I am a huge fan of this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works as promised","review":"I've had this compact flash card for a few months now, taken hundreds of pictures with it, filled it to near capacity with images and movies from my Nikon Coolpix 4300, and haven't had any problems. I don't have any experience with other kinds of CompactFlash cards in my camera to compare the write speed of this Viking card to, but I can say it has worked flawlessly for me. Its important to keep in mind that the speed at which a digital camera can write to a card is usually limited by the internals of the camera more than the card itself, so buying an incredibly fast card may not help the camera's write speed.

I am so disappointed in this set...the picture, and sound, quality is exactly the same as it was on the original DVD set. It's in stereo, not 5.1 sound, and the picture still looks like a VHS tape.The performances on the 1st DVD are terrific, don't get me wrong. The Royal Albert Hall show is great, as is the bonus disc.

It's really a gourmet dehydrator food cook book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I;m a camper not a cooker","review":"My husband and I are avid campers, and granted we like to eat well. But a nice grilled steak or a trout with lemon slices and pepper wrapped in foil with a salad on the side, takes only minutes to prepare and is just as good to us as a meal we would spend hours at the coleman to make.And those meals would leave us time to play in the woods, swim, or sight see. Granted the book has some cool ideas and tips but as a cookbook to the dedicated camper instead of the gourmet, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a Book","review":"I thought this was a book - a simple book for children to read.

Thank you, Scott Mutter for allowing me to truly see what my eyes would merely glance at"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a few good images...","review":"Although this book contains a few great images (the Library, the Escalator, the Grave), the price of the book is definitely not worth it. I had seen Mutter's images on posters, and figured the rest of his images in this book would be just as intriguing. I was wrong. Most of his images in this book have little artistic value, and seem like cheap photographic gimics. Save yourself the money and just look at his posters. If you see one you like, buy it--don't waste your money on this book. If you're looking for an exceptional photomontage book with tons of great images, check out Photo Synthesis by the original photomontage master, Jerry N. Uelsmann."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd rate photomontage","review":"Compared to Jerry Uelsmann's work, these images are boring, unimaginative, and technically mediocre. The book also suffers from misregistered half-tone printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bass response for a two piece system!","review":"I bought these primarily for a speaker that had a headphone jack (neccessary for listening to streaming music online late at night). What I didn't anticipate was the extraordinary bass reproduction from a two piece system. Right now I am listening to a Beethoven Cello Sonata, and the bass tones from the cello are felt in my chest! I am amazed because I thought I would need a subwoofer to get realistic bass. Quite simply, I feel as if sitting right next to the cellist. For the price this is well worth every penny. And the headphone jack is a nice bonus that a lot of speaker systems don't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent computer speakers","review":"I bought these speakers to improve the awful sound of my laptop computer. They are a lot more powerful than I thought. They have deep, clear bass and reasonable treble separation. I like the built-in AC adapter, the separate bass/treble and volume controls and the front mounted headphone jack. The size is fine for my needs, about 9 inches high. The downside is that there is a little distortion at very high volume, but not at normal listening levels. Construction quality seems to be OK, though this is the first Labtec product I have owned. All in all, a pretty good sounding speaker for the price. Certainly not audiophile, but for those looking to upgrade their computer sound at a reasonable price, the Spin 60 speakers are worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Speakers are AWESOME!!","review":"These speakers have great sound quality, and they also have great bass and trebble control. I listen to music that demands good base and they work great! I use them with my portable CD player and my computer, and for both they can handle the bass turned up all the way without sounding snowy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great low priced speakers","review":"I bought these for the office since I didn't really need the high end, high watt speakers there.

I've had mine for a year now and they are suprisingly powerful for their size. I use them w/the CD player on my Linux box. For your average computer user (non-gamer) I do not think you can do better for the price (and that's backed up by my research prior to purchase.) I have a three speaker system on my other PC that includes a subwoofer but I have to contend w/extra cords and underdesk space for a subwoofer that has to compete w/a waste basket, cables and an under desk tower unit for space. I wish I knew about the Amazon price then! If you are looking for a low profile set of speakers these are the best sounding for the money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I found these speakers to be average. you would be better off going with the $5 speakers available at any office supply store. the sound was decently loud, but quality degraded as the sound went up. the actual shapes of the speakers are not as pleasing as the picture might make it seem."},{"rating":"2","title":"pink and chocolate bedding","review":"I bought this bedding in July 2007.

I received this cable and it is much worse due to artifacts then my component cables.There are large white/black diamonds and blocks (several pixels) every few seconds that appear randomly all over my screen for split seconds. HDMI is digital so I figured it is either on or off. Correct, but there still can be interference, and the single may get messed up, and this creates artifacts.Anyways, if you have any doubts it really doesn't hurt to try these cheap cables.

The concepts aren't very clear and the book as a whole is unorganized; the first chapters refer to things in later chapters and makes everything hard to comprehend. The questions in the back of the chapters are difficult to ansewr because the content of the chapters don't help in answering them. In addition, there is a countless amount of spelling errors and numerical errors in the book. And this is the 6th edition of the book!! I expected so much more from this!! It makes me angry that this book is so bad. The cover is nice though if you get the hardcover edition, but i suggest getting the cheaper international edition because there are no color diagrams in the entire book. What a waste of 100 dollars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good as a sketchy reference for those who already know the material","review":"This book only seems to cover very high level concepts. Then, the end of the chapters contain problems (that our professor loves to assign) that only vaguely relate to the material discussed in the chapter. Several problems involve numerical calculations using formulas that you simply have to magically form out of thin air. No examples of how to work these problems are given.Also, the book's general explanation of concepts is absolutely horrible. They love to \\"explain\\" what they are talking about by providing a chart/figure/diagram labeled with numerous acronyms (that are rarely defined very well) that might as well be cave drawings because they describe these complex pictures so vaguely.I despise this book, and because of it, I despise the related class."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pitiful read.","review":"Sincerely, I know some people look at these reviews and decide to ignore them. DO NOT IGNORE THE BAD RATINGS this book receives! Trust me, to get a hold on digital computer achitectures and organization, look up the authors Mano & Kime for beginning logic and computer organization, and ESPECIALLY Patterson & Hennessey for all levels of technical readers. These (Patterson & Hennessey) guys wrote two different comp. arch texts that are widely considered the industry standard! AND...they have appendices to help explain the tought stuff! Trust me, enter their names and find those books. They are 5 stars compared to this 1 star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too many","review":"This book was a requirement for class, and one that the whole class (including the instructor) found to be a waste of time. It is VERY unorganized, and the questions at the end of each chapter are misleading. I read chapter 10 at least 5 times, and still couldn't answer most of the questions. Luckily when I got to class I realized that no one else could either. Hopefully in the future the professor will look into another book that promotes learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible.","review":"This book is beyond terrible. I have a B.S. in Computer Engineering, and looked at this book to help a friend out. I've never seen such a poor computer organization book. There are seriously no examples at all. End of chapter problems are impossible to do based on the information presented.If you are in a Computer Organization course, beg and plead with your professor to choose a book that you will learn from such as the Hennessy and Patterson book:Computer Architecture, Fourth Edition: A Quantitative Approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Complicated","review":"This book tries to over-complicate most of its subject matter. Many of its topics are more easily understood by referencing other texts (or even internet references). The end of chapter questions rarely seem to reference material read in the chapter. Rarely can you review an illustration or table that is on the same page that is referencing it. I almost got the impression that the author was trying very hard to display his intelligence by not presenting the material in a manner that could be understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"its a great book if youre a genius","review":"I just don't get what the point of textbooks like these is when you're expected to know everything to start with, or you're just supposed to magically understand everything from single sentence explanations that they give you. You just never quite know where the numbers are coming from and all the a - z symbols they start using randomly...so you go finding the meaning of those symbols and lose track of where you were originally. All that along with really useless complicated flowchart style examples render this book completely USELESS, and another $100 down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very easy to understand book","review":"This book doesn't contain any logic gate level designs but covers general computer organisation issues thoroughly. It is only 670 pages approximately and covers instruction set design, CPU structure (ALU + control unit), I/O (such as SCSI, FireWire and RAID), Bus systems (PCI, Futurebus+) and operating systems etc. There are numerous comparisons made between Intel Pentium and PowerPC. It is a good book to start with a very good bibliography for more detailed books on each chapter's subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is very technical in nature.","review":"This is a very technical book in nature and most people will find it very confusing. Stallings also jumps around when referring to diagrams and figures that a lot of times are on a different page from what one is reading. This book has no pictures, just drawings and diagrams, so I am surprised about the cost of this book. It is defintely not worth the $78.00 it costs. Many of the complicated computer explanations are just way over the head of even the educated reader such as myself. I would not recommend this textbook as a book for a college class. It is like reading the journal entry of someone's thesis to win an award on computer organization and architecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Depth","review":"This book is for someone who has no concept of computer architecture. The book discusses every area quiet vaugely. If you are looking for a book that will help you understand computer architecture then this is not the one. I would recommend you read \\"Computer Architecture A Quatitative Approach,\\" by Hennessy and Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy","review":"Why make it easy for the reader and come to the point? The authors of this book just use too many words. It is a waste of time to read all this blah, blah, blah. The concepts are easy in themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well organized, clear, easy to understand.","review":"I'm surprised that this book has pretty low ratings from other readers. It is well-organized, clear and easy to understand. I've gone through one other computer architecture textbook, and it was highly technical, and difficult to follow. Surprisingly, this text got good ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely difficult book to read","review":"If it were not for choosing this book, I might have passed the subject. What could be explained easily has been explained in the most difficult manner possible. Display of erudition should be left for research paper and not dumped on University students. The only reason this book sells is that there are few books that cover all those topics and faculties are forced to choose it. Don't buy it unless it is a required text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read under Protest","review":"This book was adopted by my CSci department for a Computer Arch course. The only reason I believe is because the instructor needed a book as obscure and difficult as he is. AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS! I was double stung by the fact that I had to wade through it's disconnected minutia and struggle to answer it's questions to pass a required course. I do not recommend it for students, professors OR the gentle reader. It is definietly NOT a learning tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but confusing","review":"I was asked to buy and read this book within the timespan of one month. After reading a couple of chapters I realized that this book caused more confusion than clearance on the subject at hand.I would not recommend this book to anyone, even if you have to purchase it for class."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst texts I have been forced to use.","review":"I am noticing a pattern with this publisher. Poorly organized text books, that provide little insight, yet take many pages with irrelevant diversions. Rather than present a theoretical basis and build on it with examples, it consists of examples, and unrelated scraps of information, that build to confusion without understanding. One of the worst texts I have been forced to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good material - poor presentation","review":"I'm a college professor and used this book for a class. I wish I could give this book a better rating because it does have more good, current information in it than any other book I've seen. Unfortunately, this information is presented in such a condensed, high-level and (sometimes) incomplete manner that's it's frequently very difficult to understand. The author needs to spend more time explaining the concepts he presents. He needs to give more examples, simpler examples and more detailed examples. There need to be more end of chapter exercises and the exercises need to be less ambiguous and more closely related to the material in the chapter. For a beginning course in computer architecture, this book is too high level. Another downside for using the book is that all of the exercise and test solutions are available on the internet. This essentially renders them useless for assessment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent material, absolutely terrible questions.","review":"This is by far the worst textbook I've had yet in college. The material is more of a broad, vague reference that teaches you the basics of the material. This wouldn't be so bad if the questions were the same way. The questions are the most in depth and ridiculous things I've ever seen in a textbook. They require a deep, grad-student level understanding to answer them correctly. If I were you, I would Google \\"Computer Organization and Architecture 7th edition solution manual\\" to find a free solution manual. The questions are mostly the same in the 7th edition as they are in the 8th and it helps you to see how useless this book is. Shame on you William Stallings. Don't get this if you don't have to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eighth edition - introduces new content (?) and errors","review":"I'll mirror the less favorable reviews regarding the content in the chapters and the exercises at the end of each. It would be nice to learn enough from the pages in the book to answer them, without having to refer to outside resources that provide much better explanations of the content. If you knew enough to fill in the gaps left in the reading material, for what reason would you still need to buy the book?What bugs me even more is to find all sorts of errors in the book at this price. Yes, writing a book is hard work, but if the proofreaders can't catch a decimal value in a binary field... The first year/first printing of a new edition should be half-priced.At least the publisher should host a wiki to allow these errata contributions rather than waiting for the errata sheet to be released. Maybe Amazon could offer user-submitted errata for books it carries?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive book","review":"This book is really comprehensive and up-to-date. It covers the subject in sufficient details with good examples and illustrations. The main problem of the book is that it is too dry and not very easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to understand","review":"The concepts are difficult to understand, the book is dry and the information is less than insightful and implementable. My first computer science course required this book and without the professor's assitance I do not believe that I would have fully grasped the main points the book attempted to convey. This is a poor book when it comes to teaching students the basics of computer organization and architecture, and its implementation will require additional sources and teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"This book is written using a very sparse manner of exposing ideas. Reading it is a hard and exhaustive task. I can't imagine why would they give it the 1996 TEXTY award. Buy it only if you are required to do so or if you can handle some sort of dynamic reading. Otherwise get something else (there are many other publications on the subject) since this is just a boring and demotivating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst textbook I've ever used","review":"The editorial review's first sentence is laughable. This book is the farthest thing from \\"clear.\\" The material is not fully explained. Questions at the back of each chapter don't closely relate to the material presented in the chapter. You are left making uneducated guesses as the chapter doesn't educate you on the subject. Variables in equations are not fully explain. Furthermore, examples using real numbers are not presented. I have learned nothing from this book. I hope instructors will stop using this book in their classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those of us who graduated a while ago.","review":"I have been in software for 20+ years and recently had to begin dealing more with the hardware side of the business again. I realized that some of my knowledge was a bit dated and found this book very helpful. I suppose it could be a heavy read but it was exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I followed this book in my undergraduate studies and what I remember very precisely is that I did not like it. William Stallings's way of writing is always dry, i.e., reader does not feel it interesting to read. This is by far the biggest negative aspect of this book. In addition, it is difficult to follow as well.There are far better options there, the best one is Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated concepts are easier to understand","review":"I appreciate Mitchell's ability to present psychoanalytic constructs and theories in an understandable manner. Make sure to read the introduction; it's a great review / introduction to this material."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title Says It All!","review":"While I was rather disappointed after highly anticipating the release of Surrender to the Air, my faith in the potential for Trey to make a good solo album was more than renewed when his self-titled album came out. It was only a few years ago that I stumbled across a bin containing some of his other solo releases at a music store, most of which I purchased on the spot. I would say that none of them lived up to my hopes, but this one was, as another reviewer mentioned, essentially un-listenable. I understand the rights of an artist to venture into avant-garde musical explorations, but when the groove isn't even there, it tends to lose me. It's especially frustrating when considering so many of Trey's compositions from the early eighties through most of the nineties that were brilliant combinations of creativity, chops, song structure, lyricism, and tonal exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron's the man!","review":"What a great CD from an amazing performer! I played some of Ron's CD for my high school jazz band, and their jaws hit the floor. They were even more amazed when we had the good fortune to feature Ron as a guest artist with our jazz bands. His electric personality and virtuosity on every low brass instrument and voice made for a great time for all. Enjoy the CD, and if you ever get a chance to hear Ron live, fasten your seat belt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next disc!!","review":"Ron is a monster bone player that I have had the honor to hear in person for many years in San Antonio, whenever I attend an annual music convention. He displays a great flexibility, outlandish range, and just a velvet-like tone on both tenor and bass trombone. He is a tremendous human being as well, just a super guy, with absolutely no hang-ups, which I think is very cool. If you are ever in town; check him out, and BUY THIS CD !!!! I promise that you will be glad you did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"A great album with a lot of energy. I often listen to \\"Caldonia\\" first thing in the morning, better than coffee!The only negative I have is that it's over to soon.

Not only is that scary for a book on Jesus \\"secret\\" teachings but there is nothing really new or revealing described here. Have we gotten to a point where anyone can put a captivating title on their book and publish any kind of boring cocopheny they want? So what do I do with all the beautiful om's and Indian chants I learned now which certainly predated Jesus? Throw them out? Also, was so boring I kept falling asleep. Be careful of reviewers who have only one book they reviewed. The one being sold. Always suspect they are the authors friends or publishers shills. I wouldnt mind if this was new age, but have no idea as to what one would do with this info presented here. I was so intigued that Jesus in Aramaic would give a whole new slant on Jesus's teachings. It does not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but Flawed","review":"Interesting in that it may open the eyes of some people to the actual Aramaic language spoken by Jesus and His contemporaries; flawed for the author again creates imaginative 'translations' which are merely new agey *interpretations* of Jesus' teachings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"The only complaint that I have about this book, is the explanation (which is repeated at least once per chapter), that this is merely the author's own interpretation of Scripture, and he encourages his readers to do their own research. While I am no expert in the Aramaic language, I do have some understanding of the nuances of the Semitic languages, and how difficult it is to translate from one language to another. So this particular translation is merely one of many. This author's interpretation of the Holy Scripture does give me pause, and I intend to learn some Aramaic, and study such early Bibles as the Dead Sea Scrolls, so I may have a deeper understanding of the Bible and Jesus' message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Blues fans- This is a must own, you won't regret it","review":"Please read the other reviews because they are all true. This band is great! I listen to everything from Hard Rock to Blues. I purchased this on a chance just because Corey Sterling sang on it. I figured if it was half as good as Kenny Wayne Shepherd it would be worth it. Boy was I wrong, this is better than KWS. Every song is quality song writing and performed great. I can't stop singing in my head the song \\"Born with the Blues\\", just a great great blues song. Also check out Corey Sterling and Chris Aarons other cd \\"get off\\" also good. They also played together in a band called American Standard. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers beware","review":"I bought this item, but i didn't read the little sentence that said that the tray is sold separately, so I ended up paying 9 bucks for just the jug. I would have had to pay an additional [...] (item + shipping) to receive the tray also. Does that make sense? In my opinion no, because one can't function without the other. In addition, the picture is misleading showing both items, but when the red tray is shown it only has the tray, so that's inconsistant right there. All in all, it's a horrible deal for around 18 dollars and a bad way to market this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this thing?","review":"This book is totally weird.

This is not Larry Keel's best, but it is still good. What makes Larry Keel such a fascinating bluegrass guitarist is the aggressive edge to his playing that makes him immediately identifiable. This album is more mellow than some of Keel's other albums, and features less of his aggressive edge, making it less distinctively Keel-esque, but it is still a fine album with a diversity of sounds. In particular, Just Havin Fun stands out as an unexpected gem, delving a bit into western swing, and showing off Keel's unexpected skill on electric guitar. God Don't Never Change also stands out as one of the darkest tracks Keel has ever recorded. This is a fine album, and well worth picking up for Keel fans, but it isn't as essential as The Larry Keel Experience albums (in particular, The Sound), or Magraw Gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"synonym overuse","review":"I purchased two Tawni O'Dell books, Sister Mine and another; I am a somewhat avid reader and this is my first typed Amazon review.

She did not disappoint.Tawni O'dell is masterful at examining the human condition. Relationships that are developed are poignant. The themes of reconciliation, acceptance, forgiveness,and self awareness(to name those that immediately come to mind)are addressed in a beautifully written prose. She gets it!! And she helps me understand and emphathize more with situations with which I've had no experience. We are our brother's keeper.This book, along with Back Roads, took me longer to read than usual because I go back and reread paragraphs. I'm awed by her turn of a phrase.

The separate, metal, non-stick pot is more useful than the glass or stoneware pot that is used in other designs. For instance, it's possible to brown the outside of a roast directly in the pot on a stove and then transfer it to the heating tray to finish off with slow cooking. The heating element has a simple 1 to 5 dial to set the temperature, and it can actually be set low enough to allow a 8-10 hour cooking period. The carrying bag and snap-on lid are also nice extras. I didn't give it five stars because I'd like to see heavier metal for the pan, and maybe a light to show that the heating tray is on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned Item - heating element not sufficient","review":"I have a 35 year old West-Bend slow cooker that works better than this one, except the teflon finish is quite worn. Tried to cook a roast and a stew in this new cooker, and after 10 hours it was not quite done. Not happy with product, feel it may have been defective. Heat was not evenly distributed; the pan itself seemed very thin and not of good quality (like an inexpensive light-weight teflon fry pan,that you use a few times and have to discard). Also,it really doesn't have handles; just a slight \\"roll-down\\" at the 2 sides. Item photo deceiving. Returned a week ago. Waiting for credit on my account. Like West-Bend products; may try another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for RV or Home","review":"I bought this slow cooker for our RV. Love it!! I have taken it out of the RV, into the house & back to RV. SO, I just bought a second one so I have one in the house & RV. I did buy this one with tote, this time.

This one is nice, but does not travel as well as I thought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very versatile","review":"I asked for this as a gift - planning on using it in our RV - kind of an alternate for the old crockpot. I tried it out at home and I may just have to get a second one to leave in the RV! The pot is spacious for it's size. The recipes give guidelines for faster and slower cooking speeds. I tried a pot roast and it cooked perfectly in the specified time. I have also used it for slow-cooked spaghetti sauce. I like the fact that you can remove it from the base and refrigerate it. Much more useful than a crockpot. It goes back on the stove for warm up, and the tote allows you to take it for potluck suppers. I have also found the base to be a perfect size to hold a couple of ceramic dishes with hot dips for a party. The glass cover can be used for a serving dish and cleanup of everything is a snap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Slow Cooker","review":"Nice slow cooker, purchased as a gift.

I have these both on LP and on the original CD releases. These are defining albums for a solid rock band that went ballad goey in '76 after R.E.O.

Guiles Band. Sophisticated Lady was my big favorite, but there are many other songs just as good. This is more good memories for me from my High School days, yes I was too young to go clubbing in High School but this education came from my older brother, and I took to it.So here's the deal, if you like the old roadhouse rock from the early 70's you might really like this set.

I had been a fan of REO for a couple years before that concert. I have seen them many times since then and still listen to their music to this day. REO II is one of my favorite all time rock albums and I have owned it on CD for many years now. I have searched the internet high and low looking for their first album but never have been able to find it on cd. Until now that is. The release of this 2 album/cd is long overdue. Even though I have owned REO II for sometime, I still purchased this cd since it is the only way I know of to get that rare REO debut album in cd format. All the songs are there and it sounded great on my home and car systems. I highly recommend this double cd combo pack since in my opinion REO II is the best REO album ever and as a bonus you get the rare first album on cd.

Unfortunately, this pan does not perform anything like silicone baking mats, and it's surprising KitchenAid would put its name on it. A couple of hints that this would not work: first, this pan's silicone is not the same shiny, slick stuff as the Matfer or Silpat baking mats--you can see it and feel it in its dull, rougher texture. Second, the brief instructions call for oiling the pan (!)--why should silicone have to be oiled? I went ahead anyway, with horrible results. Cranberry-orange loaves stuck badly and fell apart; french bread and honey-wheat bread stuck; bar cookies stuck....The highest temperature I used was 385 degrees, and yet the pan gave off a synthetic, burning rubber smell each time--disconcerting, to say the least.

At the end of the video you learn that the Magill's wanted to spend a summer driving through Alaska in their RV.

Slowly but surely, every one has failed with the most common failure being the small guage and low quality wiring that takes the sound from the input contained within the left headphone case over to the right headphone. The wire is very thin and fails internally after a short time. I have talked with the quality control manager at Califone and even sent him several failed units; they claim there is nothing wrong with the design, yet we all experience the same failure in wiring that renders the right channel inoperable.

Within 30 to 45 minutes he began complaining about the same thing those other reviewers noted, that there needs to be a foam pad or something inside the ear cushion areas to stop the hard plastic in there from pushing on the ear ---- which really becomes irritating.Our son tried three or four times, but had the same irritating result each time.

The style in which it is written is unworthy of any bard, especially Gabrielle. Childish and choppy, the text reads more like a rant than a narration. While Gabrielle may babble and ramble on in normal conversation, any scrolls she would have written seriously would have had some form of elegant expression. The only credit to give are a few interesting references to episodes, but not enough to make the book work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny must read book as told by Bard Gabrielle.","review":"This is some of the stories of Xena and Gabrielle's adventures as told through the eyes of Bard Gabrielle. Only Gabby could put a funny twist on a bad situation. Gabby is able to tell the stories how she likes without wondering when she will get that look from Xena. This is a must read book.

This is an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its pretty good","review":"Not the best xena book ever, but very funny.

Nothing new about Xena or any other character is revealed. And although it is told from the point of view of Gabrielle, it is unconvincing. But, I believe that the addition of this book to ones Xena collection is an unfortunate necessity for rabid Xena fans (such as myself) in order to make said collection complete. We can only hope that future books are better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste, Unfortunately","review":"Unless you're a hardcore Yardbirds fanatic who must own everything ever done by them, you'll want to save your money and NOT buy this piece of rubbish.No liner notes, no credits, no nothing.

If you happen to listen to the other guy who raved about this album and buy it, listen to the first song's snare drum reggae intro and then skip to the next song and then skip again and again until you get all the way through it, because that's the only reggae you're going to find here.

Some basic points are acceptable, such as Sufism not being apart from Islam; however, Sufism is not just an accentuation of Islam, as Sedgwick would have you believe in the first few chapters.He completely dismisses the intellectual founding of Sufism, making it appear that someone as great as ibn Arabi is just impossible to understand and thus not worth the effort. If you are really interested in Sufism why bother with the supposed social, cultural and historical elements that Sedgwick claims. There are better Western authors to read, who have much deeper and correct insights.....If you just want to have the very basics you are better off looking into a dictionary or encyclopedia of religion.

This is the most evil sounding isht i've heard in ages.

This is a must-have CD for aspiring oboists. My oboist wife is especially fond of the first Krommer concerto and the Hummel piece. The First Concerto is very much in the style of Mozart while the Second Concerto sounds more like Beethoven.

Apply it (sparingly) to the cloth first, then go over in sections on the wood. This product contains polyurethane and ammonia - it will bring out a nice shine on a prefab floor, BUT IT MAY CAUSE GOOD WOOD TO HAZE OVER IN WHITE BECAUSE AMMONIA STRIPS OFF THE FINISH!

The back end screws off and reveals a needle that can be used to reset the Visor. It slips into the existing stylus holder on the Visor.Cons: Shorter and lighter than the stock stylus, which was an annoyance both in my hand and in the holder. The writing action (ink and roller) of the pen is horrible! A 49-cent Bic pen writes much better than this. For $14.00 I was expecting something of higher quality. Fortunately I bought this at a local store and was able to return the product the next day.Bottom Line: It isn't nearly worth the $13.95 it costs. Save your money and buy a better pen/stylus combo, or look for Pilot Pen's T3200 pen/stylus (retail $7.99)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, but useful","review":"OK. It works. That's about all you can say. The back screws off to reveal a flimsy reset pin. To expose the pen, you have to remove a tiny cap.

Good for a quick signature, but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Fit","review":"I thought this was a clever replacement for the plastic stylus that came with my Handspring, however, I replaced this after a few months and bought the rainbow stylus pack. Using the pen was a pain - by the time you unscrewed the top you could have grabbed another pen and written your note. The stylus is weighted oddly, too - it seems to be top heavy. But the worst thing about it was after I put the screen film on my Visor, (to protect from scratching), I had to hit the screen hard with this stylus to register a stroke. There is no such problem with a rainbow stylus - or the original one for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the ink it writes (sometime) with","review":"Stylus is flimsier than the one supplied with the visor.

They did not fit any of my daughters barbies, only one shirt or skirt (can't remember which) was usable, the rest were way too small and useless.

Honestly, I kept reading through to the end, hoping that Corisande would stop acting so childishly and b**y to Donovan. He on the other hand deserved the designation of sainthood to have put up with her constant haranguing. I felt the same way about Pagan's Prize, another example of how the reader is asked to believe that the female lead's unrelenting shrewish behavior is justified in order to be a strong heroine.

Sadly, I read the entire book in the vain hope that it would get better. Nope! She was self-centered to the end. Oh, she was nice enough to almost everyone else. Just not the hero. Even when she found out how wrong she was about him, she still treated him like trash. The author tried to write in a backstory that would explain her horrible attitude and behavior.

The flat panel design is very nice, and I was glad to see they included wall/monitor mounts and stand-up mounts. The one negative I have with the speakers is the lack of a headphone port. To keep from distracting my wife's TV watching I had to purchase a splitter to come out of my tower with one path going to the speakers and one going to the headphones. A headphone jack in the volume control or flat speakers would have been much easier and nicer. Still though the system provides good sound for the music, and with the exception of the headphone inconvenience I rate this a solid buy for anyone interested in mid-range, moderate priced sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"These speakers are great!

Plenty of film clips and classic performances from \\"The Ed Sullivan Show\\" and Presley's own TV specials track the singer's explosive assault on the consciousness of his times, and the tragic end that, with hindsight, seemed almost inevitable. The film is marred a bit by an unnecessary narration with singer Ronnie McDowell as a less than convincing Elvis, and by the inclusion of some dramatic reenactments of key events in Presley's life.

I have no interest in militia rednecks, which seems to be the focus of this book. I really wanted to like it, but alas, did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, original, clever.","review":"As a first time reader of carl hiaasen, I have to say that this man can really write believable characters, of which there are many in this story. I thought he exploited the religious extremist factions of the south particularily well, in a way that was biting and funny, without being cruel. Mr.Hiaasen was able to engage me, make me laugh (which can prove diffucult in writing) and tell a multi-layered story. I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Lucky As Usual","review":"Sorry to buck the trend, but while I enjoyed the book (how can one not enjoy a Carl Hiaasen book?), I felt it had a derivative quality that brought the score down substantially. The business of having something stuck to the bad guy's hand (this time a crab; in Double Whammy, a pit bull) was done before. Krome was too reminiscent of the good guy in Double Whammy. And finally the plot, even for Carl Hiaasen, seemed too far-fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"Unbelievable, poorly written, nonsense that was boring and a liberal wet dream where all things bad are conservative and religious and all things good are liberal."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY!!!","review":"C HIAASEN has perfect comedic timing in his writing. Over the top nasty humor leaves me questioning mymorals and sensitivities while I am sitting there reading and laughing. Powerful writing about the fragility about Floridaenvironment creeps into all of his books. His characters are unforgettable! His books make any trip or wait for an appointment shorter than you want them to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"Carl Hiassen develops his stories around events that actually happened in Florida. Of course he elaborates and stretches the stories but of course you have to live in Florida to appreciate how crazy things are here. I laughed out loud more that once and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. RB"},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottom of the Hiaasen barrel","review":"I've read a half dozen of Hiaasen's books and this one I would have to rank as the worst. The story was rather predictable and didn't surprise me, and the characters were all lackluster and unlikeable. The book's main themes were based on racism and religion, two genres which are not at the top of my comedy scale. If you are new to Hiaasen, I'd suggest one of my favorites, either Native Tongue or Stormy Weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most interestingly funny books I've ever read","review":"What a great book! My emotions ran the gamut. I smiled, got angry, laughed, felt disgusted, and ended up smiling again. Some of the reviews are quite cute, they can't imagine characters like the ones Carl Hiaasen created actually exist. Turn on your TV set people! Watching real live people like Chub and Bode is the reason I prefer to read. I first read this book last winter, and have read it twice since. \\"Lucky You\\" is great fun - period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author","review":"I think that Carl Hiaasen is a fantastic author. I would recommend any of his books. In this story, you are following a newspaper reporter and a woman down on her luck as they try to get back the lottery ticket she had stolen from her by two losers! The things that happen to these people are so hilarious and things you wouldn't even think could happen to people. There are a ton of characters, and the names can get confusing...especially since two frequently mentioned characters are Demencio and Dominico...but it is a great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carl, You Ain't No Kinky Friedman","review":"Carl shouldn't have to try so hard. After all, the protagonist is a hack columnist for a Florida newspaper (Wow, what a stretch! Hey, your Miami Herald teammate Dave Barry is able to push the envelope more than that!), but in Hiaasen's backbreaking effort to be droll, he does little but weave a heavy-handed, mean-spirited caricature of Florida's \\"little people\\" (in the sense that Hillary or Leona considers most of us little people).The net product is an ugly yarn that goes on too long. For a dark, misanthropic, sarcastic novel with outlandish characters that is actually funny, I recommend Kinky Friedman, who manages to amuse while getting his \\"politically correct\\" (guns and Republicans are bad) point across. Try \\"Spanking Watson\\" or \\"Roadkill\\" for some real fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Jesus Willy\\" that was a great book.","review":"\\"Lucky You\\" was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. After reading a long line of frivolous yet heart warming romance novels, it was good to read something so entertaining and free spirited. Bode and Chub's crazy beliefs and redneck antics had me laughing out loud. Then there was the pairing of Miss JoyLayne and Tom. What a treat it was to see these two get together. Thank you Mr. Hiaasen for writing such a wonderfully wacky story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and dissappointing","review":"Though I am a huge Hiaasen fan, this one left me cold. Several glaring typos and overt publisher mistakes evidenced a rush job. Has Carl fallen victim to shameless Floridian opportunism? Did Demi Moore wreck a good thing? Mediocre characters, a boring religious subplot, a thoroughly predictable ending, and no Skink. Native Tongue and Double Whammy are far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit for Hiaasen","review":"Okay. I'll admit it. I am a Hiaasen junkie. There I've gotten it off my chest!! Having lived in Florida for ten years, and having read all of Carl Hiaasen's works, the thing that most draws me to him is his wonderful ability to bring the reader to the Florida you never see in the tourist promos. The humor is fabulous, tongue-in-cheek. The ironies are endless. Imagine hooking up a \\"Skinhead Wannabe\\" and a Hooters girl as they all go traipsing around So Florida with two hate driven \\"trailer trash\\" who can't be happy with just one winning ticket!! And the glue sniffing scenes!! Hysterical!! A must read for anyone who loves a laugh, and wants an adventure without leaving the living room. Highly recommended by this devotee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite simply not Hiassen's best work","review":"I have read all of his books, including collaborative works with other authors. Typically I can't put his novels down, often staying up to all hours of the evening just to finish reading the complete text.\\"Lucky You\\" festers where Hiassen's other books shine. The action has become almost formulaic, as if the author felt the need to satisfy his contract more than he wanted to satisfy his readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiaason not at his best is still Hiaasen","review":"I thought Stormy Weather was laugh out loud funny. I thought Striptease was great until it was made into a movie which was tacky instead of funny. This book is enjoyable with the requisite environmental lesson about the developers polluting the Everglades and putting Florida Bay at risk but it does move along. Do I detect a softening and a bit of sentimentality? This is a love story- who wouldn't fall in love with the leading female protagonist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but worth reading","review":"The two bad guys in this novel are very well described but the black lottery winner and black highway patrolmen are not believable. He pokes fun at small Florida towns, some of which is accurate and some is run into the ground. Personally, this is the least enjoyable of his novels, but is still funny in many places. Take a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill slide ?","review":"As with so many authors, Mr. Hiaason's work has sadly weakened over time. Compared to the inventive characters and story lines found in Strip Tease, Double Whammy and Stormy Weather, Lucky You is NOT FUNNY. Strongly suggest that Mr. Hiaason returns to his original formula of \\"Skink\\" as the sub protagonist, surrounded by \\"Chemo-esque\\" type antagonists - who display new and exciting uses for - say - chum making machines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Hiaasen's Standards","review":"Carl Hiaasen is an outstanding observer of Florida. His earlier novels balanced a biting social commentary with a story that flew and outstanding humor. Unfortunately, \\"Lucky You\\" doesn't live up to the expectations which we've come to expect from Hiaasen. He almost comes across as one of the folks he lampoons, a characiture of himself. If you're in the mood from some good Hiaasen, skip this book and go directly to his next one, \\"Sick Puppy\\". You'll be so glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As He Gets","review":"Entertainment Weekly didn't think this book was that great. ER is crazy; this is Hiaasen at his best. Carl provides me with real \\"comfort\\" books, ones that I can curl up with, forget the world and just laugh and laugh. The only problem with this and his other books is that it ends.The only criticism that I would make is that Hiaasen sometimes try to carry his \\"hilarity\\" into descriptions of violent or unpleasant death. There are some things that just aren't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elsewhere","review":"If you've never read Hiassen before, I urge you to start with an older book--Skin Tight, for example. This book feels phoned in. The characters are awful stereotypes instead of the quirky and hilarious send-ups that Hiassen is capable of. The good news: Hiassen is getting back on track with his latest, Sick Puppy. I'd say Lucky You is the worst of the handful of Hiassen books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky You? No, Lucky Me!","review":"Once again, Hiaasen proves that he is a master at making you laugh hysterically and cringe in horror at the same time. Yes, I too miss Skink, but we must go on to other characters that only Carl can develop in such a bizarre way. I will never be able to look at a road stain or a little turtle in the same way. Hollywood, please don't try to destroy a a wonderfully funny novel like you did with \\"Striptease.\\" By the way, if you love Hiaasen, I know you will also thoroughly enjoy reading any book by Christopher Moore. Give him a try. If you don't laugh out loud countless times while reading his mystically demented tomes, you need an extra fix of humor. Write on, Hiaasen and Moore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I can't imagine why Kirkus and so many readers liked this book. With its smirking racism, cardboard characters, and a writing style that wants to be Elmore Leonard but misses by a mile, there is absolutely nothing to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Win The Lottery, Lose The Money","review":"Imagine winning the lottery, only to have your lottery ticket stolen from a bunch of skinhead losers with brains the size of a thumbnail. This is the premise of \\"Lucky You,\\" in which Hiaasen mixes humor, romance, gang warfare, and environmentalism all into a neat, lucky little package. Hiaasen's books aren't high art or great literature, but they're fun and funny -- the perfect summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Composition","review":"Research is expensive but presenting research without composition is worthless.

I know absolutely everything suggested or allegedly discovered in this book.Main idea is to buy the stock which has been down for a few days, and don't buy the stock which has been up for a few days because that is what the statistics says.And more annoying is that author continually insists the method above is counter intuitive. But is it?? IS IT??Nothing considerable. Tatal waste of money. I am really frustrated and angry that I bought this book so encouraged by other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"had potential","review":"I think that the results that the author finds are helpful and interesting, but this should have been a research paper instead of a $50 book. There is just too much fluff with the 1 bar graph, 1 line graph per page for 5 different results and a paragraph or two of explanation. It would have been better to present the table and then select one or two line graphs to give the reader the gist of the argument. The bar charts are completely useless.Essentially these statistical results show that being a contrarian pays.I think it would have been helpful if the author could have created a trading system out of all this data to present to the readers. I would have thrown in an extra star or two if it had good results.The \\"Free 7'day Trial of Larry Connors' Daily Trading Service\\" that is mentioned in-between EVERY chapter is very annoying.I literally read this 'book' in an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have had some great trades using this book","review":"Traditional technical analysis has you sell weakness and buy strength.

I think it could have been a lot better. The one chapter in The Girlfriend's Guide to the Toddler Years that deals with bringing another baby into the house was more insightful than this entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had hoped this book would provide more insight and ideas. I didn't feel it really addressed preparing children based on their ages and understanding, and I wanted to know what a two-year-old will be feeling and thinking about a new baby, and I was hoping for more ideas. There are a few funny anecdotes, but overall, I didn't find anything useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is HORRIBLE!!","review":"This book is absolutely awful. I read it to be informed and wound up being offended. If you feel this way about having another baby, you shouldn't! This book reads like first children are the greatest joy, and all the ones who come after that are just intrusions on your perfect little family. Ugh! There are many ways to prepare your home and eldest child for a new sibling, and none of them should involve this miserable and cruel piece of garbage. As for sibling rivalry- as one of four children, and now a mother of five- I can tell you that it only happens if you allow it to happen. Foster love between your children, and they will respond by becoming great friends.I can't believe there are really women who feel this way about their second babies. God help them. I threw this rotten book in the trash. Don't waste your money on it- go buy something to celebrate the new life growing inside you and the new member of your family!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy transition","review":"I followed the ideas in this book to have the least amount of conflict when brining home the new baby. I let my 3 year old be very involved in the whole process. We disrupted her life as little as possible and let her welcome the new baby sister. When the new baby was born, she was excited to welcome her new baby sister. She wanted to throw a birthday party for her while we were still in the hospital. She went with grandma and bought a cake, candles and presents. I called friends to come up and my daughter got to introduce her new baby sister. We have not had jealosy issues and it has been 3 months since bringing home my second baby and for being a single mom that is truely amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still want the book...but it hasn't arrived yet!","review":"I know this book, love this book, had this book and I gave it to a friend who was expecting.

This movie is one of my favorite Marilyn movies of all time and Jane Russell was the perfect actress to play Marilyn's friend. If you're looking for something thought-provoking and metaphorical then look elsewhere but if you're looking for a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously then Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is the right movie for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Marylin vehicle","review":"MY RATING- 7.6GENTLEMAN PREFER BLONDES is the mov that contains the immortal scene of Marylin singing \\"Diamonds are the Girls Best Friends\\".It's much more than that, it's a light romantic comedy with Marylin and Jane Russel finding their ideal and millionaire husbands. Most of the action occurs in a cruise in the Atlantic also with old Charles Coburn delivering good moments with both girls.If we compare this one to SEVEN YEAR ITCH or BUS STOP we see that they're obviously superior, yet somehow this one became famous probably to the color of Marylin's hair. In fact I conly count one or two really funny sequences, while other Marylin's movs have non-stop gags.Yet watch it, if you want to enjoy beautiful Marylin and Jane and some nice mov!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG ISSUE","review":"I love this film, but you have sent me the 2001 issue and not the 3 August 2010 one.

Here is Marilyn at her absolutely best andthis is why her legend endures not trashy bios or gossip. She was oneof the best comediennes ever in movies and certainly one of the most appealing stars. Jane Russell is equally good in a performance that has only just begun to be fully appreciated in the last few decades.

Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell star as nightclub singers and dancers who get caught-up in mistaken identity/ jewel thief plot. The DVD doesn't have too many extras -there is a news reel with the two stars in front of Mann's Chinese theater and a few commercials for other Marilyn DVDs but the songs are fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diamond of a Movie","review":"This is what a Marilyn comedy should be. With Howard Hawks' pacing, together with Jane Russell's performance, the support (often absent in a lot of Monroe's films) is present to create a movie that is genuinely funny and quickly moves. The teaming of Monroe and Russell is great. Marilyn is wonderful - incredibly funny (i.e., the scenes with the small rich kid) and as everyone knows, she gives a dynamite performance on \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.\\" She and Russell are also great on the other numbers. This is one Monroe movie where everyone seems to be at the top of their game. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fault in the Box","review":"So, what could be better than Marilyn singing \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\\" or Jane singing, \\"Is There Anyone Here for Love?\\"? For the price, any lover of Hollywood musicals should add this disc to their collection.While the listing here on Amazon.com correctly states that the film is presented in \\"Standard\\" format, the jewel case mistakenly indicates Widescreen format."},{"rating":"2","title":"first rate movie","review":"Wonderful movie. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell are terrific together. Lots of music, and great comedic skills from both of these stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Marilyn","review":"I thought that this was a good movie because it was very funny and well casted. For example Ms. Lee (Monroe) gets stuck in a porthole window.

How to Marry was somewhat less a mess but still not pleasant to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Yogic Text","review":"Although this book was highly informative and well written, it was not an easy read, nor an entirely pleasant one. I believe the reason mainly is for the dry and, certainly, scholarly translation. Nonetheless, it proved to be very helpful for me, and surely for those practicing Yoga of all sorts, whether it be Bhakti, Raja, Jnana or Hatha Yoga. It also includes the main doctrine of the Yoga student, as well as the disciplines involved. Within, one will also find positions in which to meditate and the diet one must take on. All in the frame of 90 pages, this book will surely enlighten those interested and will get a deeper understanding of the practice. The book is broken up into 5 chapters with some odd number of aphorisms. Along with each aphorism is the original Sanskrit text inbetween. I do highly reccomend the works of Vivikananda as well as \\"Hatha-Yoga Pradipika\\" by Vishnu-devananda. A book to be studied upon rather than just read, indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marilyn at her best.","review":"Very nice used set.

Her acting is fabulous and she looks great. I was torn into a millions bits watching this.

Dawn Powell turns what could be the stuff of melodrama--small-town girlhood with an unloving stepmother--into a deeply beautiful exploration of growing up and finding strength and beauty wherever you can. It is as smart as the very best of Tolstoy, as witty as Chekhov, as purely American as Mark Twain, and still as uplifting (and accessible) as any Oprah's Book Club selection could hope to be. It's an almost perfect book, and one you will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting autobiographical novel of childhood","review":"This is a novel closely based on the author's childhood, growing up in rural Ohio in the early 20th century. While Dawn Powell uses an adult's language, the perspective is a child's. Although there is nothing monumental about the characters or their fates, the depth to which the reader sees and understands them is a testament to the author's skill. The writing is exquisite and the story is gripping in its depiction of a child's resilience in the face of adults who fail her at almost every turn. I finished the book weeks ago and am still thinking about it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Story of Childhood","review":"Dawn Powell is one of my favorite authors and this is my favorite of her books .

It is a different type of yoga that combines floor aerobics, toning, and relaxation classes into 1 hour.You do sweat and get a decent aerobic workout, but in addition, after the meditation cooldown, you also end up feeling relaxed and your mind is clear. The background (natural setting in Maui) and Gurmukh's soothing voice add to the escape.Please be advised - you should probably stretch before doing the tape - otherwise you may end up with sore hamstrings and thighs like me the first few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yoga video so far...","review":"Its produced very well; gives a good sense of Kundalini, and is fun to do.

I agree with the reviewer from Canada that the \\"breath of fire\\" practice was lacking, and the jumping around throwing punches felt more like Tae-Bo than yoga. The deep relaxation part at the end was also very short.As a generic workout tape, it gets you moving around at least, but as a yoga tape, it's only so-so.

The setting is nice, the people demonstrating the workout are real, normal, healthy looking people, and Gurmukh seams like a wonderful person. But...I think this workout is crazy! I feel awful giving this video such a bad review, but it really rubs me the wrong way. I come from a background of dance and yoga, where you use control in your movements and body awareness to keep you safe from injury. At several points in the video, Gurmukh advises you to 'just go, don't worry about the form' and I can't agree with this approach.The workout is not what you'd expect from yoga, it's very fast paced, very cardio vascular, with lots of fast leg kicks and arm flapping, all done with this kind of 'throw yourself into it' approach. I know from taking dance classes for so long that you can really injure yourself by throwing your body around like this. Sorry Gurmukh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aerobics or yoga?","review":"I look forward to doing yoga to relax and streach. I thought I was in an aerobics or tae-bo class for awhile.

But it's a tour-de-force analysis of the human condition in a Louisiana setting by a womanizing, semi-alcoholic, lapsed Catholic protagonist who, despite (or by means of?) the hyterical laughter of the reader, sheds new light at every turn on the human condition.

You need some other book to accompany it to get a more complete and fair treatment of multivariable calculus. Chapters 1 and 2 are pretty good, but then the rest of the book is not sufficient.

However, the stress and time spent on certain topics could have surely been avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This text leaves much to be desired as an application-intensive calculus primer and fails even more miserably as a proof-intensive development of multivariable analysis. My complaints are,1) The writing style is convoluted, boring, at times directionless.2) I had to severely edit the proofs before they were respectable. Many of the proofs suffer from blatant flaws. ertain proofs are not even proofs, but conclude with the statement: \\"an obvious pattern emerges\\" as opposed to making the appropriate inductive argument.3) The definitions are unspecific and often involve mere hand-waving.4) The examples are unhelpful and not illustrative.5) This is just personal preference, but I really don't like Folland's topology notation and have frequent problems with the rest of his notation.There are better books out there. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Numerous Errors","review":"To be brief, Folland has a list of errata that is three pages long on his website to correct all the mistakes he made when writing this book.

His strength is straight-up blues with some rock dynamics thrown in. Unfortunately, this CD features very little blues. Bb blues is the only song worth listening to on this CD in my opinion. I love Chris and have seen him several times and I don't blame him for trying to stretch out and explore but here's the bottom line....he's world class at traditional blues/blues rock...unfortunately Romp focuses on the skills he is weak at...vocals and songwriting in shakey, undefined rock style.

Much like Stevie, Chris started young. By the age of fifteen, Chris was playing jazz and blues in Austin clubs. His first few albums solidified his hold on the title of \\"the next Stevie Ray\\". The thing is, Chris is worthy of your respect without labeling him the next anybody. Let somebody else be \\"the next Chris Duarte\\". \\"Romp\\" goes a long way towards showing folks that Chris isn't just another Texan with a guitar. In fact, most of \\"Romp\\" recalls Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Winter and Jeff Beck as much as or more than Stevie. Recommended cuts include \\"Do the Romp\\", \\"Fire's Gone Out\\" and \\"Bb Blues\\".

BOTH SMART, ENTERTAINING.","review":"Having read the book by Whitley Streiber, it's clear that the director of the movie took creative license. (There was no Indian and the Wolfen were not wolves, but werewolves). However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that both versions of the story worked well; with the movie having an interesting moralistic subplot. Although I enjoyed other werewolf movies (\\"American Werewolf in London\\" and the 1st \\"Howling\\"), \\"Wolfen\\" was refreshingly subtle in its depiction of the beast, giving only their perspective by using a \\"wolf cam.\\" Thus, \\"Wolfen\\" is a good choice for those who enjoy intelligent thrillers as opposed to blood-splattering slice and dice horror films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deleted Scene - ** Stars","review":"Wolfen is a rare werewolf movie that isn't all Hollywood hokum. This absorbing and suspenseful movie makes a strong social commentary about how much we know and asks the question which race is truly superior.If you're looking for the traditional werewolf movie, Wolfen is not it. If you're looking for a well made suspense drama with great special effects, Wolfen is a 4 Star movie to see.Wolfen is a beautifully transferred DVD that has great picture quality - the only problem is that Wolfen has a deleted scene in the bar with singer Tom Waits.Are studios so in a rush to make a buck that they are deleting scenes, leaving out sub-titles and essential dubbing?

While in most cases this is a recipe for disaster, I am glad to say WOLFEN is an exemplary case of the opposite. Michael Wadleigh directs a nice thriller with werewolf-ish undertones. His main stars, Albert Finney and Diane Venora, play an unlikely couple of investigators in some nasty murders that turn out to be more than just ordinary killings. Wadleigh builds the suspense to agonizing levels, throws in special wolfen p.o.v. cameraworks just for kicks and for the fans amongst all of us, this film packs a great early James Horner score. Also notable is a good undertone of suggestion as the metamorphosis of man into wolf is hinted at but not physically shown. Filmed in 1980 or 1981, it is now only dated for it's electronic equipment. A good film for anyone's collection, especially those among you who are interested in anything concerning wolves and werewolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite, but still a pretty good movie","review":"I liked the idea behind the werewolf being a spirit connected with the Native Americans--I wanted to see more gore and more of the actual werewolf character itself.

Misplaced confidence, as it were. This pan has shown itself to be easily cleaned afterwards, but certainly not Non-stick by any stretch of the imagination when it comes to retrieving the baked goods. The brownie doesn't simply \\"pop\\" out unscathed. The typical layer of cake residue is left behind just the same as in a metal cake pan. So, aside from being able to squeeze it into a cabinet nook, the results I expected from a silicone cake pan just haven't, ahem...panned out.Eventually, I will be trying another silicone pan.

What a great idea for our little ones!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Infant Toy !","review":"This is my favorite infant toy -- well-used by both of my daugthers (now aged 10 months and 30 months) when they were infants!

Well-worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"Yay! Something that keeps baby's attention while I work! I love that each toy has a discovery reward, like a soft rattle or music or stretchy material he can pull, etc. When we leave the house, I take Octopus with us and hook him by the plastic attatchment ring to the diaper bag or infant carrier, etc., so Baby can bring a friend along.

That and more. For awhile, it was a soft place for him to lie and look at stuff. Then it became stuff for him to kick, and figure out his feet and legs. Then, slowly, he started to be able to reach the pieces, feel their texture, and even trigger some of the hidden gems. (The sea horse, for example, makes music when you squeeze it - and is still making music after months and months of being played, although we havent change the battery, and cant figure out how to if it ever becomes needed.)My only question is the \\"12 months and under\\" part. He's already using it to pull up and stand, at under 9 months, and it isnt sturdy enough to hold him up. But for those first nine months, you'll want it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy baby, happy mom","review":"I received a Tiny Love playmat at my baby shower.

He loves to stare into the mirror and just in the last week has started looking at other toys hanging from it and swatting and wiggling at them. Mine came with a musical seahorse. The only difficulty has been finding more toys to hook to it, it has and handful of grommets for just such a thing. I've washed it since he has spittled on it and it came through fine. It folds for storing. It's a little wide, but very thin. I would recommend this to anyone as a great toy for a kiddo that can't crawl yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny Love","review":"My child loves this gym for tots.

When we first got it he would lay there and play with it for 30-45 min at a time. He is used to it now though so he doesn't spend that much time with it without getting bored anymore. The octopus is his favorite. He started out staring at it then started grabbing/holding it and now he has progressed to sucking on it. We got it for Christmas so we have had it about 3 weeks now. He will still play with it for a good 20 minutes before getting bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest toy","review":"I have a 6 week old little boy who likes to be held constantly. I can put him in his bouncy seat and he may last for about 10-15 minutes, and only that long if I am sitting and talking with him most of the time. I can lay him on his playmat and he will lie there happily for as long as 30 minutes---and I don't even need to be in the room with him. We actually have the deluxe gym that also has music, lights and a mirror, but he doesn't seem that interested in any of those items at this time. When we sit with him and praise him for successfully kicking or batting at an item he gets such a smile on his face.I would recommend this toy to everyone. The toys are movable so he won't get bored and you can add different items in different places.

Up until she sat up- my daughter would lie on her back and gaze at this toys and reach for them; it held her attention longer than any other toy. It also folds up nicely when you want it out of the way. The toys come off and can be taken in the car or stroller for further play. Can't recommend it enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites!","review":"I really like this playmat. My daughter played with it for HOURS at a time when we got it. It is really great because it has several toys that come with it (the mirror turtle being her favorite one), plus you have endless possiblilties in toys you can add on to it.I did have a problem with the sea horse, because after just a few times of playing, it quit working. I called the customer service number and they replaced it for free with no hassles whatsoever. And the representative was very friendly too (which is rare among the customer service departments I have ever dealt with)My only problem with the actual mat (and the reason I didn't give it all 5 stars) is because after one time of washing it, the red around the edges and in the pictures faded a LOT.Overall, though this is a great toy, and I know that if she wasn't too big for it now, my daughter would still be playing with it to this day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gymini","review":"I bought this toy before I had the baby. At the very beginning my newborn couldn't care less and I figured I spent my money on nothing. Now at 3 mos of age she is enjoying laying and looking up at her 'friends'. She bats at the figures and giggles at them and \\"flirts\\" with them too. I don't feel like I spent my money on nothing anymore... especially since at the age she is at now theres not much she CAN do. I'm pleased with this one.

I was hoping the silicone muffin pans would be an improvement over the metal pans, which have been difficult to clean, difficult to remove the muffins, and after a short time flake so that my muffins have little metal flecks on them.I bought a pan today, and my 13-year-old daughter used the pan right away. We noticed only a slight odor from the pan while the muffins were cooking. The muffins came out cleanly with only a slight push from the bottom of the pan. The muffins were cooked evenly and cleaning the pan was a breeze. I plan to buy more pans.The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is because it is necessary to use a cookie sheet or a \\"sled\\" under the pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't meet expectations :(","review":"I was very excited to see that several silicone items were being made by kitchen-aid, given their product history. I used to work in the food industry and silicone baking mats were indespensible to us. However, this is NOT the same stuff. As the other reviewer said, it produces a rubbery smell when baking (not appetizing, and not like commercial silicone mats) AND my muffins stuck to the pan like glue. If I have to use nonstick spray to prevent sticking, I'll just use my old metal muffin tin.Unfortunately I waited til more than 30 days after I purchased it to give it a try, and now I can't even return it. At least it was cheap when I bought it.If you want some silicone bakeware stick to silpat or matfer baking mats for now. They are great. As for formed bakeware, don't purchase these.I give the product 2 stars because it makes items in a muffin shape but doesn't live up to product claims of non-stick, and beacause of the icky smell it makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"First, I get no \\"rubbery smell\\" or any offensive odor when cooking in this pan. I use it about once a week, and have for the last 2-3 months.Second, you do have to spray it lightly with nonstick spray, but when you do the baked goods literally fall out of the pan when you remove them from the oven.I use this to bake egg/quiche \\"muffins\\" (single serving sized of baked egg/veggie/cheese mixture). They stick like glue without the nonstick spray. But with it, you can literally pick up one end of this muffin pan and tip all the baked goods out onto the counter with no sticking at all. Not that you'd want to do that--but you could!It's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware.....Saftey???","review":"The only way this works is you need to spray before hand alot of non-stick spray otherwise they will never be removed. Also it does need to be placed on a cookie sheet and then put in the oven. Lastly it makes a horrible burning rubber smell as it is cooking. Gave me a headache. This holds the same for all the other kitchenaid silicone bakeware. I have bought the majority as a set and have since regreted the idea. Stick to the old fashioned metal bakeware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchenaid Silicone Bakeware","review":"I did not have any problem with this silicone bakeware. It was wonderful. I followed the directions, sprayed lightly, baked, everything was absolutely perfect, and came out of the silicone bakeware like a dream (they advise that you let the food cool completely before trying to remove). Perhaps the people who had a problem getting their food out of the bakeware should review their recipes. Everything I cooked in each of my Kitchenaid silicone wares was fantastic and there was no silicone/plastic smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sold them at my garage sale.","review":"Unfortunately, if you have an older gas oven like we do, the temperature of your oven may actually be higher than the temperature at which you set it on the dial. This led to problems determining a safe temperature in which to use the trays. We were all hesitant to eat the muffins I'd made because of the chemical/plastic smell. I'm back to using foil muffin cups on a cookie sheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll be returning this one soon!","review":"I bought a cheapie silicone 6-cup muffin pan at the local department store. It has a nice slick finish on it and the muffins pop right out.So, I think, it's a GOOD idea to buy a KitchenAid 12-cup - because after all KA makes great stuff, right? WRONG on this one!Whoever thought it was a good idea to put a TEXTURED FINISH on this thing needs to think again - the muffins stuck in it just as badly as they stuck in my old metal pans - tried it the second time using nonstick cooking spray and that didn't help either!Don't bother with this one. Find one with a slick finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning tool","review":"Introduction to Management Science is a very well written text book that explains in detail the mathematical formulas that are used for determining the different solutions in each chapter.

Needless to say, seven months later, I am down to half of them working. These units are very durable to being driven over by the heaviest of vehicles but they are not water tight so the most common of elements, such as rain, will destroy them.

I do strongly advise reading it somewhere else.

The code itself is inconistent and of a poor standard, the authors follow no consistent naming conventions, and use extremmely non-descriptive variable names, eg. int a and String s.Chapter 5 is a nightmare for novices, introducing, in one poorly written chapter, the concepts of event-driven programming, choices, class structure, interfaces and more!

Well....I have come to find out that due to the poor quality of the brush heads they need to be replaceable because the metal bristles fall off during use and remain on the grill grates and can get on your food if you are not careful. I will be going back to a Weber brand brush.

Correctly criticizing previous histories of the period, Thurston falls into the trap that awaits most revisionist historians: he spends more time looking for information to disprove their arguments than building his own case. A major problem is the author's use of Soviet archival material. Dr. Thurston uses Soviet statistics to build his case often neglecting their obvious bias. For example, he notes that only 63,889 people were arrested for counterrevolutionary crimes in 1939 (119), while later noting that in the same year more than a million Poles from the eastern Ukraine were deported to Siberia (218). Nevertheless, the book is important for students and academic interested in the impact of the terror on Soviet society."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is not grounded in reality","review":"Robert Thurston maintains that the Stalinist terror was almost, not quite, an optical illusion. This is an example of poor scholarship, because a vast ocean of memoirs and novels of survivors reveal the horrible reality of those times. Generations of meticulous, brilliant and insightful scholars support the accounts related by survivors. Finally, the opening of the secret Russian archives provides final confirmation, if that is even needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure fantasy","review":"This book is quite simply fantasy in its most pure form.

The show its self is great, but they really dropped the ball in bringing it to DVD. The menu options link to incorrect content, and the audio quality is so atrocious that it becomes a major distraction. The problem with the audio is that it's too hot (loud), and as a result it becomes distorted and annoying. I thought it was either my dvd player or my TV until I played it in my computer and had the same problem.

Ignore the chapters on \`Not so universal education' and \`Is anyone in the schools listening'. McGuiness's \`sociology of education' is puerile. But the rest of the book gives a very good presentation of what appears to be one sensible approach to the teaching of reading. Even here, however, if one stuck to the presription without additionally stressing the need to teach reading for comprehension and reading in context, my guess is the result would be disaster.

One attempted to be objective and scientific, while offering hopes for parents who are agonising over their kids who can't read; another sought self-promotion by thrashing others and making outrageous claims based on skimpy research, hoping to make offers to parents who are agonising over their kids who can't read.A two-star book is not necessarily badly written or worth less a read than a five-star book. In fact, it may prompt you to think harder and read between the lines. Reading two books writing on a similar topic especially helps. If you are into reading difficulties, read Overcoming Dyslexia first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool blue deterrent!","review":"Had this for a couple of years and the blue blinking lites make ur car parked stand out from the rest and more then likely thieves will skip yours and on to the next victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful with this purchase","review":"I could not contact the manufacturer their number was disconnected .. the product description was inaccurate.

It's not about quality of gameplay, people.........it's about the bottom line. I could go into a 5 page dissertation on why I despise Verant and their company, and why the majority of people who are looking for a good gameplaying experience will walk away shaking their heads sadly....at the potential wasted, but I digress.

It was a directx patch for the new upgrade. Lots of other people have complained about sound and graphic since the last patch. Verant has refused to do anything about it and blames the dumb customers for the problems. I havent played in about a week and miss the game alot. I would buy S.O.V. if i was still able to play it.

Graphically it is nice, somewhat better than the original and Kunark. Content wise, is still your basic hack and slash. Only a few new \\"mobs\\" have been added, most are just old models with a new skin. As far as new quests go, there is a three way faction that the game designers are still monkeying with; I decided to quit playing rather than wait on Verant to come to a final decision. The game space added is negligible to many servers, as there is a build up of higher level characters to contend with in these higher level dungeons. I give it one star for the effort involved in making it. If it were designed from a players perspective rather than an accounting perspective it would have rated higher with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everquest just keeps getting worse","review":"Everquest was a fun game that gets progressivly more boring each level you gain. AT first I thought this game was excellent but as my character grew so did the problems, spending hours just trying to find monsters to fight, lag deaths, terrible customer service, and the list goes on. This expansion pack is no diffrent from the rest of the game. Aviod this like the plague and spend your money on the better upcoming online roleplaying games."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?

Worse, guards are now near invulnerable. What? Can't a guy have a little fun and slip a 6-inch dagger between a guard's plates and into his back? It's only an AI. I pray for the day that someone with a sense of fun (dreary drugdgery, which is what this game is starting to feel like after four months) takes over this company and point this world into the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this game","review":"First of all, this is only an expansion and it is an online-only game. Secondly, the company behind this game has a very poor history of customer support. If you take the time to do some research on the some Everquest's messageboard's...you'll discover the game has a lot of bugs. Verant Interactive, the company behind the game, frequently bans players from the game for little to no reasons, and cares little for their customers. I strongly recommend Asheron's Call, Ultima Online, or one of the upcoming role-playing games to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everquest","review":"Man i think wingbat7 hit it right on the nose.

Asking someone to preorder this game based upon NO information is an exercise in the gullibility of your customer base."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best expansion for EQ","review":"Verant finally has shown there is more than just Kunark. The Ruins of Kunark was good... Scars of Velious is BEST. This expansion is very well done. The art is exceptional, with the snow areas being shown in a most realistic fashion. This expansion also brings out the concept of grouping with others. For some this is a detriment, for others it is a welcome venture. For those who are solo players, this is not for you. Most creatures are designed too tough an obstacle for one person to take down. For those who like to group, this is a dream land. XP is given very well for even grouped folks, but made so a solo character will not see much XP gain for the creatures they will be able to defeat. I myself am a grouping person so I found this an exceptional buy. I thought kunark was good, then I bought Velious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and quality","review":"This watch is just how it appears on the site, a combination of light blue, silvery blue and gray. I like the easy functioning of the stop watch as well as the indigo feature since I use mine for an alarm clock while traveling. The only drawback I've experienced is that the colors don't hold up well in a chlorine pool; while it is waterproof, the colors turn a little green after being exposed to chlorine. I will not attempt to swim with it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst watch i've ever had","review":"i've been running nearly all of my life and buy a new running watch about every year or two. and this watch is by far the worst one i've had. the colored parts on the side came off. when i swam, it fogged up. then the first number \\"1\\" went blank so I could not tell if it was 11:00 or 1:00, etc. the color of the band also faded to a gross brownish color. i bought another one with the elastic strap b/c of the gross coloring of the other one, but the watch itself had all of the same problems, except that this time the whole thing went blank after a couple of months. i used to love timex iroman watches, but this model sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex Women's Ironman Triathlon Sleek 50/100 Watch","review":"This watch did not last long in the water even though it said it was waterproof for 200 meters.

She can't use it for any major activity as the watch falls off. The band is kept on by four hooks. I would not recommend this type of wristband on any Timex. (Timex refused to warranty the wristband.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"They keep getting worse","review":"I have had at least five of these watches over the years and it used to be that I only had to replace it about every two years and only because the band finally broke, (I'm pretty hard on them, wear them all the time and do lots of sailing) but the amount of time they last has dropped a lot! On one of them a button fell off the first week, my last one hasnt even made it a year and started leaking water right away, now if you go NEAR water it fogs up and if you are in direct sunlight it goes blank. I used to love Ironman watches but never again for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 4 months","review":"I really enjoyed using the interval training piece to this watch. Unfortunately, the watch broke after 4 months. I went swimming in very shallow water and later that day the display disappeared. And now I get to pay another $8 for shipping and handling fee even though it is covered under warranty. I won't be buying another Timex. As good customer service, they shouldn't be charging the customer MORE money for their problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible band, watch fogs.","review":"(Posting for my 15 year old daughter who runs track.) This watch is not for an athlete. The band is a terrible design. The \\"Y\\" connection pulls away from the watch, letting the watch FALL OUT while you are running. It also turned yellow/brown after 30 days of use. The watch fogs when it gets damp. (A triathlete swims... and certainly sweats!) Poorly designed watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unreliable","review":"Nice design and number of functions. Unfortunately bad quality.

I didn't mind at first when the first one just got faded to a muddy shade of clay, but when the band lost grip of the watch I thought it was a singular problem. The second watch I bought to replace it separated band from watch before I even had time to complain about the color fading.

The watch will just pop right out when I take it off. On one occasion it fell out when I put my child in the car seat. If I hadn't found it I obviously would have been left with only a band and no watch. Certainly not worth the money when the risk of loosing it is so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not water resistant!","review":"I bought this watch less than a year ago, went swimming with it and it fogged up.

Finally the battery died at around eleven months and I won't be replacing it. The thing I don't like is that you can't replace the strap.

It is good as new, though did get a bit scratched up..... and VERY clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functionality is great, but the strap does not last.","review":"This would be a good watch if Timex would provide a better strap. The functions are easy to set and it has a great 'night light' that has lasted the year or so I've owned it. The trouble is the strap, it cracked and broke. The strap is glued to the watch body, so not replaceable. Come on, Timex, if you're going to attach cheap resin bands to your watches, at least make them replaceable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch popped out of band","review":"I purchased this watch at Wal-Mart, and after a month or two the strap separated from the watch on the side of the buckle. It pulled away from the watch where the two upper buttons are located. The watch could be hooked back into the strap; but the strap remained loose and the upper part of the watch separated from it frequently. This continued for another month or so until today, when the watch popped completely out of the strap and was lost somewhere. This is a terrible design and I would never purchase another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"The final decision on purchasing this sports watch was that it had multiple (3) alarms... I run and cycle and use it to time my workouts as well. So far I have used the lap/interval feature just once; seems easy to use. The other features are quite easy to navigate. I like the watch's small size and the color I selected-gray/blue. It doesn't overpower my small wrist like the black ones I used to wear.I do like the multiple alarm feature plus the capability of setting a repeating alarm for weekdays-only if needed. Wish that the alarm was a bit louder...The Indiglo has changed from other Timex-s and Nike I've owned in that the digits light up instead of the face of the watch. The display is not as immediately readable unless it's very dark outside.Hope that the band will last and not break easily (as other reviewers experienced) since it is a bit stiff. I've only had my Timex for a few weeks and so far I am pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not wear in the water.","review":"I got this watch primarily for running for which it was fine. After having it for a month I went on vacation and did some water jogging with it on. It was not in the water an excessive amount of time perhaps 2 or 3 times for a half an hour but the displayed filled with water. The watch still worked but beeped every 30 seconds or so for another month at which point it stopped working. Yes it has a warranty but it doesn't include water damage. I find the fact that you can't wear in the water (even though it has a water resistent rating) curious for a triathlon watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and easy to use","review":"This watch is great, unless you need a loud alarm. The alarm and timer beeps at a very high pitch and not very loudly. It is sleek, comfortable to wear and very easy to set. I especially like the up / down options when setting time / alarm / timer. Personally I bought this (and one in another color) for refereeing soccer and the alarm at the end of the timer countdown is way too soft to hear on the pitch. So I'd recommend the watch, but not if you plan to rely on it as an alarm clock or timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent functionality but no durability","review":"I bought this watch for working out and was impressed with the readability and chronograph functionality. However, a little over a year into usage, the band completely severed and I don't think there's any way to replace it because the band is not a typical watch band. I've tried using superglue and duct tape to keep the two parts of the band together but it only holds up for a couple of days before falling apart again. If you are looking for a durable watch, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"I'm on my second timex womem's ironman triathalon sleek 50/100 watch and this one already fell apart. The first one completely died even with trying to put a brand new battery after getting caught in the rain while running. I got the same watch, giving it another chance because I really like the design. This time, the watch part just completely fell off of its band. The straps for the watch were not at all well designed and to my disbelief the whole thing just fell apart on me ... and its only been 3 mos. since the new watch! As much as I loved the design, I would highly NOT recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, comfy watch...3 alarms are great","review":"Good Timex watch so far...easy to set times.

Not overly large - fits my smaller wrist nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and switch?????","review":"The watch I received was not as pictured.

Not at all as attractive as the pictured item."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok as a basic book but pretty uninspired","review":"This is a good general introduction to cryonic and nanotech life extension, but barely touches on a lot of the issues therein. Clearly written to be a popular piece instead of a \\"substantial\\" one. The Socratic question-and-answer format makes it seem more of a straw-man argument than one would hope. There are many better books on nanotech out there, and though I applaud the author for trying to raise public awareness of cryonics as legitimate science, he goes too far towards pop culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use it for my Toddler Son","review":"I use this for my toddler son when we go out in public so he doesn't get pee everywhere. It is great to keep in the car and have your kids pee in the parking lot so you don't have a cart full of groceries and hear \\"I gotta pee right now!\\" It kinda leaks, so make sure you empty it out. Very cheaply made with rough edges, but I just used some sandpaper to smooth them out and it was just fine. It is a lot cheaper than the other brand that looks just like it. I also got the Go Girl flexible urinal for peeing when we camp in the cold and that works great when my 21 month old son has to pee in public too :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for women","review":"This item is very difficult to use by women on trips.

It took me a while to figure out how to reinstall the gears to make the drum work, but the blank spots continued. I thought that it may be the new toner cartridge that I had installed at the same time, but even after purchasing a second new toner cartridge, the blank spots are still there.

The English overdub was horrible so I ended up just putting it on German anyway and enjoyed the movie. I liked the premise something a little different, but of course as in all \\"end of the world\\" movies there has to be cannibalism so that was predictable. I liked the movie until the end.

Bottom line: Good movie - Horrible ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Terrifying nor Suspenseful","review":"More like boring and predictable. The production values were pretty good, as far as the setting and filming goes, but the story line falls flat. The overdubbing is pretty bad, too. The voices fit the characters fairly well, with a few exceptions, but it's basically like all of the characters are standing in the same room throughout the entire movie. There's no difference in volume due to distance, etc. I'd be curious to see if I would have had a different opinion of the film if it had used subtitles instead. I think it was a big mistake not to spend more time in production when placing the overdubs. Still very predictable, though. At least it was only $9.99 new at Best Buy.

They are light-hearted and can be enjoyed by both adults and children.

He shoots the maniac saving the woman and she gives him a bracelet with magical powers to leave your body and enter anothers. She gets killed anyway because the maniac wasn,t dead as thought and kills her at her home. The story continues going well and just wondering what will happen now. Then he meets a young girl in a restarant who is a waitress and she finds out about the bracelet. Neal now goes on a adventure with this girl even though he had a girlfriend at home. Now for about a hundred and fifty pages its nothing but sex. Then to top it off hes girlfriend at home ends up liking the idea of his new girl joining in there sex games.

When the copper diode is new and the spiral cleaned I let it 2-3 days in, 4-5 days off. If your pool is in the sun it even needs less time in. Note that the spiral should be cleaned well after maybe 6 months, it is not so easy to make it well, I've found a drilling machine with some kind of soft metal brush makes the cleaning much easier.

Not only is the story great, very involving and well written, but the imagery and historical references are accurate and scholarly. As a woman interested in the often under-represented female perspective on historical events, this book fills a need for fully fleshed out mythical perspectives on life. At first I wondered if the alternate take on Christian myth would be sort of like a vegetarian version of a meat dish, interesting but not really enjoyable or necessary. Instead I found myself immersed in a completely plausible reinterpretation of a universal story which pulled me in and then expanded my understanding of myth and mystery.

For example, she mentions blue multi for the bret when in fact the name of the yarn is called deep blue (per yarndex #76). Also, have had to order the exact yarn to have the hat turn out correctly. Instructions are not always clear. Cathy should have also given pictures of how to do the bobble.

I don't know what I did wrong, but will probably try it again.I also really like page 16, where it explains how to combine different yarns to get thicknesses that are equivalent to sport, worsted, heavy worsted, chunky, or bulky. This is going to help me a lot.I found one mistake though, so far, on page 91: In the section called \\"Turn of Crown and Rise\\", in line three it should say \\"With color A: K 5 rnds\\" instead of \\"With color A: P 5 rnds\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in spite of errors","review":"I agree with some previous posters. The basic hat design has a mistake in the first row of increases and if you aren't experienced enough to catch it, it would be too discouraging to try to work thorugh.

All of the other hat books I've seen (I own most of them) feature either very basic hats in a variety of colors and yarn choices to embarrassingly silly hats I wouldn't ask my worst enemy to wear.

I will never buy another book by this author again until I read a review assuring me that it is error free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, wearable hats--great instructions--an excellent resource!","review":"The knit hats and patterns in this new book really are hip and cool! And that's saying something; most hat patterns I've seen are either dull and uninspiring, or so wildly \\"out-there\\" that only a space alien would wear one. Hip Knit Hats manages to avoid either extreme, offering 40 fun patterns for knit hats and caps that are creative, fashionable and flattering.Excellent tutorials on hat construction and knitting techniques (knitting in the round, casting on with variations, finishing, felting and fulling) lead to unusual embellishment options and then, finally, the hats!Cute, simple caps are followed by hats with wide upturned brims, caps for guys, a head-hugging cloche, a pillbox hat with darling bobbles, seed-stitch pillboxes, and various berets. I love the \\"Fabulous Felted\\" chapter and embroidery techniques offered as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hat Addicts Beware :)","review":"I love, love, love this book! I'm a hat person and a voracious knit person. I buy lots of knitting books almost all of them from Amazon. The customer reviews are what I base my buying decisions on. I've been disappointed with some purchases in the past but not this one. Having ended up with several costly mistakes knitting hats from the bottom up, (i've got several expensive wash rags now) I tuned into the top down method in this book. It's much easier to fit the hat, you keep trying it on until it covers your ears or whenever it looks right. It took me awhile to get the hang of the double pointed needles but I think I got it. And these patterns are so cool! I've knitted the hat on the cover in several different variations, I think I'm addicted. Great pictures, funky designs, easy directions, what more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Styles are great, but be prepared...","review":"The styles in this book are great but if you are a new knitter or inexperienced, I would not recommend this book. There are many errors and I have re-written every pattern I have tried (which is 5 so far). The instructions for the crown are all wrong, and you will be confused from the beginning.If you are an experienced knitter, you will be able to figure these out and make your own adjustments as necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duvet not as advertised - do not buy","review":"The duvet is barely flannel - it is so thin I can't believe it was advertised as flannel.

It was encouraging to know that there were other educators out there who respected children, worked to build a close-knit and peaceful classroom community, partered with parents in education, and welcomed and acknowledged children's thoughts, feelings, and ideas. I am now a second-year teacher, also at a progressive early childhood program, and I am more aware than ever of the truth in Wollman's book. I thank her for her gift to children and parents as an educator, her contribution to the small collection of excellent books on progressive teaching, and also for helping me know the words to use when others suggest that pre-school really is all about playdough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"I found this book to be one of the worst I have read in a long time.

Many of the art pieces are rendered in a way that does makes the colors look dark and the detail gets lost. I guess it's considered cheap for an art book, but for me, it was an investment, I surely can't afford the art and I can barely afford to buy a $30 book, and I was so excited at the time I bought it.

As the mystery unfolds, Melissa finds herself becoming emotionally involved with several of the murder suspects in the case. Once again, Melissa helps Inspector Harris solve the murder, but not until another victim falls to the killer.I enjoyed the second book in the series even though I was disappointed that Melissa's son was once again absent from the book.

I've had it for two years with no issues. I had read about the band falling apart and haven't had any problems at all. When I push the buttons, I make sure to brace my opposite finger on the watch and not the band. Maybe this has helped me avoid the catastrophic band failure.I use it for both swimming and run/walk workouts. Love that I can set an interval timer for my run/walk workouts.Will buy another one if this one ever fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economical and efficient watch","review":"I've used this watch in training and triathlons for three years now. For the price, I think that's a reasonable life expectancy. The watch is light, comfortable, attractive, simple to use, and has all the functions I've needed. After about two years the band began to discolor and to stretch, so that it now sometimes falls off. Replacement bands are not available, which is a shame since the watch itself still works fine. However - look at price - this is an extremely affordable watch which has given me several years of reliable service. If I want something more, I need to be willing to pay more. I am asking for the same watch for my birthday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great watch, poor band","review":"I love the watch itself, but will not buy another one because the band just does not last.

Due to costs to send the watch for repair, it makes more sense to buy a new watch - but this time not from Amazon. (It doesn't seem to help to pay extra for the protection plan). I like Amazon for many things, but now I've decided to not buy watches from them anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even water resistant","review":"The very first time I took it in the water after it was only 3 months old, it broke. AND the warranty does not cover water damage despite the fact that it is advertised as such. This is the 2nd timex watch that did this and I didn't even push any buttons on it. I thought the first time was a fluke. Piece of crap. Clearly, no one at Timex has ever actually used this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Waterproof","review":"When you wear the watch in the rain or very short exposure to water, it's fine. When you swim for a half hour, it leaks through the Indiglo button and fogs up the screen. The Indiglo consequently stops working temporarily (for now). I returned the first one I ordered that had this defect. This issue occured in the first month of use, the very first time I swam with the watch.I got a new one and the exact same thing happened. Too much time has elapsed for me to return it to Amazon now so I'm thinking about returning it to Timex. Regardless, the quality-control on these watches seems to have plummeted. It's good looking but it doesn't 'keep on ticking.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware! - Watch battery corroded in six months time.","review":"I purchased this watch about six months ago and while on vacation last month, the watch stopped working. I assumed that the battery had died and I finally took it to have the battery replaced. The battery had corroded (Keep in mind that this is a Timex Woman's Ironman Triathlon watch. I of course wore it in the water for swimming and certainly didn't expect a corroded battery, especially after such a short time. Unfortunately, it is outside of the Timex warranty period.I had purchased this watch after another Timex Triathlon watch strap broke and the strap could not be replaced.So, now I have two useless watches from Timex that were poorly manufactured (likely in China, although the watches don't indicate where they were made). I certainly won't be purchasing another Timex sports watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart. :(","review":"I LOVE this watch...except that less than 10 months after purchase, the band is detaching from the face in more than one spot. The detaching band is interfering with using the watch buttons to start/stop time and change modes. I don't wear my watch for swimming, showers, baths, or any other prolonged water activities. The most water exposure it's had is when I give my kiddos baths, and it's supposed to be water resistant anyway!! I have purchased many of these watches, and this one leaves me looking for a new brand of stopwatch. As a PE teacher, I wear this watch ALL of the time...how disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for run/walk interval training","review":"If you are a fan of the walk/run training of Jeff Galloway, this type of watch (with two interval timers) is essential. Just set the interval timers and switch from walking to running (or vice versa) every time you here the watch chime. I like the compact size of the watch. My only beef is that the chime is pretty quiet and I have to really listen for it. If you like to run with music, it would be hard to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome for a short time!","review":"I had one that lasted eight years and then I needed to replace it - understandable. I was very happy for how long it lasted. Then I had gone through four in the last three years due to the sealing on the watch. After a short time, when swimming, water seeped in and created a foggy screen making it difficult to view the time. With each replacement watch in the last three years, each one performed for a shorter amount of time than the one previous. Too bad I love the watch and it's three alarms, but I don't think I will replace my most recent watch. It's time to find a better performing watch for swimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Didn't Last More than 3 Months","review":"I first purchased this watch May 2010. It lasted a few months. I clicked the start button while underwater and broke the water-resistant seal. I was later able to find online that this was a known problem. I purchased the watch again because I love the look and feel and how it performs when it's working. I've only had it a few months and did not use it while swimming. While running in 20 degree weather, the face started clouding over again like the seal was broken. Since then, the watch has gotten slower and slower and is still cloudy on its face. Would love the watch if I could actually get it to work more than 3 months at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what I need","review":"I needed a durable watch to take to Kenya, Africa.

I have reconnected it several times. However, it keeps coming a part. I guess I will see if a watch store can help me. I have only had the watch for 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another watch band/face compliant","review":"The watch mechanism itself is great, but if I can't wear it on my wrist, it's useless. Although it looks good at first, the cheap plastic that holds the face to the strap gets worn out, stretches, and then eventually doesn't hold onto the face and buttons any longer. I wear this watch only to the gym, so I put it on and take it off 4-5 times a week, which is apparently too much stress for the watch band. Because the band is such an intricate part of the design-- the side buttons are incorporated into it-- it can't be replaced. I have to get a new watch.I've had $9.99 Casios that lasted 10 years... For $35, I think this watch should last a lot longer than the year or so I've gotten out of it. Very poor design by Timex. (Though very clever that this design flaw is not covered under the warranty.) Two stars instead of 1 because it was a 5 star item for about 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 6 of these exact watches. 13 months is longest any have lasted.","review":"Returning watch I purchased 1 month ago (water ruined display) even though supposed to be water resistant to 100 meters.

Works well until the display fails due to moisture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good simple sport watch","review":"I've been using this sport watch for almost a year in and out of the water. It provides all of the basic timing functions I need for running, biking, and swimming - including lap timing and various ways to view your splits.So far, it has proved to be water resistant in pools, lakes, and showers.I also really like the way the band is secured. It has a sliding ring to hold the end of the band down. The cool thing is that the ring has a little nub that fits into a hole at the end of the band to keep it in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well designed but doesn't stand up to use","review":"I have had this Ironman watch for about a year. I have been really happy with the interval timer function and the watch in general, but it has not held up to a year of regular use. I wear it probably about 75% of my waking hours. I take it off, of course, to sleep, shower, and swim, but I do wear it when I run, bike, hit the weight room, and at work. In a year's time, the band has broken because it is very thin where it wraps around the watch face, and over time it has become slightly brittle and worn out. The strap is also highly susceptible to discoloration (soaks up dyes from clothing like a sponge) but I imagine that this is a problem with many similar watches. Another problem I've had is the indiglo function ceasing to work within a few months of purchasing the watch. Now pressing the indiglo button just makes the screen go blank. I wear the watch a lot but am pretty careful with it, so I have been surprised by how quickly it has worn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON TIMEX","review":"This watch is advertised as a \\"triathlon\\" watch by Timex. It took on water the first time I took it in the pool! Timex customer service told me that you can't press the buttons when the watch is in the water!Does anyone at Timex know what a triathlon is? I'm sorry, but if you call a watch a triathlon watch it means people are going to buy it to use swimming (getting splits, etc.) and they're going to need to press the buttons while the watch is wet! False advertising by Timex. They should be ashamed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't waterproof","review":"Despite claims, this watch is NOT waterproof. The whole reason I bought it is so I could wear it in the pool. After only a few swims it began taking on water and shorted out.

It's perfect for swim workouts and aquathlon races -- takes splits, can do intervals, etc. I use a different product with a heartrate monitor for my runs, but can't use it for my swims (since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water, and also, the unit itself is not waterproof). This Timex has an audible chime under water, and it's easy to set the various functions. It stores your workout splits so you can recall them later when logging your workout. I also love the 3 alarms - my schedule is different every day, so I use the alarms to remind me when to leave work for school, when to leave to pick up my son, etc. I had lost my first watch (same model), but never found another watch that had all the features I wanted for a reasonable price.

I purchased an older model Timex Women's Ironman watch in DEC of 2007. The band kept popping off the top and bottom of the watch, forcing me to buy a new one. I went with the T59201, hoping the new band design would be better. I have had no problems with the band. It is now the watch, itself, that is the problem!I purchased the T59201 in JUL 10. After wearing it to the waterpark one day, I noticed water inside the watch. The watchface became so clouded over with condensation that the watch was useless. Timex did send me a replacement watch in about 3 weeks. I have worn this watch lap swimming twice. Today, AGAIN, I noticed water in the watch. AGAIN, the face is clouding over.

About 5 days after I wore it in the pool it just completely died.

And it only was submerged on maybe 5 occasions during that time frame. The customer service representative tried to tell me that I likely pushed buttons while I was underwater, but I know I didn't. Since then, I've heard other people tell me that the same has happened with their Timexes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible band and warranty","review":"The watch's warranty makes you pay 7$ for shipping and handling if it has a manufacturing problem, which it usually has when inmersed in water for the first time.

Timex replaced the watch, stating that the original watch could not be repaired.Okay fine.By the time I got the new watch, swimming season was over.I got back in the pool for the first time 3 days ago.

That was a big mistake.1. The first problem is with the size of the muffin cups -- they are significantly more shallow than in a typical mini-muffin pan.2. The silicone warped from the heat while in the oven, spilling the meager contents of the tiny cups over the edges, making flat, crooked, ugly muffins.3. The silicone did not release the muffins easily. I did spray it with nonstick spray before filling, and allowed the muffins to cool completely before I tried to get them out.I didn't even bother to try and wash it, so I don't have any comment about the ease of washing.

Norman Tyler's \\"Historic Preservation\\" was originally written as a text for a college class on historic preservation. His purpose was to expose his students to the major themes in the field of preservation.The book starts with a philosophical overview of preservation and moves onto chapters dealing with historic districts and the legal basis for preservation. I found his chapter on the documentation and designation of individual historic properties to be most valuable. Tyler concludes with chapters on design issues, preservation technology, downtown reviatalization and preservation economics.This book is a well written introduction that will get you started in learning more about historic introduction. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"So expensive for such a useless product","review":"This cream doesn't even shave well, much less moisturize as you shave.

We have a new Samsung 55 inch TV and this movie is just overwhelming! Combined with the nostalgia, cast and super score, one just can't complain at all about this presentation.

It is a set piece, a very restricted musical, but it is still fun. I don't think there is another movie quite like it. The costuming and sets look really good on our large screen TV.

How, instead of slipping away in the night, he stays to face the cosequences of his actions - all because he is conflicted over leaving his new love. The new love (played by Shirley Jones)is also cold hearted because of the walls she built up to protect herself from men with one thing on their mind. The intermixing between the two, as Robert Preston tries to capture Shirley Jones' heart is very enjoyable. This \\"G\\" rated movie also has Buddy Hackett and shows the debut of Ronnie Howard, as a stuttering boy with a pained heart.

What makes this film particularly delightful after all of these years is the direction. It is shot in such a way as to not just \\"open it up\\" as a film with songs (which it does), but it gives you the feeling of the stage show with the big numbers choreographed with an eye for the proscenium stage and even a curtain call and encore at the end. You can see why Robert Preston was such a great performer (especially in this role). Comedy buffs can get a renewed appreciation of Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold.

What a thrill that Hollywood recognized (after every other actor they offered it to turned it down in favor of Preston) that the stars on Broadway really do know how to act.

If ever a man was meant to play a role it was Robert Preston. His Professor Hill is a character for the ages. Shiley Jones's lovely voice+great presence match him very well. The fact that,like Rex Harrison,Preston could not carry a tune makes his performance all the more astonishing. You would never know after hearing Preston+Jones sing \\"Till There was You\\" that he was not a singer. Supporting cast is outstanding especially the Mayor--a sort of archetype of a bumbling politician. Though it may seem corny,my favorite song is still \\"76 Trombones\\" followed closely by \\"Trouble\\" Finally,I suggest those reviewers who do not feel this film is in the same class as My Fair Lady or the Sound of Music give this film another try.

Unfortunately, as a movie it seems to go on forever.Robert Preston is stodgy as Harold Hill, and an unlikely suitor for Marian (Shirley Jones),unless she's a gold digger as well. There's a young Ron Howard, looong before his deadpan narration for \\"Arrested Development\\",singing \\"Gary,Indiana.\\" \\"The Music Man\\" drags its feet. Too much exposition between songs.

The passing of the times should not have destroyed that. It has. We do not make the time just to sit and enjoy. Mind you, today's 'reality' shows are NOT something I sit down to enjoy.

The story line itself was almost unpalatable. As someone else stated, mbee for the girls, I doubt even then. Without giving any spoilers there is little to say other than any action above the waves was plain tedious and even annoying.

Only in my case, I found the book extremely well written and greatly paced. It just made me sick inside. If reading graphic description of a child being tortured or killed is your idea of a good read then this book is for you. If not, I recommend not starting this book. Once you start this book, you won't be able to not look away.

He is kidnapped by a Native American living in the California coastal mountains because the 'Indian' has been given a vision by Bee, his spirit creature. He has to find out whether this boy is worthy of what destiny says the 'Indian' must do. And what is that I hear you asking? Well we can't tell you everything now, can we. But rest assured the ending is well worth the length of the novel itself.I notice that this book is currently unavailable (out of print). Sad. Such a good story.

The informational text is regularly interrupted by an inane conversation between two people spending the day in the garden. The conversation sometimes starts mid-sentence, making it very difficult to follow the line of thought in the text. Moreover, the author tries to make the topic more interesting by waxing poetic and calling mites little cars. Actually, the information is interesting on its own. and his feeble attempts to be \\"cute\\" or \\"special\\" make this book very hard to read and difficult to believe. I really wish that he had told the stories in a straightforward fashion and added a bibliography so I could follow up.

Most hubs use 1 controller for all of the ports to save money, which causes all of the ports to run at the LOWEST COMMON SPEED. This is a huge performance hit, in addition to causing lots of the USB problems that folks have with the devices connected to them. I don't know why these aren't more popular, but these hubs are awesome. I wish I could say that about some of Belkin's other products."},{"rating":"2","title":"works perfectly","review":"I just plugged it in to one of my usb2 ports, and hooked up my scanner and camera and printers... absolutely wonderful.

It is lots of fun and cuts perfect spirals. A nice tropical cup is leftover too which will be fun to do this summer!I gave it a 4 because there is a small piece of black plastic that either broke or fell out, we have to stick a little stick in the hole (near the handle) to make it work.

Thought the picture on amazon was too good to be true but works exactly as pictured/described."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL!","review":"While I thought this slicer would be great because it is stainless steel and would last longer, it was small and not great for slicing normal sized pineapples. The plastic version is about 4 inches on the bottom while the steel slicer is about 3 inches in diameter.I would not recommend purchasing this slicer because it will waste about 1/2 inch of the pineapple when slicing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great product!","review":"This pineapple slicer really does work. It does waste more of the pineapple than if you were cutting it with a knife, but it is sooooo much easier and less messy than the traditional way. As another reviewer suggested, don't cut too far down if you want to use the shell to drink out of or to serve something in it. The core does not remain in the shell, but you will have to use something to push it out of the slicer...I usually use the handle of a wooden spoon.

Great investment if you enjoy pineapple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Solution.","review":"I love this product. My sister had one and let me borrow it, and I was hooked. Now, I never thought preparing pineapple was challenging, and was against any extra kitchen gadgets because, well, who needs more gadgets? But if you eat pineapple at all, this is worth your time. It used to take me 10 minutes on a good day to slice the pineapple up. Now it makes me maybe a minute, and I don't have to trim any of the core or skin. Besides the fact that it's extremely efficient, it's kind of fun to use, corkscrewing a pineapple. The slices aren't too thick, and can easily be cut into chunks.

This metal version works very well. It practically glides through the pineapple. My teenagers like it so much that they are going through 2 to 3 pineapples per week!

However, I got so disappointed with this one and not sure if I want to try another model..."},{"rating":"1","title":"steel pineapple slicer","review":"I bought the stainless steel pineapple slicer because I had been given the plastic model. The plastic slicer did a very nice job, but I knew it wasn't going to last very long. However, for some reason the steel version is smaller than the plastic model, and as a result, the core often isn't completely cut out, resulting in some tough pieces attached to each slice. Also, since it doesn't slice as wide a diameter as the plastic model, I am forced to manually trim the pineapple that the cutter failed to remove from the outer skin, in order to reduce waste. However, the steel slicer cuts much easier than the plastic model because it's edge is much sharper. I am very disappointed with the steel model, especially since it costs 2 1/2 times as much as the plastic model."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's GREAT","review":"It's strong and easy to use. Just slice the top off the pineapple, put the slicer on top and turn, it cuts and cores in less than a minute and you have the pineapple sliced and ready to eat. Plus you can use the remaining shell as a cup or bowl. No more slicing the pineapple in half and then slicing the halfs again and again to get wedges and then trying to cut off the outer skin and picking out the \\"eyes\\" that remain in the pieces , now you still had to cut the core off and each wedge into pieces -- it was a lot of work and always made a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company Won't Stand Behind Poorly Manufactured Product","review":"(REAL NAME)I used my Vacu Vin about three times before the handle broke off, and contacted the company through their website about a replacement handle. After two weeks I received no response and emailed them a second time.This time I received a hasty response as follows, \\"I have responded back to you 2 weeks ago and told you that we do not have extra pineapple slicer handles nor do we offer a warranty on this item.\\"As far as the three times that I was able to use the slicer, it sometimes worked nicely, and sometimes mangled the pineapple.

I love fresh pineapple but don't buy them because of the mess. Not any more! I'm having so much fun with this gadget that I'm buying at least one pineapple a week. I do wish there was an extra disc or two so that I could adjust to the size of the pineapple and not waste alot of fruit. I understand that a plastic model does have the additional discs but I didn't know how long plastic would last and opted for the stainless steel. I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pineapple corer","review":"This thing works as advertised. If you love the taste of fresh cut pineapple then you simply must own this device.

It is a bit of a chore to get the slicer lined up in the center of the pineapple and then to turn it to spiral down can be a project in itself.

Well, I am on the west coast and she is on the east coast so I thought maybe they don't have em on the east coast. I sent her one for a present and got my mom one too.

While most of these errors were minor, many served as great distractions from the reading of the text. The biographies of the men involved in baseball at the turn of the century really turned into nothing more than a verbal recapitulation of the statistics found in the \\"Baseball Encyclopedia\\" or \\"Total Baseball.\\" Finally, the author seemed intent in finding a new villain or a new victim, or maybe even a new mystery to the ending of the 1908 National League season. Much of his argument proves to be superficial, often trivial, and sometimes just plain nonsense. On the positive side, the book does also examine the American League race of 1908, something that is often lost in the wake of the Merkle incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Machine","review":"This incredible season is relived with amazing detail and insight that makes the modern fan wonder.

Linse's book, 'Young Learners' edited by David Nunan, in which Nunan refers to her book for why teachers of young learners should do this and shouldn't do that. I thought that this book was a lot better than that and better than Nunan's own book, 'Teaching English to Young Learners.' Pinter is very generous and eloquent with her advice, which is well said and to the point. Pinter speaks from a combined position of research and practical teaching experience, which was very refreshing. I particularly liked the Recommended Reading and the Practical Teacher Resource sections that follow each chapter. I plan to read this book again and again. I can't say that is the case with the thirty odd plus and continually growing ELT mini library I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS TRUE METAL","review":"I have been a fan for exactly 1 year and I am very impressed with what Slipknot has created.

SLIPKNOT KILLS ALL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is easily worth the money!","review":"I have been a fan for about two years now and I must say that this is one of their better import singles. It has a little bit fresher artwork than some of their other releases. The tracks are pretty good, the song is great too but you need to be familiar with Slipknot's groove to really move with it. But for a first time listener get the whole album. You will get a much better taste of what Slipknot is all about. The cd itself has many good qualities in itself but the drawback with most import singles is the lack of tracks for the money. Since I am a collector as well as a fan though it means more to me than it does to some people and this is mainly a novelty to me, I do listen to it though. But it does have a pretty cool remix and the live version is excellent. All in all I give it four stars just to say that it did not get five cause not everybody will want this, if you are a collector it is an essential. If you are a listener then just get the full-length import."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE......","review":"This thru glass technology is a good idea, but Terk seriously needs to re-design this product.

I think it would appeal to a wide variety of music fans, from those into ambient sounds to anyone who digs unusual but catchy pop tunes, like the Talking Heads. I bought it after hearing Cat Power's song -- the shortest one on the CD, clocking in at an infuriatingly short 2 minutes. Besides the music, the CD bestowed another bonus: I discovered the work of George Seferis. Sigmatropic is a wonderful homage to his poetry and an exciting example of the interpretive possibilities of modern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous soundscape, low on the songwriting.","review":"I suppose it's an empty critique to say that the album does not showcase much strength in songwriting. Yet the album was the collaberation of 19 established vocalists (e.g. Cat Power, Robert Wyatt who is also featured on the new Bjork album \\"Medulla\\", and Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth), none of whom are working with their own lyrics but are converting the poetry of George Seferis to music.The poetry is gorgeous, no doubt. The music itself matches and maybe excells Seferis' kaikus. Ranging from light acoustic experimentation to what borders on trance, the album is musically varied and stunning. It's amorphous in it's form and has little in the sense of forward motion or climax, but works tremendously well in it's soundscape and emotive atmosphere. In many ways, the work sounds like the product of a marraige between Miles Davis and Sigur Ros, with the occasional passionate affair with Bjork.I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highest quality log cabin building book I've seen","review":"Excellent all color on glossy high quality paper.

When you think of all of the mindlessly fawning portrayals of the monsters of the left (Che Guevara comes to mind in the Motorcycle Diaries, or John Reed, in Reds), is it too much to ask that a movie that shows the other side of them (the side that butchered 100 million people over the course of the last century) be made available?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I bought this because it includes kelly's heroes.

Though the film has been out for years, it never received much play when first released, and conspiracy buffs have long argued that the film was purposely suppressed by the Hollywood elite in order to squelch the movie's harsh portrayal of a character undoubtedly based on anti-war actress/activist Jane Fonda. My only criticism of the film is that it pulls punches and doesn't go far enough in portraying the true horrors endured by our POWs, nor does it hammer Ms. Fonda as hard as she should have been for her actions.I consider this movie a must-have for your Vietnam DVD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy I got it","review":"I had Hanoi Hilton on VHS, and liked it well enough that I got the DVD.

After doing this workout for several months, I really enjoy it. However, it's not something you can just jump into. Since I was already in pretty good shape when I began this workout, it only took a couple of weeks for me to be able to perform the entire routine. For someone who is looking to get into shape, this may not be the place to start, though. I still think he moves too fast at times. A good bit of memorization is required before you can actually flow with the workout, as opposed to trying to see what's going on while your body is moving between positions it has never encountered before. Overall, I think this video was an excellent entry point into yoga for my fitness level, and I enjoyed the challenging aspects of it as well as the tremendous increase in flexibility this workout has given me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a beginner workout AT ALL","review":"Unlike my other reviews, I'm going to be brief here: This workout is sold as a beginner workout and it is not for anyone who hasn't had a solid background in the poses required. Rodney Yee ought to include an instructional section to this set that leads the true beginner through each stance and pose, and gives the beginner that he is selling this DVD to a good base to start these fast paced sequences that make up this workout. I'm very disappointed.The music is nice, the backgrounds are beautiful, but this workout isn't for anyone who hasn't had a complete yoga class prior to attempting this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for busy yogis","review":"I love this DVD because it provides 3 relatively quick (20-25 minutes each) workouts that address different needs: strength, flexibility, and stamina. I take it with me during business trips and play it on my laptop for a quick workout in my hotel room. It gives me variety to choose whatever I'm in the mood for each day, and the workouts are short enough to allow me to get them done even if I tend to hit the snooze button a few too many times before getting out of bed.One caveat - this workout moves pretty quickly without much in the way of instruction or tips about positioning. It is better for someone familiar with the basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga-at-home","review":"This is really one of my favourite workout dvds, but it's NOT for beginners. I would not recommend this tape to anyone who is not already familiar with downward facing dog, upward facing dog, and triangle poses -- you will just hurt yourself or get discouraged because Yee does not provide much instruction or modification for a safe practice. He does give good cueing though, if you already know the poses. I've had the dvd for over a year and feel that I am just now mastering the first practice after practicing almost every day. Yee has put together sequences that are sufficiently challenging to keep your interest and encourage you to keep improving. There is enough on this dvd to keep you busy for a long time. The flow between the sequences is quite fast so I memorized the first practice and often do it in a slower form. My one complaint is that he often stays longer on one side than on the other, which is annoying because you have to stop the dvd or try to catch up somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Yoga the Complete Workout - Stamina, Strength, Flexibi","review":"I think that this video is really great. I will not lie to you you should know the basic yoga moves before you start because it is fast paced.

Eventually I'll be able to do this too.' Then I watched the first program and realized that there is no instruction whatsoever for the novice.I've never tried yoga before and after watching the one segment one time, offered the dvd to my sister (otherwise I would have thrown it out).If you are not very flexible already, look for something else. I would only recommend this to someone who already has some yoga background and can start right out doing most of the positions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginners?","review":"The tape mentions that it is for beginners. I disagree. While it is an outstanding workout, it is most definitley not for beginners. Perhaps more intermediate. You need to have a basic knowledge of the poses and form before trying this. However, it is outstanding. I stopped lifting weights altogether because the strength segment is so much more efficient and result effective. Whether you are male or female, this tape, along with proper diet and perhaps pilates, will get you the body you've wanted. It really is that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"effective workout, but....","review":"The Rodney Yee workouts will provide you with almost instant results. In three to four days of practice you will notice a marked improvement in your energy level. Your posture will also improve; however, these exercises are not for beginners. If you have some experience with yoga then try the Yee workouts. They're strenuous, muscle toning, and ligament stretching programs. For anyone involved in competitive sports these yoga exercises will help to lessen the chances of twists and sprains, but to reiterate, if you are new to yoga approach these DVDs with common sense and please do not subject yourself to overstraining and possible injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR BEGINNERS","review":"I'm a beginner in yoga, I've taken a few classes and followed a few videos. I bought this DVD by mistake cause I did not know what power yoga was. Power Yoga is a type of Yoga that moves through the poses at an accelerated pace, which makes it difficult for beginners to follow.I've also read a lot of reviews that Rodney Yee seems to move into poses before he explains them or indicates that he is going to do them, I agree with these reviews.One last point, I actually find his voice kind of irritating, which is frustrating, cause he's such a beautiful man. If you've got the dvd and you notice the way he says \\"exxxhale...\\" then you know what I mean.Maybe if you're really good at yoga and are used to power yoga and rodney yee's voice, then this dvd is alright for you. but it's NOT FOR BEGINNNERS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exercise the body and mind!","review":"After using power yoga for beginners not only did my body feel better but my mind was more focused.

If you've done it a while or intermittently and want a step up, I like this DVD. The music's fine and Rodney's voice is pretty soothing.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought the wrong DVD","review":"If you are new to Yoga, this DVD will not help you.

Imho, it's fine for either the beginner or intermediated student. Sure, the beginner won't be able to do everything right away, but that's ok, they'll be able to learn quickly.Over the years Rodney has become my favorite \\"video\\" yoga teacher. The routines are challenging and interesting, and best of all, he lets the poses speak for themselves rather than submerge the viewer in a sea of new age mumbo jumbo.Rodney Yee's DVD for \\"Power Yoga\\" is a no risk purchase, imho.

The previews made it seem like it would be great--starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Peter Facinelli and Matthew Lillard. All three of them had been in movies I loved before like Can't Hardly Wait. But this was a very disappointing movie.First the majority of the movie takes place in a pizza parlor where Dash and Facinelli work. It is mostly about life after school where some people are going off to make the most of their lives and these guys are working in a slow pizza place. Hewitt is by no means the star or even a major role in this movie--she palys an obnoxious girl and is on screen for a total of less than 15 mintues. A total waste. And Lillard plays his usual role as a hotshot, but like Hewitt, has his talent completely wasted in this film.I was so disapointed in this movie. I expected more from a cast that had produced other great movies in the past. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"telling you","review":"from the summary on the back of the video tape the film sounded good - how wrong can you be! After 30 mins of suffering i turned the video off - but did finish watching it the next day but it was just as awful. The film is slow moving to the point that nothing really happens at all. The main actor was dreadful and the other actors that were good hardly got any on screen time. The cover for the video has 2 girls and 2 boys - the girls are on screen for a few minutes only.Basically a total waste of money - i wouldn't recomend anyone to buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling you... to give it a chance.","review":"I really enjoyed this movie for a few reasons. I thought they did a great job with the cast..even though I am not a JLH fan. I enjoyed the other characters and even the story line. It's not a classic, but the story has a moral to it. It's slow at times, but the good parts (like the discussion about the panda and the ostrich) are funny. It's a basic high-school-mentality movie that doesn't rank with others like it, but my husband and I love this cute movie. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"Ok...first off, was the budget so low on this one that they couldnt explain what was supposedly happening?(thankfully they wrote it on the back of the rental box), and Jennifer Love Hewitt was barely in this, although she is listed as one of the main characters...ditto for matthew lillard! If they had JLH and ML in this movie more it probably would've been more of a comedy, cuz they were hilarious in their little parts. Obviously the ppl who made the film put their names on the front in order to cash in. This movie has some moments, but it is really pointless and you're always saying a good part is going to come, but it doesn't. Perhaps if this had been made a big shot film company rather than an indie one, it would've been better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm telling you this movie sucks!","review":"Take a group of college graduates - 2 of them work at a pizza place. They lose $1100 of their bosses money....panic what should we do? lets throw a party...the end! The cast is really good but they are wasted on a the story. The story may seem OK but there are too many long pointless conversations and boring moments which left me reaching for the ff button on my remote. Theres nothing really going on in the movie...if there is it takes forever to get going.If you're a hard core Jennifer Love Hewitt or Peter Facinelli fan then this will be bearable...if not just catch it on tv!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hah","review":"ive never actually seen the movie but it was written by my science teacher which i find pretty damn kool.... cant be that bad JHL is in it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT A REFUND!","review":"i give this movie 2 stars because it would be downright cruel to give it anything less... i think that it was hyped up way too much for what it really turned out to be. they used big stars like jenifer and matthew on their poster when the probably had a combined total of 15 minutes screen time.. it really was just a huge dissapointment to me finding out i wasted 13 bucks buying 15 minutes of my fave. stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD BE ILLEAGAL TO SELL!","review":"This movie was auwful. The commercials for it on She's All That made it look like the next movie in line for a teen Oscar...so I went to Blockbuster and got it right? I had such high expectations so I kept waiting for it to get good. IT NEVER DID! What was the point of this movie? Umm- a story about a JEALOUS lover in the beginning- a physcho stalker (JHL Who acted well as her part- Love, I commend you) and then some money gets takin by a homeless guy. Well great movie!...not THIS MOVIE STINKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"missed a good chance","review":"The director should take the blame on this one. Obviously somehow he got his hands on a good script with fairly amusing dialogue, cast good actors who were able to keep it floating most of the time (particularly when the director himself isn't in the scene), but the actores are left alone out there. There's no pacing, no mind behind the telling of the story. Looks like a vanity production for the little director guy who dropped himself in scenes. What happened? Couldn't get cast in a project with someone else's money on the line? Stay away from the biz, director. If another co-writer ever takes you on again, be thankful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it was good!!","review":"The only thing I didn't like about this awesome movie is that stupid guy who showed up twice in the movie. He's tall(just to describe, not that tall means anything) and he can't act worth beans. He made the movie worse in those appearences, luckily, it was only twice and that's what saved the movie. That, and JLH was absolutely amazing!! She was the best! 4 stars for her, and none for the movie! Plotwise, well this movie didn't have a strong plot, but was pretty funny! LIke when JLH falls off her bed answering the phone! The other actors weren't so good, especially the main actor! But this movie was good enough, mostly JLH, but what can you do, not much, see this, it's worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"inside scoop","review":"I was one of the writers on the original screenplay. I think the movie turned out pretty well for a couple of first time writers. Those of you who find so much fault with it should try writing your own screenplay-- very difficult. The script could definitely have used some work-- the director made very few changes to the original script. BUt for a first time adventure for all, not bad. If i had known then what I know now, the script would have been alot tighter. But it was a a thrill to have such wonderful cast, I think they saw the simplicity in the plot and thought it would be fun; no one was expecting an Oscar nomination for the film. So if you're looking for memorable plots and performances this movie is not for you. It is not the worst movie ever made (How about Tom Hanks in That Thing You Do?) It happens to the best of 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than zero.","review":"I would love to give this movie zero stars if I could. Jennifer Love Hewitt for such a popular actress has a proclivity for consistenly exposing her lack of genuine talent. Jennifer Love is a cute girl who relies on a child-like simplicity to perform all her roles to date, and in \\"Telling You\\" she is as vapid and air-headed as usual; \\"Trojan War\\", \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\", \\"Heartbreakers\\" et al.This movie has a very boring plot and really bad direction, it is long-winded and not funny, thus none of the actors are served by it.Dash Mihok was great in the movie \\"Whiteboyz\\" but he has nothing to work with in this poor screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"You have to buy a specific brand of supplies to duplicate work.

From the first I thought it looked chromed, but it worked so well that I kept using it. Then after less than 3 months the top layer began to pit after soaking in water, which is precisely what I bought stainless steel to avoid.I would give it 5 stars if it weren't chromed. It works great, especially with the standard round ice cream container.Well, too bad. And too bad that it's too late to return it.If you do get one then keep it clean, dry, don't let it soak, and you should be fine.LATER NOTE: Nothing in the description states that this is stainless steel: It's Amazon's search & in-house description that does: \\"Wilton / Copco Ice Cream Scoop - Stainless Steel \\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bargain of a lifetime!","review":"I found this COPCO scoop at a thrift store and paid $2.50 for it!!!

Although the packaging seems very mainstream, it is clear that Rodney Yee is a very experienced instructor. He is very bright, calming, and incorporates many aspects of yoga (including meditation and breathing) into the practice. The reviewer who complained of the warning saying that menstrating women shouldn't do inverted poses is uniformed and doesn't understand that Yee was not being sexist. It is meant to keep balance in a woman's body. Women who practice yoga regularily know this. Check out his other videos too! Yogi Hari, Wai Lana, and David Swenson are also very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but not for beginners","review":"This is a fabulous practicm for true intermediates or advanced students--those who have had enough instruction to have mastered headstands, handstands, and strenous backbends like camel and upward facing bow. Rodney does a good job of helping viewers navigate through these challenging poses. But this is not strictly an instructional tape. If you're not failiar with the basics, you won't find the here. Still, for seasoned practitioners, this is a great practice for those days when you either can't make it to class, or can't get motivated to d.i.y."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSTRUCTOR ASSUMES PERFECTION","review":"Only buy this tape if you can do head stands without assistance and if while sitting with legs extended you can place your forehead on your knees and your hands around the bottom of your feet. if you can't do things like this you won't be able to do at least 1/3rd of the poses in this tape. Yee doesn't offer any easier modified alternatives so you if you can't do these things you can miss out on entire segments. the tape is also a little too dreamy for my tastes as it emphasizes the hawaiin surroundings and spiritual enlightment aspects of yoga throughout the workout. i prefer more practical, down to earth deliveries of yoga instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"Don't make the mistake I did of thinking that a flexible person in fairly good shape could skip the beginning tape and go straight to the intermediate. I can do Patricia Walden's yoga for flexability (a great tape and fairly challenging) so I thought I could do this tape. This tape is absolutely only for the experienced practicer of yoga. I found about ninty percent of the moves impossible and gave up on the tape about half way through and returned it to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily breakable","review":"I just picked green fer the heck of it.Don't get this for ANY racing,fighting,multiplayer,or sports games moving the D-pad around too much l' make it break,too much for this is little!I hate writing bad reviws but don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.","review":"I was led to believe that this game would play in the Xbox 360 console, but it will not.

Look at scouts in the final 4 Epochs, and spies in Epochs 12-13 or 14. Same great function thoughout the game, but spies appear as a 1900's looking unit for too long, and scouts in the final Epoch look like those who explored early North America, where the year for the Epoch reaches far into the 21st Century. These are just examples, others can be seen, and it makes certain Epochs look silly.A great game, some minor unit-looking tweaks would be nice, but other than that a great game to add to your RTS collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This game is great. It's similar to the first game but adds some new things to keep it fresh. The one thing I don't like about the additions was the use of houses to increase the amount of population you can have.

In addition to this, when I purchased this item, I thought I would get the game pictured. Instead I received the European version.

But, in typical Laymon fashion, ISLAND takes the common theme and pushes it in new, extreme directions.If you're familiar with Richard Laymon's work at all you know the currency he deals in: schoolboy fantasies and hardcore horror. Laymon seems to have found the ultimate outlet here with the story of a young man trapped on an island after a boating accident. Take the normal dram of being separated from civilization with limited food and water, mix in a mysterious killer, heap on the typical Laymon madness, then top that off with a shocking finale and you've got a tale that makes Castaway look like a comedy.It's not high art (and you're probably not expecting it to be), but if you're a fan of survival stories, extreme adventure, or Richard Laymon in general you're making a safe bet with ISLAND.For more reviews visit our site at http://www.thereaderreviews.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...what was that?","review":"This had to be the most outrageous, over-the-top and certifiably INSANE story I,'ve read in quite a while. There are numerous pages dedicated to detailed descriptions of erections, decapitation and urination. The vast majority of the plot consists of the protagonist describing how aroused his acquaintances make him. The best thing about this book is that you get 500+ pages for $2, but I still can't call this one my better investments. Do yourself a solid and PASS on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great beach read","review":"This is the fourth book by Laymon that I have read, and it is the only one I can recommend, and I recommend it highly. \\"Island\\" is a fast, fun read that any reader of horror or thrillers will enjoy. Quick, funny and thrilling, \\"Island\\" never tries to be anything but an adolescent boy's horny fantasy come true. No, it's not great literature, but once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down. Fans of Scott Smith's \\"The Ruins\\" will find out what that book could have been if it hadn't taken itself waaaaaaaaay too seriously. Laymon is not everyone's cup of tea, and it took me four books to find out why I have read so many positive reviews of him over the years, but \\"Island\\" has convinced me to read more of his books. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste time or money on this one","review":"I read a number of reviews from people about Laymon, and thought I'd give him a try. This is the second book of his I have read. I can't imagine spending any more more money on him. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The dialogue was juvenile at best. Some of the actions of Rupert either made no sense or were simply stupid. In reading this one and Darkness..., I was reminded of something a creative writing teacher said years ago to his class: sex is fine in a novel if it serves or furthers some part of the storyline. Don't just put it in to fill pages. Laymon should have been in that class. This neverending fascination with breasts is ridiculous. It kills the flow of the story and at times seems completely out of place. Save your money and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read.

As a woman reading this book I was extremely disturbed by its pandering and objectification of the novel's women. I suppose the author excuses this misogyny by attributing it to his character, but there is nothing in the book that censures, punishes or even disapproves of the protagonist's attitude. I felt slightly nauseated when I gave up reading this book after it became clear that it was nothing more than an extended pornographic depiction of some man's fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible.","review":"I've read a lot of horror (including a number of Laymon's other books) and I don't think I'm particularly squeamish. But I found this book to be disgusting.Laymon's best, such as Night in Lonesome October and The Traveling Vampire Show, are creepy, surreal, and yet somehow (in spots) charming. I thought this one was simply revolting and (in spots) ridiculous. The plot is just silly, but what really turned me against this book was the gruesome depictions of violence, rape, and torture. Laymon seems to always mix up sex and violence, but in this book he is way over the top and goes too far.Some of the other reviewers suggest that there is an exciting twist at the end. I wouldn't know - I threw this book away (literally - I threw it into our kitchen garbage can and promptly took the trash out) when I was about halfway through.I'd strongly recommend skipping this one entirely. But some of Laymon's other books (like the two mentioned above) are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out interesting, then (seriously) degenerated.","review":"It's as if a sexually twisted13-year-old rendered a slightly interesting plot.

Gilligan's Island Gone Bad!","review":"Who can give this book one star? Obviously someone who doesn't understand that horror books, or any other book, should contain great characters, a sense of humor, unique perspective, and twists galore.Laymon has had some amazing books out there that are straight out horror, but this one is a slow builder, although entertaining all the way. It's a mystery/suspense novel moreso than horror, but so what? All that matters is that it's worth reading.Not many writers could write and layer characters like Laymon did, especially with such deceptively simple prose. Yet in this manner, he allows the story to grow, layer upon layer until this \\"simple\\" novel is deep & entralling.Hopefully, more readers will give this & all his novels a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Adolescent's Wet Dream","review":"First off, this book is NOT scary. Nor is it suspenseful. What starts off as a promising premise,an anniversary outing goes wrong when the rented boat unexpectedly explodes, stranding them on this deserted island. No sooner does a day pass when the husband of one of the women is found dead, which leaves 4 women and 2 men. The following day, the second man is dispatched. What could have been a suspenseful story of survival against a psychotic individual turns into an adolescent's wet dream. Not a chapter goes by where the writer--the \\"author\\" of the account, as the story is told first person--doesn't talk about the women's breasts, their butts, their bikinis. Granted, there are moments of blood and guts, but those seem to be thrown in as an afterthought. I bought this book looking for a good scare, what I got was an embarassment to the horror genre. If you want a good scare--and a good read--pass this book by and, if necessary, reread some old Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Fun Read","review":"What a fun book! Sure there is a lot of adolescent sexuality invovled here, but that's one of the things that makes Dick Laymon such a fantastic writer - his ability to firmly put the reader into the hormonal rages of male adolescence (the Traveling Vampire Show was another that did this well). There's quite a bit of suspense here - not over the top scares, but more along the lines of a good solid thriller. \\"Island\\" has an intriguing premise, well-drawn characters, a great pace, and a wonderful climax and twist at the end. Bring this anywhere and you'll be glad you picked it up. As always, with Richard laymon, you can't pick a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start, great story - but the end is weak...","review":"The funny thing about that book is - Rupert (the guy telling the story) is so horny that it's hard for him to think about another thing than to stare at (or if possible under) the bikinis of the girls which are with him on the trip to a lonely island.He's still horny, even when man after man gets killed in a very brutlal way and it becomes clear that he is the next on the killer's list . . .After a few pages of the book you won't stop reading because it's really thrilling an (as I wrote above) very funny sometimes.It also has some sudden and unexpected turns during the story.The whole story is great, from the beginning up almost to the end.But it seems to me that Laymond was in a hurry when he finished the book - I was not really happy with the end.Nevertheless - I can recommend it; everyone who likes thrillers will love this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book I care for","review":"It started off promisingly. The writing itself was ok. At times there were amusing moments. The story is told from the point of view of an 18 year old boy. I'm sure lots of people will like the book but I didn't care for the almost constant sexual commentary the main character spewed. I didn't like the prolonged descriptions of corpses. I found the characters cartoonish. The book is like an immature sexist fantasy. Finally a little over 2/3 in I couldn't take it any more and skipped to the end. I hated the ending. What a monster. Now I just need some time for that garbage I read to leave my head. There are lots of other writers. I won't be reading any more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are all the main characters stupid?","review":"This could have been a good book. It had a great plot and for the most part good characters, but why in the world can the author actually think a person reading it would want to continue to the end knowing that the main character (who's telling this tale) can be so stupid and so horny as to put himself in jeopardy over and over and over and over again. I'm really becoming disillusioned with authors today. Do they think we (the readers) want someone who is stupid to survive. Very sad to think Dean Koontz thinks enough of this author to write such a lengthy and interesting introduction.

The main character has the same appeal that say, Rodney Dangerfield, the 3 Stooges or Napolean Dynamite may have.Written 1st hand by a 19-year old loser, stranded on an island with his girlfriend who hates him, her hot mother and sisters and their spouses. The men start getting whacked, and then it is up to our dorky hero to protect his babes.While propostourous, it is still a fun read and plausable if you let it be.

I guess it should be in the horror category though because I was horrified at the disgusting perversion and immorality it contained.

IT DIDN'T Sorry is the the word tahat fits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost","review":"This book disturbed me. Not by the violence or situation. It bothered me how Rupert could only think of bedding any of the women on the island. Then he would write about it. I found it strange/bizarre how that aspect of the story kept coming up. Overall the premise was good but I had a hard time dealing with his sexual preoccupation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Disturbing","review":"This book is the fastest page turner that I have read to date. Near the beginning I enjoyed it so much I told some people that it would be an ideal book for a fast vacation read. Then it got so sick and disturbing towards the end that I almost had to take back my recommendation, just to keep people from thinking there was something wrong with me. LOL. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed it. I will definitely be reading more of Laymon's books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Plot is simple and predictable. Story told first person by a sexually starved 18 year old boy. If you like good prose and interesting tales then don't bother with this one."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],C={key:0},N={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(W,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-2ea764fa"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/20.md","filePath":"library/20.md"}'),j={name:"library/20.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
