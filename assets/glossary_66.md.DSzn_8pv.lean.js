This is a modern, and much over-looked classic. It's German Language and subtitled, and very blunt (realistic) in it's approach, straight down to it's tragic, abrupt conclusion.I'm hoping that this will soon be released on DVD, and receive a wider audience.

This book, however, with its succinct style did change my mind. I am not sure we actually should impeach him, but I do, now, believe his behavior rises to a level where he could be impeached.The book, written by a team of lawyers, is written as the articles of impeachment would be laid out against the President. It is well written, and contains explanations of why each item is an impeachable offense. In addition, the appendix holds a wealth of information, including the articles of impeachment that were written for Johnson, Nixon and Clinton.I would recommend that this book be read by anyone who thinks that Bush should not be impeached, as well as anyone interested in how it could be done.

Sure the information you want is all there, somewhere, but it is neither easy to find nor interesting to read. I was given the book at Christmas and only finished it at July. More than often the author takes several pages to describe various conflicting sources of historical information, but in the end does not conclude anything. The book is also rather poor in maps and figures and the text often mentions places and roads without referring the reader to the existing maps. Some times you read through 2 or 3 pages without fully understanding the description, just to find out that the necessary map was there, 2 pages ahead. Also, there is no detailed description of the battle units and armaments used at Alexander's times."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"He lifted the civilized world out of one groove and set it in another...\\" Sir William Tarn","review":"This is a book about one of the greatest of all conquerors, Alexander the Great.

It tells in great detail about the Macedonian army, Alex's training, and his character. The second part of this book goes into detail about the the battles, the wars, and his \\"statesmanship and generalship\\". This book gives a great detailed history of his time and battles from over 3,000 years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work on Alexander's military campaigns","review":"Fullers work is a laudable work on the military campaigns of Alexander. It is a very easy to read book with thoughful analysis of each battle. He begins the book not on Alexander but his father and traces the rise of the Macedonian power that would be passed on from Phillip II to his son Alexander.The book is very well divided into two main parts then broken down again into very well thought out sub sections. This makes for a pleasant read and also makes it easy for reference or research. It is well written and should be able to be read and understood by the average High School student but with enough analysis and detail for a more advanced reader to peruse through and not lose interest. I recommend this book to any student not only of Alexander but also to any student of military history."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought a new expensive blender with the intention of adding smoothies to my diet. This book seemed highly recommended regarding greens. After getting shortly into the book, I found many of the same concerns as others who were disappointed. Without repeating all the examples here, I'll simply say that when I got to the section that asserted that grazing animals get adequate protein from greens (grass) so therefore people should too, I had to give up. Does the author not know that grazing animals have completly different digestive systems than humans, (a fermentation tank called a Rumen)? After that assertion, she lost all credibility with me. I hope I can re-sell my Kindle version of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to the hype; not even close.","review":"I really was disappointed in this book. With all the hype I expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. There are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. Basically we should eat more greens. Other than that much of it is hard to believe. There is absolutely NO WAY all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. Sorry... but NO WAY. Please, moles and warts just fell off.... That kind of claim is a total turn off. The recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. So basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? Way over rated.

First of all, there is no educational background listed for the author. The only thing in this book that even smells of anyone having a college education is the foreword which is written by a psychatrist!!! The rest of the book is filled with testimonials, such as asking person after person how their eliminations (color, consistency, and yes, smell) changed after drinking green smoothies, as well as a person who had a strange growth on their nose that fell-off after they drank green smoothies. There are a few pages with green smoothie recipes that are favorites of some of her family members. Save yourself some money; if you want to make green smoothies, buy a Vitamix or Blendtec blender, put in your favorite fruits, a banana, some ice, and either chard, spinach, or kale, and blend away.

This book shows you how easy and delicious it is to do so. Best of all, you don't have to buy expensive, highly processed \\"green foods\\" to do so. It's just a matter of running to your closest grocer to buy the greens you would never dream of eating (collards, kale, mustard greens, swiss chard, even radishes with their green tops) throw them in your blender with some fruit juice, banana, and frozen fruit and viola' an unbelievably delicious smoothie results!

Unfortunately it has very few recipes or usable information. Worse, much of this is book is simply wrong - a regurgitation of the vegan raw dogma that is simply incorrect. Chimps might not need animal protein - which is why that have extended stomachs - but is it accurate to then assert that humans don't need any animal protein? The author suggests that all mammals are the same. Should we adopt a dolphin or whale diet?Sorry, I really wanted to like this book. I'm in dire need of good recipes for juicing and smoothie creation. Just didn't find them here - or information that I can trust.

The logic stands for itself: their ingredients are essentially superfoods. What could be better for you?A better book would have condensed the rationale for green smoothies into a brief introduction, and then provided the reader with a plethora of delicious recipes with which to experiment.As the book is, however, I am disappointed.

All relevant science, medical and otherwise, confirms that cooked vegetables are digested by humans far more effectively, with greater absorption, than raw vegetables. Raw romaine and other lettuce seems to be okay, but anything else, such as spinach and chunkier green vegetables, should be cooked. This also applies to fruits. Don't take my word for it, though.

I expected this book would be a good introduction into green smoothies and might give me some tips toward healthier eating.The book does contain some recipes and some tips that I found useful.However, the bulk of the book reads like an infomercial, and I found that tone grating. According to this book, drinking green smoothies will get rid of your asthma, eczema, reverse gray hairs, and will CURE CANCER. Really?Excuse my skepticism, but as soon as a nutrition enthusiast claims her particular brand of nutrition will cure cancer, I tend to tune out the rest of the claims.

Granted, she offers an interesting and fun way to prepare and ingest green veggies, so she gets two stars for that. But honestly, wouldn't it be a whole lot easier (and cheaper!) to just eat them as they come?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Really Works","review":"I first learned about raw foods through my work as a marketing consultant when a health coach, who offers raw food consultations and cooking demonstrations, contacted me for a marketing plan. I was highly skeptical. She convinced me to try a 30-day program and add green smoothies to my diet. Victoria Boutenko's book was one of the few I bought as an introduction to this program. Words can't describe how much more energy, clarity and focus I have since drinking green smoothies. While I was in good health before, I feel as if many minor things have cleared up. I highly recommend this book and drinking more green smoothies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greens can change your life!","review":"Victoria gives great information on why we need dark leafy greens in our diet, and a very palatable way to \\"drink\\" them. I've been drinking green smoothies for over a year, and they make me feel so great! I also went on a 1 week retreat where all we had to eat/drink was green smoothies and fresh fruit, and wow! what a transformation. I also recommend all of the Boutenko books, 12 steps, cook books, etc.I am now in the process of transitioning to an all raw vegan diet. There are many health benefits, and this book is the best introduction. Victoria really does her research! Enjoy...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but best for those already eating raw","review":"This is a lovely book. It is heartening to hear how the Boutenkos cured themselves of terrible diseases with raw foods. I think it provides a great service to those on raw foods in that it reminds us of how important it is to balance the kinds of raw foods we eat. I was apprehensive about some of the recipes for the smoothies because I thought they wouldn't taste that good, but the ones I have tried have turned out to be very tasty indeed. For those who want to learn how to go raw I would recommend Rainbow Green Live-Food Cuisine by Cousens and LifeFood Recipe Book by Jubb & Jubb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Raw Foodists","review":"I think this is a great book. I am not a raw foodist or a vegetarian but love the idea of starting my day with a green smoothie. I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and have issues with fertility. Although I thought I had a pretty healthy diet was trying to find a ways to decrease carbs and increase heathly fiber intakes. Breakfast was the one meal for me that was always carb heavy. I've been doing a smoothie in the morning in place of cereal/toast/bagel and it gives me a better buzz than my coffee! The book is also an interesting read and great background on why greens are important!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love victoria","review":"it may be that i just SO adored the boutenko's life story that i would love anything thats thiers, but that said, tho i am no longer doing a raw lifestyle i really appreciate this particular book as i love smoothies and i love victoria so thats all good in my world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information","review":"This book helps me realize how important it is to get the right fruits and vegetables in my diet.

Will recommend to others with any health or mental issues.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I don't write many reviews but had to in this case.I would not call this a book, but more like a large phamplet. It contains 166 pgs of which only 7 are the green smoothie recipes. Testimonials consist of 45 pgs., thats right 45, way overdone to provide verbage where the rest of the book is lacking.There is very little substance to this 'book'. The obvious message is to consume more greens through the use of smoothie drinks and the author gives very few facts to back up the claims. Though I have never doubted the need to consume far more greens, I wanted to learn of more factual information.I also wanted to see lots of recipes with variety. I was left disappointed there.I never did find any credentials for the author, Victoria Boutenko. I only assume they are good and she is a knowledgeable nutritionist of some sort. But the facts are lacking in this book, would like to see more detail.I cannot recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hodes Really Jams","review":"This is the first of Art Hodes' jam sessions, featuring Jimmy McPartland and Eddie Condon.

Guest musicians such as Nelson and Vaughan do not a great album make. Yes, it might have worked much later on 'Supernatural', but only because the material was cohesive and much better. Not the worst Santana album, but not a must have either."},{"rating":"1","title":"could've been a lot better","review":"SPOILERS -sorry!I hate it when heroines apologize when they shouldn't. Kyle is a complete jerk throughout much of this book to Sophie. I hated when he was deliberately insulting and even worse when he threatened to have sex with Sophie's cousin. I found myself screaming at Sophie that she could do better. If Kyle wanted her only for her looks and not when she was 40 lbs overweight, she should've dropped him like yesterday's garbage. He never looked for what was inside. Aha-like Kyle wouldn't be cheating on her later on when she's pregnant or when she gets older and has cellulite and crow's feet. Heck, the guy is almost 38 and she's 23. She should've ditched him and moved on with her life. Ok, I know this is only fiction and HR books are not known for strong female characters, but this one did not rate a 4 or a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half the book is excellent!","review":"SPOILERS!!The first half of this book is really good. Sophie meets handsome Kyle Hart when she's gained a lot of weight for a movie role and she falls in love with him. One day she overhears him saying very nasty and hurtful things about her appearance and it really hurts her feelings. Months later, she has lost the weight and sees him again when vacationing in Jamaica. But she looks so different that he doesn't recognize her. That's when she decides to play a little game with him.This part of the book is good. And when she sees him at the party after Jamaica is really exciting! After that, the book gets pretty ridiculous. Kyle plans a childish revenge on her and she's just a big cry baby about the whole thing. And then it's the usual long and cheesy love confessions.Highly recommended as a beach read or when you go on a vacation some place sunny. Well-written, funny, and like I said, the first part of the book is excellent. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm just the Purchaser","review":"My grandsons will think these are great - hey it's Peyton Manning!

I am a bit surprised by the choice of Sean as the main character to follow the previous novel Rage. In that book I found both Garrick and Michael Courtney to be more interesting and really, Smith did a good job of revealing Sean to be a somewhat cruel and unlikable person in the last book.The romantic subplot is jokingly cheesy...I mean the dialogue is laughable. It is not really a gripping story. I usually skip the hunt scenes in Smith's books, which usually all have either a lion or elephant hunt. The first half of this book is nothing but: not one--but two; both a lion and then an elephant hunt...yawn.Then it is on to more of the story whose characters I couldn't care less about...hard to finish...and it fizzles rather than bangs. Maybe it is just hopelessy dated and doesn't hold up well taken out of a 1980s context.I would skip it and re-read Monsoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ethnocentric","review":"No half-measures with Mr. Smith: The antagonist is black, bisexual and communist.

This album has quickly become one of my favorites. Without question the stand out tracks are This Is Love, and Where the Sun Meets the Sea. Other strong tracks are Just In Time, and Missing You. The rest of the album is very strong vocally. \\"Be The Light\\" is uplifting and spiritual. The weakest track on the album is probably \\"Stormy Weather\\" with it's quirky \\"you are my sunshine\\" lyric. However if you are an Erasure fan you might actually like that one. All in all, the album exceeded my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is an excellent duo on a fantastic cd.

They are just a really fun band to see on stage. This Live DVD, which was filmed over two nights at the Troubadour in Hollywood, does a great job of capturing Pepper's onstage energy and spirit. There are 18 songs on the DVD, running about 80 minutes. All the songs will be easily recognizable to Pepper fans, and both Kaleo and Bret's voices sound amazing. The DVD is also very well produced and edited, and the sound quality is excellent as well. The only downside to the show is that Kaleo and Bret seem to only be able to get the crowd going when they yell and curse at them. Other than that, the concert, the bonus features (music videos, a short documentary, etc) are great and anybody who loves Pepper will love this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Pepper, you'll love the DVD","review":"I saw Pepper twice at the Stone Pony, once in December 2004 and the other in February of 2005, and both times they were great.

You'll only need the large flipper for huge hunks of meat (I've never used the large flipper in over five years.) I think the large and small flippers should be sold separately.

Sure the writing is great but I hate the content. Well I am somewhat of a Raistlin fan so I'm a bit biased but that's not the point. The great thing about the Raistlin-Crysania love team is the idea that love transcends the very idea of good and evil. By making Crysania fall for this other guy once agian shows us the prejudices of this world. It's like saying elves could only love elves. This book tells us that Raist's and Crysania's relationship was doomed from the start. They should have left their relationship open ended since the authors obviously have no wish to resolve it. I mean Gilthanas and Silvara where abe to resolve their problems even though Gilthanas openly reviled her.

Dalmar tells her that she if she gets the other three stones she can speak the gods directy.But the other stone are Neraka the darkest city in all of Krynn(I think).The thing that is missing is that Dalmar say he has to go the burning sea but after that they don't tell what happens to him.

I really didn't like this book, it just seemed meaningless. This whole novel just seemed so flat, even the dialogue was lacking. The simple fact that they brought in some white robe mage called Valin (couldn't they think of a more original name also?) to replace Raistlin is just sad. Nancy Varian Berberick was way over classed in trying to create something between those two characters in one book that could over come the great and complicated relationship of Crysania and Raistlin, especially since the mage was a tiger for more than half the book. You really should stay away from this book; I can't stress it enough.

It played just like a mini version of the t.v. show, which sounds like a good idea, but the creators were completely unable to pull it off. Between levels, there are long dialogues between the characters which set up a plot line. After the dialogues, Buffy goes to patrol and, of course, is attacked by vampires. Unlike the t.v. show, Buffy only fights vampires. I was hoping for some vicious demons to shake things up, but no such luck. The game lacks choices. There are no weapons and you follow an arrow which points out the next vampire. The graphics and action are awful. Sometimes when fighting a vamp, you don't know if you are successfully hitting it or not. I would recommend this only if you are a hardcore Buffy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy kickes ...","review":"I'm a big fan of \\" Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\". So when I heard from my friend that he bought the game on GAMEBOY color, I knew I had to have it. When I read the reviews about the game I didn't feel convinced, but I got in anyway. The game is really great . The stages are fun to play and the best part is that you get to control Buffy the Chosen One. The game is really easy, all you do is press the down pad, B then approach the vampire & stake it. I'm going to be generous and tell you the password that will help you finish the game: BNPXZ9. I hope you'll enjoy staking vampires, killing Ethan the trouble maker, and have a chance at dusting the dragon that controls all Evil.

The Game is just as exciting. You travel around with Buffy and the scooby gang crossing many demons, vampires, and even a few cordettes during your journey. This game will definitly keep you hooked. You become Buffy herself and it's almost like you are in the tv show. The best is when you kill the vampire and he turns the dust. That, of course, is a classic buffy move. With the Stake, Crossbow, and much more. Defeat the minions of evil, move from level to level and proove to everyone that you have what it takes to be a Vampire Slayer. Hey, you never know, you could be the next Buffy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game for Buffy fans.","review":"This game is pretty cool.

The most useful part of the book is the practices with explanations including the CD-ROM.I would recommend the book as a good start for your studies.

I just wonder how the movie (and original book) could be so warm while this sequel is cold and rather flat. To his credit, Groom has interjected some bits of genuine humor like naming Ivan Bozosky instead of you know who. Wouldn't Mike Milkedem have been more true than Milligan?

He meets up with little forest and the two have adventures that take them all over the country. Same basic stuff as in the movie, great feats, amazing luck, bla bla bla, but here here they are mostly just plain silly - like the part when he gets poop all over the town.

Nason presents the path of tiki from tribal cutures into Americana by detailing the influence of primitive work on Leroy Schmaltz (in the 1950s and 1960s) and Shag (present-day tiki cool).Visually, the photography in NOTT is top notch while the writing is informative, interesting, and entertaining.This book is great for anyone who ever thought tiki was cool, hip, and enjoyable and is a must have if you're a Shag fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiki Fans Rejoice!","review":"A comprehensive and enjoyable read.

This is one of them. The late Arthur Cohen and Paul Mendes Flohr assembled a remarkable array of first rate authors to write on an encyclopedic range of topics relevant to an understanding of what Judaism is all about from a contemporary perspective. I've used the book since 1994 in an intro to Judaism course I offer every year, and I have never been disappointed. Occasionally, the essays demand a bit much from an undergraduate student. But as long as s/he is ready to engage in reading texts that don't dum down the issue, s/he'll get something valuable out of it. I recommend this book most highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - This product is terrible","review":"You would think such a simple item would work. I did for about a week, then it just failed. In fact, I bought 2 and the second one JUST failed, which prompted me to come on to Amazon and warn potential buyers. The first one I bought because IT failed.

I've since picked up a $8 usb reader that is much slower but much more reliable. I've done lots of video editing with the firewire card so I don't know what kept killing the drives.

This is a never released material that dates from 1970, in the Isle of Wight, this location got it's popularity for being the last place Jimi Hendrix played.Of course there was a lot of other bands playing on the festival, and Tull was one of them. This is a fine performance made by a band with only 3 albums released, and Ian Anderson loaded of ideas in a very inspired day.The unforgettable flute of Ian floats sweet and angry beyond the numbers, giving us the magic of a real rock menestrel that he are!If you are a Tull fan, you can't miss this historical presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Tull !!!","review":"I don't know how this slipped past me for so long.This is an awsome show maybe Ian has some more stuff in the vaults he could release.

If you are expecting the more mainstream, folk-based Tull, you could be surprised. This is a great example of the British Blues of the day. I often wonder what the results would have been if that had continued in this vien. As a blues fan, I really appreciate this style. You will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live at the Isle of Wight 1970","review":"This is Jethro Tull at it's peak, sounding as good as the studio album and the quality of the recording is great"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birth Of Grunge?","review":"Sure, the recording's not perfect, but there's no denying the energy here. For a band usually associated with crispness and precision, it's refreshing to hear Tull let their hair down (and boy did they have hair in those days!), crank the amps to 11 and let 'er rip!I too wish that live Tull recordings would retain Ian's often hilarious between-songs patter, as this as is integral to a Tull show as the musical virtuosity and visual humour.Nonetheless, this album is a lot of fun. Also recommended is the \\"Message to Love\\" Isle of Wight film--a hilarious counterpart to \\"Peace and Love\\" Woodstock--hippies gone bad!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family History book","review":"I had been given portions of this book by a relative and wanted the complete volume.

I have to reinstall the firmware each time. Note if you're having problems- get the firmware version 2.09.92.09 from Support@datastation.us. Do not use version 10 from the Trekstor website as it has problems with the volume (per Datastation). Also remove the battery before reinstalling the firmware. Now that I've figured that out I think I'll get a lot of use out of this. I save all my music to a 4GB card rather than the device, so I don't lose it with the firmware installation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We bought this and returned it twice before finally giving up on it. Only once was I able to get ahold of customer support for Trekstore - and even they couldn't help us 'revive' the mp3 player.Each one only worked for about a week.

At a higher price the balance changes some, but still technically this unit does exactly everything it says, as well as any comparable unit of this size and form factor. It is slightly larger than one might think, because it does hold a battery. Even the headphones are genuinely good enough, as opposed to the trash some units include.

I'm returning it for a more expensive Creative Muvo, (which this was meant to replace after I broke the Muvo.)Pros: features; mp3's, voice recordings for lectures (although I didn't try out this feature), fm radio, additional storage capacity with memory card.Cons: battery runs out when the unit is off, even when the \\"hold\\" button is activated. There's also a delay when you press a button before the screen shows your selection, so you don't know if the screen isn't changing because you didn't press the button hard enough, if you press it a second time, the first hit is registered along with the next and you end up passing your desired selection. For a crowded train or walking around town, having to stop, stare at the screen, press the button, wait for it to register, press again and wait again to scroll to your song or folder, is not worth the trouble.If you're not \\"on the go\\", this is a fine product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shorts for Bikram Yoga","review":"These are my favorite shorts for hot yoga.

It's not horrible, but it sure isn't really good. CTK's guitar sounds thin, angry, and buzzy - not at all what I expected from a 'bluesman' of any mark. The songs are OK, but the standout track is a cover of Prince's 'Kiss'. I might try one of his more acoustic-oriented albums next, but $14 doesn't just grow on trees, you know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant analysis of medical culture & its consequences","review":"This superb book is a critical examination of the cultural aspects of the doctor-patient relationship and how these may operate to benefit or harm the patient. He discusses the reasons that well-meaning physicians behave in an arrogant and dictatorial manner, express more certainty than they really feel, manipulate their patients, rely on \\"clinical judgment\\" rather than scientific evidence, overtreat, etc. This is not a doctor-trashing book, as he sees much of this as being outside the ability of an individual physician to change given the pressures of medical culture. I recommend his fascinating analysis without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference","review":"Di Pilla's book is an excellent reference for anyone truly interested in addressing slip/fall concerns. This book presents a scientific description of slip resistance measurement, methods for ensuring accurate and repeatable quantification of slip resistance, and recommendations for maintaining slip-resistant workplaces.

What I found is that the whole radio range concept has been turned into one of the biggest marketing scams around. I can't believe it is legal for them to print \\"up to 5 mile range\\" on the box, even with all the fine print. I live in a flat section of Austin, Texas, which is not especially dense but does have some foliage and a reasonable number of houses. I tested the radios using a GPS so that I would know the exact distance to the other radio. I could not believe the result. The radios had very clear voice quality to .25 miles. Voices were 80% intelligible at .35 miles. After that, the radios were useless. There are some nice features on these radios, but give me a break. I'm returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"$75 FCC fee, No NOAA Weather, 1 watt output","review":"I ordered 2 T6400s, but am returning them for a couple of reasons.- This model does NOT support NOAA weather radio channels.- The FCC license fee is $75 per call sign (per FCC web site).- The power output is 1 watt maximum (GMRS radios can be up to 5 watts).I already have an ICOM M3A handheld marine radio for kayaking, and I will buy a second instead of using the Motorola radios. The Marine radios have a 5 watt output, but are about twice the size. If you are looking for a small 2 way radio, look at the T6300 1/2 watt FRS instead. They currently have a $25 rebate, and you'll save the FCC fee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power output of the t6400","review":"I do not own this radio, although I explored all it's features.Per the owner's manual that I downloaded from Motorola, the power ouput on all GMRS frequencies is 1 watt, with the remaining strictly FRS frequencies at one half watt. I came very close to buying 3 of these units for hikes in heavily wooded areas of New England, but even at one watt, I was concerned with the distance. I elected to buy 3 of the Midland G-30's due to their 2 watt output, even though the Motorola had better features such as voice compression, vibrate call, and the 7 other FRS frequencies. The Midland G30 comes with NiMH batteries and charger. The Motorola does not, although it can be purchased through Amazon (...)(the t6400 uses the same accessories as the other 6000 series i.e. t6300). I hope this helps all future buyers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad over all.","review":"I bought two T6400 and tested them against my older motorola radios. I did find that in the two-mile range mode you didn't get two miles. More like a mile and half. My older two mile radios got at least two miles. However in the 5 mile channels I did get close to 5 miles. Sometimes I got over that depending on the terran.

So then they make a tv show, and now a book? This book took the movie and what it had to say and turned it upsidedown. They took all the valley girl talk from the movie and tripled it! Here is the first paragraph... Charity is so fresh. My best friend ,Dionne, and I are totally into doing good for humanity. Like making it more attractive. They also use phrases from the movie, you know the ones like, ensembly challenged, and the word brutil way to much. Now they are giving a makeover to Mrs. Guiests student assistent. It gives the title clueless a whole new meaning! Even the back is inept, it starts out with, Charity begins in your own mansion, right? Do yourself a favor and skip it! I hope this has been helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional work","review":"Gardening books ... sigh.The number of gardening opinions that conflict with or contradict each other usually equals the number of gardening books you have in your library. Sometimes, plus -- I own a book on \\"easy roses,\\" bought on the cheap somewhere long forgotten, that manages to contradict itself on nearly every page. I thought it a great value -- so much confusion offered within one volume!Somehow, Ms. Damrosch's book offers an exception to that rule, and is the guide my wife and I rely on most. It is never out of date, always reliably practical.Sound advice delivered in a civilized and clear manner. You'll wish you lived down the road from her, just to lean across the fence to chat occasionally.We heartily recommend this book, even if you think you've gardened long enough to be above a primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gifted Teacher","review":"Barbara Damrosch and her husband, Eliot Coleman, are the type of teachers that I find the most helpful. They stand in your shoes and ask what would I want to know on this subject, then proceed to tell you precisely and in plain language, not only what you want to know but what you didn't even know to ask.I've taped all their television shows on gardening and have a number of the books both of them have written, but when I walk out in the garden and see a problem, whether it be disease or bug, it is this book that is my guide. I also grab it whenever I'm planting, fertilizing or harvesting most anything.I just put in grapes, blueberries, blackberries, honeysuckle, clematis and the only book I referred to was this one. Never intimidating, always helpful, if I could only have one gardening book, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unparalleled first, a sufficient only","review":"After borrowing this book from the library oh, maybe 20 times my first gardening summer, I broke down and bought a copy. It remains the best such investment I ever made. Damrosch succeeds in giving the real fundamentals other books are afraid of; she tells you not only the importantce of the N-P-K ratio, but how nitrogen and phosphorus and potassium actually influence plant tissue, and what their natural sources are. You could treat this book like a correspondence course (I took notes, made lists, quizzed myself!) but you wouldn't have to: it is written clearly and directly for even the casual reader to understand. All other gardening books I've read since have been embellishments to the basics presented here."},{"rating":"2","title":"lucky find","review":"I stumbled on this book entirely by accident, and judged it first by its cover and illustrations, which are appealing. Now that I've actually read it -- What a great resource! Not only is she a good writer, and a careful logical thinker, she's anticipated pretty much every question the novice gardener could have and has explained her topic with grace and wisdom.

On the positive side, it's a serious competitor to All-Clad. Three-ply construction, heavy weight, and with the very nice rolled edge, which makes it easy to pour from. I LOVE the brushed finish, which hides the ugly water spots our hard water leaves behind on a mirrored finish.The one huge downside for me is that the pan is NOT flat on the bottom. Rather, it's concave. A straight edge reveals that the center is a good 1/8\\" (3mm) higher (further away) than the outer edge. On a smooth top radiant range, only the outermost inch (or so) of the edge is in full contact with the burner. This greatly slows heat transfer, making it quite slow to boil water or heat a big pot of soup. On a coil-type electric or gas range, it works perfectly. However, the concavity renders the pan far less than satisfactory on a smooth top radiant range.

This was not an easy decision, because the rest of my cookware is All-Clad and I love it. For a piece that would be used more seldom than most of the other pieces, I decided to try the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro. The stockpot has a nice, heavy feel to it, and has been used to make soup, chili, stew. I've boiled chicken, ham bones, turkey carcasses, and through it all, have been thrilled with the quality. The lid is a little lighter weight than the pot, but that doesn't bother me, as I don't need a heavy lid. For the price, this is truly a bargain.

Maybe it will come off with bar keepers friend or the like, but I don't have this problem with my All-Clad collection.

Wolf3D is the grand daddy of morden 3D games but it was Doom which made the world sit and take notice. Without Doom there would be no multiplayer tournaments, I think doom is the game which started the multiplayer games with co-operative and deathmatch gameplay. You play a soldier sent to another planet to destroy the aliens and save the world, The gameplay is very good and the controls are very easy to use. The length of all the games are very good. Finally i think an OpenGL patch for Doom called GLDoom was made by a gamer using the doom source code. I read that on the net a long time ago. They could have included that patch in this edition.

At first I thought the author spent too much time on what seemed like ancient history, but it soon became clear that the only way to really understand this conflict was to get a decent grasp of its history. The writing is vital and intelligent. The author blends his eye-witness account with other sources to beautifully create a compelling and tragic mosaic of this horrible conflict.

I think leonidas_of_sparta covered the book's flaws pretty well and i will give only one example of the inherent unbalance in this book. Sebastian Smith faults the western countries for the failure of chechnya because they did not invest during the post war peroid but he then goes on stating that the four foreign engineers (who were beheaded by chechen kidnappers)should never went to chechnya, even though they were during what smith was lamenting - post war reconstruction funded by western powers. This book is so un-balanced that it contradict itself on the same page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but one-sided...","review":"I agree with both Mr. Yin and Leonides. The premise of the book was good, but the book is heavily biased and ultimately unsatisfying if you are a serious student of this and related conflicts. The author admits that the Chenchens are proud, but somewhat thuggish, then goes on to praise how they cherish their knives while at the same time castigating the Russians for acting war-like. War is murderous and both sides in this book play at savagery. The author cannot praise one side and castigate the other - and contradicting himself on many pages - for the same characteristics; he loses all credibility.And, let us not forget that Chechens are supporting Al-Qaida and related extremist,Islamic groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Preschoolers and Beginners","review":"Because it requires very little reading, this is the best game I have found for the age 5 and under Game Boy players.

However, the book does not provide anything of value to a financial services firm of any size or any professional marketers. The book is not bad, but in my opinion (marketer working in financial services, 10+ years experience) it is really only of value to a novice independent sales professional who needs assistance with planning their own personal marketing activities. In fact, if I could make a recommendation to the authors it would be that the next version of the book should focus very specifically on just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises Much But Delivers Little","review":"This book attempts to be thoroughly comprehensive but ultimately fails because often some vital information is missing. I believe that health books which really empower are ones which give real, useable answers, not vague outlines.

He refers to these tests numerous times as providing part of the answer, but I am left feeling that I have a vague idea of the problem, but a wholly inadequate idea of the solution.

All in all, a bit thin (108 pages total) for the price, but for a stunning display of classic designs by Clichy, St. Louis and Baccarat (the 19th Century master studios) as well as a decent if dated guide to pricing on these rarities, a good reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Tight!

Got it from another authorized online retailer. Got the projector, screen and A/V wires installed by a professional. 2 days into the glory of 120 inches, I noticed 2 parallel bars (see uploaded images) on the picture that are distinctly visible on a white or light colored scene/background image. What was hardly noticeable for the first 2 days became an ordeal later on because all my attention was grabbed by those black bars. Called up the CC and they sent a new screen (not the frame etc) immediately. Now I have to go through the painful task of putting the replacement screen myself or shell out money for a professional job. I don't mind getting replacement for stuff but Projector Screen?

The Elite EzFrame screen (120\\") is excellent quality and assembly is straight forward. The end result is an attactive screen with a very flat surface (i.e., with no waves in the screen material). My only negative is Elite has a very limited choice in the screen fabrics offered the EzFrame series of screens. I selected the 1.1 gain matte white. It would be great if they also offered a 1.3 or 1.5 gain white fabric.

The big box stores all said that a grey screen would run a minimum of $1000-$1200. So I was pretty happy to find one for about half that price. I was a little skeptical about the quality prior to purchase, but after getting the screen I was very impressed. I've got an Epson 8350 paired with this screen, and the picture is very impressive! The velvet frame finishes the look off very nicely. My only complaint (and it's not a big one) is that on some screen shots, a little bit of bleed through shows up on 1 corner of the velvet screen.

There are several children in my kids classes who have had ear tubes, and you would never know it. Kids who need tubes do not always shout, and are most likely indistinguishable from the other kids.

These materials include painted papers, Japanese papers, found objects, photographs, etc.Rather than a how-to book, this is a book that presents many finished pieces in all their beauty, and explains how they were done by these very accomplished artists.

I found the educational and historical perspectives to be useful and interesting to read, as well as the lessons and explainations. The author uses many good examples that come from a variety of sources, so it is possible to look through and say, \\"Yes, that's the skill or portrayal that I'm looking for.\\" Collage Techniques doesn't get dry or repetative, nor does it foist a single technique upon the reader.

However, if you are a sim fan, you might not enjoy it as much. Nonetheless, this is the pageantry that is the WWF in your hands. Great graphics, great sounds, good control, it all hits home! This game focuses on double team action and run-ins, but it begs the question: where are those damn Dudleyz and the infamous 3D through a table.

And the characters are very badly done. Their bodies are made very poor, and you have about 3 moves to choose from.Not only is the Rumble a let down, but your only other option in the game is exibition. Thats it folks.

Those who are looking for an options filled wrestling sim will be disappointed but for those looking for a fun, fast paced game Royal Rumble will satisfy. The Royal Rumble mode is hectic but a blast to play. The main problem, and I'm sure this will pop up in every review posted, is that there are only 21 characters so the same characters will show up in the ring more than once. And in a related problem, why Edge and no Christian? Where are the Dudley Boys? With the ability to do tag team moves, it would have been awesome to give that shmuck X-Pac a 3-D. More modes would have been nice, too.But as it is Royal Rumble is an arcade game, and an extremely fun one at that. Having a partner outside the ring to help out adds a lot to the game. I like the powerup system, too. There is something very satisfying about getting that last 'S' and finishing off your opponent with the Rock Bottom.

When I started to play royal rumble every superstar ganged up on me and they only tried to get me out. On exhibition when I would try to hit them they would spin around me and from there on I had no control over them and I could not get 1 hit off on them.And it is almost impossible to get your partner to help you. Also when you go to pin them you end up running across the ring. If you're looking for a fun game to just mess around with then this might be a good game for you, but if you want a championship winning, hard hitting action type game you will probably want to go for WWE Wrestlemania x8 on GC, or Smackdown: Shut your mouth on PS2."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for digital cameras","review":"This is a great software for my digital camera.

Not the most inspiring movie in my mind but it had its moments...I mean, you guys might find this uplifting and WOW!! but I found it to be longish and boring really and it sorta played off like a cheesy TV movie like on the Lifetime. Only Jackson gives off his usual blazing brilliance. Also starring Rob Brown and singer Ashanti who isnt impressive..mostly annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one?!","review":"Out of all the ideas someone could have come up with to spend money on, why in the world would they decide to make ANOTHER \\"sports will help kids\\" movie?! Hasn't this been over done? Not only is it unrealistic (the fact that one man can make such a huge difference), but the plot is really really retarded.

I think all athletes, as well as parents, and coaches should watchi this movie. It shows the imporatance of an education. That we shouldn't just push kids through school to get rid of them thatwe should accept OUR responsibilities that we have in life. I was very impressed expecially since it was based on a true story.

God Bless you Coach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting -- makes you want to hit the court","review":"I saw an advance screening of this film, and really enjoyed it -- Samuel L. Jackson was very compelling in this \\"White Shadow\\"-like role. Uplifting story about a man who takes over as high school basketball coach for an inner city school. He turns the team around from a team that can't win, to one that goes virtually undefeated, and along the way instills discipline and an emphasis on studying that impacts the players lives in a much deeper way. The ending was a little surprising, but given that it was a true story, sometime hollywood endings need to take a backseat. I'd highly recommend this movie to high school students and for those who enjoy sports and stories about beating the odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Movie has a great message and recommend that all teanagers and adults see this movie.

This film has a strong message. NEVER give up on your dreams! Coach Carter is the definition of \\"focussed\\" and is a man of principle, not afraid what the status quo will think of his methods.

Coach Carter is about a basketball team that lives in a rough town and a rough high school. The Richmond Oilers had a really bad coach until the new coach Mr. Carter came around. Coach Carter used to go to the school and broke a bunch of records and knew a lot about basketball. Ever since Coach Carter started to coach, the team progressed and he lead the team to the state championships. This movie is very inspiring and I would give it four and a half out of five. This movie shows you that you can do anything if you believe in yourself. This movie is PG-13 so I would not recommend this to younger kids. This movie is also a true story so the movie always keeps you on your toes.

An oncourt victory would make the rest of theseason lose its meaning.However that is the message of this film. Enduring spirits are not all Hoosiers. Winning isn't everything.

I agree with so many of the other reviewers of this book. There is obiviously no joy in Elaine St.James' life. Along with the obivious ommission of the celebration of Christ's birth, the entire of idea of simplify comes straight down to eliminating everything that the season encompasses regardless of how commericalized it has become.

No tree???I can understand how others might like this if you're sick of the commercialization of the season, or are elderly and too tired, etc. but I still have young ones at home and I want to make fun memories for them w/out showering them with gifts (some presents are their fave foods that I often say no to throughout the year).It does have some good examples that helped me convince my hubby not to spend time with his extended family (the s-i-l is a you-know-what and it's not fun to be around her), so that came in handy!

Because St. James recommends too many times that if you can't \\"delegate\\" to someone else Christmas chores associated with upholding certain Christmas traditions, just don't do them.Lots of contradictions in this book, too. In the chapter \\"Remember What You Once Loved About the Holidays,\\" she recalls \\"The fresh scent of pine when we first brought the Christmas tree into the house.\\" Later on she devotes an entire chapter to \\"Twelve Reasons to Skip the Tree.\\"And then there is the irony of paying money for a book that tells you to cut way back on your Christmas spending. There are a few good tips among the 100 ways St. James offers to \\"Simplify your Christmas,\\" but they aren't worth the price of this book.The bottom line is that, for adults, \\"keeping Christmas\\" involves a certain amount of money, effort and knowledge about Christmas history and traditions.

There is not truly 100 ways to \\"simplify\\" your Christmas, but almost everyone can find at least four or six to simplify theirs, depending on what they find over indulgent or too time consuming. Quite a few suggestions are common sense when you read them, but due to holiday over stress and over planning you tend to forget about them and a quick review is very helpful. My personal favorites are \\"rise above the guilt\\" and \\"halt the runaway train\\" which are chapters on emotions at Christmas and over zealous gifting.I think the beauty of this book is almost everyone will find a few ideas to employ to destress their holidays.

However, there were so many things that I appreciated in the book that I could overlook the filler. Christmas is one of those things where we set expectations for ourselves, and this book does really examine where those expectations came from and how much value they bring to the holiday season.

Though it is a carefully-researched piece of fairly straight-up history, the author has woven a complex fabric, a tapestry revealing an little-known time in American History. He has included several personal stories of historical figures whose destinies were altered by the New Madrid earthquakes without pandering to the maudlin or the sensational. Every element is appropriate to the development of the tale and I read it with appreciation for the writing and the author's art as well as for the insights and information the book provided. I recommend this one highly as a really good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown and underdone","review":"This book, \\"When the Mississippi Ran Backwards: Empire, Intrigue, Murder, and the New Madrid Earthquakes\\" by Jay Feldman strikes this reader as having almost enough for a couple of short magazine articles. Instead, it has been padded out to book length with a series of at most tenuously connected elements that the author attempts, unavailingly, to weave into coherence. In this padding, Mr. Feldman manages to have \\"..veterans of the Napoleonic wars- many had fought with Wellington at Waterloo-..\\" engaged at New Orleans nearly six months before the decisive European battle (Jan 8, 1815 vs. June 18, 1815.) Most military historians attribute the \\"..whites of their eyes..\\" order to one of the colonial commanders at Bunker Hill, often to Israel Putnam - Feldman gives it to Jackson. The continual jumping from place to place and back again; topic to topic and back again; and time to time and back again left this reader dazed but not dazzled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncertain if the River or the Book ran Backwards","review":"Unfortunately, this book's Title is a misnomer as it promises so much and goes backwards from there. It is as if the author were unsure - did he want to write about an historical period in time (1800 to say 1815), or about some very important events (the first steamboat down the Mississippi which just happened to coincide with one of the New Madrid Quakes), or about the not as important but certainly tawdry tale of a failed branch of the Jefferson family. It seems he chose to weave the tales together and, by doing so, did justice to none. He does explore some interesting historical events that coincided in time with the quakes, but fails to make any of the events real or meaningful, leaving the reader wondering why he bothered to write this ultimately superficial book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A uniquely constructed book","review":"What's strange about the excellent When the Mississippi Ran Backwards, by Jan Feldman, is its organization. Throughout the whole book we go from massive earthquake to massive earthquake--due the name of the book--as well as the story of the wise Indian chief Tecumseh (and the usual portion of mangled, naked and scalped bodies as well as the massacre of Indian women and children); the history of the first steamboat (that went from port to port on its way to New Orleans, making a fortune through short side-trips at a dollar a pop); the Spanish control of Louisiana (with graft and treason galore); the savage murder of a slave and the trial of the perpetrators; the whole ending with the War of 1812 and the further slaughter of Americans, Indians and the British. With so much going on, the book makes for relentless movement and breathless action. My own books can be found under Michael Hone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit confused","review":"I would have liked to have given this book more than a two star rating. However, for those who wish to discover more about the New Madrid earthquake, you probably won't find it here. Somewhere between steamboats on the Mississippi, relations with local Indian tribes, and the War of 1812 the story of the quake is minimally told.A glaring error is found on page 227 where the author states that at the Battle of New Orleans the British troops fought with Wellington at Waterloo--a battle that occured six months later. This type of mistake is untenable in that it draws a conclusion within its assertion and suggests the possibility of other errors throughout the text.Readers of history would be better served by David McCullough or Joseph J.

Readers will love the last part of the story when Alex finds herself not an heiress and goes ahead to work in a brothel as a stripper in order to take care of her family. An usual woman who is admirable or like Nick said - a hellion."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so awful that it was painful","review":"I have been a fan of Ms Henley for the longest time and was very dissapointed with this book.

In fact much of it read like a journal entry- descriptive of an individual's experience ending a relationship with little insight into the overall trend and patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"The cap on the top of the blade is designed to be removed for easy cleaning.

Because of this I became afraid to operate it and it has set idle on my shelf for MONTHS. I did not realize that it had a 6 month warranty on it and I never used it when I had first gotten it. Because of this delay, the warranty is no longer valid.

Rick, Robin, Tom, Bun: pull out those original recordings, produce it yourselves, and rerelease this should-have-been classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked","review":"From the band that has put out both some of the best and not so great music of the past 25 years...a sadly overlooked piece of work. \\"I can't take it\\", \\"Borderline\\", \\"Younger Girls\\" (what a nasty little song...would love to see some bold female artist redo this as \\"younger guys\\"...yikes!)...and my favorite on this CD, oddly enough, \\"Heaven's Falling\\" (chorus is fantastic production). Has anyone else noticed how consistently good Robin Zander is??? One of the best vocalists in rocknroll, by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very listenable","review":"Sure, it's not the blisteringly loud, raw-edged bubble punk that we heard on their first album, or the more refined sounds of Heaven Tonight, but this album is a top-notch effort. It's surprising how often I return to this album. Producer Todd Rundgren heavily influences the sound, but it's still classic Rick Nielsen song writing. There are a couple clunkers here and there (Dancing the Night Away, You Say Jump), but the album is so smooth that it's easy to overlook them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapor Trails.... Solid Noise","review":"As a long time fan of Rush I cannot fully express how disappointed I am with their long-awaited new release. Every song on the CD has very few melodic rhythems to grab the ear and make you want to listen. It just sounds like a bunch scrapped sound check jams that weren't good enough and never made into previous songs. It sounds to me like they didn't even try. I've tried to listen to the CD several times, but I can't seem to get through it without turning th CD off. Rush has always tried to push the envelope musically, and I have always been able to get into and appreciate whatever direction that they have gone. I hope that if they decide to write another album, it will be better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"21st Century Rush","review":"It is easy to understand how persons who became Rush fans during or after the Moving Pictures era would be taken aback by Vapor Trails. Remember this is Rush's first album in a half-dozen years, so there are bound to be some changes. Rush's ability to evolve has contributed to the long-term strength of this talented trio.Vapor Trails has a bass-heavy, in-your-face sound, quite unlike the slick production of previous Rush releases. No synths here, but the musicianship and songwriting are still first-rate, thus proving these guys still have what it takes after three decades. Geddy Lee's vocals are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the harmonies usually work well. The best songs are Ghost Rider, Sweet Miracle, Secret Touch, and Earthshine. Overall, Vapor Trails is a very worthwhile CD that should be part of any Rush fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am in awe!","review":"I just wanted to say...Thanks, Rush! This is true art. Creative as all get out. Straight from the heart. I am so grateful to you for what you offer us. Please continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not interesting","review":"As a counterpoint to those reviewers who seem to want to position this album as an acquired taste...caveat emptor. I've also had the CD in the car for a few weeks, and I have to say, it's just not a memorable experience. It feels tired; the guitars are sludgy and uninspired; the drumming could be anybody; and the clever wordplay seems almost forced when placed atop this melting, amorphous heap of musical slop. After waiting seemingly endlessly for this new disc, and hearing such glowing praise on Amazon, I couldn't wait to try it out; this'll be the last money Rush gets from this formerly loyal fan for a good long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too darn loud","review":"I love Rush sound and its evolution throughout the years. I own almost all of the CDs plus some vinils.This could be a very good CD, as the songs are good. Nevertheless, Vapor Trails is *not* a good CD.This CD is recorded so loud that does *not* sound right. The sound is so distorted that you cannot tell if the lead guitar is Alex Lifeson or your punk neighbor down the street, using a Spinal Tap-type amplifier cranked all the way to \\"eleven\\".It's is a real shame that a band this good, with such virtuoso musicians, get their work all destroyed because a dont-know-better sound engineer decided to crank the amplifier to \\"eleven\\".When I listen to Rush I want to listen to good musicians playing. If I want it loud, I have my volume control, thank you very much.I'm disturbed by this trend of cranking the volume so high that musical skill doesn't matter anymore.:("},{"rating":"1","title":"you've got to be kidding!","review":"What are these guys trying to prove? That they can still play their instruments? That they still exist? The song writing on this album is virtually non-existent. The lyrics are typical Rush without the melodic wrapping. This album is really more of an experimental studio session that would have been better left in the studio. Sorry, folks, but as a Rush fan this was embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Flatline","review":"Lyrically, this album is Rush's usual brilliance, but musically, this album is a total bust. I don't know what Alex, Geddy and Neil were thinking putting out such a sonically imprecise album. The first song \\"one little victory\\" is the only likeable song on the album. Some are tolerable, and some are just plain garbage. I long for albums like Power Windows, Roll The Bones, and other such sonically brilliant albums. Alex is a tremendous guitar soloist and has done himself, the band, and the fans a cataclysmic disservice by denying his talents. I can only hope for better the next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel the frustration...","review":"Wow, I got this album and the _first_ thing I noticed was the _horrible_ mix. I have a wonderful full spectrum EQ and it's still been very difficult to achieve a desireable sound with this album, and re-equalization is neccessary from track to track as well, sometimes even multiple times within a single track! I love the album, I really do like the songs and I think the band is punching through the new millenium quite fashionably, but I cannot help but become infuriated at how difficult it is to enjoy the great songmanship of the band through _such_ a horrible mix. It's just a shame to have them release such a pivotal album with such an untalented sound engineer. If you can get through the aural tourture of the overdriven highs and overpowering lows you might be able to enjoy another wonderful romp through Rush land...otherwise, pull out good ol' 2112 or Roll the Bones..."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 years in the making but well worth the wait","review":"This CD is definately worth the wait. It is not Rush's best CD but it is diferent. Rush has musically taken a new path on this CD. The keyboards are almost completely done away with and Neil Peart defiantely is playing at his hardest. Although the guitar solos are few and far between the vocals, drums, and bass make up for it. Geddy Lee's voice is as sharp as it ever was and the percussion is amazing as well. The opening track \\"One Little Victory\\" is a prime example of Pearts talent and the lyrics are well written as always. A few other standout tracks are \\"Ghost Rider\\" \\"Nocturne\\" and \\"How it is\\" This is not Rush's best album but one of their best in years and its deifnately a must have for any Rush fan and if you havent listened to Rush before this album is the perfect reason to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"great songs mastered crappy!5 stars if mastered properly.","review":"I really think the songs on this album are fantastic!but ruined by no dynamic range!but i think putting the songs through my tube amp with my 24 bit hrt music streamer with jriver music will make it sound much better.but i will remaster it myself unless rush remaster the whole album.is there a better vapor trails import that sounds better?anyone know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly melodic and textural hell","review":"First, I love RUSH. I have seen them countless times in many venues and have never been dissapointed...until VAPOR TRAILS. This album has virtually no melodic substance. It's as though they started jamming and Geddy sang whatever came to mind in a completely impromptu way. Melody and song structure are tough to grind out and RUSH didn't do the work necessary to produce masterpieces the likes of their earlier work. I never thought I'd be saying this about a band I have enjoyed for decades, but this record should never have been produced. On the bright side, however, the musicianship is, as always, tremendous. And my 2 stars are my testament to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, murky sound","review":"This album is definitely different - a tough one to rate. I hated it on first listen, but it's grown on me. It's a throwback to mid-70's Rush, with rough, raw, straight-ahead rocking assault. Given this, the murky sound quality seems appropriate, though I'm not enamored of it. Even so, I've come to feel it's one of their best - only \\"Counterparts\\" is better in the last 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Rush!!!!! More than a","review":"I've been a Rush fan since Moving Pictures and have followed them religiously since. The long wait since T4E is now over and the results are absolutely mindblowing. This is undoubtedly the most complex and satisfying Rush release since Moving Pictures, at least for me! Gone are the lush landscapes of keyboards....this is a very crunchy, guitar loaded, driving, percussion riddled release. The opener, One Little Victory is just astounding in its relentless attack. Alex's guitar work hasn't sounded this vicious in years and this is lyrically Rush's most interesting stuff since Signals. It's clear the guys have been through some rough times, especially Neil, but it's great to see they regrouped and harnessed that energy so very productively. Favorites: Ceiling Unlimited, Earthshine, Nocturn and Out of the Cradle (and of course, Victory)I'll be looping this one for some time to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush Rocks","review":"Rush hit a home run with this one! I specifically like the guitar work from both Alex and Geddy. Neil was his usual awesome. It's powerful rhythms and strong vocals had me rocking along with each song. Didn't miss the keyboards - glad they got back to the old ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album destroyed by poor production","review":"I am a huge Rush fan, and I was certainly excited about this release. However, due to the poor production it just sounds awful, to the point where it is nearly unlistenable. The whole thing just sounds like a big, muddy mess. How Rush could have allowed it to be released in this state is beyond me. Sure, there are places on the Internet where you can find directions on how to \\"fix\\" this album (by ripping it into MP3's, correcting it somewhat and re-burning the CD), but when I buy a CD, I don't expect to become the band's new recording engineer.There are some high points despite the poor quality of the recording, especially \\"One Little Victory\\", \\"Earthshine\\", and \\"Ghost Rider\\". Listen to any of the Vapor Trails songs on the last two live recordings (\\"Rush in Rio\\" and \\"R30\\") and you'll see how much better they sound than what is on this CD. Very disappointing - there's a reason why this is one of Rush's worst selling albums of all time, folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!!","review":"This album is great!I have been a Rush fan since 79.This is already one of my favorites.Best album since Power Windows.Don't be stupid,buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rush Album Since Grace Under Pressure","review":"I remember when Grace Under Pressure was released. I was in line that day to buy it on the first day. It remains one of my favorite albums. Vapor Trails is the best thing Rush has done since then. Every track is good, although I really like Ghost Rider in particular. They remain the most musically talented rock band in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am a huge Rush fan (since Signals). But this album is just terrible. If I had never heard of Rush before, I would think that they can't write songs. They all sound the same - it's hard to tell where one song ends and the next starts. This albums is eminently forgettable. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst mixing since Subdivisions","review":"Regardless of what you think of Rush's latest musical direction (personally I think its mediocre), the sound quality and mixing of this CD is embarrasing and inexcusable in this day and age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed...","review":"I have to agree with Sughosh Varadarajan. Rush at they're most desparate to be different, along with trying to fit in with all the other crappy bands that are out there now. This album is very disjointed and noisy. Songs are difficult to grasp and very unmemorable. Seems like a rushed effort. Overall not much heart of true thought really went into making this album. Hopefully the next release will be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cacophony","review":"This has to be one of those most harsh, noisy, annoying records I've heard in a while. Mind you, I don't make a habit of hearing records like that, but I'd certainly never expected Rush to head in that direction. I haven't really followed their career as such, but what attracted me to Rush was their strong sense of melody within the progressive framework. Sadly, none of that is on display here. It's just a sonic assault from the word go, with completely nondescript songs.A poor effort from a band I'd only just begun to really respect. If you, like, me, have heard and loved \\"Moving pictures\\" and \\"Permanent Waves\\", you'll want to stay far, far away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you thought you'd heard it all from Rush.......","review":"When you thought you'd heard Rush go into all the musical directions possible, they find a new one. ...the songs on this cd cannot be distinguished apart(sound wise). \\"Vapor Trails\\" has a real heavy grunge feel throughout with lots of guitar distortion. Much of the time Geddy can barely be heard over the music. The production quality and clarity seems poor to me. It's not a bad sound for the grunge scene but if you are a Rush fan of (2112,Farewell,Grace,Fly,Moving Pics, etc), you'll be disappointed. I have to say I think \\"Test for Echo\\" was a better cd if that's any help for some of you deciding whether or not to buy this one. I have to say that I gave another couple of listens after the initial and some of the music is growing on me a bit. It's very different and that has fans wondering about the direction that Rush has taken in 2002. Give it another listen once the shock has worn off because there are a few very good tunes mixed in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush is Baaaaaaaaaaack!","review":"Since 1975, Rush has been jamming. Here is where I say, you are looking at one of their greatest albums ever! Each song is totally amazing and after 27 years and 22 albums, these guys still can make noise like none other. The opening song has an amazing drum solo that blows you away. Each song is different from the others and I see PLATINUM in it's future. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh my GAWD.....","review":"This album is unreal...By far some of their best work. It took me a few spins to warm up to some of the songs, but I'm hooked now. \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\", \\"Earthshine\\" and \\"Freeze\\" are stunning examples of playing in odd-time signatures. On the other side the lighter tunes like \\"How it Is\\" and \\"Sweet Miracle\\" help to balance out the album.The whole album has a much darker sound than those of the \\"synthesized\\" 80's, and I've seen people's comments that Rush has sold out by going \\"grunge...\\" I'd really like to see a \\"grunge\\" band try and even come close to matching the playing on this disc. The 6 year wait for a new album was definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word...Awesome!!!","review":"I've just listened to this album for the 4th, now going onto the 5th time. Its got energy!! Its got Power!!! It's better than the last couple of albums COMBINED!!! I cant wait for Rush to come through on tour!!! My recomendation is to buy this album, no ifs ands or buts!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you, Rush for the worst sounding album we can buy!!","review":"Come one, come all. Want a horribly produced CD with great songs? VT is the album for you.Check out Disturbed's new album Believe. This thing is clipped all to hell (obviousy mixed/mastered hot), but it's not distorted and still comes through very clear and powerful. Korn's new album Untouchables is another shining example of hot production done right.With nearly 30 years in the business, you'd think Rush would be the example of how to produce an album. Apparently the new guys figured it out in a fraction of the time on thier own.If this is a new trend for the band, I should probably buy new speakers now to prepare for the next LOUDER IS BETTER masterpiece from Rush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is the worst Rush album ever. It lacks depth & imagination & sounds like it was recorded in a garage with a dictaphone. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to this album & was hoping I was going to hear something pretty diverse and interesting like the Rush of old, but I was severely disappointed & had to take it back to the store. In the past Rush have recorded some of my favourite material, but with this latest release they appear to have created a new genre of music - 'Regressive Rock.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great song, but the worst production ever!!!","review":"\\"From what I can actually hear\\", all the songs on Vapor Trails are awesome. But, as said in many of the reviews, this is the most poorly produced album in existance, period. You would think that with all of the lessons learned, advancements in recording technology, and the fact that Rush is not some throw-away band that's here today and gone tomorrow, the producers would have actually made this thing listenable! Worst sounding CD I own!!Songs = 10+Production = -10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen from the Bottom up","review":"I just listened to the disc start to finish right out of the box. The first few tracks reminded me of the \\"new agey\\" sounding stuff that has been on the last few releases. About half way through though, this disc really starts to rock. Starting with Secret Touch, the Cd rips right to the end. They should have inverted the Song order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glimmer of Hope","review":"Vapor Trails holds a glimmer of hope for fans of Rush, however, while it tries to rock a bit harder than recent albums, it lacks overall musical inspiration and melodic structure. Vocal lines are largely directionless and void of emotion, and even some of the guitar riffs are reused on this album from A.L.'s Victor project as well as previous Rush albums. Nothing really new to grab onto from this album except for a few cool production tricks. I am very happy to see the band back together again after such a long break, but I really don't feel rewarded for waiting so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rush ever!!","review":"From two tragic events in Neil Peart's life come the best Rush lyrics ever. The songs are more personal than ever, and the playing is among the hardest rocking and best arranged Rush ever released. This album just proves that some bands do get better with age.I am glad to see them leave the synthesizers behind for a more raw guitar-bass-drums approach. This is what they do best, and they do it better than anyone else. Welcome back Rush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad sound, forgetable tunes","review":"I am a hugh Rush fan - I have all their cds. My favorite is Power Windows (1980-1989 -best era for the band). But this cd? The sound is bad, no catchy bass lines or guitar riffs. This is not the Rush I used to love and listen too...Geddy, get back to basics! This cd is all over the place. Not even good for real fans. Avoid if this is your first Rush cd! This cd was made by another band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush: back to the limelight","review":"Well, I am a huge fan of Rush, and all I can say about this new album is that if you are a half fan as I am, you're gonna like it.This album is similar to \\"Test for Echo\\", but a little harder. The sound is pretty raw, basically due to the little presence of keyboards.Neil Peart rocks on this album. He has recovered very well from his personal tragedies. He demonstrates why the people calls him \\"The Master\\".Geddy Lee is awesome, as always. The bass playing is just perfect and the voice is more mature, yet high as it always has been.Alex Lifeson's guitar has evolved into a new sound, but keeping that characteristic that has marked him since the beginning.It's an excellent album. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"about as good as their last cd","review":"To me, this cd is a whole lot of noise with no real musical direction. Alot of the songs sound very similar and only a few really stick out. With the time these guys had after their last album you think each song would be different, but it sounds as if they wrote every song in one day. As a drummer, the drum parts are very simple which bummed me out.With the release of their 70's live cd as part of \\"different stages\\" i thought i was going to get something that was more old school, themed, lots of odd changes and fun to listen to but also fun to try and learn and play. there's nothing on this cd that makes me wanna pick up my sticks and play along to.I hope they get it right on their next cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing it?","review":"I've been listening to Rush since 1983, and they have since become my favorite band. I've listened to Vapor Trails six times now, and I still cannot get into it. There is a serious sense of evocation missing that is so characteristic of their music. I am going to give it a few more tries, but I am not optimistic. Before doing that, I think I'll listen to Permanent Waves or Exit...Stage Left first though."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't get this one first time around but it gets better","review":"This is definitely not a safe play by Rush. It is defintely a attempt to try to break new ground. I'm going to say it's as good say A Farewell to Kings(my personal favorite) but it gets better every listen. My favorite's of the cd so far are Earthshine, One little victory, Ghost Rider, Sweet Miracle at least so far sometimes things change as you listen to cd overtime. It is a very bass oriented cd sometimes a little rough to listen to in some parts i.e ceiling unlimited. It depends on what you want out of rush cd. If you like rougher tunes then this cd is probaly for. I think Earthsine may end up being a classic rush song. This cd is not perfect but they are trying to do something different"},{"rating":"2","title":"How it is...","review":"We had to wait a long time for this album, but it was worth it. I like it more and more every time I listen to it. It takes some time to understand the words and live them, but it's fantastic to see their truth. I used to think that RUSH was dead. They are more alive than ever.Thank you for being a part of my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the [in the world] are they singing about!","review":"I love Rush, but this is bad. What happened to Tom Sawyer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Thanks","review":"Only live show can help these messy jam sessions - pieced together by Geddy with a computer. Neil must have been dissapointed by the music Alex and Geddy matched to his most personal lyrics to date. The sound production is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The curtain is falling...","review":"I have loved Rush since junior high, but this album demonstrates the wisdom of the saying \\"quit while you're ahead.\\" Maybe I'm being too harsh, but these songs just aren't interesting for the most part and they sound like the last gasp efforts of a band that's beyond its prime. Rush is a great band, as their live concerts attest, but all good things must come to an end. They would have been better to stop at Counterparts. Nothing since then, with the exception of Different Stages (Live) has added to their legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but........","review":"Sorry guys - I am a huge Rush Fan going back to my teenage years, but this album just does not have it. I cant hear any of the great drums of Peart. WHere are songs like Tom Sawyer? Even my 16 year old likes the old Rush stuff. This album is a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"There really isn't anything to want to make me listen to this after the first couple of listens, outside of pure loyalty to the band. There's absolutely no melody in any of the songs, and nothing memorable in almost the entire record. It actually gave me a headache listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a Rush fan for more than 20 years and have been through the various transitions in style. Yet, no matter how many times I listen to Vapor Trails, I can't seem to find any direction with this CD. Certain tracks seem disjointed at times while others pound constantly with drums. With all the hype this CD was given, I expected a style similiar to that of 2112. This album was a real disappointment considering it's coming from a band that's been around for more than 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUSH RETURNS","review":"Rush is back ,this album rocks.a progression album that makes up for not only the years they were on haitus but also the not so inventive albums of resent release.

What a surprise.My two favorite bands seem to be going in different directions and I\`m not talking about musical directions. I can't believe how AWFUL Vapor Trails is, the sound quality is just plain bad, the arrangements feel forced and the songs simply aren't good, let alone memorable. The lyrics are good, but that doesn't matter when the rest of it just sits there. I'm struggling just getting through this thing.On the other hand, Rapture of the Deep is everything Vapor Trails isn't. Great performances, fantastic songs, great lyrics, good sound quality. Deep Purple sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the flow of the album is just outstanding.It's safe to say this is not Rush\`s finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple\`s.Vapor Trails = 1/2 starRapture of the Deep = 4 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty awful","review":"i'm writing this as not a huge rush fan...just a shadow in there play so this was my first album i had bought by them.. and i was really excited when i put this in my CD and was blow by the riff of \\"one little victory\\" then came two poor efforts \\"ceiling unlimited\\" \\"ghost rider\\" then it picks up with the fantastic song \\"peaceable kingdom\\" with it's heavy riff then really after that i turn the album off because it become MEDIOCRE so really they could of put \\"peaceable kingdom\\" on the single \\"one little victory\\" and left the rest of the songs in the valt because they are AWFUL.. when it has no substance...i won't be buying anymore rush albums"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried... but I'm sorry...","review":"According to most people that have reveiwed this album it's a great one.

I just get exhausted... There's only a few songs I can stand - \\"Ghost rider\\" and \\"Sweet miracle\\".If you're looking for a good Rush album, check out \\"2112\\" or their first self titled release \\"Rush\\".

Let the musician write music and the producer do his job.Soooory"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Rush of old","review":"I've listened to this CD three times or more at work and I'm still wondering if it is ever going to sound good. The only song I like on it is \\"Vapor Trail\\", the other songs just don't grab me. Maybe Rush has run out of good material. Most groups run out a lot sooner. Some of these songs sound annoying, not characteristic for Rush. If it was their first album I'd probably like it more but when I consider what has come before there aren't practically any of their other albums that I like less than this one. To make things even worse, the sound is muddled throughout the whole CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid Trail","review":"I bought this new Rush CD shortly after it was released. I listened to it. I cried. I then went out to my backyard, dug a hole, and buried it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the beginning of the end?","review":"This cannot be the Rush I have grown up with? This album is veryharsh in most places and is missing the important aspects: such as guitar solo's, drum fills, chops and most importantly of all \\"melody\\"! Geddy does do a commendable job on the bass though. Alex and Neal just leave you wanting to hear more. The music is very convoluted, trying to sound too much like all of todays so called Rock Acts and very uncomfortable to listen to like the opener \\"Vapor Trails\\". Don't get me wrong, I love Rush, but I have listened to this CD over and over and just cannot get into it. I have a good ear for music and there is NOTHING TO GET. There are no catchy melody's or hooks and even the album cover stinks. I just hope the rest of their forthcoming recordings don't sound like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The first minute of Vapor Trails - I thought - would be a sample of how powerful the rest of the album would be. I was wrong. Each track, after the title, blends with the other and could easily be mistaken for a track on Test For Echo.Rush is starting to sound boring...and that is something I never thought I would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever Rush release","review":"wow i dunno what the trio wanted to prove - that they can make a heavy album? the end product is awful. the guitar sound is so muddy that i wonder sometimes maybe its really a sessions player. whatever happened to the geniuses who made light-but-rocking gems like power windows, grace under pressure etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"never under-estimate the power of Geddy and crew","review":"so, i bought this album not knowing what was on it...my fist 5 minutes of listening , i thought \\"OK, this album sounds like it is goin to kick some major A$$.\\" it took me about a week of listening to really understand what these musical genius' were doin. I love the fact that it is a straight up ROCK album..no keyboards or fluffy stuff..i like the last few Rush albums, but this one really stole the cake.IF you are looking for a good ol' Rush jam with killer guitar work, drums, and that amazing RUSH progression that they have in their music, i would recommnend this. My favorite songs are Secret Touch, The Stars Look Down, Earthshine, One Little Victory...otherwise, there is really not one bad song in this album...Never under-estimate the power of Geddy and crew..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, sparkling, luminescent!","review":"Rush have really outdone themselves, giving long-time fans like me the Rush album we've dreamt of. Vapor Trails is vibrant, immediate, dark, emotive, and powerful, and will rank up among \\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"2112\\" as a seminal work in their career. The songs are organic -- they've abandoned the everpresent keyboards that have been on their albums since 1977 -- and direct. Neil Peart has set a new standard for himself with the lyrics -- moving from his familliar role of 'observer/reporter' to a place more personal, perhaps to a place more painful. The band has maintained their integrity, drive, professionalism, and dedication to their fans -- and Rush fans everywhere can be grateful that they stuck together through the pain and uncertainty of the last five years. Incredible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth about the Mastering","review":"Yes, this CD is mastered so poorly it's unlistenable after a couple songs due to distortion and lack of dynamics(which is the reason for my rating). However, this is neither the band's nor the mastering engineer's fault. Record labels demand that their CDs are louder than all others; they have absolutely no regard for how this affects the music. They simply do not care. So, if you're going to complain, please complain to the record label responsible for releasing this. To find out more about the \\"loudness race,\\" visit http://www.loudnessrace.net. Also, contrary to the misinformed belief of one reviewer, turning down the volume will not make things better; you're simply turning down distorted and overcompressed music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite RUSH sound at first, but a huge relief.","review":"I must say, along with everyone else, that this CD demands and deserves closer inspection and further acquaintance. I was a little overwhelmed and confused at first, but now I find new elements each time I listen. That experience has held true for me, regarding RUSH, for the past 24 years.I was first attracted to RUSH in the late 70's by their overall sound, but I was caught and held by Neil Peart's virtuosity as a musician and lyricist. And although the sound has changed many times during the years, I am delighted to find that virtuosity (and indeed that of Lee and Lifeson) is ever present on this CD. The first eight bars of the first song scream \\"Neil Peart is back!\\" In no uncertain terms.What a relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a 0, but here we go with a 1","review":"Hooray, Rush it back.Hooray, we have a new album.Boo, the production is horrible and anyone giving this album 5 stars is insane. 5 stars means the album succeeds in songwriting, performance, and production. The performances, though admittedly pieced together on a computer are good. The songwriting, again the result of piecing together jams on a computer, are also good. The production, well, can an album sound any worse?For those that own the Rush in Rio DVD, check out the Vapor Trails tracks used as background music for the documentary. Notice a difference in sound quality and clarity? The original recordings or mixed tracks were obviously damaged between leaving the studio and reaching the pressing plants. Clean up this CD, already!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they hadn't released this album.","review":"Despite being a big Rush fan, I could not take this album. If you like the modern day alternative music, you would like this album. Yes, true Rush has always evolved, but it should evolve better than rest of the music-world, thats the standard Rush has set for me as far as I am concerned and anything less is not acceptable, no matter they are old, or Neil Pert lost his family. I think Geddy Lee should have explored more of his tempo/music like he demonstrated in his \\"Favorite Headache\\". In other words, I am not listening to Vapor Trails again, I have already given it couple of tries. Sorry if I offend you."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst rush album!","review":"its easily their worst. its got all the bad qualities - muddy guitar sound which seems like some sessions guitarists is playing, awful vocals by geddy, and really annoying noises all throughout the songs. i can't believe this is the same band that produced albums like \\"grace under pressure\\", \\"power windows\\", \\"hemispheres\\" etc. fans of classic rush, keep away from this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise","review":"I'm a huge Rush fan. However, who knows if I like this album. It's mastered so badly that I can't listen to the whole disc. It's dynamically-compressed and clipped; every song sounds like noise to me.My recommendation is to wait until Rush masters this disc properly before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change of Pace","review":"Rush has done it again. The ability to change their style and variety is one of the reason this band has been around so long. It is not the best piece of work from these musicians, but it rocks none-the-less. Pearts lyrics again show his poetic abilities, I only wish I could write as freely as he does. By the way I think toddbees needs to get a new sound system, Geddy comes across loud and clear throughout all the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Rush?","review":"30 years in music with such incredible albums as 2112, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Presto, etc. and THIS is what Rush releases after their hiatus? THIS is worthy of being included in thier catalog? Rush have lost it musically. I think they've lost their hearing too (the sound quality is atrocious for a modern day, major release). Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the the Fame","review":"I love Rush, but this is not their best album to be nice. Perhaps all the praise is from those who just crave a new album. This one is overproduced and in laborious to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vapor Trails","review":"All Rush albums are great. However, this long awaited studio album from Rush is possibly the best Rush album since Signals in 1981."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush Returns","review":"Rush's first record in 5 years is their most personal and introspective statement ever. There is no \\"Tom Sawyer\\" or \\"Spirit of Radio\\" here, but it is still a fitting return from one of the finest rock bands ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"really poor sound quality","review":"listen to Vapor Trails all the way through and you will get a headache ... the really poor sound quality and clipping tracks make this the worst sounding Rush album ever released ... this is worse than some of those poor quality bootleg mp3s out there ... save your money and don't buy this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible mix!!!!","review":"I love Rush. I have a full collection of their works. This is their all time worst CD. It is the worst mix of any professionally released cd ever!!! Every single song is clipping. Check out this link ...The really sad part is that behind this awful mix is some good writing and playing. The problem is the mix is sooo muddy that you can't really hear it. This CD is defective and should be recalled and remixed and reissued. Whoever is responsible for mixing this should be flogged.Jeff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"What surprises me is that this album gets any good rewievs at all. This is without doubt the worst Rush album ever. Come on! What happened to the band that made albums like Moving Pictures and Permanent Waves. This album is unlistenable. The production is a mess. Even after listening to the album several times it is impossible to find anything of value. It is just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"once they were great!","review":"what an horrible cd! It sounds noisy and all tracks are such anonymous that I even don't remember a single melody! How great they were .... avoid this Vapor Trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's true - the sound is awful - 3 stars","review":"I recently listened to 'Roll the Bones' and was amazed again at how well produced Rush has always been up until now. Their hallmark has been stellar sound, challenging music, memorable and meaningful lyrics, and outstanding musicianship.Unfortunately, the lyrics are about the only thing I can really confirm to be up to par on this cd. True, 'How it Is' overcomes all of the obstacles and is the lone standout on this dismally produced cd.Alex's guitar just seems lifeless (no pun intended). The distortion makes no sense. Where he can normally create wonderful sound landscapes he just seems to be meandering around the fretboard. And it's not his fault. It's the sound. It is not at all produced correctly for his guitar. In turn the entire cd is thrown off.I wish we could say more for this return.This album was rated 3 stars by me but I cannot seem to get it updated correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a chance.","review":"I was hoping for a great fantastic cd . IT is good though ,not the best but good but just listen a few times . It will grow on you . It seems like a hybrid of test for echo and counter parts ..If you like that . Still good and different for the times . Not for all but I like it ,it may not reach expectations . I have no real complaints ..Just go with a hunch thats all i can tell you ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does presentation count for anything?","review":"Yeah, the songs are pretty [darn]good and it's great to even have an album after what this band's been through, but the way VT was presented as an \\"official release\\" is pathetic. If the whole point of this album was for the guys to get reaquinted, hang out, jam and \\"see what happens\\", then treat it as such. Don't toss this sonic trash to the fans through a major label when you know it's far from ready for mainstream. You actually want fans to pay for this [fluff]? As if this album, with its horrible production quality, can even stand up with the rest of Rush's catalog. VT should have been released as a free download on the web. Yeah, the songs are good, even though they were pasted together on a damn computer, but the presentation is attrocious.(Why can't we have a 0 star rating?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Rush Album Ever","review":"I own every Rush album and have been a fan since 1978. This album sucks. Geddy Lee holds each syllable of every word he sang for an extended period of time and ruined this album. Alex Lifeson's guitar work is lazy and unimaginative. The only redeeming quality of this work is Neil Peart's drumming which as usual is excellent. Please go back to the drawing board and produce a great album. If you want to listen to Rush then buy Caress of Steel, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Roll the Bones or Counterparts.... Throw this CD in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it!","review":"I'm a huge Rush fan (since 1982) and I alway have been. I own every album and have seen them in concert four times (it'll be five times after August 17th) but I hate to say it, I just don't like this album. Nothing about the songs stick with me. It seems like our beloved boys from Canada are trying too hard to be \\"modern\\". The melody's are confusing, Neils lyrics are cryptic, and Geddy's voice is lost in a cavalcade of overwrought riffs.Another problem is the albums length. 70+ minutes! Why oh why do bands today feel the need to fill every bit of CD space with sound even when most of it is filler ....? 1980's Permanent Waves barely cracks 30 minutes and only has six songs but every song is wonderful and melodic.I know Rush will never again achieve the heights they reached in the early 80s but they can surely do better than this. Especially when we have to wait 5 years between albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing!","review":"I am completly disappointed with this record.How the group with such a fame could publish something like this? There is no melodiousness on it,which is characteristic for the group.In the foreground there are heavy guitars-uninspired,unmelodious(there is NO guitar solo!)no keyboard ,flat drums ,monotonic, with no characteristic for N.Peart passage.The disk is fatlly produced and mixed.Compositions are monotonic and similar to one onother.It really makes impression , that it was recorded in garage- with the sizzle in the guitar passages.Have the producers of this record ever heard about HDCD? And gentelmen from Rush listened to it even once after mixing?Luckily there are good records of them!!!Fun of Rush from 20 years"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Effort!","review":"I agree with a LOT of the negative comments expressed in other reviews; this album has faults. And yet...I REALLY like it!It's the first Rush album since Moving Pictures that you can actually jump around the living room to!I also think that Neil's 'drum lessons' have REALLY paid off. While some have expressed an understandable disappointment in the relative straightforwardness of the drumming on this album, to me the difference is tremendous. VERY powerful and direct. The talented teenage showoff takes a back seat on this album while Neil Pert plays for the songs. He's not playing for drummers here, he's just having a blast. Way to go, boy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Big Victory for Rush","review":"Wall-to-wall guitars, soaring vocals, slamming bass riffs, and drums as only the Professor can play 'em -- Rush is back, and with a passion. Vapor Trails is the loudest, thickest, heaviest, most personal, and most endearing Rush album in 20 years. There's a sense of reckless abandon in how the songs are arranged and performed, like a roller-coaster ride in the dark -- you have no clue what's around the next corner, or when the bottom will drop out. The ride leaves you breathless and disoriented, and you love every second of it. Congratulations to Geddy, Neil, and Alex on a fabulous piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics","review":"Geddy Lee, lead singer for Rush has, at Alex Lifeson's (guitar) suggestion, abandoned his keyboards for their latest recording. I have listened to it about three times now, and am truely impressed. It is similar to Test for Echo, and Roll the Bones in its full, fat rock, but seems to be more sophisticated and enduring. The songs are not as accessable as anything that is getting radio play right now, but once you learn the songs, they seem to be filled with emotion. I love this CD, and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who actually listens to the words, is familiar with Rush, or just thinks that there has to be something more to rock today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight-ahead Rush!","review":"Finally, after 6 years a new Rush studio album! Rush is my favorite group so my vision is admittedly clouded, but I enjoyed this album on the first listen and I never like a new Rush album on the first listen. I've always wanted them to tone down their sound, and they've successfully accomplished that with Vapor Trails. The sound is stripped-down, no keyboards. Only bass, drum, guitar and Geddy's wailing voice! This album is hard-driving, straight-ahead infectious rock like they've never done before. The usual Rush syncopated rhythms and blazing guitar solos are absent, it's just driving rock from the best band in the world that delivers hard rock with brains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average and strange","review":"Ok, RUSH surprised us all in a strong manner. But that does not mean the album is greta. The songs do not have an identity, they are faceless and do not stick to your memory.I liked the xclusion of the keyboards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"Being a Rush fan for over twenty years, the long awaited return of the Canadian trio keep me anxiously awaiting May14th, the day Vapor Trails would finally be released. Perhaps the group should have waited a bit longer and written some better songs. This is the worst Rush recording since \\"Hold Your Fire\\". Each song melds in to one another before they become indistinguishable. The cd, although clearly not lacking for passion, does lack for content. This is clearly an instance where the parts do not equal the whole. Where are Alex Lifeson's signature guitar solos? Where are the meledoy's that syat in your head? Where are the infamous Rush licks? It always takes me two or three listens to really get into new Rush albums but I am having serious difficulties getting through even a second listen. Oh well. Let me go listen to \\"counterparts\\" See you all on tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a Remaster","review":"If we're lucky, we'll get a remaster of this CD while we're still alive to hear it. Vapor Trails contains some of Rush's best songs, but thanks to the Loudness War, they're virtually unlistenable. The sound quality of this CD is about as bad as can be imagined. Rush's record company owes fans a remaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"As a long time Rush fan, it is difficult to write this review, but if I can save you from purchasing an awful CD, so be it. The songs are overdone and the production is poor. This album has the feel of Rush trying too much to capture the attention of fans of modern day music - kind of like \\"Rush meets Creed.\\" (Nothing against Creed, I just can't believe Rush finally sold out). Many tracks sound like two or three completely different songs cobbled together with a 'jerky' uneven patchwork sound. Also, believe it or not, the lyrics sound simplistic and unimaginative. I often found myself wondering, \\"what is this song about? It's gibberish.\\" The only reason I gave this CD one star was because of one, good song buried amidst the rubble. If you're a Rush fan and must have every album, or if you don't mind spending $15 to hear overdone, lame dribble (plus the one good song: sweet miracle)then buy Vapor Trails. Otherwise, STAY AWAY from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality for a major release","review":"I gotta give this album something because the songs are so good, but the production is a disgrace. I would be embarassed if my band released an album that sounded this poor, especially if we were distributing through a major lable like Atlantic. Shame on Atlantic too, for giving this their stamp of approval."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best Rush album since Hold Your Fire","review":"I bought this album with some trepidation because the last couple of Rush albums...Counterparts was at least listenable, but Presto, Test for Echo, Roll the Bones all...Anyway, this album rocks from start to finish with fresh melodic lines, great bass playing and of course, superb lyrics and percussion. The only thing that bothered me is that there are NO solos. Not one. This is perplexing since Alex is a fabulous guitarist (put on Hemispheres or 2112). Other than that, they all sound superb. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rush Album Yet","review":"This is my second review. My first one was over 8 months ago. I just want to say that Vapor Trails has become my favorite Rush album (which by default makes it my favorite album). It would have been inconceivable to me that Rush could do better than Moving Pictures, Hemispheres or Fairwell to Kings. Hold Your Fire was the the last really great Rush album for me (although I do like all the ones that followed except maybe Presto). Vapor Trails has turned it all around again. I just hope they keep releasing albums. Anyone that can't hear the genius in this album just hasn't given it a chance. Play the full album 10 times and then decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs? Hello?","review":"Where are the songs? This album is even worse than Test For Echo. I'm not one of those Rush fans that loves the 80s synth period over the rockier late 70s stuff or vice versa. I love Hold Your Fire just as much as Roll The Bones, Moving Pictures or Signals. It seems that after Roll The Bones, Rush forgot how to write a good song and became obsessed with becoming a 'heavier' band at the expense of the songwriting. I'm sure I'm not alone here in saying that the quality of songwriting will always be what albums are judged on. When people on here talk about the production being bad then you know that something is amiss elsewhere - Grace Without Pressure sounds like it was recorded in a [...] but the songs still shine though. I really wanted to like this album, especially after all that Neil has gone though, but this is not the defiant return to form I hoped for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the need to respond","review":"Although I wrote a review a few weeks ago, I feel compelled to respond to some of the recent reviews of this...well...great cd. First, this is not 2112, 2112 was made about 25 years ago...or so. This album is far more mature, in many ways, than anything made in that time frame, by anyone. This cd is as BIG as 2112, and Moving Pictures, without being either of them, they already DID THAT. This music speaks for itself and stands on its own, very well! All the songs are strong, well crafted, and yes...HEAVY. This is a wonderful collection of songs with great melodies, rhythm and innovation that I love to hear from a great band, like RUSH. To be honest their last three studio efforts, in my opinion, came up short, so this cd was suprising to me. If you are stuck in the past...sorry...RUSH isn't...but this is a cd for true music appreciation and solid Rock'in out too!! (anything can happen!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Effort","review":"The boys have taken thier stripped-down sound to a new level with a complete lack of keyboards and guitar solos. What came out is an album pretty much on par with thier last three but with a few more surprises thrown in. There are really only two passable tunes \\"Ghost Rider\\" and \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" which are back to back tracks and easy to skip over. With those thrown out your left with a solid album. \\"Freeze\\" is the best song they've written in quite some time. Other favorites of mine are \\"Secret Touch\\", \\"One Little Victory\\", and \\"The Stars Look Down\\". Overall It's a nice departure from Test For Echo and it will be interesting to see where they go with this direction. Hopefully we won't have to wait six more years to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 5-year wait was worth it!!","review":"While Vapor Trails may not show the range that earlier Rush albums have (Test for Echo or Signals, for example), the disc has an emotional drive that we haven't seen since Moving Pictures (although T4E came pretty close). The boys from up north have stripped down the sound and created quite a charge.... It's sort of like taking off the gloves and going bare knuckles.Still, the songs are layered and have the classical Rush timbre and richness, and Niel hasn't missed a step in the lyrics department. Ghost Rider is full of beautiful harmonies, and the edge in Nocturne does a great job of genre bending...this is no Chopin, kiddies. In the past whenever I picked up the newest Rush album, I listened to nothing else for two weeks. Not going to do anything different with this one. Holy cow, it's good to have the boys back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome back rush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I've been a huge fan since I was a kid in grammar school listening to 2112. It's been a long 5 years and it has been worth the wait!!!! The main knock on Rush for the last 15-20 years is that they turned into a keyboard band, well fear not fellow rockers, there is not a keyboard to be heard on the entire album!! It takes several listenings to really appreciate the complexity of the songs, but eventually you will. Can't wait to see them tour this summer!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad turn","review":"Muddy. Drums are almost lost in the mix. Guitars are a wall of sound with no distinction. An interesting new style from Geddy, singing random notes in the background behind his vocal, attempted on almost every song. I've yet to find a memorable melody in the vocals or guitars.I've always been a truly devoted fan, but find this a big disappointment. It's almost as if it hadn't been listened to during the studio mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"a true disappointment","review":"It's a relief to read all these negative reviews about Rush's latest sorry effort. I just came from another music site that gave this stinker a positive review, and I just had to come here hoping I could find the truth. It seems our trio has really found inspiration, in the simplistic rock music that's been pumped out in the last ten years or so. This talk you see in magazines about \\"getting back to the guitar\\", losing the keyboards, and making a more \\"raw sound\\" really sounds like a lot of [junk], and it's also very unbecoming for their age and maturity. The general disappointment in the lack instrumental quality, and the excess of vocals( Lee just will not shut up from beginning to end)has already been pointed out in the other reviews.I really see a promising future for these guys, in the instumental rock/fusion-superband scene that's going on today. As far as teenage garage rock, let's hope this is the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush the other direction","review":"The only reason this CD got 2 stars is because it is rush, if it was anyone else, it would be 1 star. This album is astounding in that sounds nothing like what i have come to expect from rush. There are no odd time signatures, no guitar solos, no instrumentals, it is incredibly repetitive (i could keep going) This album seems like it was thrown together in about an hour, very disapointing, sounds like rush's attempt to be a mainstream rock band. I guess i get a little upset when bands who earn respect and a good following throw it all away assuming that they will gain more fans, but end up losing a good chunk of there fans and end up doing county fair tours for the next 20 years. I hate to throw rush in that category but they have earned that also. I wouldn't buy it again if i could go back in time. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best days clearly behind them","review":"Disappointing. I went to four Rush concerts in a row in the 80's, beginning with Signals and ending with Hold Your Fire. Their last really good effort was Power Windows. At one time they were the \\"thinking man's\\" hard rock band, and while they still are to a degree, they should hang it up. This CD has been reviewed as being the hardest they have played in some time. That is true, but that hardly makes it good. The one thing I was most disappointed with was the fact that on this CD, they repeat lines over and over again just like every other band out there.Pull out anything in your collection from Power Windows back to the beginning. Do not bother with this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush","review":"Chris Barlow's review was excellent and conveys most of my feelings about it. I had heard the Neil Peart suffered some personal loses last year with wife and daughter. I think the band's on auto-pilot right now which shows from the no-letup heavy approach from track to track. This album reminds me of a lot of musically solid albums I've heard in the past that did not have the required elements to set the songs apart from each other, and which resulted in a body of work that did not make a lasting impression. Maybe I'm getting old, but I'm not willing to give even Rush, a 5-10 uninterrupted listening in order for it to grow on me. Songs like \\"Roll the Bones\\" had alot of breaks and tempo changes, and changes to vocals. The listener needs this to keep engauged. Rush might have been looser and more experimental 10-12 years ago. Here there's no keyboards, Aimee Mann, or quirkiness to make it an enjoyable listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"Never in my life did I think I would have to repeat a 2-star-rating for Rush, the other dismal effort being \\"Counterparts.\\" What a mess. I have listened to this less often than any of their albums, and I never listen to \\"Counterparts\\" anymore. What a sad effort. It is time for these guys to set their egos aside and seek out a new producer. Or, dare I say it about my all-time favorite band, just go away. Listening to these guys fade into late middle-age is depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful CD. Just awful.","review":"I used to be a serious Rush fan, and that loyalty enticed me to buy this CD the day it was released. I popped it in the car on the way back to work. By the time I parked the car, I was done with this CD -- forever.Like the last three or four Rush albums, Vapor Trail was produced by a band trying to recapture the spark it had 15 years ago. Unfortunately, Rush is now survivng merely on its own vapors.Uninspired, tedious and just plain uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"just letting off steam ....I guess","review":"This is the album that after a long love affair, made me come to terms with my relationship ..............yep honey, I just have to move on!!!

Much better than their synth-plagued previous records, which sounded flat and emotionless and punchless.VAPOR TRAILS will hit you in the stomach. It's a totally new Rush, without any keyboards at all, with a more \\"acommodated\\" NEil Peart, with a dirt guitar sound (ALex tried too hard to sounds \\"modern\\" - the only great flaw of the album).I never liked Peart's lyrics, but here they are worse than ever, unfortunately... But Geddy sings them well and hard, with a changed voice.Thanks, the keyboards are gone! Welcome back RUSH!!But I think this is their last ablum... I don't know, it's just a guess..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooked for being a fan","review":"Unfortunately after \\"Presto\\" , I have always had the feeling of wasting my money after listening to every new release, and this CD confirms it.Come on, guys, you know that each and every fan you have will buy all your records withouth ever thinking. Why not stuffing some music into them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"When will this band just die? NEVER!","review":"Im going to try my best to be objective here. This is not the best Rush album ever made, but it is one of the best in the last 15 years. As most of us are, I am an avid Rush fan, and I own every single CD ever made by these guys. As a die hard, it is hard to rate any of their CD's as poor. Test for echo was about as close to poor as I could rate an album. Vapor Trails redeemed Rush in my eyes. This album rocks, but it does seem a bit jumbled and over produced at times. However, I think \\"ghost rider\\" is one of the best rush songs ever made. If you are just getting into Rush, or if you are a die hard, this album will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Bananas instead!","review":"I just bought Vapor Trails along with Deep Purple's latest album, Bananas (import) and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience.Two of my favorite bands seem to be going in different directions and I\`m not talking about musical directions. I can't believe how awful Vapor Trails is, the sound quality is just plain bad, the playing lacks spark and the songs simply aren't good or memorable.The arrangements feel forced and Rush just don't sound like they are having FUN!I'm struggling just getting though the CD.On the other hand, Bananas is everything Vapor Trails isn't. Great songs, fantastic performances, terrific sound quality, Deep Purple sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the flow of the album is just outstanding.It's safe to say this is not Rush\`s finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple\`s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellooooooo....bass.....","review":"Lol, ok, I'm an aspiring bass player and for those of you RUSH fans that found tabbing Geddy's lines were hard before, some of the ones here are a beast too. The most notable thing that no one else has really mentioned is that it's apparent this album is the first one to come out after Geddy Lee's solo project. Why you ask? Because the bass lines are much more prominent in this one than in many other albums in the past. Just listen to the samples and you'll see what I mean. Neil Peart is amazing as ever and the sounds produced from this trio are different, but evolved, not necessarily \\"bad.\\" Once listeners of old and new RUSH alike come to terms with that, then they will really enjoy this album. I found it of greater value than \\"Counterparts\\" AND \\"Roll The Bones.\\" (But I think that's just the bass player in me talking) :) Bon appetit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unbelievable RUSH","review":"As a Rush fan, let me say this album is stellar. Seldom do we find an album with great material from the beginning to end. This album even gets better as it goes along. The last several tracks are so relentless, you might not be able to take it all in. One track in particular, Freeze, is such an incredible jam with so many layers of harmonic dissonance, it will take several listens before it comes together in your mind. Once that happens, this will be one of your favorites off the album. Other tracks that deserve mention are Peaceable Kingdom, Ceiling Unlimited, Vapor Trail, Earthshine, and Nocturne. But the entire album is truly a work of art. Hard rock has never been so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, disconnected, disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of Rush, but I was really disappointed in this album. The album in general, but especially the vocals, are tedious and uninspiring. This album lacks many of the qualities that earned this trio their well-deserved status as a masterful force in rock and roll. While they have learned to incorporate some new styles into their compositions, they lack the art of past works. The different instruments seem disconnected, not tightly and masterful integrated as they once were. There were a few interesting phrases, but no good solid tracks.If you're new to Rush and you'd like a great set of songs from the height of their career (in my opinion), buy \\"Exit, Stage Left\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"another chance at victory...","review":"Simply put - this is the best Rush album ever. I didn't believe that until I listen to the entire album about 2 dozen times. Now, I can't stop listening to it. Lyrically and musically it's amazing - the constructs of each song are smartly put together and are built for repeated listening. Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one in years","review":"Bottom line: If something happened to my copy I would gladly pay full price for a replacement.It's a great CD. You can hear a renewed vigor in the writing and playing, that they had fun doing it. The sound is heavier, almost \\"Tool-like\\" at times.There are no synthesizers or guitar solos, but the music is layered so well that I didn't even notice this until it was pointed out to me. Many have said the production is poor, and others say it sounds fine. It sounds great on my stereo, so maybe it's just the system it's played on.I've thought their last few albums have been pretty bad, especially Test for Echo. Vapor Trails is a welcome return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush - Vapor Trails","review":"I have been an avid fan of Rush for a good few years now, owning everything they have produced in one format or another. But what can I say, yet again they have produced another testament of their sheer prog-rock magnificence.Although they are looking a bit 'past the sell by date,' these old boys still kick it! Their individual input is still very noticeable, although these days what they leave out is definitely more important. They have returned to their former glory of just 'strings and skins' (and obviously, Mr Lee's natural 'falsetto' vocals) but more to the point, no synths or programming.Basically, if you know what's good for you, you will buy this!!!PS Have you tried Alex Lifeson's \\"Victor\\" & Geddy Lee's \\"My Favourite Headache?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Back To It's Roots Rush!","review":"Wow, what a different Rush sound. I was looking forward to more of the same, but RUSH has dramatically changed it's sound, even though the RUSH sound is still ever present within it's songs, they have gone to a much simpler and more raw sound. It reminds me more of 2112 than anything newer. The title track \\"One Little Victory\\", has hints of \\"Red Barchetta\\" in it. Niel Pert's drumming is frantic. It is a fresh change for RUSH. I still need to get used to it, but I believe that it will be a new driving favorite of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peart bears his soul","review":"Rush should have never released this album. Drummer Neal Peart lost both his daughter and lover within a year of each other. The devastated Peart went on a long motorcycle tour to find out what was left inside of himself. He gave no thought to working with his Canadian band mates. Eventually, he healed enough to start doing what he did best: make music. Vapor Trails is the result. It's muscular. Its heaviness harkens back to Rush's 2112. Peart goes all out with intricate drum work that sounds almost impossible for a man to perform. Geddy Lee sings Peart's lyrics with his unforgettable voice that doesn't try to do too much. Alex Lifeson throws out plenty of thick chords from his guitar, but he needed to do more solos. (Where have guitar solos gone in rock music?) Knowing Peart's story opens a window into the lyrics on the album. \\"Ghost Rider\\" is Peart's journey around North America trying to heal his soul. \\"Secret Touch\\" is Peart dealing with his loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's fast and heavy","review":"This album is a departure from the last four. But as a fan of the second batch of four (the AFIK-MP era), I may always be disappointed with 5min songs that don't have mythological lyrics. The album sounds cool though. Not quite grunge, but it has a heavy crunchy fast sound. Unfortunately, Geddy's voice doesn't quite fit with it; this might be due to the light lyric content. I hope they continue with this sound/style for future albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative and interesting..............","review":"But with excessive layering and over-production and mixing there is just a lot of noise from some of the best musicians around. There are some good sounds and mixes but the sound usually gets so thick that the interest fades. I can't see myself going down the road and hitting replay. I would like to see them go back to one guitar, one bass and the drums/percussion again and even some synthesizers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here - Here! on the lousy mastering complaints","review":"Poor mastering sums it up! Not a trade mark example of the Rush sound quality we have all come to know and love. CD companies need to be paying way more attention to sound quality details - especially considering what they expect us to pay for the final product. Furthermore, Rush themselves should be paying more attention and frankly I am surprised they let this one out the bag in the over modulated state that polutes all the exciting tracks. Digital technology isn't what's it cracked up to be folks. Don't let the CD companies get away with this BS - contact them and demand quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"How NOT to produce a record","review":"This has got to be the worst major label production I've heard in years. The production is not merely a distraction. It comes close to making this CD completely unlistenable.Some bright engineer decided to completely hard line limit and compress this recording. If you pop it in after any other RUSH release, particularly some of the old classic stuff, you will notice right away that it is MUCH LOUDER. Unfortunately, it's the sonic equivalent of READING ALL CAPS. It grows tiresome very quickly. I simply can't overlook this.Also, while the lyrics are nice and perhaps even a touch above the last couple releases, Rush appears to be adrift musically. Yes, I get the no guitar solos and straight ahead thing they're trying to do. I just find myself less interested in it. Rush is no longer that special of a band if this is what they have in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"sonic jumble","review":"TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY!!!!!!!! worst production values of any recording in the last 30 years. I thought that I might of had a faulty CD until I read other reviews. a RUSH album that I have to cut down all the bass??? my car stereo has DSP, and the only way to hear anything is to set it on Jazz Club. after 1 week of trying to give it a chance I have given up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at Best","review":"This album contains some of the worst mixing I've ever heard. The guitars are so muddled I can't even pick out individual chords. Most of the songs are grating and lack any real hooks. With any Rush album, you have to listen to it all the way through at least three times to get a full appreciation of the music, lyrics, and rhythm. I listened to this one five times and still didn't like it.I expected more from these guys after masterpieces like 2112, Grace Under Pressure, and Roll The Bones. Seems like they've finally run out of new directions to explore.Don't buy this album if you are a Rush fan familiar with all their work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this album, pure and simple !!","review":"If you think Rush has lost anything over the years, think again! This CD will stand as a classic along with the likes of Moving Pictures and Signals.The band's approach was unique. No Keyboards, only Alex's layered guitars and Geddy's phenomenally layered vocals. Neil's lyrics are from the heart and speaks to anyone who is listening. Check out the outstanding tracks like Earthshine, Secret Touch, How It Is and, the opener, One Little Victory. The only thing that scares me is, can the band outdo this masterpiece? Time will tell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay....","review":"I can't put my finger on it... it rocks hard, has songs with challenging arrangements...but, I just can't get into this CD....and I'm a HUGE Rush fan. This CD will probably never move from beyond my bottom 5. Along with the terrible noise, crackles and pops, the whole project just seems kinda sloppily put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt, one of Rush's best","review":"Vapor Trails ranks among Rush's top 3 albums of all time. If you don't like VT, you don't like Rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome back!","review":"After an extended hiatus due to unfortunate circumstances, Rush is back with their seventeenth studio album. I've listened to it a few times already and I like it, although it takes time getting used to, to say the least. the absence of keyboards and guitar solos is radical in one way, but they have been heading towards it for more than ten years. Neil's drumming is excellent as usual, lots of stuff happening. I can see this album growing on me more and more. Can't wait to see them at the Tweeter Center July 12th :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boys Still Rock","review":"Out of the last three studio albums, Vapor Trails rocks harder than any of them. I bought the album on the release date and listened to it 4 times that night. Can't wait for the tour. See you guys on Septmber 17, 2002 in Concord, California."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Keyboards = Geddy's Voice","review":"I was quite amazed with this release. The vocals on Sweet Miracle, when Geddy is crying \\"Oh salvation\\", are simply astounding. Suspending the use of keyboards was the best thing they could have done. It's been a long time since we have been treated to Geddy's unique voice. Incredibly satisfying release. There's real sould in this music. The engineering is pure and the sound is big."},{"rating":"2","title":"I COMMEND THESE TALENTED MUSICIANS!","review":"I FOR ONE AM HAPPY FOR THIS BAND AND PLEASED WITH THERE WORK.THEY NEVER SEASE TO AMAZE ME.SOME PEOPLE PROBABLY SAY RUSH COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER ALBUM WELL I THINK FROM A MUSICIAN STAND POINT YOUR PROBABLY RIGHT BUT AFTER WHAT NEIL PEART WENT THROUGH TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED WAS PROBABLY A HARD TASK!BUT THERE TRUE QUALITIES STILL SHINED THROUGH IN MY BOOK.AND I STILL THINK THEY KEEP IT INTERESTING.I HOPE THEY CONTINUE TO GRACE US WITH THERE MUSICAL GENIUS AND INSPIRING TUNES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot","review":"OK, I know what they are trying to do here. They wanted to \\"update\\" their sound and they did. Now they have [bad] sound production like the rest of the NEW bands, no guitar solos, and no keyboards. BLAH!I love RUSH and I'm one of their biggest fans, but really, this album is NOT SO HOT. I have listened to it many times and grows on ya a little, but the sound is so muddy and Lees voice so tinny, that you cannot help tiring of it quickly.Rush needs to get back to the days of Counterparts, Roll The Bones, Presto, but with better sound production on albums like Hemispheres, and Moving Pictures.Cmon' guys, the true fans are NOT 16 year olds that think that mp3 is \\"CD Quality\\". We are older and wiser than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRODUCTION AWFUL","review":"Who mixed this? I have not heard such a poorly produced CD since U2's \\"Pop\\". And it is a shame because \\"Vapor Trails\\" is a decent disc in terms of musicianship. Well played by the canadian trio.But the muddled sound and even distorted Alex Liefson jams really make a good CD VERY disappointing.Note to Rush: Listen to the final tapes before you release them to the record label for mass production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapor Trails","review":"I hate to say it but this CD blows. I am a long time RUSH fan and I love their music. But this recording seems contrived and put together. I really think they would have been better off not releaseing it.I tried to sell it to my local used CD store and they said they had too many. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"This music provided me the most life affirming RUSH of any music I have ever listened to. Emotions are breed from reality and each song is a stark example if this. Each song has it's own distinct lesson, learning of which can only be achieved through repeated listening, and study of the underlying philosophy. If only more listeners could get to this stage of life. Thanks Neil, Geddy and Alex for giving me the tools to get to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Pictures II?","review":"Vapor Trails sounds nothing like Moving Pictures, but after multiple listenings I find that it evokes the same kind of feelings that Moving Pictures did nearly 22 years ago. Then, as a teenager, Lee and Lifeson's musical virtuosity behind Peart's intelligent lyrics captivated me. On Vapor Trails, the combination of lyrical poetry and musical punch recreate the magic. I like Vapor Trails more and more every time I listen to it. It is by far their best work since Moving Pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back And Better Than Ever!","review":"Amazing disk! Hardest sounding albumb from Rush Ive heared in quite a while. Completely well done. Not as much Synth. Ripping guitar rifs and awsome bass and ofcourse Neil on the drums.

The only track with some merit is 8. The formula for this album is: mushy mix + shaky, unmelodic vocals + harmonies that always clash + lyrics that seem to have been written in a weak poem format before the song was composed. The result is the usual RUSH of late, uninteresting and unmemorable. By the way, RUSH, you don't need 13 tracks to show that you can't compose anymore. I tried to like this album, but could not.Former Fan,Jon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"If I had never heard of Rush prior to listening to this album, I'd say they weren't very good songwriters. Since I have heard of Rush, I know that they are capable of much better work than this. Compared to the whole continuum of other albums out there, this is a 1 or zero-star. Compared to other Rush albums, it barely rates 2 stars.

I can't believe how AWFUL Vapor Trails is, the sound quality is just plain bad, the arrangements feel forced and the songs simply aren't good, let alone memorable. The lyrics are good, but that doesn't matter when the rest of it just sits there. I'm struggling just getting through this thing.On the other hand, Rapture of the Deep is everything Vapor Trails isn't.

I have been waiting with much anticipation for this new CD to arrive and I am sorry to say I am disappointed. I kept forwarding to each new track searching for that \\"old Rush hard rock sound\\" that early reviews promised, but never found it. Just mediocre pop rock tunes with similar melodies and beats. In the past, as Rush as changed it's music I have come to appreciate at least some of the tracks on each of it's latest albums, but I don't think that will happen with this album. My advice to Rush: Do an \\"All the World's a Stage Reunion Tour\\" and watch your venues sell out. It'll never happen but what a thought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Kicks ASS!!","review":"Now this is music. 30 years and rocking strong.

No...Just some very negative people unwilling to admit that Rush has changed, and for the better. Every album they put out sounds DIFFERENT! You should all know that by now! Listen to \\"Ghost Rider\\" and you will see that the entire song could be a guitar solo, but it's backed up by such beautiful music, its pure bliss. And so are many of the other songs on Vapor Trails.In my oppinion, the best songs are :-Ghost Rider-Earthshine-Vapor Trail-Secret Touch-Sweet MiracleAnd ALL of the others are well above adequateIf you are willing to accept the fact that Rush has changed since 2112, and Signals, then please explore Vapor Trails, it's a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen...","review":"Vapor Trails is a mess, bad sound quality, not a memorable song in the bunch. I was horrified at how bad this disc is, at first I thought something had gone wrong with my stereo system. This is one of those 'all levels peaked at once' recordings which translates into a wall of noise with very little soundstage. The high-end/clarity is missing. It's sounds like it was recorded in a garage. Neil Pert's drumming is lazy and lackluster and sounds as though it was his cheapest drum kit, again no soundstage. Geddy Lee's vocals are buried in the mix, not that it matters with a [bad] performance as this one. Alex Lifeson's raw and U2 sounding grungy guitarwork is painful to listen to. Vapor Trails reminds me of another sorry release of theirs: 'Presto', I hated that one right off. I don't what has happened to Rush, I thoroughly enjoy their earlier work in their Polygram days but this is a sad outing for what was once a very talented band...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for after 5 years","review":"In my opinion, every album Rush put out after Power Windows, gets a little worse each time. Now, it's 2002 and this CD is terrible. Although, it does have a few songs that I can get into, most of the CD is not that great. The songs just dont have any groove to it.

My chain of thought was constantly interrupted trying to translate the French. It is arrogant on his part and condescending to expect the average reader to understand French in order to read his book. The practice of using French was very prevalent in fiction before 1960 and always irritated me when I was younger. It still irritates me.

I would never spend money on a game like this. As hard as I tried i couldn't get into the storyline. The storyline is pretty weak anyway, Alaron gets hit with a poison arrow and it can't be cured, pretty stupid, huh. It takes forever to get from one city to another. I like RPGs like Final Fantasy where yoiu don't walk around in battles in Aidyn Chronicles yoiu walk around and aim at the enemies.

The characters' conversations seem to go on FOREVER, and there's no way to break away from someone talking to you and move on. The \\"battle mode\\" is also something that I found to be distracting and frustrating; however, if you're a big fan of the old-style RPGs that use this feature, you'll probably like this game. On the other hand, if you want fast-paced action or thrilling gameplay, I'd stick to another title. The graphics and story line are the best parts of the game.

Every aspect of your stats can be raised, and there are dozens of unique skills and spells. The Enormous world is realistic and larger then any other game before it. You can explore virtually everywhere in the game, and although the battles are turn based, it still involves action, unlike many RPGs(final fantasy). Over a dozen characters allows much depth to gameplay, and tons of cutscenes change depending on which characters are in your group. The hundreds of hours of gameplay that I spent on Aidyn on my first two tries did not stop me from wanting to play a third , fourth, and fifth time. This game can be played a hundred times over and never be exactly the same. All RPGs of today should model themselves after Aidyn Chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best RPGs","review":"This game is one of the best games for n64- by far.So what if its extreamly hard(I've had it for two years now, not even close)?The gameplay is great!You run around and talk to people like normal games, but when you run into an enemy, you go in to a complety different mode.Based on you states,some of you four charecters can move or attack.You have a certain space to move in to attack enemys.The storyline is complacated, the game play never gets old or repetative,over all, this is a great game.I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop locking","review":"I used them on a display case.

I've heard others compare her work on this album to that of Pearl Bailey. Her voice is so rich, and, singing the blues, you can hear both amusement and pain in her tones. In fact, her recording of \\"Lush Life\\" is so accomplished that you do a double-take, thinking this cannot be the \\"U.N.I.T.Y.\\" rapper. But it is.The rest of the album, alas, is less thrilling. Danny DeVito's a good enough vocalist, but he just sounds like someone who could wow people at a karaoke bar, little more than that.The other tunes, minus the Fenton score tracks that are heavy on piano and light on mood, are jazz and pop standards you could find on any number of albums.But Latifah, singing her heart out and winning over new fans, triumphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is A*M*A*Z*I*N*G","review":"This is a great movie and the soundtrack is equally amazing.

For lovers of Word Jazz, for music lovers of all kinds, it is impossible to listen to this and not get all warm and fuzzy inside and goosebumps on the outside. Queen Latifah, throw out your rap shoes, honey, you were meant to sing these songs, the delicious creations of the greats. Lush Life is wonderful, Clark Anderson's Give Me Something Real - well, I'm at a loss for words. The silver throat of Mel Torme, Etta James' unforgettable At Last, I simply love this soundtrack,with its fun cherry on top snappy Danny deVito rendition of They Can't That Away From Me. Just when I thought the music couldn't be more perfect for every moment, it finished with Sly and The Family Stone's Hot Fun In The the Summertime, which sent me out of the theatre smiling and \\"coo-coo-coo-coo when I want to.\\" Get this one.

The first was that the girls wanted the puppies to know their names; when we tried to program them, one of my daughters' names was on the list that the puppy has preprogrammed to learn, my other daughter's name was not. It was such a bummer to tell her that her puppy will never \\"know\\" her name. Then, on top of that, the batteries in her puppy were low when the dog arrived so her dog never grew! It took me a while to figure out that that was the problem b/c the dog sang and moved its head and wagged its tail; it just never grew!

It doesn't sing, as professional reviews have stated it would. Nor does it have any phrases other than \\"Hi (child's name) I'm so happy to see you.\\"I thought it should at least wag it's tail or move it's head a little in response to petting, grooming and playing with it (would have been a cute feature if it had).

Apparently, earlier versions knew about the child's friends, places, and other cool stuff. The new CD only allowed you to choose a name from a pre-determined list for both the puppy and child. There were no other options. The fisher price website was useless to find out why we couldn't access anything else. The first day my daughter played with it for about 5 minutes as it did very little.

Upon receipt, we realized parts of the chair said MADE IN CHINA. We then realized the box also said made in China. This was an attempt to not purchase cheaply made Chinese products, as they invariably are made incorrectly or not designed properly to begin with. Case in point, the bolt holes do not align with the mounting brackets underneath the chair. This is the second desk chair we've bought this year, as our previous chair was also designed incorrectly. The reason we spent $140 on an office chair is so that we'll not have to buy one for several years. It makes absolutely no sense to purchase 10 chairs in 5 years at $80-$150 each when we could purchase a single office chair for that much which lasts a decade.Long story short, seller advertised MADE IN USA and sent cheap Chinese trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS TOY IS GREAT!!!","review":"I bought this for my sister for her third birthday and she loved it!!!

It is (in my opinion) worse than the worst episode. The writers tried to introduce the entire series in a movie length of time; it was disjointed and not funny.

I bought it on Friday night and had it finished by Sunday. This book would be enjoyed by anyone, not just the avid boxing fan.This is the story of Teddy Atlas, it begins with his childhood, works its way through his days with Cus D'Amato and Mike Tyson, Michael Moorer, and ends at ESPN. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, I only wish it were longer (its approx 300 pages). The writer did a fantastic job of really capturing the thoughts and emotions of Atlas.Buy this book, you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed big time","review":"I like Teddy Atlas. I like to listen to him analyze a fight. I like that he held a gun to Mike Tyson's head and later walked away from him even though he knew that nutjob could make him millions. I like the whole idea of Teddy Atlas. I didn't like the book though.If I had to read one more story about Teddy beating the b'jesus out of a guy, or better yet, out of a group of guys, I think I would have lost my lunch right into the book. His hands must be sore to this day from all the beatdowns he administered. Take it easy there Francis. Where do you bury your dead? If you were that tough you wouldn't have brought the gun along when you went to see Tyson.He doesn't come across that way on television, so I was very surprised, but to me the tone of the book was such that as I was reading I was afraid he was gonna come through the pages and catch me with a right cross if my mind wandered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and self-centered","review":"I am big boxing fan, so I had to read this--unfortunatley. Atlas tells his stories in an \\"I'm right, everyone else is wrong\\" tone. The book is a tough read, it has no momentum. Some of Atlas' stories are contridictory to ones he has told in previous interviews. Also, every fight he has is against \\"A giant\\" or \\"A guy over 6'2\\"..\\" Teddy is always right, everyone else is wrong, and he comes off like a guy trying to sell himself as Mr. Morality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teddy Atlas","review":"I just finished reading this book last night.

It's really fascinating to listen to this Album again, it's all great original dance tracks from another world. \\"Future Shock\\" is a little more funky but sound like a typical soul song, it's a good remake though. \\"Earth Beat\\" sound a little like \\"Rockit\\" with many drums and beats. \\"TFS is one of my favorites, a catchy dance track with nice melody.

Nope. I found it very distasteful and my son thought it boring. He would not even let me finish reading it to him (even with sound effects - I really tried!) I understand the premise is that the dog farts, but an entire book about the dog farting at all times, in all places, etc.! With illustrated fart gas clouds around the page! The picture of the veterinarian inspecting the dog's rear-end with a fart cloud escaping in his face was just poor taste, not funny, nor was the fart which propelled the dog across the room.

Now, we're told we should make poopie jokes with our kids and laugh right along. \\"But kids laugh at this stuff anyway, so what's the harm? Don't be such a stick in the mud!\\" Funny, parenting used to be all about demanding more than gutter behavior from children and teaching them how to have manners, regardless of what they snickered about with their friends.

In my opinion, the only appealing visual in Walter is Walter himself. The people are freakishly rendered and a visual detraction from the story. Any book that makes children happy is okay by me and Dav Pilkey has created many books that children of all ages enjoy and seems to be doing pretty well on his own.That said I think it is a shame that his book is overlooked for this inferior version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Fartiste Instead","review":"Ugh.

However, they do like offensive books to have some merit besides offensiveness.)I wasn't nearly as disgusted with the content of the book as with it's blatant rip-off of Dogbreath by Dav Pilkey.

I noticed other reviewers made this observaton too.Also, I'm okay with the occasional potty-humor, but this book is a little over-the-top. The word, \\"fart\\" is mentioned so frequently it got tiresome to read. Before you make the purchase, might I suggest, if you're buying this book for children who can't read yet, you might want to THINK how you feel about reading \\"FART\\" OUT LOUD over and over again at story-time.If you're OK with that, and you've never read \\"Dog Breath\\" this might be one to add to you're collection.

The fart jokes are not the problem. I just don't like the way that the burglars are portrayed as white males. As a white male, I find this offensive. If you're going to have burglars, make them race and gender neutral. I don't think it's appropriate for children to grow up believing that only white men are burglars or commit crimes. The authors could easily have had them in black masks or ski masks, or something. I'm sure that if the burglars were black males but the vet was a white male, there would be major complaints.

My 4yo is now worried about \\"mean guys\\" (they look really evil in the illustration!) breaking into our house at night.I also think the book's premise (farting, farting, farting) is low class. No need to encourage the farting talk. I can see it now, I'm in for 3 months of farting talk now that my 4yo read this book. The illustrations are also UGLY...the faces are scary looking and are magazine cutouts. Not cute at all.

They change his food and everything, but the poor dog just can't help it. Just as the father is about to give them the final ultimatum, Walter saves the family home from robbers, and the dad realizes that he really is a good dog, smell and all!

It is a reminder of the risks that abound in today's markets, and of the compelling importance of the great values that have led to the strength of the nation's financial system. In the book's most important chapter (16), Dr. Kaufman presents 17 neglected lessons for policymakers, financial institutions, and investors. If we ignore them, the well-catalogued sins of our financial past will return to haunt us. Consider Lesson 4: \\"..basic fiduciary duty too often has been forgotten in the high-voltage, high velocity financial environment of recent decades . . . the notion of financial trusteeship has been lost in the shuffle.\\" He's right, and readers will profit immensely by taking heed, not only of those words, but the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Money and Markets","review":"Henry Kaufman has written an excellent book that should be read, underlined, and referred to frequently by all persons who make decisions and manage their own pensions and other financial assets.

I expected a little more insight and less hair-splitting (e.g. at one point he takes the time to explain the difference between liquidity and marketability.)

'Take Me Away' and 'Shooting Shark' both enjoyed some airplay, but faded quickly. Too often, people mistakenly criticize the style variation on this album for lack of focus. Each song is well thought out and well produced. The only fault that could be found is in the trite lyrics. If you are looking for lyrical epiphanies, this ain't your album.

Even the drums which are vastly different from what B.O.C. fans are familiar with work in the same way as the bass does. Overall I think it is a great musical experience.

A close listen will certainly reward. Its always a good idea to look at our culture through the watchful eye of the poet. Of course Dylan and Springstein have revealed much, but Jeff Smith takes a look at that wilderness often overlooked - the middle size American town where their creative people are treated like freaks at worst, and polyannas at best. In towns like these the underlying inferiority complex of its people can crush a budding local artist with an attitude like \\" ...can't be much good if they're from around here\\".

If water gets in then the sound stops and your done, you can get them set up well enough on land so water stays out but when you start swiming things like turning your head to breath or doing a turn will shift them and water will get in and your done. Also, there is NO BASS at ALL. For some reason the headphones don't have them. Good idea but in practice they fail. these aren't even good enough for just sitting in a hot tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy only if you have VERY LOW expectations","review":"I was excited about this product, but it has been a complete flop. the first set fizzed when minor strain on the headphones broke the contacts with the case. The customer service rep was very good about getting a replacement, however. The second pair, despite tinkering, cutting, adding ear plugs to headphones, never could give me a reliable sound for more than a lap. I appreciate their effort on this VIP problem, but don't settle for this attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"very poor sound quality, very uncomfortable, and the cord isnt long enough. just buy a cheap pair of ear buds unless youre swimming in the things."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy and easily broken","review":"After using this product for five days in the pool (five hours of use) it no longer works. It appears that the jack is very flimsy, and that ANY stress on the cord attaching the headphones to the jack (such as wearing the headphones!) will immediately dislodge the wire from the jack and rending the headphones useless.It's a shame- I was SO excited to find a set of headphones that stayed put while I swam laps, and was comfortable. But the fact they died so quickly (I normally get at least a month out of the cheapy ones) just irritates me. I'd wait a while for the company to perfect these, because clearly the first ones produced have some major issues.I don't understand why someone can't invent a sturdy, comfortable pair of waterproof headphones. They don't have to be high fidelity or anything, just as long as they don't short out all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the Aquapac instead!","review":"I was excited to listen to music while swimming, so I bought and Otter box, and H2O Swimbelt and the H2O headphones. The system worked except for the horrible headphones, they could not keep water out, I tried it every way I could. Got some audio in one ear for two swim laps,...very frustrating (and expensive). Very reluctantly I tried another set of headphones (just this week): the Aquapac Waterproof Headphones. they worked 100%. I cannot say how long these will hold up, but I know they work now. The H2O Audio phones never worked (and were very uncomfortable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound, uncomfortable, break easily","review":"I was excited about having waterproof headphones but these are very cheaply made and already there's a bad connection in the cable. They're also hard to get lined up properly in your ear canal and don't block out the water. This means the sound has different intensities as water goes in and out of your ears.I would steer clear of these phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but might take some practice","review":"I've used these headphones twice now. They work as advertised; they are waterproof and it's great to be able to listen to music while swimming in the pool. The cord is shorter than the cord on the standard white iPod earphones, but it seems like it would be long enough to reach an armband or a belt around your waist. I am a woman so I just tuck the iPod into my bathing suit and so I have no problems with cord length.My only complaint is that it's hard to insert the earphones into your ear at the correct angle so it will both block out water and also channel the music properly. So I have to swim a lap, adjust the earphones, swim another lap, adjust the earphones again, swim another lap, adjust, etc. for about 10 minutes before I find the right angle. Hopefully this will get easier with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"These headphones are useless and waterproof","review":"These headphones are inaudible under water.They are also uncomfortable to wear.You can not hear the music under water.Not recommending these."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"Fast paced action but with a lot of character depth and development.

The acting, the suspense, the overall eeriness was here and a lot of that was missing from the original movie.Even though this movie is more eerie than its predecessor, it still isn't a scary movie. Agreed, some parts are chilling, but nothing to really make you jump out of your seat. But I must praise the movie anyway, it was awesome. Tomie's evil side really does start to come out in this movie. All I can say is that every thing is better in this movie, almost no confusion haunts this movie, this movie can almost be seen without watching the first one, and it's a very stand alone movie.Very excellent special effects. The opening scene is quite memorable. The acting was excellent as well. Watch it! Get it!

Wowie! I have the whole Tomie Collection, and Replay was one of the most rememorable one. And personally, my 2nd favorite out of the 3! Yeah, It was that good. You don't even really have to see the first Tomie to understand this one. You don't have to do it! And that's great! You still understand what's going on. Basically, the movie is about a little girl of 6 years old has \\"Tomie\\" head in her tummy somehow, which is strange and never is explained why. And then, the people at the hospital who operated on the little girl end up dying one by one. You can probably read what the story's about.

It's got the action and camp you want and expect from a JS story--and it lacks the sugar and spice you don't want from a Hollywood piece--but it's missing something viewers quite often take for granted: production values. Its cheesiness shows. Heck, that may even make it a better flick.Anyway, who wouldn't want to see Dyan Cannon having a cat fight with a couple of queens? Or the robotic but handsome John Phillip Law belt an Amazon (as in tall) hooker unconscious? This and all the while poking fun at the television industry.The movie didn't leverage the \\"you're a Don Juan because you're really gay\\" theme that the book did, and the movie suffered from it.

But for the most part, the band just didn't deliver an album that could stand up to the body of his previous albums.

'Holyana' is better by Paich again, but not enough to rescue a boring album that has none of the trademark melodies and ballads that Toto are best known for."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best!","review":"Sorry, but reviewer Mike couldn't be more wrong. I've been a fan of Toto's since the beginning and Isolation is probably their best album. It starts strong with Carmen and continues with Lion's strong guitar and Fergie Frederiksen's vocals. The title track is another great song, as is Angel Don't Cry. Endless is one of the best songs Toto has ever done. Period. Stranger In Town is a very freightening song if you study the lyrics and figure out who they're singing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best!","review":"This is one of their best works, IMO! Fergie has always been one of my favorite vocalists ever since he sang with LeRoux. Best cuts are Carmen, Stranger in Town, Isolation, and Mr. Friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from Toto IV, but in a way better","review":"Over Toto's first four albums the band seemed to be struggling to fuse Luke's guitar chops and rock roots with that Paich/Porcaro weird keyboard magic. They got it just right with \\"Rosanna\\" on Toto IV, and they got it just right on \\"Carmen\\", \\"Lion\\" and \\"Isolation\\" on this disc. Fergie really shines in all three songs and I can't imagine Kimball singing any of them as well. Kimball has a voice made for the R&B songs that were wholly absent from this album. If this album is missing anything, it is the R&B elements found in songs like \\"Waiting For Your Love\\", \\"Mama\\" and \\"You Are the Flower\\" from earlier albums. On this album Toto almost (but not quite) sounds like just one band.I agree with the other reviewers about the energy present throughout this release. There is only one ballad (\\"How Does It Feel\\"). The rest of the disc kicks, even the odd tunes like \\"Mr. Friendly\\", thanks to Jeff Porcaro's strong drumming."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate 80's style!","review":"This album was released two years after Toto IV, and in my opinion continues the great style and songwriting of their peak album.Allthough Bobby Kimball (Toto 1-4 and Mindfields-present) is one of my all time favourite singers, Fergie Fredricksen does a good job as well. His style is a little more Heavy Metal-inspired, whereas Kimball originally is a soul singer. In a way this is the real peak of Toto, and I think it's often overlooked by fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"180 degrees...","review":"Released: Nov 1984 Produced by: Toto(Were 1/2 stars available, would rate a 2-1/2.) Jarring style reversal following departure of Bobby Kimball, featuring sterile note-hitting yeller Fergie Frederiksen. Frederiksen lacks Kimball's soul, feel, & balls, yet somehow musician's ever-resourceful grasp on whatever style they choose rescues album from possible disaster. Steve Porcaro's classical keyboard vignettes seamlessly team with Steve Lukather's more up-front rock riffs, and Jeff Porcaro gets a workout, but rocking set feels emotion-free. David Paich sings lead on a mere 2-1/2 songs out of 10--most he would on any subsequent album (weak single \\"Stranger In Town\\" and silly Holyanna\\"). Standouts: Journey-esque title track, Kimball co-written \\"Lion,\\" neo-classical pop metal \\"Change Of Heart.\\" Original bassist Mike Porcaro's recorded debut with band. Most fans had no idea what to make of this. Aficionados only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album.","review":"\\"Windows And Walls\\" #15 (1984)This the follow up to Dan's huge selling \\"The Innocent Age\\", in 1981. This album would go gold, but it just seemed people were buying more teenage product in '84. This album is another winner with great tracks like, the mid-tempo rockers, \\"The Language Of Love\\" #13 hot 100, \\"Let Her Go\\", \\"The Loving Cup\\", great story telling songs in \\"the title track, and one of Dan's best in \\"Tucson, Arizona (Gazette)\\", the ballad \\"Believe In Me\\" #48 hot 100 and the rocking \\"Gone Too Far\\". Dan passed away in 2007 at age 56."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse yet bound by epic tales and poignant themes!","review":"Another brilliant stroke from a master of instruments and verse. \\"Tuscon\\" is an epic tale in the music world, set to music and worthy of a place with American Pie, Bohemian Rhapsody, and Paradise By The Dashboard Light. Language of Love is a song for all men and women to embrace; Windows and Walls a truly poignant tale of our aging loved ones. My favorite, Believe in Me. Wonderful lyrics and music from a deeply missed genious and soul of the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"\\"The Language of Love,\\" which was Fogelberg's last big hit single is catchy. With the guitar line, meldoy, and snappy lyric, it is a winner.The rest of the album is a mess, with one song, \\"Tuscon Arizona (Gazette)\\" being quite possibly the most lyrically embarassing song Fogelberg has ever compossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice features... quality, wait and see","review":"I have two of these. Both are less than 2 months old. I purchased Belkin for their SUPERB software suite. These are used on a remote cabin which is unattended most of the time. I need to keep a laptop up and running for weather station and video monitoring.The software has alert features that allow me to get an e-mail or a page as soon as power is interrupted, restored or any other problems arise such as it failing a self test cycle. It is fully configurable.One of the two units failed within about 10 days of going into service. Belkin made me pay for the return shipping on it at nearly $20, that really increased the cost of the device for me.So... A+ for features. B for customer service. Grade pending for long term reliability!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Stephen White novel!","review":"Having read all of Stephen White's books, I think the Best Revenge lives up to his other works. Usually after a few books by an author, I can read the first chapter and tell you the ending of the book. This book made me question the characters until the end. Great job Stephen!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down, didn't want it to be over...","review":"What a wild ride. Stephen White's familiar cast is here, but feel free to jump right in even if you've never meet the regular crew. Be warned, though, that you will NOT want to interrupt reading to eat, to sleep, to do anything other than continue along the twisted trail of plot White has masterfully laid out.As usual in White's books, the characters and their foibles seem fully real and the settings are scarily believable. What happens makes sense, even though the reader may quibble a bit with how the plot resolves. A fully engaging, highly enjoyable roller coaster of a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Would an FBI agent really act this way? If they did, would we want them in the FBI? Improbable plot, ridiculous characters, not one of his best. Why do so many of Stephen White's females characters have physical problems?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Revenge","review":"This is the first time I have read Stephen White. I found this book to a real thriller. Just the type of book to spend some lazy time with. The ending will surprise you. The one drawback is the author lack of knowledge on how the real FBI works, with all the backstabbing and politics. He did get right how the local police does not really repect the FBI, but what the heck is only fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Unbelievable plot and characters really hamper this story, which started off with some promise and became more and more silly as it went on. This was my first White novel. I'll try again, and hope that his other work is stronger than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his weaker efforts","review":"I've read three of his books, and this is easily the worst. Storylines are never a strength in his works, and that is most obvious here, where the ending looks like something he just pulled out of his rear end when he couldn't come up with anything better.The strength of his books for me has always been Gregory, his relationships, and his practise. Those elements take a backseat in this book to featuring some other characters who, I hope, we won't see again in other novels.You won't miss anything if you give this one a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heck have I been???","review":"Wow! This was my first Stephen White read, although I have Priviledged Conversation, as yet unread, in my library. I never would have guessed this was a \\"series\\" as I never felt like I was missing part of the story I should have already known; important for first-time readers. This was a great read. I often found myself thinking \\"OK, what's this guy up to?\\". I found myself laughing one minute and saying \\"Oh My GOD!\\" a few pages later. It's not perfect but for mystery/detective/cop story fans its a darn good read. Priviledged Conversation will be my next read as will all the ones inbetween."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always A Winner","review":"Both my husband and I always enjoy reading works by Stephen White. I think we've read everything he has written... It's like watching a weekly series on TV because you get to know all the same characters so well.His novels are always page turners that keep you interested to the very end!I only regret that due to arthritis in my hands, I have to wait for the paperback version each time a new one comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I've read most of Stephen White's other books, and found them to be a quick read of better-than-average quality, so when I saw this one I picked it up.This book, however, fails to live up to the \\"better-than-average\\" status of his other Alan Gregory books. The plot here is thin and ridiculous. The characters are given improbable motives and even more improbable handicaps and abilities. This book felt rushed, and lacked the depth of plot and intrigue of his earlier books, almost as if White is getting tired of being narratively hemmed in by the slightly dweebish, boring Alan Gregory. After this book, I know I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot? Characters?","review":"I have never read anything by Stephen White but saw the number of books that he had written so I bought one.The plot is beyond far-fetched. The psychologist is a joke. Sorry - pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A get-real book","review":"Isn't it always about expectations? Ours, the author's? Maybe it's both. Bottom lining it,I have to say I was completely disappointed in this one. It took me a while, years ago,to adjust to Stephen King's supernatural thrillers. But once I realigned my thinking, I beganto enjoy many of his books. Now with White I'm not so willing to accept implausible plots and characters. This one is loaded with situations that defy imagination, simply put. It's not that I demand justice of some sort for those who have been horribly abused, but to let theperps get off so easily after the most horrific misdeeds leaves me cold. And not in a good way.Fiction is fiction, I get that. But there's just got to be a portion of believability andsome fragment of redemption in human beings for me to feel entertained in any traditional way.This book fails, in my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like I was Reading an 8th Grade Novel.","review":"Corny beginning, corny middle, and definitely an absurd ending. This was my first and more than likely last Stephen White book. His style of writing is as simplistic as a Judy Blume novel. I truly felt like I was back in 8th grade and this was on the mandatory summer reading list. Lesson learned for any of his future writings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but","review":"This is a very good (5 star) mystery, with twists right 'til the end. BUT, the reader has an annoying habit of dropping his voice for what I suppose he thinks is an appropriately dramatic delivery. It turns out to be just irritating and hard to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, enthralling, and perfect for long drives. (Audio)","review":"This was my first experience with Stephen White and it was an enjoyable one. There are many plot twists and this mystery thriller was a fun adventure. It made me enjoy the drive and rant and rave aloud about some of the characters' choices.The story weaves around an FBI agent female who is responsible for getting a death row inmate out, a shrink who is professionally involved with both the agent and ex-inmate, and a cast of characters that add confusion, passion, and bizarre motivations and twists into the plot.You'll be surprized at the end, but the story will definately keep you interested. I have not read this author before and give it a four star only because I think the motivation for the murder was a weak one and that the ending could have come earlier...but it still was/is a fun and interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and Confusing","review":"Unfortunately for this book, it didn't get interesting until I was almost 3/4 of the way done. I had read a lot of great reviews about this book that it was a real thriller and full of suspense. It wasn't. I found that the story jumped around a lot and you never knew who was talking since it switched from 1st person to 3rd person all the time.The idea behind this book was good; Tom Clone, a convicted murderer gets released from jail because of new evidence found by FBI Agent Kelda James. Kelda recommends her own therapist, Alan Gregory to Tom. Soon they are both telling Alan their deepest secrets and Alan becomes the one who slowly pieces together a very strange puzzle of events.I admit, the end of the book came as quite a shock to me, and I'm sure it will do the same to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album with a heart, a soul and a brain","review":"\\"Woody Guthrie sang about B-E-E-T-S/Not B-E-A-T-S\\" I MUST NOT THINK BAD THOUGHTS is one of the greatest songs ever written by America's best band.

When this band tours soon, any track off this record will make my night. This is American rock'n'roll at some of its very finest...poetic, soulful, and intensely passionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"X rips and roars its way through music that goes bang, and every once in a while gets softer and more introspective on songs such as \\"I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts.\\"\\"Poor Girl\\" should have been a hit. John Doe's voice is a modern treasure, and the song rocks with a great melody.Or get it for \\"Devil Doll,\\" if nothing else.

Thanks for a perfect transaction!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Fun!!","review":"This is X at their peak. I agree with the notes in the cd, this is their most complete record. The first 3 are great, but this is X hitting on all pistons. The songs are consistent (not a bad or mediocre one in the batch), exciting and unique. Nice booklet with insights from the band and great pictures. The remaster sounds great, less echo & reverb, more punch and bass to the mix. All 4 bonus tracks are unique to this release, they are not on the Anthology double cd. Oh, but the music is killer, relentless, clever and strong. This album was the last produced by Ray Manzerak. He did a great job on the first 3 and he doesn't disappoint here. He didn't indulge in the crappy, poppy and \\"dated\\" '80s production of the time. You'll hear Punk, funk, rockabilly and blues here. This album is pure, evil, candid and one of the most delicious RNR albums you will ever hear. What are you waiting for?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Album from one of our greatest Bands...","review":"This is without a doubt one of X's best.

I listen to this at work and it helps the day move along"},{"rating":"2","title":"walking the line","review":"X has a funny way of tip toeing the line between raw punk and gritty, classic rock. For one, John and Exene sing extremely well together. The fact that they sing harmonies in a punk band is unusual, but it works. Then there is the fact that they can just churn out the most adrenaline injected punk you will ever hear. These elements are really evident on this and albums after Los angeles and wild gift. X will live on the heart and minds of fans as one of the most dynamic and kick ass bands punk music has ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"sizzlin sounds of summer","review":"Is it punk?

If your interest is theater, theater writing, performance, group dynamics or reflecting on educational/academic and artistic practice then this book is a must.The author explores notions of trust and truth, documentation and creative writing and what it means to create and shape material for performance. The work described is UK based but the ACTUAL material of the book is pretty much universal. For students who are being asked to write about their own processes (or other people's) it's absolutely first rate. Likewise for college and university tutors.

Truly an inspirational and accomplished work, cerebral and delightful. A must for all who love Chinese food."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative and fun","review":"I recommend Swallowing Clouds to anyone curious about Chinese food and culture.

That is, it belongs in the canon of musical compositions that evoke not just a mood correlative to literary fantasy, but that also convey or suggest a fantastic narrative. My impression is that a lot of recent musical efforts in this vein have a Celtic (or \\"Celtic\\") quality.

I base my rating (really a 3.5) on the price. Way too expensive to use if you plan to do 3-4 ounces per day. If it weren't for the price, I'd buy several more bottles and give it a few months to see the effects it would have on my voice and body.

At 11 months, he started referring to any train he saw as, \\"huff! huff! huff!\\" thanks to this book. The Lois Lenski illustrations are second to none, and the colorful pictures keep our son engaged. Our son has yet to graduate to the hardcover version (which is apparently longer and more involving), and despite negative comments against the board book version I've read, I have to say that its shorter length is about all our 17 month old has the patience for... plus, he likes to rip paper pages, so the board book version has been perfect so far.

I do not find the Neoforma master case helpful and substitute a number of Harvard cases such as Walnut Ventures, Vinod Khosla and Sun Microsystems, China Baby Food, and Google for the Neoforma case.

I have read most of Zane Grey, Ernest Haycox, Luke Short, Peter Dawson, Louis L'Amour and William Macleod Raine's books, I don't think that I will be able to say the same of Lauran Paine, he wrote under many other names which you can look up under a.k.a. on the Lukol search engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just didn't draw me in...","review":"After reading this novel, I wonder if maybe the flow of it was lost when it was translated into English.

Any person with half a brain can figure out who the \\"Soothsayer\\" is the minute the narrator meets him, and the big \\"secret\\" that is discovered at the end is completely anticlimactic.

I read Robert Ludlum on a regular basis, so I consider myself to be someone who can follow a complex story line, but this wasn't so complex as it was just all over the place. Perhaps this could be attributed to the abridgement, but the story jumped from scene to scene without any flow, the characters had no development (some of them seemed to appear from nowhere). Ironically, there was a vast amount of time dedicated to a particular event in the beginning that seemed to have no connection to any other part of the story. Perhaps the book is better, but don't waste your time on the abridged CD. If the book doesn't grab you in the first few chapters, I probably wouldn't waste my time on the effort to finish it - unless you have an overwhelming desire to give yourself a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Many Undeveloped Characters; Great Theory","review":"While I enjoyed your theories, I felt that the characters were underdeveloped, especially Leonardo DV. Many of the characters were confusing to me, especially how you jumped from Milan to Rome. Other times and places were confusing to me, not knowing the geography of Milan and vicinity.You left me with an appetite to learn more about the era so that I can readily separate fact from fiction. For example, does the mysterious book held in the left hand of the maiden on the playing card really exist? Or do we know of it only by reference? Why is the food on the table at the Last Supper so scattered about? It seems to me that an actual meal would be much more ordered.

But it didn't. There was a little bit of code-breaking that went on, but it was all too pat, too cut-and-dried with no room for suspense, no theories tentatively advanced to be proven wrong later, no breakthroughs"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret Supper","review":"Rarely do I not finish a book I have started reading; however, I didn't finish this one.

I am glad I did so: as I am sure I would not have enjoyed it anywhere near as much.Yes, this is another novel based on coded mysteries. It is also a fascinating view of the times in which Leonardo da Vinci lived, and incorporates some details of his life and paintings.The novel moves quickly, but in small chapters. While I solved the puzzle well before the end of the book, that was simply because I'd been paying attention to the clues being offered along the way. Solving the puzzle prematurely in no way diminished my pleasure in reading the novel.I enjoyed this novel immensely and had no difficulty in imagining Leonardo in such a role.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Dud","review":"This was dreadful fiction, a weak mystery, a boring thriller. There's no sense of the period; the characterizations are paper-thin; the pacing is poor. And then central concept is ludicrous: Leonardo hides a huge secret in The Last Supper and then brags about it to his assistant? I had to re-read that chapter to figure out what the author was up to, though perhaps some of the book's problems are the fault of the translation because there's much too much bad English here. More annoying still, there's a major clue which is easy to figure out, if you're moderately literate, many chapters before the solution is presented. This feels like a Da Vinci Code knock-off and that book has much more brio and audacity, which means that despite its flaws, it's page-turning fun. I turned these pages, yes, but mostly out of morbid curiosity--could it really be this bad? Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Supper","review":"A good read!

Mr. Sierra simply took too long to get to his point and rambled about topics not relevant to the crux of his book.

I agree with the reviewer who said that perhaps there was something lost in translation.

It did not flow at all, and it even hada \\" smug \\" feeling to it. I did not enjoy it at all, I found it very hard to read, not with level of difficulty, but with flow of sentences and topic.

I rate Cainer's cosmic book a better read than this, and even better again are the cosmic books by Andronicou and Richards. This for me did not give enough coverage to the origination of this ancient concept or its progression to the present time. It is just claimed that Mohr is responsible for cosmic ordering being in existence, which of course is a ridiculous claim. No one can claim to have carte blanche over the origination. What follows in the book is just a story of how Mohr went against the wishes of her friend and tried to prove this concept did not work by thinking negatively, but somehow what she had written down came about. This would seem to dumbfound the law of attraction about attracting what you think of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book and works well","review":"I have just started to look into cosmic ordering and found this book of great value and interest.

It is a story even avid spaceflight fans may not have heard. Dewar presents a very readable account of the visionary engineers, project managers, and politicians who developed the first nuclear thermal rockets. The narrative covers the politics and engineering (with supplementary appendices) without being overwhelming. It explains why the nuclear rocket is superior to chemical engines, yet why the world failed to embrace it. The technology has lain dormant for decades, but is quietly making a revival in NASA's project Prometheus and elsewhere.

An excellent modern ( Stereo ) score made up of renditions of the Brazilian music Welles was investigating is dubbed on together with appropriate sound effects ( wind & waves etc ). Despite being on Nitrate film stock stashed in a studio basement for over 40 years its presented in almost perfect condition. A thrill to see what's left and truly sad to think of what might have emerged. Included amongst the snippets of incomplete material is just 3 minutes B&W and 3 minutes colour Rio Carnival footage and a complete 3 minute segment from \\"My Friend Burrito\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"A little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative. Touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both Mr. Welles and the Brazilian culture. If there is one reason to own this tape it would be to see over and over again the last part of the film.

Kerasote, hunter, environmentalist, and ethicist, presents three examples of hunting: subsistence hunting with the Eskimo, big game trophy hunting, and a personal hunting trip.

Some of his envronmental arguments are particularly telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUNTER'S VIEW","review":"this book will only appeal to those seeking an alternative lifestyle.

Get church members to blindly give 10% (at least) of their income to the local Church.Number 1 is a noble goal. Number 2 runs counter to true Christian stewardship. True stewardship teaches that 100% of our time, treasure, and talent belongs to the Lord, not just 10% of our income. Even in the OT, the poor RECEIVED tithes, not paid them. How seriously wrong to exact money from the poor in the name of God. If the poor give, it should be of a freewill offering. This book uses the typical out-of-context Scripture twisting to justify the ungodly \\"give-to-get\\" perverted Gospel teaching.For the truth on tithing, please read a much better book: \\"Should the Church Teach Tithing\\" by Dr. Russell.

She writes about her growing up when life was more simple. I can relate to that! I understand her loss when her mother died when she was so young. I applaud her praise for the stay at home moms. What bothers me is the fact that she gripes so much about sending her kids to private school. Parents should be involved in their children's school whether it's public or private.

She calls him about every name in the book, in the book. I know she was trying to be funny in doing this, but when it appears that you're trying, then you're not being funny.A glaring omission in the book is the lack of a passage to tell the reader \\"how to get a job like mine\\".

Hayley Mills, remembered from so many Disney movies, is a full grown adult with a young daughter who is fascinated by the people and experiences of Africa.The story is simple but touching. The family is conned into a coffee farm in Africa and like an American western, encounters all types of difficulties in getting started. A neighboring family and a dashing white hunter provide a romantic love triangle. There is spectacular scenery and wild animals. Then it all goes wrong thanks to WWI."},{"rating":"2","title":"PBS show of many years ago now available on DVD","review":"We watched this series on PBS with our boys when they were growing up. Ran across a VHS set at our library. One tape was missing so I did an internet search and found the series on DVD at Amazon. Also bought a copy for my sister's kids.I had forgotten that the series ended with lots of unanswered questions. Since Elsbeth has written like thirty books I suppose some of the questions are answered there like--What happened to her parents? What happended to her after they left Africa? Did they ever come back to Kenya? How did the plantations continue with the coffee production?The stories provide excellent examples of how different cultures are from each other. This is a good family opportunity for discussion about life decisions and the consequences.We really enjoyed watching these again and plan to share them with friends who went to Kenya on a missions trip last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family film","review":"If you are a fan of Hayley Mills then you will love this film.

I suppose there is merit in listing to the Stokowski Symphony Orchestra conducted by Stokowski himself. However, I was looking for an excellent HiFi listening CD using current technology and not remastering of old, mono recorded music. Chandos 9259 is a much better recording of some of the same Bach music (certainly not a 1:1 match).

In addition, this text has a whole online study area you can go to and take practice quizzes, do activities and things like that.

I guess I keep hoping for something better than the last book, but they just keep getting more and more boring and mired in theology lessons. Instead of feeling as if I've just read a murder mystery, I feel as if I've just attended a lengthy lecture course on theology. I come away exhausted and wondering where the excitement, the tension, and the suspense were hiding. Clearly, Mr. Kienzle misses preaching. His characters deliver multi-paragraphed speeches, not dialogues. And the pesky quotation marks, while grammatically accurate, are confusing. I'm constantly checking them to be sure who is talking. I used to look forward to Kienzle's novels, but I think \\"No Greater Love\\" has cured me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"This book was dreadful.

All in all the dish was saved at the end, albeit a bit soggy and just somewhat like the photo on pg. 159.

Timeless. And new. One of the 2-3 best things to happen in music this year if not the decade. It's a giant leap ahead of their peers into a new genre. Beaches and Canyons is endlessly more fascinating to listen to than any electroclash triphop drum'n'bass glitch postrock trance jungle techno you've heard.

Ms Rogers has gathered information about the personal life of Abraham Lincoln and his family, & has tied them into Civil War activities in an insightful way through the eye's of President Lincoln wife Mary Todd Lincoln.Ms Rogers has used both factual & fanciful information and imagination in a perfectly delicate mix to place together a novel with an historical emphasis that is hard to put down; but that has natural chapter breaks which allow the reader to feel comfortable if he feels the need to fall asleep in peace at the end of each.I fully recommend reading this book for an insight into the life of our country and its president during this very trying time in our country's history"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoochie Baby Clothes","review":"I realize I should have looked at the clothes a little closer, but I did not notice how tiny they were until they arrived.

While most often the line will be an opening one, that is not necessarily the case.

Examples are:From \\"Essay on Criticism\\" by Alexander Pope\\"To err is human, to forgive divine.\\"Followed by\\"Some errors I forgive, though quickly. . . .

This is one of the last works of theirs to heavily use the analog synthesis technology of the time with a hint of the new digital sounds that were just coming out. This provided sound that was very warm, yet also bright and clear. Producer Rupert Hine (the producer used on Worlds Apart) added his magic again to create a complete package that is enjoyable from start to finish. In case you couldn't tell, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A step forward and a step back","review":"It's quite hard to look at Heads or Tales as either an improvement or a step backwards over its predecessor, Worlds Apart. While being musically more daring, by evidence of even more elaborate and intricate dual guitar - keyboard attacks, I always had the feeling that the songwriting had suffered a bit. 'Catwalk', 'Sound of Strangers' sounded like rather unfinished songs. It's unfortunate that the songwriting didn't live up to the crowning achievement of its predecessor.I must acknowledge, however, that Heads or Tales' crisp & raw sounding mix, coupled with very unusual digital-analog combination of sounds for its era (owed to Gilmour's PPG Wave synthesizer) did the album good for not having sounded like anything that was on the early 80s musical scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of saga's best","review":"this work by one of the most under rated bands is nothing short of phenominal.this album takes on all musical styles and comes up a winner.from the flyer to pitchman to catwalk there's something for everyone.this is an album i enjoy listening to all the time,i first heard it when it came out and have been amazed at the quality and tastefulness that this band puts into it's music. a must-have for any saga fan or anyone who enjoyes music that has something to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Although I do have a few complaints about the book, I really liked it. Most of my complaints involved wanting more - more artist commentary, more concept drawings, that sort of thing. The book has an introduction written by Hayao Miyazaki, a section with concept sketches, a section with concept sketches, backgrounds, and character designs, and a section explaining how computer graphics were used in the movie. This book even has the movie's screenplay. I really enjoyed the concept sketches, which show how original ideas changed to create the final product. For instance, a sketch of Zeniba and Yubaba shows how much Zeniba's design changed - she looks more normally proportioned than her sister. Later in the book, there is an explanation for why the change in Zeniba's design occurred. I also enjoyed the computer graphics section, because I would never have noticed any of the things they pointed out on my own. I foudn it fascinating, they way they blended cel art and digital art so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Look At The Making of Spirited Away!","review":"After buying this book and looking through it I found many interesting things about not only the making of the movie itself, but about the initial designs for many of the characters, themes, and settings for it.

The book is very complete in showing the work behind the movie, and does it neatly.It starts with an introduction by the very same Hayao Miyazaki, and the follows with sketches, concept art, background art, character design, screenshots, and even the complete movie script.The only critisims i could give is that the book itself feels a bit washed out. The design of the book doesn't keep up with the beautiful/folklore inpired art it is showing, plain white being the common concept from front to back cover. Maybe this isn't that important, but a preetier design would've sure make a nice adition (see Art of Okami).That aside, a very nice book for fans of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but...","review":"I'm a fan of the Ghibli animators, I'm a graphic designer and illustrator.

I loved the movie and this is a perfect companion collectible. As far as the art, I think I like it even better than the movie because the colors are slightly softer in the art and not quite as cartoony. The art of the movie is fine to, don't get me wrong, but animation is not the same kind of art as this. As in other books like this that I have collected I love seeing the creative process best.

While not cheap, it is fun!On a more mature side of Japanese art/history, and unrelated to cartoons, is the great book Samurai Warriors by Stephen Turnbull.

They are the ultimate expression of the ultimate good that is capitalism.And that is the source fallacy of this book and all others like it: the notion that capitalism is bad and socialism is the answer.

A careful reading of the actual book reveals a highly balanced perspective on business and the corporate world. The author is not antibusiness or marxist, but rather classically conservative in that he advocates for corporate power being subordinate to the needs and rights of the people.

As we look back over the history of the US, I would suspect that the Founding Fathers would not recognize the nation they set in motion. According to Hartmann, protection of the individual from the effectively limitless powers of non-human corporations was a keystone on which the Founding Fathers did agree, even if their recommended methods may have differed. Unfortunately, our fundamental lack of interest or understanding of American history has led to our inability to properly maintain the safeguards that provided those protections. Despite its problems, the uniqueness and the greatness of the American Experiment comes through loud and clear in this book, and it is a must read for anyone who wants to or needs to be reminded of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute and easy to use","review":"I bought the Samsung t209 for my mother but I was sooo tempted to keep it for myself.

My daughter just turned 1 and she adores it. it comes with the mother and a baby in a car seat as well as her stroller. The van has eyes which move when the wheels spin and you can honk the horn. It also palys the music to If You're Happy And You Know It.... when the horn is honked again. It does seem a bit loud but it plays for only a short time when pressed. My daughter can't fit them in properly yet but she gets them in the car and pushes it around anyway. I love this toy because it is one of the few for children her age that lets her use her imagination. I will be picking up the Little People Zoo or Barn next since my daughter loves animals. This toy is durable and easy to clean. It can also be taken everywhere since it is a good size to carry along. The only thing that bothers me is that my daughter always throws the mom on the floor and plays with the baby. Is she trying to tell me something ;-))??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute... but really loud!","review":"This little mini van is very cute, and my 3-year old daughter loves it. Being a music nut, she especially likes to push the button and play the song. I do wish the van had a volume control, though, because it's REALLY loud! This seems to be an issue with a number of Fisher-Price toys, like the Little People Ferris Wheel / Carnival set. The van is also pretty sturdily built, except for the open-able tailgate, which my daughter took off almost immediately. Again, I've had this sort of problem with other Little People toys' doors. This isn't a big deal, and it certainly doesn't affect the toy in any other way. It's also fun to use the mom and baby with other Little People sets, and vice versa. All in all, an above-average toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little car","review":"My daughter has loved this car since the day we bought it. The thing that first got her attention were the sounds. She loved to hear the baby laughing and the horn honking. She also liked the \\"engine\\" sounds.

It is such a great, fun toy at a super price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vrooom--Vrooom","review":"This minivan plays various songs and sounds.

My oldest is now five and she still enjoys playing with them. I love their durability and the way they stimulate so much imaginative play. This toy is no exception.The only negative thing I could say about the minivan is that the sounds it makes are way too loud. That's not the case with other Little People toys we have, so I don't understand why the volume is set so much higher on this one. Of course, that's MY complaint, not my kids'!!! I really do wish that toy manufacturers would pay more attention to the noise level of their toys. It's not good for kids' hearing or for parents' sanity.I'm off my soapbox now - I hope you enjoy this toy as much as my girls do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"I recently bought this for my 9 month old and she loves it! She loves pushing it back and fourth and loves dancing to the music! She loves to play with the people that came with it. It is a great early learning toy, it is helping her with her grasping and cordination and learning that 1 thing can go into another. She also learned in NO time at all where the button was that made the sounds. As for the recommend age of 1 year, We have had no problem with the durability or safety issues.

Hiring a real estate company to represent you the buyer instead of using an agent who drags you around to all of the \\"in house listings\\". The exclusive buyer agent works only for your best interest. You hire the agent to help you buy the best home, save money, and avoid surprises. Having bought three homes and using an Exclusive Buyer's Agent on our last home, I know from personal experience what a godsend this is. A true EBA tells the buyer everything. This is so popular now that almost all agents claim to be Buyer Agents, look for the company that does not represent sellers, hence \\"exclusive\\" buyer agents.

Kristina seems to me to be the serious work that Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus had in them all the time and finally got out. It's a sprawling, lush, varied work that simultaneously bridges pop, Swedish folk, rock, and classical genres in a single work that holds up as a cohesive piece. Amazing. I've since gotten Andersson's \\"Klinga Mina Klocker\\" and his \\"Benny Andersson Orchestra\\" CD's and Kristina seems like a logical development from these efforts.If you haven't heard it yet, buy it - it will sink its beautiful hooks into you before long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best modern musical","review":"Benny and Bjorn have exceeded everything they ever did with ABBA.

It is a \\"tear jerker\\" and filled with love and passion . . . based on historical facts of the great Swedish migration to America in the mid 19th century. \\"Kristina\\" is more moving than \\"Sound of Music\\".

I found Kristina through my love of Chess(benny and Bjorns first musical written along with tim rice) At first I was reluctant to buy this cd as it is 60.00 dollars and swedish. But I emplore you to buy it. One last thing to mention is \\"When is this angel, Helen Sjolom, going to come to America. She has without a doubt the most beautiful yet strong voice I have ever heard.

I highly recommend this if you are a music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Simply Marvelous","review":"Musical theater and opera play a very big role in my life. Several years ago Kristina fran Duvemala was recommended to me. I don't know a word of Swedish, yet after several listenings to the 3-CD set, I was completely captivated by the music and the singing. Helen Sjoholm, Anders Ekborg, and Peter Joback are among my favorites now. I subsequently bought the Joback CD of Broadway songs. I am not at all surprised Mamma Mia is a big hit as Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus seem to have been born [Bjorn?] to write for the stage. The show Chess has various weaknesses, but the score surely is not one of them. To those of you who like the Chess music, I can only say wait 'til you hear Kristina. Its a healthy investment -- I overpaid [price] at Colony in NYC -- but worth every penny. I would travel to Minneapolis to see it in English, or even in Swedish, if it actually were performed there as was planned, at least at one time.

It only affects about 3 of the tricks in the book and of those only 2 of them can't be overcome with a little ingenuity from the reader.

There is nothing like the feeling of urgency to get home and settled so I can get back to reading this book. I thought the level of action vs romance was perfect. The transformation of the characters was gradual and realistic. JR Ward is not afraid to surprise the reader with twists in the plot. I connected with the characters, with the struggle and love how the entire Brotherhood changes and grows with each book. Zsadist's story is one that I could re-read over and over again.

I just didn't feel he was very well developed, his story sounded haphazardly at best. But Bella was the greatest disappointment of all. She was so awesome in the other books, but in this one I hardly recognized her.Oh the action was good, and it was nice 'n dark, but it just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Just wow.","review":"I don't usually bothering writing reviews on books, but after seeing that the book had 5 stars I had to.This book is truly god awful, to put it bluntly. There's too much plot, too much back story, and too many characters competing for space. There's absolutely no real characterization. And of course, it's so cheesy it's laughable. Zadist's (if you can call that a name) history of sexual abuse is just a stupid ploy to gain sympathy from the readers, and as soon as the insipid, forgettable heroine appears he's able to magically heal. The so called \\"romance\\" was the best example of IKEA porn I've seen outside a LKH novel. The dialogue honestly made me feel embarrassed for the writer, and the idea of leather-clad, wanna-be thug vampires was just too pathetic to believe.So, if you're into that kind of stuff, this is the book for you. As for me, let's just say this is my new guide on how not to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me, I guess","review":"Maybe I should have started with the first book of the series. The author does not write these to stand alone. The author did try to make it clear what was going on, but it seemed for her to do that the book ended up bogged down with backstory not haveing to do much with the current story, and it was also bogged down with storyline setting up what will obviously be the next few books in the series. If we take that away all we get is some vamps with stupid names and a lot of sex from a main character who suffered centuries of sexual abuse only to be turned around in less than a week by some boring and insignificant female vamp character. I found the whole thing rediculous. I was hoping for a much richer story but the author only cracked the surface of the emotional depth a character who went through so much trama would experience. I expected so much more and was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best out of the first 3","review":"I think I enjoyed this one out of the first three the best because the plot seemed to have a bit more depth. I could NOT wait until this main character had a book written about him. (Something about the wounded type that seems appealing.) Also, the main female character was very multi sided and interesting. Once again, I was done in a day and could not put it down. Like most series books, by the 2nd or 3rd book, the reader starts to see the recipe. However, these are still awesome to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite BDB","review":"I've just re-read this book yet again and I have to say this is my favorite of the BDB series. It's so hard to read and so sad at parts, but I think that is what makes the end so rewarding and the happy and beautiful moments even better. JRW is an excellent story teller and I think she does a good job of letting us see inside the characters' heads. In some ways I feel like I know the brothers and their shellans and reading her books is like visiting friends. If you haven't read this series yet, start at the beginning. This world of the BDB that JRW has created can be cold and dark and very violent and the heroes don't always act like gentleman so if you are looking for pure fluff, this series may not be for you. But if you like your prince charming with a bit of a sharp edge, you are in for a real treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adore This!!!","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! It is my favorite Ward book. I can read this novel over and over again..in fact I have. Zsadist is my favorite of the BDB. Its nice to read his journey from a cold, soul-less male, to a hot loving male. Never a complaint for Ward from this girl. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series.","review":"I haven't read anything better than this series all year. I've always been a Christine Feehan fan, But after reading J.R.wards Novels, I've seen the light. Feehan is ok, But i've come to realize that her characters are all pretty much the same. The men all seem like the same character over and over again. J.R.'s characters have been so different. It doesn't feel like i'm reading about the same couple in a different situation. I love J.r.'s World. I can get so lost in it. The love scenes aren't over bearing and she's built a world that will keep you coming back for more!Jump on this series and you'll see what i mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commandment Breaker","review":"I would very much enjoy this series if not for the fact that I'm cringing at least every other page because the author cannot keep herself from frequently taking the Lord's name in vain; breaking one of the Ten Commandments. I don't know how she is not afraid to thumb her nose at God, but it really bothers me. I read this book and another with pen in hand, obliterating the offensive words, but don't know that I will be reading any of her others...a shame, because overall I really like the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!!","review":"The story of Zsadist is the best of the series. A ruthless killer, all-powerful, untouchable, soooooo very dangerous is tamed by a woman who finds and saves his tortured inner child. That's after he saves her from a certain death, heals her injuries, lets her drink his blood, secretly falls in love with her but thinks himself unworthy so he pushes her away, hoping she can be happy with someone else. In between all the suffering they manage to have a few hot, rough encounters. He ultimately offers his very life to avenge her honor and is willing to sacrifice himself for her happiness, even if it is with another man. WOW!!! If that's not an ultimate fantasy then I don't know what is!! The only complaint I have about this book is that certain characters were killed off, which is my opinion was totally unnecessary. Also, i hope that Phury will get his own book because he deserves a break. But make no mistake-- Zsadist is the ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lover Awakened","review":"Ah, Zsadist. I like him, if only because he is bad but sweet inside... that is, when I looked really deep.Sure, it's not the best of the series so far, but the ending is what got me. So many things are unsolved, and while this would bother a lot of people I'm not one of them. Personally, an unsolved ending like this is sure to pull me towards Lover Revealed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"He can be saved","review":"It's awesome to read a story that is both realistic in dialoge and sex but them be able to throw in the fantastic fantasy of saving someone with love instead of deep psychotherapy. I'm not kidding! Zsadist (best name) has some serious issues that need to be delt with. The author does so with real style, showing us in flashback mode what exactly happened to our favorite bloodsucker. Bella is drawn by his anger and danger, but falls in love because he's in pain and vulnerable. Great story, the best one so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Job well done!","review":"Of all the Brothers, Zsadist had it the worst and to read about what happened to him that turned him so hateful was great. The expressions are thorough and give the reader such insight on how abused he was and explains so much about his character.I also like the fact that although Bella is there with him and all seems great, the author doesn't turn him into a \\"sap\\" ...after all he endured, it would have been unrealistic to make him a happy-go-lucky guy just because of Bella.Loved the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zsadist's story is my favorite thus far!","review":"These books are great! They are explicitly sexual however, and can/will make you a little bit uncomfortable to read in public. Maybe I'm just a newbie to erotica or whatever, but these are sort of like mental porn, and I didn't know I would like them so much, and I think that makes me a little uncomfortable (blush). However, they are really well written, and the stories are great, and I have not been able to put them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book moved me to tears","review":"Just when I thought the series couldn't get any better...god, was I ever wrong. By far, hands down, my favorite new book. The story of Zsadist and Bella touched me beyond words. I laughed, I cried, I wept. I don't want to give any of the story away but you NEED to get this book. It is worth every last penny and more! Strait up, the series owns me. And out of all the books I have written reviews for, this on is the BEST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too depressing","review":"Oh my God I really struggled with this. Zsadist is a MISERY. Do not read this if you are looking for a light and uplifting and fun story, this is dark and heavy and very slow going."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Brother!!","review":"I recently began reading this series and have thoroughly enjoyed reading every last single word, page, and books!! But I must say that this book is the best of them all. Zsadist is an excellent mix of danger, strength, softness, romance, and eroticism all mixed in one. He is a keeper!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love these books","review":"i won't do a synopsis of the book, but the story, like the 2 before, was wonderful. the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, is the language in all three books. the guys are discribed as white, but the language is gangster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lover Awakened (Zsadist's Story)","review":"Ever since I read Rhage's story (Lover Eternal) I could not wait to read about Zsadist. I was disappointed that Bella or Phury didn't slap him upside the head and tell him to stop whining and get over it! Or that it took him so long to realize she somewhat went through the same thing as he and was able to look past it. (Gotta love women) All in all, I expected more, but was delightfully surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the plot well written","review":"Excellent vampire series, especially if you're into Vampire Erotica, sounds a little Harlequine Romancy but this line of books has a very strong continuous story with a wonderful devotion amongst it characters and their mates. I found myself getting emotionally attached to each brother and their different personality traits."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I knew Zadist's story was going to be hard. How do you make a man with so many wounds, mental & physical grow and heal. And somehow J.R Ward has done that. And Bella is perfect for him.I also liked the fact that other things are also going on with the other characters. That it's not just dialog between Zadist & Bella. Everything that happens apart from our two main characters is what brings everything full circle in this story.I was not disappointed and I cannot wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"really, really excellent book","review":"I read it in one day, and I'm going to have to immediately read it again. I was one of the people just DYING for this book to come out, as Z is my favorite Brother. And it was everything I wanted it to be. I thought Ward did a great job showing how abuse-survivor Zsadist would feel, she was spot-on with his reactions, feeling \\"dirty\\", \\"unworthy\\" and such. It was a bittersweet book, one that stays with you for a while. She is an amazing writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I havent read this one yet...","review":"I just finished book 2 in this series. I am in love with the Black Dagger Brotherhood! There is just enough violence enough sex, that it doesnt overshadow the character of each brother. I absolutely LOVE IT!!! J.R. Ward does an excellent job. I will be picking up book 3 this weekend! I am so excited...its like seeing an old friend again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I loved this book! I have definitely added J.R. Ward to my favorite author list. I am telling all my friends about this book. I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"j r ward is a must read. Her imagination outshines the rest.Get all of her books you will never regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zsadist and Bella","review":"This is the book that I thought started to show some interconnectivity to the characters. This book is dark; it shows gives a lot of the back story of Zsadist's life as a blood slave. His past haunts him throughout the book and it so amazing to see how his fondness for Bella starts to shatter some of his walls. Ward does a great job in this book, she makes you see that the front of, I am an evil bxxxxxd, is not all that Zsadist can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of them all!","review":"The best book by far (I just read the last one Lover Avenged) and still, book #3 is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of them all!","review":"Lover Awakened to me is the best of the whole series... you understand why Zsadist is the darkest of the brothers and is so touched when finally there is a female who accepts him for who he is and is able to touch his heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the series so far","review":"I hate to admit it, but I had 13 year old fan girl moments in this book!I absolutely adored Zsadist and Bella. What a stunning relationship.This was the most enjoyable book of the series so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK","review":"I think this book was the best from the whole series. Loved it so much, I've read it 4 times..hehe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zsadist's Story","review":"Ok, I have to say EXCELLENT BOOK!! Excellently written, definatley recommended!! BUT YOU HAVE TO READ THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES IN THE CORRECT ORDER...way too much stuff happens, and the reader would be lost. I really never saw this one comming, Ward does a great job of revealing her characters and forshadowing future books. After this book, I can't wait to see what Ward has in store for me in the next book, prob start reading it tonite!! Happy Reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate tortured hero","review":"J.R. Ward's third entry in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series brings us the history of Zsadist, arguably the most tortured hero of the whole romance genre, and Bella, the high-ranking female who loves him enough to cope with his inner and outer demons. Frankly, the pain might put some people off, but as the book continues with the writer's clever subplots and secondary characters, I urge you to stick with it. You know that romance will win, but what about all those other vampires and humans that we are coming to know as our own? Don't miss any details, and get ready to dive into the next volume in this enthralling series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL! CRIED.....LAUGHED......CRIED AGAIN!","review":"An up all night read. I could not put it down. The BDB series is wonderful. This is my favorite in the series. This story is very emotioal. Zsadist is very tormented having been a blood slave for many years. He his unable to welcome any emotional or physical pleasures. He thinks himself unworthy of Bella's physical and emotional love. This story also gives us insight to Zsadist and Phury's relationship (very emotional also) The battle with the lessers also still rages. Just Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the BDB series, so far","review":"I'm a real fan of the BDB series, and this book is the best example of what is good about the series. The main character, Zsadist, is a very troubled man, a victim of sexual abuse in his past, with some real baggage to shake off. Bella, the female protagonist is kidnapped and tortured, and so, in addition to her already burgeoning sympathy for Z, develops a real ability to connect with his suffering and draw him out.J.K. Ward's universe is impressive. As usual, the 'voice' of the series is compelling, contemporary, with each of the Brothers having their own quirky personalities. I've never been one for vampire books, but these vampires are more like a different species of human, with their own problems, with their own society. It is the 'Lesser's' - humans who have sold themselves to the dark Omega, who have no souls. Z, a tortured character, is nevertheless capable of redemption, and his story of redemption and awakening will have you rivited."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little input","review":"I'm not going to talk about this book specifically, as the other reviewers have already done a great review of it.This is the best series I have run across in the past year (since I started seriously reading vampire/otherworld type novels). I haven't read all of the authors out there, but so far I'm amazed by Ward. I like this series better than Sherrilyn Kenyon, Lora Leigh, Angela Knight and even Christine Feehan.Of course it could just be that my personal tastes in reading material coincide perfectly with this series. All I can say is that if you're looking for a new author to try, pick up Ward's Dark Lover and keep going as her writing only gets better as the series progresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the series","review":"Defiantly the best one and I would recommend reading father mine the short story that accompanies this book to it's really good also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spelling more cutesy in each volume","review":"The story line is excellent. Thus far, I agree with the other reviewers.But. In each successive volume, the spelling gets more annoying and cutesy.

It has a much larger interior than I thought it would. We've been able to put a large loaf of bread, 6 bagels in a bag, one package of hotdog buns and a package of pita bread in there all at the same time. Since it's flat on top, I can put other items on top of it. A definite plus since storage space is limited. The bread stays fresh and lasts much longer. We put a loaf in there and deliberately took our time eating it. Three weeks after its \\"best by\\" date it was still fresh and mold free.

You MUST start with Season 1 if you want to fully enjoy every little nuance and detail of the amazing storylines behind each unforgettable character."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you're Lost, a map is helpful","review":"I was intrigued when I heard of the new Lost series. I have enjoyed classic stories such as Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson, and even Lost in Space and CastAway. The stories of one, or a small group of people learning to survive when detached from civilization dramatize the feelings of helplessness that many of us experience on occasion.The Lost series goes beyond the man vs. nature storyline. We see each character's soul exposed in flashbacks. These flashbacks identify the burdens each character has to bear in addition to the challenges of surviving on a deserted island.The series gives me hope for broadcast televisionI look forward to viewing the DVD set so I can fill in the holes left by missed episodes and find needed insights offered by the extra content on the DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sharkjumping Here","review":"In the midst of the season, when we Lost junkies hang on each new episode, repeats are the bane of one's existence (unless of course you have been careless enough to somehow have your life interfere causing you to miss an episode). Removed from that \\"what happens next\\" compulsion, the first season replayed in DVD is even more rewarding. Yes, you occasionally notice little -- and perhaps important -- things you missed the first time around (Hurley on Korean television for example), but mostly the pleasure comes from seeing just how consistently superb television this is -- the writing, the acting, and most of all the rich imagination and creativity that underpins it all. Quite simply, this is the best dramatic television has to offer -- with The Sopranos on hiatus and Buffy ended -- and in the DVD versions you get it wonderfully commercial free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!","review":"Lost is the best series ever!!!! Yes, it leaves you off at a terrible place at the end of the season, but it makes you want to wait through the summer for the first episode of the next season!

JJ Abraham does it again, we thought nothing would be better then alias then suddenly comes lost. It's a show the whole family can watch together. Great story line amazing charactersSeason two aired in Sep 2005 and its just getting better with every episode I watch. I hope the show keeps up its standard.I highly recommend season 1 to everyone it's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks for the multi-ethnic cast","review":"At last, a show with characters where their ethnic identity affects their story, but it avoids the usual stereotypes. I'm grateful that a popular show has found a large following and people can love or hate the characters based on their personalities. The Asians are not regulated into science geeks and Jin and Sun have become sex symbols."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out great - goes absolutely nowhere.","review":"At the beginning of the first season the writers had about enough plot for six episodes - then they made 24 episodes out of it.While the general idea of the show is great, the first season has turned out to be as exciting as watching paint dry.If you loved the later seasons of The X-Files or Alias, where they kept dancing around the same \\"secrets\\" without ever giving any answers, then Lost is the show for you.If you want to watch a show that actually goes somewhere and whose writers have an idea about where they are taking the story, then stay as far away from Lost as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintelligent","review":"Watched the first pilot episode downloaded from iTunes for $2, based on the rave reviews. All I can say that it is very slow and boring. Invisible monsters running around a tropical island terrorizing survivors, gimme a break!!!

I can't wait to buy this and re-live the finale where you learn absolutely nothing about what's going on and they introduce more characters and more puzzles!

When have you ever seen such a uniformly good looking bunch of plane passengers? Obviously, this particular flight had taken off from LAX and was a bunch of actors on their way to some tropical casting call. Why can't Hollywood get it right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS THE 0 STAR OPTION DARN IT!","review":"The fact that this and Desperate Housewives have become major hits shows that American's tastes have gone downhill. People become stranded on an island and have to learn how to survive. Oh, and by the way, some mysterious things happen. So what? Justhow manuy times has this storyline been used? Too much. All J.J.ABRAMS did to create this series was: Take Gilligan's Island, replace the charachters with smart people (as well as people who are buff and handsome or sexy), use a plane crash to get them stranded on the island, and then use a few storylines that make it seem new and interesting, even though it isn't. This is an action packed soap opera. With a little luck, people will get tired of having to wait months and years to find out the answers to these mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"The first package I ordered never came, so it was sent to me again.

The few moments of action are often interspersed with long periods of boredom and the characters sometimes behave ridiculously and beyond reason.If you want to watch monsters maruading about on an Island then watch Jurassic park instead.If HBO had made this series, it would've kicked ass!."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't say enough good things about Lost.","review":"One of my favorite TV shows ever. This is the first season and although it is interesting from the start - the unique aspects of this show don't occur until well into this season and even more in season two. If you've just caught an episode here or there out of sequence, then you are probably not hooked because this is a story line that has to be viewed in order.If you like NOT being able to know what's going to happen next, then this is the show for you. It's full of mystery and has more questions than answers. It doesn't follow the usual Hollywood story lines at all. They are not afraid of killing off main characters. Hold on to your seat - this is a great journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"ETHAN!","review":"Oh my! Claire and Charlie have been taken by Ethan! The suspense keeps building! Who is Ethan?

You have to see this show from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this show!","review":"I wish I started watching this when it came out. I watched the whole series over the weekend and was mesmerized. The cast, the writing and character development is great. This is one of the best series on TV in the last 10 years. I'll have to wait awhile to catch up on it but I'm looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent time waster.","review":"Nothing on television has even come close to capturing my attention like the Soprano's. HBO has done very well with their recent exploration into primetime tv. Over five years they've developed some wonderful shows that I've quickly become addicted to. Honestly, tv wasn't worth watching unless it was an HBO series. I shunned most everything else.ABC's LOST has reversed my way of thinking. Drama, suspense, mystery; this show has everything. I'm an addict now and I really get into this series. The only drawback that I see is the necessity to watch the shows in order. If you miss an episode you could potentially become clueless on what's going on.Buy it, watch it, enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One minor complaint about the set, but otherwise it's awesome","review":"I saw all but 2 of the episodes during the first season (I managed to miss BOTH when they were re-run for the first time too) and have finally gone back to watch them (\\"Walkabout\\" and \\"Solitary\\"). Both were among the best of the first season, especially \\"Walkabout.\\"My one minor quarrel with the set was that I wish they had taken the deleted/extended scenes (incl. the 2 unused flashbacks) and dropped them in where they were originally supposed to go, a la the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies. It wouldn't have extended the episodes more than a couple minutes here and there and would have made the viewing experience that much higher a quality.The bonus stuff would still be just that: a bonus, but now I have the feeling that \\"there's something that should go here but I'd have to change discs to see it\\" whenever I watch an episode that was cut to fit into an hour of primetime TV.Can't wait for season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw LOST for the first time last night...","review":"...and I LOVED it! I'm not one of those people who gets 'stuck' into a TV show (not that there's anything wrong with it). I careless about who slept with who in 'Desperate Hosewives',or whether Detective Knucklehead captured aliens in 'X Files', but when I saw LOST (I ended up watching it for the fact that I had nothing better to do last night. Yup, it was a slow evening...), I knew this was a top notch show. Great scripts, actors, etc... Of course, I have no clue as to who the characters are, or the past story line, that's why I'm going to buy this DVD so that I can catch up with the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in Lost","review":"The show grabs you from the start and, though often implausible and contrived in its story telling, is complete escapist fare.

Pulp fiction on the beach in paradise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series ever","review":"I enjoyed a lot watching to this DVD. It is so intense that I watched one episode after another.

I get the feeling that a lot people simply can't face up to the fact that they hate this show.

You are un-patriotic and not a true American."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lostaways","review":"People who like Sopranos, The Wire, shield, O.Z., Deadwood, know what good shows are. And this is not a good show, thats why I am warning all fans of good shows to keep away from this one.The story is lame, like a polar bear could survive on a tropic island. And some big monsters are walking around.They all go around and live in there own world and talk as litle as posible with each other. The show never get any further. And the acting is lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - spoilers below","review":"Yes, it is an incredible good debut season. Great acting, amazing stories, mysteries, a great concept. It grabs you by the throat and never let it go. But I'm gonna talk about Season Two.This show ended for me the moment the characters begun to make totally absurd, egotistical, no-sense decisions going against what we have learned about them in the first season. The pinneacle of these absurds ocurred at the moment that Michael killed Ana Lucia. Michael, a character we learned to admire due to his love for his missing son. My jaw simply dropped in astonishment... it was absurd, useless, it broke plot coerence, it was a twist just for the sake of twisting, nothing more. From this moment on I simply do not care anymore about this show. Good luck for all of you who wil kkep watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost? Yeah, they lost all the episodes","review":"We started watching this show and we were hooked. But, unlike 24, they only have a new episode every three weeks! They play reruns constantly. Then, out of desperation, they made up a new episode by combining highlights from old episodes and narrating it! We turned that one off! Also, have they answered one question of what's happening on the island this entire season? NO! I'll stick with 24 which has a new episode every week! I give up! No more Lost for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"very exciting","review":"Was a very exciting story line although I never watched lthe show while it was running on TV Thought the acting was very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best show on TV.","review":"I just finished watching Season 1 on Amazon Prime.

That being said, the content of the disks is certainly worth it. Even if you weren't a fan of every storyline, or every character, the series was good. You can't take that away from it. As such, I'm glad that I can add it to my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda, well, boring!!","review":"I think there was a compilation of like 6 episodes out of 24 that kept my interest. I tried to like it, but the more I watched, the more painful it got to sit through an entire snooze-fest episode. I actually found myself fast forwarding so that I could see when something interesting would happen.How can people find this show amazing. There's an episode about playing golf, an episode about building a raft, taking a shower, picking fruit, and even drinking water. COME ON! I hardly consider this entertainment. It wasnt horrible, but I dont think I'll be watching the second season. If I were you, I would watch the first and last episode. Everthing else is boring filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. VERY DISAAPOINTED!!","review":"THIS WAS HORRIBLE!

I like the way it unfolds to open - like unrolling a book. The opening background for each disc is like a bit of the jungle in the series - soothing at first, then it seems creepy.

A TV show that deserves attention! I'm one of the people who watches DVDs instead of most of what's on TV. CSI has been spin-offed to death, Raymond's gone, Simpsons should be cancelled, Angel, Buffy, bla bla bla etc, E.R bites and so-called \\"reality\\" shows can kiss my derriere. Let's face it; apart from late night shows like Letterman, it's mighty slim pickings. Thank God (Or rather JJ Abrams) for this fantastic show. Never have I ever become so immersed in such a compelling story. Fantastic characters, sharp action and a premise that seems so simple at the beginning but has a myriad of layers yet to be revealed. The acting is so heart-felt, the stories so rich and rewarding, I don't miss a minute of this top-notch drama. The only annoying thing is having to wait a week between episodes, but the DVD will be here soon, so, along with special making of features, I can relive the GREATEST TV SHOW EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Booklet","review":"I bought the DVD and I was dissapointed when opened up the box to find there was no Booklet.

I was hooked after watching the first 3 shows and I watched it very faithfully to the end. The story is very suspenseful, thrilling and full of action. You will be on the edge of your seat the whole way through.The main problem that I have with this is that there are NO answers to any of the main puzzles in the first season. There is a lot of background and the characters are developed with their back stories. But, even as the characters' backgrounds are developed, we only find more puzzles with very few answers. (I would say that there are no answers to any of the significant questions.) For me, there are too many questions after 25 episodes. I feel that my faithfulness in watching the show to the end paid off to nothing.Granted, as I stated in the beginning, I was entertained. But, how long is it going to go on until we get some answers? Season 2? Season 3?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I never recieved it!","review":"I never recieved this product but being a huge Lost fan, trust me anyone that buys this will ultimatley enjoy it.!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"24\\"...with monsters!

Evil numbers? And the acting is dire, Kate has two expressions, constipated or head leaning on shoulder, she is NOT sexy! And where do they get all they freshly laundered clothes and new wardrobe each week, does the French woman run them something up?It is trying too hard to be 'wacky', when it has episodes which deal with living on the island and general relationships it is so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow plot details/ NWO propaganda tool","review":"I can appreciate the setting of the storyline... Nobody can deny that Oahu Hawaii is an island paradise but I think the screenwriting for this series is too shallow and dysfunctional. The plot flits and undulates with a shallow orchestration. Too many cheesy and modernized takes on pop culture seem to bog down this schizophrenic, and brain-damaged weekly video hopelessness. It may be paradise but it surely is paradise LOST.If you choose to waste your time on this series feature, you will have too many attempts to overthrow a simple faith in God to withstand at one time, such as the lie that death is not dying, Catholic faith constitutes true Christianity, romantic relationships with multiple partners is a good thing. This series represents everything that is wrong with our world and none seem to be speaking up about it. It is addictive, but definitely in a bad and morally-depraved mode.

But the season is more than that, exploring the \\"back story\\" of the characters as the show progresses. It includes a good mix of comedy, and intricately linked together mysteries. Season one comes as a set of 6 or 7 DVDs - each disc holds 4 episodes and some bonus material. Season one is basically about the crash on the island, and an introduction to the characters.

I could easily re watch it. This is a must own DVD set. I have managed to get many others hooked on it. I have only met one person who watched it and disliked it. His complaint was that it was too close toThe Bridge of San Luis Rey (Perennial Classics)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It pays off in the end.","review":"Although the first season is confusing and doesn't offer any real answers, once you finish the whole series, you can see how everything they do is for a reason and how the story truly comes together across all seasons. This is one not to miss. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start at least...","review":"This show started off really well. High drama, good acting, interesting subplots...Then it turned into a soap opera version of \\"Land of the Lost\\" - Where are the Sleestak when you need them? The way this show is spinning out of control, I bet that those scaly guys will make an appearance soon.I think that the problem with shows like this is that network television writers are'nt that talented. So even if you hand them a good idea, they'll eventually mess it up.The first few episodes are worth watching at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"I waited for the release of the DVD-set before watching LOST, and I have to say, I was smitten from the first second and could not stop watching this riveting series. The extras on this boxset are very interesting and shed some informative light on the creation of the series. GREAT ENTERTAINMENT"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little meandering but pretty good","review":"I enjoyed the first two disks the most. It seems like the writers got a little \\"Lost\\" themselves because they seemed to lose plot lines for a while and then pick them up after 5 or 6 episodes. It's a little frustrating because it feels like there is no resolution to anything in the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"a television classic","review":"If you haven't already joined the Lost movement, now's the time to catch up! No other show is so perfectly suited for DVD marathon viewings.

Cute looking cast thou."},{"rating":"2","title":"In top 3... possibly the best","review":"So, the first season of Lost is definitely in my top 3 for the past 10 years. No show since 24 changed the viewing experience like Lost, and with another same-channel hit, \\"Desperate Housewives\\", Lost is definitely a great show.DVD features do not dissapoint, but even better is the ability to watch the whole season without the need to wait for another week for a new episode. Granted, I got this at a cheaper price (still from Amazon.com) but I think this is one for the ages, and should be in any dvd collector's archives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this series!","review":"The final season was a waste. After the finale you'll be scratching your headed wondering why you wasted so many hours of your life with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not live up to its promises","review":"This first season of Lost was intriguing, and many of us became invested in watching the series, only to become disillusioned and soured over time. In retrospect, the flaws in Season 1 are now clear because they are repeated -- and only get worse -- in the next seasons.This series added mystery on top of mystery, question on top of question, new characters on top of old, until it just wore me out. Never gives any answers, and the plot never really moves forward -- which is apparent in the first season, if you look carefully.Don't get hooked! Don't waste your time! Save yourself while you still can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little better that others.","review":"Completely unrealistic film. Heroes of that film has fault all their challenges.

Maybe they will release an abridged version of this show at some point that puts everything interesting in the first 24 episodes into 6 or 7 episodes and doesn't waste my time.THANK GOD I DOWNLOADED THIS SHOW INSTEAD OF BUYING IT!!!I can't believe everyone is being played so easily! There's only so far that you can go with endless mysteries and fake tension before I get fed up. 24 episodes to open a metal hatch . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could","review":"I wish I could review this item, but I was charged for it and never got it.

Another example of Rip-Off Britain?Looking forward to seeing the whole 1 series as I am hooked and cannot wait to see the conclusion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost - Just Brilliant","review":"As we were only half way through the first series here in England, I couldn't wait and so bought the entire first season and must say, I wasn't disappointed. Everything about Lost is just great, the actors, the storylines, the special features on the DVD.Roll on the second series !"},{"rating":"2","title":"What you DIDN'T notice the FIRST time around...","review":"This set is a MUST for any LOST fan. If you are a true fan, you know that simply watching an episode ONCE is not nearly enough. There are so many details that are evident only upon a second review.I have especially enjoyed viewing episodes from the first season now that the second season has begun. Now that SOME of LOST's mysteries have been answered, it's great to view season 1 again to see how it all began.I only wish the extras had been a little more \\"behind-the-scenes\\" and info-oriented as opposed to what seemed to me as \\"Hollywood fluff\\". The details on how the plane crash and crash site were created, however, are NOT to be missed!Can't wait for season 2 to be out to be able to catch all the details of this wonderful series. This is TV at it's BEST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"Incredible series, incredible price...But why, oh why, this box set doesn't have spanish, french or other subtitles ? Not every U.S. resident, or amazon.com customer speaks english as a native language. Nor every boxset is sold only in the U.S.This isn't any TV series. This one deserves a better treatment. If you only knew how useful is for us (foreigners) having other language subtitles and dubbing options.I'd like to buy LOST with other language options. And I'm not the only one that thinks so... I'm far from being the only one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I was disapointed when I waited for almost a month for my movie. It ended up \\"Lost\\" in Hawaii. It was usps fault, not the dealer. I got a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it again for the first time...","review":"It is a fantastic show and watching it again, without advertisements breaking it up, was even more thrilling. You pick up connections you may have previously missed and if you love the cast now, wait until you see them in the special features. They are so funny and loveable. Great box set. I will buy the next season without hesitation"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY GRANDDAUGHTER (8) LOVES IT. FAVORITE TOY!","review":"My grandduaghter saw ad on tv and I got it for her.

She is an absolute dog fanatic so I thought this would be ideal since she is too young to care for a real dog. She was excited when she opened the gift since she had previously seen commercials selling it. Once we programmed it, there was not much to do with it except feed it a bone, measure it when it grows (once a day for 4 days), and brush it's short curly hair.I was hoping for it to be a little more interactive such as say things on its own or sing songs on its own. Basically, it only talks when you press the button on its head. I would recommend this toy for children that are of much younger age. It also shouldn't be priced this high!I wish I could return it since she played for it for about a day. Then she gave up with it and I could have used my money on something more educational and worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but frustrating without a usb cable","review":"Cute toy, but it was a huge problem Christmas day when there was no USB cable.

Granny that gave it to her has no idea what a usb cord is and didn't know to get one. For the price, would it kill them to include it?

It looked so cute and seemed like a really fun toy for a little girl. But be warned before you purchase..puppy grows and may not know your name! I put in the cd to program the puppy and my child's name was not there in any spelling variation. her name is gabrielle. not exactly an unusual name. no gabrielle, gabby, gabbie, gabe, gabriella, gabriel..nothing. But hey, if your name is genesis or apple or rhododendron, it's your lucky day! I'm not kidding. those names were on the list. needless to say, she was crying because we had to tell her that her name wasn't on the list.

Wrong! What could have been a compelling tale is botched up by the skilless jumps forward and backward in time. (Usually, if a good writer tells us at the outset what happens to one of the main characters -- in this case, a murder -- the subsequent description of things leading to up the the event are more interesting than the event itself. Not the case in this book). The historical framework of Guatemala is leaked in awkward places in the narrative, and the usage of Spanish-language phrases are often translated when they don't need to be, or not translated when they should be. I betcha Goldman will surprise us one day with a winner -- I think he has the core talent -- but this ain't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating -- draws you into the hearts of two cultures","review":"It was four years ago that I first read Goldman's first novel, and I still recommend it, still search for new books he has written.

I didn't think much of it until my mouse buttons started sticking or not working at all. A $5 mouse works better than this super expensive one. Earlier, I also found out this mouse will not work with black mousepads, even brand new mousepads. The mouse cursor stuttered and stopped while using it. You have to get a mousepad with textured colors. And when I first bought this thing the first thing I noticed was how heavy it is.

I like the ergonomic shape and the wireless capability. However, I threw them aside when my hands started to hurt from typing and mousing.

The mouse also takes some effort and is abnormally heavy for a mouse.Overall, I would not recommend buying this product because of the strain you will be putting on your hands and wrists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noobs keyboard","review":"Besides the akward key placemnets that other reviews pointed out I would add that the existing encryption for the keyboard is 64 bit. This static 64 bit key can be broken in minutes. There is even security advisory about this. Once key is broken everybody can see what you are typing in.At the bottom of the keyboard there are butterfly flaps that let you raise the keyboard. These flaps open to the right and left ( / \\\\ ). This one is no brainer. Everytime you move keyboard left or right one of these flaps closes and the keyboard colapses(yes, there is no way to lock the flaps).- No cap clock indicator on the keyboard.I did get it working in Unix (just for fun) with USB and PS2. However there is NO encryption support for Unix so I'm not sure why would you want to use it.I would NOT recomend that you get this keyboard. Its basic hardware design flaws, odd keyboard layout, and lack of security deserves only one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent keyboard - Wish it came with the trackman","review":"I'm buying my 3rd Logitech Cordless Duo Pro/Comfort Duo, not because they wear out, because once you get used to it you'll refuse to switch back.

My only wish was that it came with the Cordless Trackman. I have to buy it separately but it works off the same receiver or you could use it in addition to the mouse.I'd like to address some of the other comments:Yes, the keyboard feet do collapse but I just whittled and glued some feet on it to my personal angle.So they changed the \\"standard\\" layout of the keyboard buttons, once you get used to it all the other keyboards are \\"wrong.\\" It's just a matter of what you're familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ergonomic feel","review":"We ordered these for use with our notebook computers.

I find that I DO like the instrumentals in \\"I'm Beginning to See the Light\\", and Barrows does an adequate job with the rest of the albums content.

I was looking for a biography that would conncentrate on his work, what technical, scientific, human, political obstacles he faced developing all the rockets and the Saturn rockets in particular, what tradeoffs he faced, what were the key challenges, etc. There is practically nothing in this book on this topic.

The description for this movie is completely innacurate, and I'm absolutely perplexed as to why the British Broadcast Corporation would ban this. I wish that I could meet the director of this defilement of cinema, simply to spit in his face and demand my hard-earned money back.Reading this, I am absolutely sure that Amazon will not post this review, and it is likely the first and last time that you will ask me to post a review. But it is good to let you know that I just paid you for absolute putrescence.Aside from this purchase, and other than the order that I have been waiting almost one year for, all of my other orders have come in a timely fashion and have proved quite enjoyable for me. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Italian and ignorant","review":"As an Italian-American I found this book to be patently offensive. The author takes every opportunity to slander and defame the Italian people making snide remarks as often as possible. His view of Italian immigrants reminded me of reading Jacob Riis with its turn-of-the-century ignorance. Crocker also does not seem to have a good grasp of Irish Catholic history and has an obvious bent toward mother England. Perhaps that's his Anglican background shining through. It's obvious this book has an agenda and I specifically don't recommend it for the impressionable recent convert for this reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something good about the Church","review":"As a convert from Lutheranism, I found the book most enjoyable and an eye-opener into the Catholic view of the Reformation.

Finally something uplifting about The True Faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"Triumph was excessively opinionated and poluted by its overuse of emotionally charged adjectives.

The description of the Church's reaction to slavery in the South seems to suggest that slavery wasn't such a bad thing, after all.My suggestion: stop reading it once the 19th Century arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice narrative, misleading history.","review":"This book's author is a convert to Roman Catholicism, and the book reads like it: while a \\"cradle Catholic\\" [sic] would take a balanced approach to Roman Catholicism, weighing the bad with the good, Crocker provides a crock, er, a heavily weighted apologia for Roman Catholicism. Especially interesting is his discussion of the break with the Orthodox, wherein a position that never had been doctrinal before suddenly becomes the measure of \\"true\\" Christianity, and Crocker finds this perfectly reasonable!If you are a committed Roman Catholic who does not know much about the history of Christianity, this book's bias will not bother you and its cheerleading will appeal; otherwise, try a different title (say, Gregory Palamas's _The Triads_)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written Catholic propaganda; deserves ZERO stars","review":"If you want something that alternately whitewashes or ignores every evil act commited by the Roman Catholic Church over the past two millenia while at the same time marginalizes and insults a host of non-Catholic faiths and historical figures, then this is the book for you.

TRIUMPH is a complete load of cow dung."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome and inspiring history of the one true church","review":"This is one the best books i've read in a long, long time! I would recommend it to everyone with even a passing interest in the history of the Catholic church. It takes the reader on a journey from the days immediatly after the death and resurection of Christ until the papacy of John Paul II. It is written in a very easy to read style and is thouroghly addictive, once you start you will find it hard to put down. It is totally politically incorrect and unapologetic in tone and has a dim view of protestants and modernism.

However, every rule has an exception and in this case Triumph is that exception.In punchy prose Crocker surveys the history of the impact of the Catholic Church on human history. A convert, he not surprisingly finds that impact to be positive. This book is a useful contrast to a torrent of recent books written by bitter ex-catholics, de facto if not de jure, that pillory the Church for having standards that differ from those contained in the latest editorials of the New York Times.Considering the dearth of readable books on the subject, this book should be considered by every Catholic parent as must reading for themselves and their kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glorious Triumph Indeed","review":"This is a fantastic book, Its also an enjoyable read, I smiled and laughed aloud, while reaading it. Its a great history of the Church and Christianity. It's like reading about your grand parents and finding out they had such a difficult & adventurous but love & fun filled life. As I read it I fell in Love with the Church all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and surprisingly fun reading","review":"This sweeping history is well-written and laden with humor, which makes it an enjoyable book to read. Crocker's broadsides on Protestantism and its supposed effects on the world are, I think, a bit overblown, and he glosses over the corruption in the Church that gave fuel to the Reformation. His history is, nonetheless, probably one of the more balanced accounts to have come out in awhile. This is an excellent book to get an historic overview of what may be the most influential institution of the past two millenia."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"the book began with an even handed introduction to the Church until the beginning of the reformation era. at that point the author began to use words like 'toadies' 'fissiparous' and other value laden phrases that detracted from the subject matter. i had expected a clear exposition of the history of the Church, not a polemic against protestantism and its progeny. for the record i am a committed Catholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyperbolic Nonsense","review":"The Catholic Information Center of Washington DC recommends \\"Triumph\\" on its impressive Lifetime Reading Plan list so when I saw it at the bookstore I had no reservations about it being reliable \\"history.\\" For the sake of its own credibility, the CIC should remove this book immediately. I should've paid more attention to the back cover which touts Crocker as being a former political speech writer and that explains much. Crocker's history is fast-paced, exciting and pure hyperbolic nonsense! In the first half of the book, he blames everything on the Eastern Orthodox Church and the second half on those schismatic reformers who had nothing better to do than challenge the glorious authority those noble Romans. This book should be an embarrassment to the CIC, or anyone else who claims to seek the truth. The only thing that prevents me from giving this one star is that Crocker should be given credit for spinning a good yarn."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a biased book!!!!!!!!!","review":"The book is good but completely bent toward the conservative end. I believe that to be truly 'Catholic' you must be represent all sides and be truly in the middle. This book shows only one side - and totally a conservative side - which is not really 'Catholic' according to canon law (I have a master's in theology and pastoral studies from a seminary) I am sorry but it is not 'in the middle' of Catholcism but an extreme! Read it with care!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is an outrage. Not only is Mr. Crocker's history flawed and out of date (still blames Nero for burning Rome) his references are distorted and taken out of context. He refers to Protestantism as heresy, a moronic inferno, and barbaric. He equates Luther with Hitler and the reformation with the Khmer Rouge. He says Calvin invented the police state and calls him a democrat, as if it were some kind of a vile epithet. Even Catholics are rebuked for the \\"disastrous results\\" of the Vatican II reforms.A Catholic friend gave this book to me. I have never been so offended. Not recommended for ecumenical dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasent Surpirse.","review":"The book does provide a valuable and entertaining sketch of the history of the Catholic Church and Europe over the last 2,000 years. However the overt bigotry of the author is reminiscent of Rush Limbaugh. I am a devout Catholic, however I (unlike the author) believe that many non-Catholics will end up in Heaven!The author has completely missed the point of Vatican II and his partial distortion of Humanae Vitae is disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Chinese junk","review":"This lasted a few months before failing.The timer only runs for 7 minutes at full range.

I'm demoralized. It broke in exactly the same way: when the timer reaches the 'off' position instead of 'dinging' and stopping it keeps going on round to the 'on' position. This flaw almost set my kitchen on fire. Maybe there's a timer out there that doesn't break easily, but this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"wow. this was just an excellant book. kept me wanting to read on. it really was a good choice. i highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Listen To","review":"Do NOT buy this recording. The recording quality of this set is so bad that I threw it away after struggling through most of one CD. GALA opera CDs are \\"hit or miss\\", and this one is the worst. It is literally the worst recorded sound I have ever heard commercially released. The whole thing sounds like someone shouting down a pipe. It's a shame because the cast has some excellent singers, but you wouldn't know it from this recording. GALA should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording. Look elsewhere.","review":"This recording sounds like someone snuck a cheap cassette recorder into the theater, took his seat in the upper balcony, and recorded the performance while hiding the recorder under his coat. The orchestra sounds like it is off in the far distance, and the voices can barely be heard.This set was so bad that I didn't even try to resell it. I just threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money on this badly recorded set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top rate cast but one of the worst opera recordings ever","review":"Cast is great with Gedda sailing all over the place with high D's. Recording is horrible with what sounds live severe reverb and done far away from the stage. Recording sounds like the Act 1 duet in Boheme where the soprano and tenor turn their backs during the recording to get the effect of being very distant. By third cd I threw the whole set out the car window. Buy the Opera d'oro set or the Pavarotti. The best set is the old Cetra set which has been rereleased on a reissue label with Filippeschi or the other one with Gianni Raimondi. The Filippeschi is about 1952 but is even far superior to the Pavarotti version where Pavarotti is out of his element. It is too bad as this label usually has top rate casts and recording. This is a clunker of the first order. This is one of those operas which require a first rate cast due to the technical demands.

It features Pimp C, and it is really and truly a pretty tight album. Tracks 1, 2, 3, and 10 are my favorites.

It features all of the stereo recordings that Anderson made of his music, except for his Christmas arrangements. Nobody could capture the whimsy and excitement of Leroy Anderson's music like the composer. 8 Anderson pieces are available only on this 2 CD set which has 47 diferent pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game, terrible build quality","review":"The game itself is great fun, but this particular presentation is awful. This is a faux-antique box with very cheap parts that fall apart pretty quickly. The dowel holding the tiles is bendy and spins freely: often you will accidentally flip down 3 or 4 tiles at once instead of just the one you wanted. The box is much deeper than others and can be difficult to see into to read the dice, especially when they're against the side. This also means it is not really possible for more than one or two people to watch. The chain tends to get caught up in the tiles when closing. The label on the inside of the lid is glued in and wrinkled. Overall it is a cheaply made game and there seem to be much better choices available for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"The picture makes it look like you are getting something nice ... you are not.

Where other hardhouse Dj's such as venom and Irene make boomy interesting tracks that make you wanna jump out of your seat, this album seems so uninspired. And like the other reviews said its good on subs, sure but it doesnt make my trunk rattle like some of the other stuff Ive heard. The tracks almost sound as if he just put the records on the platter and left them to play, not much in the creative sense.

Nor am I that big on any other spanish or latin music. All I can say for sure, is that Luna Nueva is a great cd. Very interesting rythems ,amazingly melodic, with songs ranging from very slow tempos to excelent spanish flamenco-like roller coasters. I don't know exactly what kind of music this is, I just know is its a wonderful, beuatiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoiding the \\"sophomore slump\\"","review":"This is the second album from Rosana, an amazingly talented musician and songwriter. For those unfamiliar with her, I highly recommend her first album, \\"Lunas Rotas\\" before getting this one. That said, she continues her poetry on this album with some phenomenal songs, but this is not the type of album you want to listen to from beginning to end, as was her first. The best songs are \\"Ya No Siento\\", \\"Dunas de Poemas\\", \\"Sonrie\\", \\"Si Yo Fuera Tu Amante\\" y \\"Navidad\\", a Caribbean-style Christmas carol not actually listed on the album. The remaining songs tend to venture into unknown territory for Rosana, and it loses a lot in the attempt. Nonetheless, she will continue to strike a cord with her haunting lyrics that seem so human, yet so eloquent. In short, I recommend this album, but with the understanding that the first is far superior. Let's hope for a third album soon that will surpass these first two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosana's first was much better","review":"I have both Rosana's Cd's and think that her second , lunas nuevas was a far cry from her Lunas Rotas.

He got this garage/car wash for his birthday, and we have had no problems with it. The car lift seems to work pretty easily for him and the gas hose hasn't broken off as was the experience of some other reviewers. My son loves to connect the many Little People toys he has together and create a city or town with them, and this is one of many that connects together. My only complaint is that when you get a lot of these items, they take up a ton of room. This is a smaller set, but beware the collection habit, as we've now got two oversized bins overflowing with Little People sets, and he still covets several more sets.

You cannot imagine a sweeter love story than this one: there's pure joy in the union of the lovely, compassionate Louise, cousin to King Louis XIV, and the handsome, attentive Antoine, second in command to that same King.The story being told here, and many of the characters, is factual. The author has carefully researched, and artfully presented a history of the forebears of the legendary Davy Crockett, of whom author Jennifer Lynn Cary is a direct descendent. Having read this one, I can hardly wait for the next book in the series, set in an England that I bet will be just as hostile to the Protestant group as France ever was. What an easy, entertaining way to absorb a bit of neglected history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating Story","review":"My favorite books to read are those that draw me into the story in a way that makes me feel as if I know the characters personally. Jennifer does an excellent job of this in The Huguenot. I found myself anxiously turning the page in anticipation of what would happen to Antoine and Louise next. I laughed, cried and shared the joy of their love and their story. I felt as if I had been transported to Versaille as Jennifer's descriptions drew me further into the scene. I not only got a glimpse of French history and the ancestry of Davy Crockett, but I got to enjoy a captivating love story that has me anticipating the next chapter in the life of the Crockett ancestors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bed Rails","review":"This is another great product that we have come to expect from Putco.

Its description was good but I found the book to be painfully basic and not practically useful for any grade level.

There isn't a track on this album that I dislike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Town Hero Rocks","review":"Hometown Hero is the post-grunge alt rock answer! Combinding elements of Pop-Punk, Emo, Grunge, and their roots of hardcore, they make for an excellent listen. Straight out of the Southern California emo-punk scene, they are influenced, but different then the rest. Sweet ballads, and catchy sing along choruses make them really worthwhile.

Normally I am more of a punk rock, emo, ska listener, but after I heard some HTH I was HOOKED.Ok, now I'll just say that if you have a girlfriend all you guys out there this is definately an album worth purchasing. Songs like \\"Bleeds In Blue\\" and \\"Eighteen\\" blend in perfectly on this cd to slow it up a little and therefore produce a somewhat romantic environment shortly after a rockin' fun environment while in your car taking her to a movie or wherever..trust me its a great feeling when the music makes a mood the girl loves and music you love!

It also makes me thankful I can save them fifteen dollars and forty-five minutes of their life. The album art looked promising enough, the four band members portrait silhouette against varying shades of orange resembling a sunset. HTH's sound is no different than Nickelback, Lifehouse, or The Calling, or any other alt-rock act trying to milk a major record deal for all the exposure it's worth. For what it's worth the singles are \\"Questions,\\" and \\"Eighteen\\" which sounds to be a little bit out of Weezer's songbook.

BOO YAH!","review":"First off, Home Town Hero's self titled debut is definitely one of the best albums i have listened in 2002. With tracks like 'Questions' that make you wanna pound your head and wave your fists in a fit of rage with its hard rock appeal and extremely catchy melody ...to 'Everything Out Of Water'--a softer ballad packed with insightful lyrics and hypnotizing tunes, this cd has deemed itself as flawless. It has remained in my cd player for over a month and continues to be played often. VERY often. I enjoy this cd so much that i'm peeing in my pants trying to explain how awesome it is...but I can't--you would have to take a listen for yourself. To sum things up, Home town hero is one kick arse rock-pop band to watch out for in 2002 and upcoming years.

I love their lyrics and the diversity of their music, like how they can go from hardcore to soft in a couple seconds. Run Right Through is the best song on this cd, and Bleeds in Blue too.

What a rotten toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy--Waste of Money","review":"THIS DOLL IS HORRIBLE, so for all the Moms that are searching for the ethnic version of the doll, don't waste your time or money. My 8 year old is a doll lover, and was very excited and surprised to receive this doll as a Christmas gift. On Christmas Day we spent several hours trying to make this doll live up to expectations, and that NEVER happened. The tedious directions on holding the doll at certain angles and trying to make her work takes ALL of the fun out of the doll. Honestly, after about 3 hours, she gave up and tossed it aside. We are going to return it ASAP.

I never got my doll to eat the special food etheir!!! All the food ever did was run straight out of her mouth and that got annoying!!!!! There were not enough diapers ethier with how much water runs out of her after you feed her!!! I used the potty for her after she soaked through that one diaper that she came with!!!!After I fed my baby born doll and she used the potty the potty would over flow and soak evrything!!! Mine never squeaked ethier cried mabye after ten bottles cried only two times!!! I would not reccomend this doll to anyone!! I am ten. If it was difficult for a ten year old to clean out then it would be twice as hard for a three year old to clean this doll out!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I got this doll for my 6yr old daughter for Christmas. She wanted a baby that cried & wet it's diaper. It does wet it's diaper, but you have to hold it just right when you SQUEEZE the water in it's mouth or it just spills out. I haven't even tried to mess with the food since the water is not easy to get down it. Then in order to get it to cry, you have to squeeze the arm SOOO hard that my daughter can't even get it to work. I barely can. I guess the educational part of that is if you squeeze a REAL baby's arm that hard, yes it will cry!! The other arm you squeeze to make it \\"squeak\\" again, too hard to squeeze. The only bonus I see to this doll is that you can take it in the bath wich my daughter does. She doesn't really play with it otherwise, so it was an expensive bath toy. If it had not been for the fact that it came from \\"Santa\\" I would have promptly returned it & let her select another doll. VERY DISAPOINTED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I bought this doll for my 7 year old daughter. I feel it was not worth the money at all. My daughter got very frustrated with it. The doll does not sit on the potty correctly, when you give a bottle the water drips out of the mouth, you had to position it a certain way to feed it or even see a tear. It is not a doll for a younger child. You will have to do everything for them. After a week my daughter said this should not be called baby born, it should be called \\"Baby Boring\\". Save your money, this doll is in the back of the closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I've never written a review before this, but I was so dissapointed when I got this doll, I had to write one. I wanted my 2 year old to have a baby that pees on the potty because I thought it may help with potty training. If you want the baby to pee, you have to feed it the bottle while it's sitting on the potty because the water runs right through it. The baby is also hard, not soft and cuddly. As for the other functions, the other reviewers are correct, I haven't seen a tear, or heard a cry yet. Maybe it would be better for an older child. My neighbor's child got Baby Annabell, which seems so much nicer. It's softer, it cries, it burps, etc. I feel I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it........ exept for one thing","review":"hi my name is Alyssa. im almost 12 years old. i wrote a review for this doll on November 13 of last year. finally got the doll, but i have one problem. i know you have to hold her vertically to feed her, but almost every time i feed her water will run out of her mouth. i hold her vertically, but it doesnt work. every other function works fine. i love this doll, and babys dribble anyway! so i guess i'll live!

I bought this for my 4yr. old who wanted a doll for tub, feeding and potty. The doll must be positioned just right to do any of the functions and is, in general, awkward to use and clean. Since there are resevoirs in the doll you must clean it out after it has been in tub or pool. If the doll is for a younger child there is definitely maintenance required on the parents' part. Because of the functionality rules, I find myself feeding and changinging the doll more than my daughter. Yes, I like playing with my daughter but the idea with a doll is for the child to be the \\"mommy\\"or \\"daddy.\\" Maybe this is best for a child over 6 or 7?"},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Fringe is a lot of work.","review":"This is an excellent book.

There is some discussion of a previous suicide attempt, but no reasons for her behavior were discussed. One can only assume that she had a bi-polar personality, but perhaps it was something else.There should have been more depth to the characters in the movie.Paltrow went way overboard, in my opinion, in a classic example of overacting in practically every scene. On top of that, the music was so loud most of the time that the dialog could not be heard above the din.A bad production, and a poor screenplay. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Piece of Junk","review":"This film is not very good and doesnt give a decent description to the banal writer, Plath, played with unmotivated response by Paltrow. Somehow the director, who is a woman, never chooses to give us passion or even any amount of interest in the topic at hand, the matter of fact presentation is dull and the climax is expected. So she killed herself and, well, the director rolls the credits and nothing is ever satisfied inside the viewer's mind......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough momentum","review":"The movie \\"Sylvia\\" was a case of excellent actors doing the best possible with a \\"not excellently paced script\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Shouldn't Have Proceeded without the Poetry","review":"Sylvia Plath is one of the great female poets of all time, in league with Sappho, Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Sexton, and the underrated Louise Gluck. \\"Ariel\\" may be the finest book of poems by a woman EVER, vivid, dark, trilling, grisly, and gorgeous. That book, her last, is available in a lovely new hardbound with previous drafts and interesting information.Get that, rather than this film, because the filmmakers were barred from quoting very much of her poetry or excerpting lines from her best novel \\"The Bell Jar,\\" and without her powers of the written word on display, we don't know why a movie about Sylvia Plath would even be made.All we have is a dysfunctional woman succumbing to suicidal depression. Poets' lives are seldom impressive; it's their work we remember! See \\"As Night Falls\\" for a much better example of a poet bio-pic; it has a far more interesting plot and is soaked in the man's vibrant poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat portrait of Sylvia Plath","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing a movie about the life and death of the famous Sylvia Plath, but I found this movie to be ultimately unsatisfying. I guess one major problem I have with it is that it does not show her life in New York City which ultimately became the basis for THE BELL JAR, her most compelling work. Although I liked the reading of her poems throughout the movie, the focus on her life with Ted Hughes I didn't like. Ted Hughes was the last influence in her life; she had many major influences before she met him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"I was really looking forward to the release of Sylvia, after having read the Bell Jar and Rough Magic, the biography of her life. After I watched the dvd I was very disappointed. They never really focused on her childhood, which I felt was a big part of what led to her mental illness and eventually her suicide. I was left feeling that something was missing. I know Sylvia Plath's family didn't give permission for the film to use any of her poetry, which kept people from knowing what a gifted and talented poet and writer she was. A really sad portray of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful-Read the Book Instead","review":"I thought this film was dreadful. Thank goodness Plath's daughter had the sense and premonition to refuse to let the producers use the poet's work in this trite film. What was the point? To see Plath put her head in the oven? To re-play tiresome cliches (the sexual symbolism in this film is sophomoric)over and over? Paltrow is an actress of little depth who clearly has no insight into Plath's character or intelligence and can only play her like a wounded ingenue-how disappointing. Hearing her \\"read\\" two lines of Sylvia Plath's poetry made me want to laugh out loud. Really, avoid this and read any of the biographies available or, better yet, Sylvia's letters, poetry or diaries. I'm amazed to see the good reviews for this film on Amazon-it's one of the worst I've seen recently and really does a dis-service to Sylvia Plath's talent and complex, if troubled, personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of my way Mama, there's a fire somewhere!","review":"My daughter got this firetruck and the dump truck from her nephew and she loves playing with both!

As far as I'm concerned, Pleasantville is his best work to date. Newman did an excellent job in referencing tv music from the 50's, as well as just composing some of the most beautiful movie music ever. 'Real Rain', 'The Mural', and 'A New Day' are some of the best tracks on the CD. He also does a fine job composing music for the few serious or menacing cues in the movie. My only complaint is that this CD is quite short. One track is only 15 seconds long. But then again, I don't recall them leaving anything out, so I guess I can't complain too much. However, just for the sheer beauty of the music, this CD is worth the buy.

So, how well does he interpret scripture for a place that is often difficult to imagine? He is careful to anchor every musing to a scriptural mooring and delineate what is written there v. what he conjectures.This factual, painstaking question-and-answer format is breath-taking in its scope and soaring in its hope. Nearly every question you have about heaven is addressed, and the answer is often very different from common, but misconceived, ideas of what the life to come will be like.Far from being a boring, wispy and disembodied existence, the bible's teaching about heaven describes living in resurrected bodies with the resurrected Christ on a resurrected earth. Imagine a place that encompasses all the beauty we know, and multiplies it many-fold, beyond all of our desires.

He has put it all together and made it easier to understand. Jesus Christ spoke more about Hell than He did about Heaven because it was Hell He wanted us to avoid at all costs. This book has given me a calmer view of my life and death to come. It has also reminded me how important it is to share it with as many people as possible. If you've already read this book, then you know that it would make a comforting gift to someone that has lost a loved one to death or a person will a terrible illness or someone that needs to know Jesus Christ.

It is very mind opening and inspirational. However the author gets redundant and toward the end I'm amazed at how many ways and times he can say basically the same thing.Also some of the scriptures he uses I'm pretty sure are talking about the 1000 year reign of Christ like Isaiah 11 6-9. If read the similar chapter of Isaiah 65 17-25 it's easy to see that the verses are not talking about a time when people live forever. Though I suppose the verses describing a perfect world could in part be a applied to the eternal paradise.Still a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and comforting!","review":"From wondering what \\"in the world\\" I'd be doing for eternity in Heaven, to praising God for His beyond-wonderful plan for our eternity, Alcorn's book, \\"Heaven\\" has addressed every question I've ever had about Heaven.

Although it sounds logical as written (especially because scripture is often quoted as proof), one must assume that his biblical interpretations (and, indeed, that Christianity is the only way to go) are accurate. In some cases, the interpretations are at best arguable (which means the conclusions are as well). If you like considering a very different opinion than what is traditionally taught, this will be a fascinating book. And for me, it was indeed fascinating until it became clear that the more assumptions (and conclusions) that were made, the bigger house of cards this became. And while I am not at all a traditionalist (i.e. just because it is tradition does not mean it is right), and while I enjoyed the head scratching this caused me, I just could not go the next step and believe all this. Oh well. It was a good exercise anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on Heaven I've ever read","review":"He spent 25 years in research for this.

Perhaps Alcorn is an authority on the subject--albeit a self-proclaimed one--but I simply found his concept of heaven too far out to do proper justice to the subject. Besides, who among us can write a definitive study of the subject? I do not recommend this book to anyone. I think Mr. Alcorn needs to revise his concept of mankind's eternal home and then, if he simply must do so, approach his subject from an entirely different perspective. But I will say that I admire the time and effort that went into the writing of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent take on Heaven","review":"This is a very good book. It is a little bit of a slow read at first, but uses Scripture well and is so encouraging about Heaven, that it really makes you want to get on with it and be there.

The book quotes many passages from the bible to make it's point, but I believe that you could make any point from the bible by selecting the quotes that suite your need.

If only the author could see the naturalness and necessity of death books like this wouldn't be necessary. This is the height of Fundamentalist Christian dribble. Having said all of this, it is pretty entertaining.

If you want yet another scholarly fantasy that attempts to balance Scripture with \\"what ifs,\\" this is the book for you. \\"Will there be seasons on the New Earth? Why wouldn't there be?\\" There's a danger in placing too much confidence in books like this. If it gives you comfort, great.

It does make you appreciate this life more and look forward to Heaven.

The tools themselves were disappointing, They were obviously very cheaply made and the edge they came with was clearly something I would have to work hours on to get a mediocre edge at best.

I pity someone who develops an interest in wood carving and starts out with this set. They are very poorly ground and as far as I can tell they are made of poor quality metal. I am a seasoned wood carver that can never have too many chisels and gouges. I thought if they were ground poorly, I could regrind them to make tools for special applications. However, the metal is soft, so there is no good reason to do anything with them. Compared to well known carving tools (Swiss Made, old Buck Brothers, etc.) and these are far softer. I question if they are hardened at all. New wood carvers would be far better off with one decent quality chisel than a whole set of these.Disclaimer: I bought these from a seller on eBay for almost nothing, so I should not complain too much.

Words cannot describe what seeing Sarah B. live is like and it was more than worth every penny I spent and every mile I traveled! I could not wait to get home to order this DVD! I've already rated it a 5 (even though I have not actually seen the DVD) because I saw her in a smaller arena with a smaller crowd. The people there last night knew who they were there to see and it was one of the best concert crowds I've been in. She got a long standing ovation after Nessun Dorma and that was in the middle of the show...AWESOME performance. If you are not sure about the DVD, go see Sarah B. live and see how quickly you rush home to buy it just to try to relive the whole experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone","review":"I bought this DVD after seeing Ms. Brightman on a special and great program on PBS with Andrea Bocelli over the 4th of July program a number of years ago and enjoying her singing on \\"the Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection\\" CD that I enjoy so much.I found everything on this DVD to be excessive. The endless pomp with no circumstance led me to listen to it rather than watch it and to tell the truth, her voice was clear but totally expressionless. There was voice but no interpretation and no quality. I know that concerts need to be visual but the music must come first and I am more than dispointed with the totality of the DVD. The need for one outlandish outfit per song leads to a lot of dead air and shrill music between minor vocalizing. This is a lady with talent but it is not (repeat not) demonstrated here. Seek better examples of her work elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lip-synched again?","review":"I was so very much disappointed with her previous dvd album \\"One Night in Eden\\" because it was lip-synched and I couldn't feel any real concert feel.

In true Las Vegas fashion, her show had a very dark stage and was continuously pumped full of smoke. The result? Video that is filled with \\"noise\\" and without detail. You have to go back to the early 1980's to equal this quality of video.Poor Sarah, a beautiful women, had her face heavily made up around the eyes, to the point of looking like a freak in most scenes. Frightening to look at. Her DVD cover is not part of the show. They wouldn't dare!The audio is okay but use it as background music vs. sitting there trying to view this DVD.If you want to see Sarah in full brilliance, then purchase Andrea Bocelli's Live in Tuscany (Blu-Ray). Then you'll see the classy Sarah and not a circus clown.It's obvious that Sarah allowed the Las Vegas \\"handlers\\" to \\"make her up\\" to suit the LV crowd.

When you get to the well full of water people say, no, don't drink it. You think if you dont get that darn water your gonna die! That's the urge to self harm!

The instructions caution against the use of a flame above medium except for boiling water; but the pan will not sear and caramelize food quickly at these temperatures. So it isn't a wok experience. As for boiling water, it is not efficient for boiling water unless in small quantities. The lid is heavier than the pan; I can hang the pan on a hook; but in my kitchen, am at a loss for a good place to store the 14\\" lid conveniently.

I did not want a non stick finish as when heated too hot they produce fumes that can be toxic to pet birds.I purchased this Cusinart Stainless 14 inch stir fry. It is a great pan. It is good looking, large so you can cook a lot of food in it. It is extremely easy to clean. It comes with a nice glass lid. It is also light weight.

Realized while the family was happily gobbling the foods down, also took along those chemical elements into our bodies. Then I found Cuisinart 14\\" stainless steel wok when I shopped around for an idea wok. I've had this wok for over a month now. I'm practically impressed. It transfers heat very well, gives adequate heat to do crisp stir fry vegetable dishes. The 14\\" diameter gives plenty of space to cook for 4 people. I especially like how easy it is to clean. I can scrub it as hard as I want to with soapy water, and don't worry about take the synthetic coat off or the wok will become rusty later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't yet figured out what to use it for.","review":"I bought this stir fry pan to help with cooking Chinese cuisine, have used it to cook, deep fry and stir fry but not impressed with any of it.

Cooking items takes so long since it is not recommended to cook items on high, low - medium heat for best cooking results. Was looking for a wok, this is definitely not the product that I was looking for. There are actually two things that I am disappointed about one- is the name brand, usually stands for good product, huge disappointment here.

The construction is exactly what she was looking for - a pan big enough to do stir fry dishes, yet light enough that cooking wasn't like a workout. As previous reviews have stated the lid is heavy in comparison to the pan, so just don't use it :) - would recommend cuisinart change lid to same construction as pan. Some hot spots can occur if used on too high a heat, just takes some getting used to the way it heats/cooks.

They spent more time showing the scientists reacting to marine life (such intelligent comment such as \\"awesome!\\") than the marine life itself. The director should have realized that viewers aren't watching the movie to look at the scientists or watch the scientists photograph each other in their vehicles - we want to look at the marine life.

There is more emphasis on special effects and hypothesis of life on other planets than seeing the real \\"Aliens\\". Sure, thousands of shrimp piled around a volcanic vent is kind of cool, and that fish with two feet-like appendages is unusual, but other than a large translucent jellyfish, there's not much here. All the younger scientists look and talk like actors and the technology of going deep in clear bubble-like compartments is amazing, but it all seems too staged. The extras are interesting only in that they go into more depth about the crew and the machinery. I would recommend this perhaps, on a large 3D screen, but don't bother for the home theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to see it more than once","review":"to capture all of the things that you will see.I sat down and before I knew it the movie was over.

To see life that exists without photosynthesis makes me believe that being close to a star has less to do with life than we have been willing to admit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"There's actually very little deep sea footage in this movie. There was more discussion of life elsewhere in the Solar System. While sitting around discussing alien life is fun, I would rather they focused on deep sea life. I would also have prefer it if they had taken a Marine Biologist, instead of an Astrobiologist (yea, that's a usefull profession). Frankly, this played like an after school special. There's very little here of interest, and one can do much better watching PBS. Watching the extended version only prolongs the pain.

Its like listening to tourists who have no idea whats going on, but enthuiastic none the less.I guess the most annoying thing though is at the start of the movie it goes on about the Sun being the source of all life on Earth, yet during the movie we are shown the Black Smokers, where the energy for life is entirely derived from chemosynthesis, and not photosynthesis. Its a complete contradiction to what was said before.

Instead, I got a patronizing, self-centered tour of the team who did the dive, with maybe 10 to 15 minutes of actual deepsea life forms added just to keep us hoping for more. Add to that the assumptions about life on other planets, and the science-fiction bit at the end, I have to say that this was a waste of time and money.

Taped a plastic straw to reach the bottom but pump, even w/new batteries, is so weak it will not pump any air below 1/2 bottle depth. Filled wine bottle w/water, added a bit of sawdust, shook to mix, then tried aerator w/new batteries. The sawdust circulated vverrrrry slowly and only in the top half of the bottle. A decent design concept that should work well with a more powerful pump that could really bubble a substantial volume of air to the bottom of a bottle. This one is junk. I've sent it back and am awaiting a refund. Get a decanter aerator and swirl your wine a few times over 10 minutes for a decent, fast airing.

The items that I have used so far work VERY well for me, they scrape and cut and gouge very nicely. They are sharp and strong and I like the handle.

Hard to label this one...comedy..drama...and a big-time suprise ending that any great thriller would be proud of...wow..I just didn't expect THAT! This is a really cool movie. A little heavier than Costner's usual light romantic comedy, but he's still at his best in these type of roles...Interesting and unusual movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Upside of Anger","review":"Let me start with what is good about this movie. Very well acted by great actors, great atmosphere, great scenery. What completely turned me off about this movie was the utter self indulgence, self pitying mother who thinks of no one but herself and doesn't even attempt to be the least bit strong for her children. WARNING PLOT SPOILER COMING UP! STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW! The whole basis of this movie turns on her husband leaving her. My only question at the end was, how long was he still alive in that hole while she was wallowing in self-pity. Maybe I am biased by having a mother that would have tried to keep herself together when delivering news about a sick sibling. Or possibly, if my husband suddenly went missing I would actually try to find out what happened to him before I assumed he left me for another woman. Two hours I will never get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL MOVIE!","review":"I first viewed this several years ago and since I saw it I have yearned to own it. Well I finally bought it and the movie is just Grade-A first class acting. It's very estrogen-driven but it's very interesting to watch Joan Allen as she is troubled by her husband leaving and then the incredible twist at the end makes you realize that sometimes being angry (especially when you don't know the entire truth) can be somewhat of a luxury.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"deserves a slap","review":"Only another drunk would put up with the nasty attitude and cruel behavior of our \\"heroine\\". A long running ad for Bud. This cannot be redeemed by good actors. It made me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"This movie features Joan Allen as a woman whose husband has left her. She drowns herself in booze and anger and leaves her four daughters in exasperated confusion as she flounders around trying to make sense of a new life without her husband. As her daughters are going through important passages in their lives, she continues on her bitter way, showing little support for their hopes and dreams. Her only solace is her next-door neighbor, a former professional baseball player (Kevin Costner) who offers her companionship and understanding. The movie seems to have an identity crisis and has moments of comedy, drama, and darkness which alternate in no particular order and for no particular purpose. I spent the first 3/4 of the movie trying to decide where it was going and the last part, marveling at the ill-advised twist at the end. The acting was good, but the writing and plot were not and the results were very unsatisfying for this viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Upside of Anger","review":"The Upside of Anger~ Joan Allen is a misnomer for this picture as it should have been called the upside of tedium. The movie is supposedely under 2 hours but it sure feels like one is watching it for 2 weeks, months or even years. Kevin Costner is ok in his role but the rest of the cast seemingly mail in their performances. The story line is alright but implodes at the end and the ending is kind of lame and predictable. It is strange to say this since Costner sure has made his sure of really bad and horrid movies over the years, but he is the star of this mediocre flick and prevents me from giving it one star. I was espcially perplexed that Keri Russel does such a lame job but the character that she was given was also paper thin so she did what she could with a bad part. This movie is tedious, boring, long and lame but still not so bad that it gets one star, but two stars is just what it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film","review":"I don't profess to be a film buff so I can't critique really well. But I do feel like this is a film that was overlooked by a lot of people somehow and it deserved more. The story has stayed with me and I think in a large part that is due to the spectacular performance by the cast. There is not a weak link present. I was pleasantly surprised by Keri Russell (I'd dismissed her as the Felicity girl), especially. If you have not watched this film, please give it a shot. I'm going to add it to my personal DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"This is an odd choice for me, as I usually avoid Kevin Costner, unless it's to make a snide comment about Waterworld. But who doesn't? Anyway, he's really good in this movie, perhaps because he's not being Kevin Costner. Kind of a morbid romantic comedy - recommended. Recommended to me by another friend who's movie opinions I trust - otherwise I never would have rented this one on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the newly single woman!!!","review":"Love, love, love this movie. I saw it in the theater just after my husband moved out. I had no idea what it was about, I picked it for the stars.

It is truly awful, the acting, the plot, the characters, there is nothing here. The only good thing that I can say is that at least I didn't spend one penny on this piece of crap (I checked it out from the library). I will always regret the two hours I spent watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cast, poor film","review":"When I saw the cast of this film, I hired it. It wasn't bad but I can't say that I was overwhelmed with enthusiasm. It was a bit slow although the surprising twist at the end makes you think how you make emotive assumptions based on the facts which are often quite erroneous. I won't say more so as not to spoil it for you but it wasn't up to my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs something more","review":"Good cast. Female lead should have more compassion, otherwise a fairly good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and 1/2 stars","review":"This movie had some good actors and could have been much better. As it was, it was very choppy and not quite all there. The storylines for the characters were good, but the stories all seemed to jump around so much and never played out the way you would expect. It seemed as if they tried to crame a very long novel into 2 hrs of film and it didn't work. The ending was very unexpected, which I liked, but the characters fell flat for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Upside to this Movie","review":"This movie was horrible. My sister rented it, and, bless her heart, she had faith that at some point it would have some highlights. There were no highlights, save one brief moment in a fantasy scene where a character's head blows up. It would have been a better movie if all the character's heads blew up.When people crawl into a bottle because things get tough, it's not cute or funny. This film might have a place at AA meetings to illustrate how ugly alcoholism is."},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"i love this movie. it is nice to see anger on tv that you have felt before. and its funny on top of it all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant People","review":"Screaming skull anorexic lollipop-head drunk bitch Joan Allen and fat slob drunk dufus Kevin Costner argue for two hours while Allen's spoiled daughters carry on with various dopey/stoned/pervert boyfriends. There are about three tediously long scenes where all the characters laugh, and laugh, and laugh. If only I could have found this lame story one-tenth as amusing as they did. And after all that, there's a preposterous twist ending worthy of \\"Murder, She Wrote.\\" The one thing I can be thankful for is that, in spite of two shower scenes and a sex scene, we are spared seeing Allen's skeletal body naked. Joan--for God's sake, eat something. Smoking is not a substitute for food!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The upside of tedium","review":"It was nice to kind of like Kevin Costner again for a change, but could this movie have possibly been any less interesting?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Upside of Good","review":"In the movie a woman is abandon by her husband who has apparently ran off with his mistress and leaving her with their four daughter. Joan Allen is very good at playing the mainpulative mother as she trys to hold on to her daughters and keep them from growing up. When she mets Costner's character she is suprised to find herself falling in love again. The endig will send you through a loop though. I gave it 4 stars mainly because the plot was alittle hard to follow and keep up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant and lovely","review":"The movie has a star-studded cast, but no one competes for the space on screen. The script is smartly handled. The movie also handles the change of seasons, to show the passing time, very well. It brings a good point about anger and about knowing all sides of the story. I agree that the truth is only every partially correct. This movie made me miss quite a few people I haven't spoken with in a while and wonder about lost ties and misunderstandings."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Suprised me","review":"It really did suprise me. This is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen But it was good. I do recommend everyone to give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Costner can act?","review":"I was as surprised as the rest of the world after watching this movie when I realized that Mr. Costner could actually act. I don't think this man has made a decent movie in years, but I was shocked at how good this movie was. It was a very funny movie that made the washed out semi-drunk baseball player character of Costner's actually likeable. Falling in love with Joan Allen after her husband \\"runs away\\", he becomes her friend and in the end...well, you know. Actually you do and you don't, but I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it. Needless to say it's not also one of those Hollywood movies that attempts to wrap everything up in a pretty bow at the end (thankfully) but it does come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I've watched this movie 3 or 4 times.

You can not play it fast, it is fragile, and the tone is scratchy. That being said it can be used to make some interesting sounds for color in rhythm and slow lead playing. It is not something I would use often. My 1.00 mm Clayton feels and sounds great after after a few minutes of playing the Jellifish.

A monumental choral work is made anemic by a faulty sound track. The chorus and male soloists sound distant from the dominating sound of the orchestra. When the soloists sing in quartet, the male voices, especially the bass, are almost overpowered by the soprano and alto; not that the men don't have powerful voices. It is due to poor sound engineering. On blu-ray, the visual is sharp in detail.

That's unfortunate because, in my view, he brings a fresh, new perspective on the civil rights movement and the historic events comprising it. Unlike other works on the subject, Mr. Gaillard dares to examine the movement from the standpoint of the Southern policital establishment having the difficult, if not impossible, tasks of protecting the participants and, at the same time, enforce the law. By today's standards, the only fault I can find with the book is that it is not \\"politically correct,\\" that is, it doesn't demonize all Southern politicians who had to confront and deal with the civil rights movement. To the dismay of his detractors, Mr. Gaillard finds that some of these individuals were real, flesh and blood human beings, and he gave credit where credit is due. I think he should be applauded for writing real history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyberpunk Fiction - An Industrial Strength Parody","review":"Featuring spoken word parodies of sections of the movie Pulp Fiction plus a range of covers of songs on the original sound track this is an entertaining album.

It is only ever less than fascinating when dealing with the old master himself.So little is known of Vermeer as to leave his biographers only slightly better off than those of Shakespeare, imagining that this document indicated this mood, this painting signifies that political opinion...such supposition is not terribly interesting to the lay reader.But in his detailed recreation of 17th century Delft and his lush and delicate descriptions of the major canvases, Bailey makes up for the limitations of his subject. This period of Dutch history is so rich it seems almost a shame to spend so much of the text on a figure about whom so little is known, and Bailey recounts it beautifully.An excellent book, then, unless one really wants a biography of Vermeer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vermeer: A View of Delft","review":"This book was really helpfull to me as I wrote a paper on Vermeer.

Great for adults and children. As an educator, I would recommend this CD for social studies.

Kerr might seem a most unlikely fellow to deal with such things - his areas of specialty are the great classics he teaches at University. The novel's most intriguing charcter is Howard, a seemingly inoffensive librarian at the heart of a murder-for-hire outfit that ultimately targets the Texas attorney general for death. The book finds Lt. Hilderbrand dealing with a form of evil that seems to flourish even from beyond the grave. And evil is especially effective in its way of appearing to be something that it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bolan combats racism","review":"This book contains all the action of Pendleton's other adventures, but the theme is racism.

Tales of honor and justice, the pains of the past and the hopes of the future, all beautifully intwined in this novel of the adopted mother of Steel Brightblade, Sara Dunstan.

It also was fun for me to see Leo G. Carroll, a guy I saw each week growing up watching \\"Topper\\" on television. Carroll played, by far, the most interesting character in this movie.The acting was good in here, too, once again above '50s sci-fi standards.

Why can't they give us the old movies with subtitles regionfree, this way we have to miss a lot of movies we are dying to have.

It just never seemed to click with the politics. The romance, although developed & revealed gradually, never did resonate with me -- although it had nothing to do with the portrayal of Will Travis; probably due more to my own personal/political biases than any flaw in the work.

I was only 6 years old when this album came out but I can still remember hearing I Didn't Mean To Turn You On. My Mother had the cassette tape (remember those in the 80's). She let me listen to it and I would play it in my boombox at night. For some reason I enjoy this album better at night. This whole album was excellent. Cherrelle (Cheryl Norton) should have gone mainstream. She had exceptional vocal ability and she had star quality. If you can find this album or Affair buy them. My top 4 tracks:1. Fragile - love the horns on this one2. I Will Wait For You - this song has a beautiful dreamy quality to it.3. Who's It Gonna Be - Hot4.

This combined with the overall cheap construction and lack of rubber seal make it a total piece of garbage.Sorry folks don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"small - must fill syringe >3 times for 1 gallon mix","review":"This is just a cheap plastic syringe with a hose to fit on the end. I should have thought it through before ordering and it would have been obvious that this isn't a quick easy solution to mixing since you have to fill and empty the syringe 3 or 4 times to get enough oil for mixing with 1 gallon due to the relatively small size of the syringe. Also, I don't believe it takes the volume of oil in the tube into account, meaning all mixes you make will be somewhat richer than intended.That said, it's better than nothing if you have no way of measuring the oil and want to buy it in larger sizes than the pre-measured mini-bottles. A cheap plastic graduated cylinder of somewhat larger size would be best though, something that will hold around 6 oz total."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works For Mix Ratio, Cheaply Made, Could Be Much Better","review":"I agree with the other reviews who are disappointed with the cheap construction. I recently was using it and accidentally pulled the plunger all the way out the backside and oil got all over the place. It was hard to pull at first and then hit a less friction area and that was it. It is made of all plastic and seems like it could have been made with more quality materials and design. The two finger tabs on the sides of the syringe tube are thin and start to bend while applying pull if you try to use it for any type of heavier oil. It is not a one handed tool. It could have been if it were higher quality. It's a shame that there are not more choices in this category as I would gladly pay a few dollars more to get a better made product. Does the job, just not a well as it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Per the description, this item is ALL plastic. There is no rubber tip to the plunger as on typical syringes. This makes moving the plunger very difficult when loading the chamber requiring a lot of force. This force also makes it more likely to spill when the plunger suddenly decides to move freely nearer the top and completely comes out as you fill the chamber. Also two of the four I had broke the pull ring after about half a dozen uses. I won't buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"mixing tool","review":"This is a joke, dont waste your money on this are muck better out there! nothing in gallons or gallon if you want to suck up the oil you need to pour in something large joke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible terrible terrible!

I really wanted it to work because I've never had a cordless mouse, so be assured that I tried my best to get past the problems. It eats batteries so fast that we had to go out and buy rechargeable batteries. Then, we had to take the batteries out every time we shut down the computer because the mouse would still drain them. Sometimes it would just decide not to work. There is a reset button and a 'channel connect' button to remedy this, but many times they didn't help and I would just have to restart the computer or just use the keyboard. As I write this, I'm using my old mouse with a cord and the Kensington is in a drawer where it probably will never see the light of day.

The problem, simply put, is that \\"Three Times\\" moves at a glacial pace and little happens. As one of the few critics not to wax euphoric put it, \\"if this movie moved any slower it could qualify as a photograph.\\" When each segment ended, and when the final credits rolled, the question plaintively asked by Peggy Lee came to mind: Is that all there is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Testament","review":"Movies like this serve to remind you that real life is much, much more important--and entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"anything but a masterpiece","review":"I've seen a lot of movies and read a lot of reviews over the years, and I have never before found a movie that was judged so highly by well-known critics to be so poor. There is a fair amount of visual beauty, including that provided by lead actress Shu Qi. But the imagery amd music are repetitive, the camera work is slothful and uninspired, the music is largely trite and cloying, and the sparse dialogue is alternately trite and banal. good love stories show you why and how the people love each other; these show you neither. I am a big fan of foreign films and I often like films that don't follow conventional formulas, and films paced slowly and without a lot of dialogue or action, e.g. The Silence and Cache. But without much dialogue, action, innovation, or substance, what's left is \\"Three Times\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the most boring movie I ever saw","review":"If you look at this movie, make sure you do while you are very awake.

Failed as a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Times","review":"Although the cinematography was beautiful, I found \\"Three Times\\" to be boring. It is a very slow and deliberate movie. Because it essentially consists of only two characters, there's not much of a storyline. And to be perfectly honest, I didn't find either characters to be that well developed or interesting. I suppose the theme would be how difficult it is to connect with people who we love, but did I have to be told that three times??? (Hence the title of the film.) Many people walked out of this movie--especially during the very long second part. I felt like doing it too, but I wanted to get my money's worth. Unfortunately, I didn't.

The lyrics are all there too, with the right messages and not what you typically hear repeated a thousand times by every other band.

Please, read the other reviews and resist the impulse to buy this - the writing is haphazard, the plot is extremely disjointed (as well as implausible) and the end result is just plain dissatisfaction. There are much better books out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too terrible for words","review":"The jacket blurb for this book refers to it as the third in a trilogy - trilogy, schmilogy. I adore the characters and plots in the earlier, non-trilogy Karp/Ciampi books, but this is just sad. Not only are the characters flat, but they now exhibit radical memory loss as well as personality disorders. Lucy - one of the most interestingly developed characters in popular fiction -- has turned into a dim, bean-eating sex addict. For this alone Tanenbaum should be shot at dawn. The errors, as other reviews point out, are staggering. Whoever the new ghost is, he/she hasn't read the earlier books or taken English 101. Shame, Tanenbaum, both you and the hack you rode in on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm through with Tanenbaum","review":"It's obvious that Tanenbaum had a ghostwriter for the earlier books...they were funny, had great plots, and a lot of character development.

I'm taking them to Powell's tomorrow but they'll probably laugh me right out of the place. Next stop?GOODWILL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is pathetic.

The author has the following teamed up as a terrorist fighting team: New York's DA, his loose cannon security expert wife, 'mole people' who live in the underground of New York City, a former Viet Cong fighter and current mobster, a tribal police chief from New Mexico, some Russian mobsters, and Karp's young twin boys.If the composition of this 'team' doesn't reveal the lack of credibility in the plot, and you are inclined to get this book, I would at least recommend checking it out from a library. It is not one that is worth buying. Robert Tanenbaum's writing has gone downhill in a big way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmally bad","review":"As others, I loved the series. As others, I have been disappointed in recent books. I read the reviews and determined not to buy this book. But my readerly affection for the Karp family - generated, I realize, mostly by Michael Gruber's tight and witty writing in the early part of the series - drew me in. What a mess. Stop, already, Mr. Tanenbaum - its over. In fact, it was over 2 or 3 books ago. This sloppy, boring mess of a novel was my last from you - I'm just sorry my friends Butch and Marlene and their extended family had to get caught up in it. Fini. Prospective readers, listen to the other reviewers: don't waste your time or your money! Let's not encourage Mr. Tanenbaum any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterplay","review":"Well, I was warned and got this book anyway. Calling this another in the Karp/Chiampi series is very misleading. The characters have the same names but thay are not the same characters. In fact this book has such flat characters I almost see it as characterless. It is clear that when Michael Gruber left the farm, so did the characters and writing we all loved. Whatever Mr. Tanenbaum did that caused Michael Gruber to move on - he should apologize and get him back, or end the series. I feel a little like the victim of a fraud by having had this book passed off to me as another \\"in the series\\". I'm going to buy Michael Grubers's books from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"How are the mighty fallen","review":"I have followed the Karp series since the very beginning and indeed own all the books. \\"Counterplay\\" just does not belong there. Indeed it seems at time as if it was written by someone who never read the series. On page 26 we are told that \\"Atop the list of Karp's happiest moments had been his presence at the birth of his three children: Lucy, the eldest, and the twins\\" Yet in \\"Material Witness\\" Karp is far away when his wife, pursued by Mafia killers, finds refuge at neighbors who help deliver little Lucy.

Perhaps his body was taken over by aliens and this book is atypically atrocious -- I cannot help but wonder how it got published? I am more annoyed at myself for buying the book. The characters are almost so cartoonish that I am expecting a Saturday morning animated show -- Marlene, the one eyed crime fighter -- Lucy, the twenty something year old who has visions from a saint and speaks 60 languages -- but from what she says in the book it appears that eloquent english is not one of them. I actually forced myself to finish the book because I thought it could not decline further as the chapters progressed. Alas, I was so horriby mistaken. Anyone want my copy of this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"My faith in humanity is restored...","review":"by the number of scathing reviews of this book. Generally I find that hurlers like this one have about as many 5-stars as 1-stars, but the public seems happily at one on this conclusion: \\"Counterplay\\" is dreck. I can't review the entire book, because I only made it to page 45 before I tossed it away, but I think I'm better off than the poor saps who stuck it out to the end. I approached it with no prior experience with the series and no expectations except that it be competent and readable. Needless to say, it was neither.

I should have kept my $12 for some peanuts and taken a nap instead. I had never heard of this series, so I can't compare to previous books or say whether or not the characters or plotlines are consistent without its predecessors.I can say this, though: what a piece of crap.This is quite frankly the worst-written, most stupid book I have come across in a long time. The characters are unappealing, stereotypical and two-dimensional. The \\"plot lines\\" are overwrought and, at, best, tenuous. And the writing is clichéd when it isn't plain old repulsive. I can't even decide which of those three is the worst.Also, what's with the overuse of italics? Conceit?This book is so bad, it has led to me writing my very first review on Amazon. Just to say: for the love of God, do NOT give these people anymore money. My 12 $ were more than they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Besides being totally distracted by the misspelled words and badly placed punctuation, I did not feel this was a \\"comprehensive\\" guide to finding a nanny.

This author needs a good editor to re-write this book - there are some helpful nuggets of information buried in this poorly written and seemingly un-edited resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY practical approach","review":"Cliff and Jill have written a very practical approach to building a high net worth customer business. They understand that in order to be truly successful in this business, one must be a personal solution-provider, not a financial product purveyor; and customers' needs are constantly changing. Staying in touch and in sync with customer needs is the key to a succesful apporach. As I read this book, I tried to think of myself as a current wirehouse or independent contractor rep who was in the process of deciding whether it made sense to join a firm like Oberlin Financial. If one has any inclination to take more control over his or her daily business activities, and take more control over the path to financial rewards -- this book serves as a \\"how to\\" guide for that process.Nice job, C & J. Best of luck in all your endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Business Practice, not only for financial advisors","review":"When I read this book, I personally was not so interested in the subject, but the important message here is not only for those working in the financial/investment world, is for everybody willing to develop good business practice, clear guiadance for clients, trust and sucess as a restul of making and keeping satisfied clients for long-term relations. These principles are applicable to any business, is business common sense.

A lot of their songs are good and worth listening to. I did think this band sounded a lot like TooL when I first heard the CD. The vocals are close to the same, the guitar and other instruments are clearly trying to get the sound that TooL made so popular more than a decade ago. But Earshot takes this sound and adapts it to today's more \\"popular\\" music styles. They have some songs that are original, and some that are rather dull. But all in all, Earshot is a band that should be checked out. They had to be doing something right if they got a record contract. When it comes down to it: If you like TooL, you will like Earshot.

I like this album a lot, but it is not what I thought it was going to be when I bought it. The excellent track \\"Get Away\\" is the closest to Tool that they get, which disappointed me (Tool being the best band in existence), but I like that they have their own style and sound. This album is relatively short, which is also another dissapointment. Other than that I say give this a shot. Their sound is strong, and the singer's voice can be powerful (sort of like Maynard from aforementioned musical Gods Tool) and also fragile, which is a good quality. Go ahead and purchase this relatively cheap and valuable cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S NOT TOOL!!!","review":"Anyone who tells you this group sounds like took only listens to the lead singers voice, which yes resonates maynard a little bit, but not a whole lot. the music is not progressive like tool's but rather build around simple melody blocks. When you want to learn about this band and maybe want to buy their cd, if you ask someone for a reccomendation and they tell you these guys sounds like tool, they flat out do not understand music. Earshot's second album, Two, by the way, was one of the best rock releases of 2004. check it out.

Did Maynard James Keenan sing wiht another band??\\" No, no no, Tool fans. It is just Earshot. Scratch that. It's Earshot, one of the best new rock bands to come out of the melting pot. Sure Puddle Of Mudd and Nickelback (I know Nickelback isn't a new band, but they're \\"new\\" to popularity) are great, but Earshot is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your own sound.....","review":"And just why would I want to listen to a watered down Tool [copy] when I could just go listen to Tool? This is just another attempt to [copy] a great band's sound and make it more pop-friendly, just like Incubus did to Faith No More. But at least Incubus has some redeeming value(They did put out that non-commercial SCIENCE). I've read some reviews that say Earshot is different from Tool because it isn't as complex and it's easier to get into. That doesn't change anything, folks. Why do we need a more radio friendly Tool, when the original is so much better? Go get Silverchair's new album instead, or The Used's debut or Glassjaw's new CD, and see if you like those any better. I don't buy this for one second."},{"rating":"1","title":"I changed my mind","review":"When I first reviewed this album two years ago, I gave it a glowing reviews. Unfortunately, the album doesn't have too much lasting value. They initially impressed me due to the vocalist's similarity to Maynard James Keenan, but the novelty of that wore thin quickly. The band doesn't have too much aside from that to back them up, leaving a rather average nu-metal band. If they worked at developing a more unique sound, there's definite potential for greatness. But as of this record, that potential is far from fulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"I honestly forgot these guys even existed.","review":"I was at karaoke last night and I was flipping through the book for music choices when I saw \\"Get Away\\" by Earshot and I was like \\"Whoa, those guys actually existed! I forgot about them!\\"So with that said, I have no problem reviewing old stuff so here this goes.This CD isn't bad the way a bunch of no-talent hacks are. These guys at least have the requisite ability to play their instruments. It's the overwhelmingly embarrassing lack of originality that crippled any attempt for credibility in the music community. I mean, if they didn't simply record a CD and market it to the industry, if they actually played out and played live, could have ANYONE told them to maybe not sound like... well if you haven't figured it out by the other reviews, I guess I can't help.But yeah, the songs on this album sound largely like leftover Tool riffs and generic rock. Not a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find another hobby","review":"First of all I would like to say that I am blown away by how good this cd is. When I picked it up I expected a mediocre cd, but this is much better. ... Well, let me tell you something, this band not only has its own sound but it is way better than some of those bands that \\"push you one step closer to the edge\\". The people who say Earshot is unoriginal need to find something else to complain about. Their are millions of bands that have a sound that isn't completly original. Earshot has some toolesque sounds but they also have some very individual riffs and even a solo or two. If you like and rock and especially Tool this Cd belongs in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get off their back","review":"We all know they don't even come close to the talent and originality of TOOL and APC so quit writing the same reviews dissing this band.As far as I'm concerned, as long as someone out there is producing something other than rap/rock in this time of blah music I say more power to them even if they are heavily influenced by a successful band.Don't listen to people who say you arent a true TOOL fan by pickin up this CD. You think Maynard really cares that you have his CD's and this one in the same CD cartridge? Trust me, he doesn't. Don't let anyone tell you what not to listen to. If you like a rif or singer in a song cuz it reminds you of an awesome band and it makes you feel good crank it up in front of all of those \\"true\\" fans.This CD is not the best out there and probably wont last that long in the CD player...but there are definately some catchy tunes that you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earshot-Music to My Ears","review":"Finally the much awaited release of \\"Letting Go\\" proves to be one of the best new music releases of this year! This album features strong riffs and powerful lyrics, a combination that undoubtedly will leave you feeling Earshot's energy and motivation. Favorite tracks include-Unfortunate, Ordinary Girl,and Not Afraid, though every song has it's unique style and mood elements. \\"Letting Go\\" is a rock album that presents itself with powerful vocals and lyrics to accompany the already mesmerizing flow of the guitars and percussion.

I mean, the singer sounds exactly like Maynard and the band sounds exactly like Tool. Then, the DJ said it was some band called Earshot. I couldn't believe a band could get away with ripping off another band's sound so blatantly. Well, Godsmack did it (ripping off the far superior AIC's sound), so why not these guys? I agree wth another reviewer who said this represents yet another all-time low for the music business. Aren't there ANY bands out there doing something fresh and new?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't this band used to be called Tool?","review":"I was really disappointed with Tool's new album. The music isn't as innovative as it used to be, and they've dumbed down to watered down pop rock. Danny Carey's drumming is horrible, and Maynard sounds like he has a cold. And worse yet, they changed their name to Earshot. How could a band just change their name ten years into their career? Man, this is a huge step down from \\"Lateralus\\".Waitaminute! This isn't Tool? Man, you coulda fooled me! Actually, it's easy to tell the difference. Tool is a brilliant, original, innovative band, whereas Earshot are nothing but derivative hacks. Danny Carey is the best drummer since Buddy Rich. This guy sounds like he's playing drunk. And, finally, Tool's albums are worth buying, Earshot's albums are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good... this sounds nothing like Tool","review":"This band is alright. Not really my type of music, but alright. I only bought the CD because I was told it sounded very similar to Tool. I tried REALLY hard to hear the similarity, but found them to sound much more like Chavelle. I really don't see how people can say this sounds like Tool at all. They are different in just about every way possible. They are lacking as far as lyrical meaning. I wasn't impressed, whereas Tool's Lyrics seem to lick my soul. There are I believe 3 guitarists in this band, so even structurally they are far off from Tool.For all who keep saying this band sounds like Tool, just stop... although I'm sure this band is flattered by it, they probably want their own identity. And to compare them to a band as musically evolved as Tool is just ignorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"For an exboyfriend","review":"I bought this for an exboyfriend a long time ago because he liked this band.

Yes there were some quirky characters aplenty, just few of them that were loveable.And let's face it. Does anyone actually decide to go into a junky bar to interview a ex-boyfriend that you suspect may have killed someone? How about going to a place that known as being a drug house where weapons are sold?

Uses and re-uses over worn plot devices: (1) No one believes the hero (2) Good guys are really bad guys (3) Heroine outwits bad guy (4) young doc with great futureAgain, if you look at the old reviews this book was a big hit, but Robin Cook now writes more timely and more economically."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"There were some part (as mentioned by other reviewers) where the writing was laughable for overall, it was a very interesting story!

After all, that's the backbone of the novel, and yet, it's explained and over with in the final few pages of the book. Cook's done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, but the politics are a bit dated.","review":"You have to take this book with a grain of salt since it was written about a quarter-century ago. Dr. Cook spends a good deal of time on the protagonist, a female medical student, trying to fit into the male-dominated medical world. I'm not saying that what he says has no relevance to today's society, but since what he was talking about was groundbreaking in the 70's it makes sense why he spends so much time on it. I don't mean to imply this is a bad part of the book, in fact it is pretty interesting. The story is quite good; a medical conspiracy where a famous Boston hospital is selling human organs on the black market. It is well written & keeps you on your toes. I think Dr. Cook's novels get more refined as time goes on, but \\"Coma\\" is an essential beginning novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe He wrote this","review":"I'm sorry, but this was Robin Cook's worst books...

I buy and read Cook's novels anytime I finish my pre-planned books on a trip, and was truly delighted to have a chance to pick up the anniversary edition, which I had not read previously.Among the aspects of Cook's \\"formula\\" that I especially appreciate are 1) his provision of non-fiction background references that frame the novel in the real world; 2) his orchestration of vignettes so that one obtains real insights into the backroom operations and otherwise invisible nuances of hospitals and medicine; 3) his engaging characters; and, most importantly, 4) his dramatization of major threats that are not well-articulated to the public by any other means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coma: Classic Cook!","review":"Coma, a fantastic novel full of medical horror and mystery. This is some of Cook's older work, made into a movie (Director: Michael Crichton).

This is the sort of book you should throw in the bottom of your carry on bag as you head off on a trip, it is great reading on a plane, in an airport, on a bus, on a beach or by a pool. It flows along really well, and it is easy to keep track of what is going on. The drama maintains a adequate and believable pace, and you have to love our heroine, she comes across as a young mans dream; I ended up feeling her pain, and I was cheering when things went well. For a student she stumbled across too much, and maybe that is not realistic, but this is fiction, so what does it matter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Coma is very good and has a very plot but it is very confusing at sometimes.

Do not listen to the other reviewers. I felt obliged to write because I have no idea what they are thinking. The characters, especially the main girl, are all totally unbelievable. They act in totally bizarre ways and I could hardly stop myself from screaming at them out loud. The book drags on and on but having put myself through so much torture I felt obliged to finish it.

The story jumps quickly from scene to scene. I read all the Harry Potter books as an adult and enjoyed them very much. Maybe this one is so bad in comparison because it is for children only.

I'm VERY glad I only borrowed it from the library, instead of buying it. While I rather appreciated the poetic writing style, the book itself was downright BORING. I was over halfway through the book before anything remotely exciting started to happen. The story doesn't seem to flow very well, and I found the descriptions of the characters and places quite shallow and choppy. Not a horribe book, but certainly not worth the time spent reading it. Try Diana Duane's \\"So You Want to be a Wizard\\" for a good wizarding book or \\"Little White Horse\\" by Elizabeth Goudge for a slower-paced story with a wonderfully poetic writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predecessor to Harry Potter!","review":"Wizards Hall was actually written in the late 1980's long before the Harry Potter books. I read Wizards Hall many years ago, so when I started reading Harry Potter I immediately recognized the remarkable similarities between the two books, so much so that I wrote the author of Wizards Hall to find out if she was going to sue! The same company that published Harry Potter originally published Wizards Hall, but dropped it when they signed for Harry Potter. This idea did not go over well it seems, and Wizards Hall was brought back in paper-back. Harry Potter is written in a lot more detail, but if you want real imagination, this is the book to read. The book and plot were well thought out, and the story is one that is memorable for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before There Was Harry Potter","review":"Before there was Harry Potter, there was Henry, a boy who decided to become a wizard. Henry travels to the Wizard school were he meets up with a red-headed friend and other young wizards, then is called upon to save the school from an evil wizard.Shorter and with less depth than the massive Harry Potter books, Wizard's Hall is a good book for young readers with a clear message. Anyone who likes the Harry Potter books should by a copy of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this when I was in 4th grade. Great book!","review":"I read this book when I was in 4th grade in 1993 and 14 years later, I was searching for this book for my classroom because I remember how much I loved it. This book pre-dates Harry Potter by several years, and I've been trying to find this particular book because it enchanted me when I read it in my teacher's library. I would definitely suggest this book because it has everything the HP series has (if you like that), but is unique and well written. Certainly worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book for Anyone who likes Magic","review":"This is a really cool book for any kid (or grownup!) who likes magic. It is a LOT like Harry Potter, except with some more original twists. The only problem with this book, is it seems as if the part in the book where the boy is being introduced to Wizard's Hall to the big disaster scene where a monster of some sorts tries to eat everyone and the boy saves them. It goes right from the beggining to the end! Otherwise, this book is a really good book. It is creative and imaginative and so people of all ages like it.

There are other wizard in training books out there (you may have even read one in a popular series, ahem) but the best is still A Wizard of Earthsea--buy that first, then return for this book if you must. It's not awful, it's mostly harmless, but it isn't her best work.Note: 3 stars, for me, is a pretty good review, 4 is for extremely distinguished works, and 5 only for those I consider classics. Most of what is published is, unfortunately, a 2 or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weaves disparate strands into an affecting comingofage story","review":"After reading mixed reviews of this novel, I wasn't sure what to expect but perhaps this lack of expectations freed me to enjoy it. Hellenga takes various unrelated elements - book restoration, Italian travelogue, love story, convent history, etc. - and blends them to create an interesting and, at times, moving read. Flaws: 1) occasionally becomes too didactic, with side detours that go on too long; 2) too loosely plotted, 3) sometimes doesn't quite manage to hit the true voice of a woman. The style of the book reminds me of \\"Girl's Guide to Hunting ..\\" in that it feels like a collection of connected short stories, with different points of view and writing styles. Some of the chapters are self-contained, maybe a little too much so. But overall, good writing and an unusual mix of elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pleasures at all","review":"The title cites \\"Sixteen pleasures\\", and the back of the book states that the heroine explores each of these pleasures. I was expecting a mildly erotic story about the awakening of this young woman. I learned more about restoring frescoes and books than I did about erotica.It's an ok book, but they need to be clearer about what it's about. I felt duped, and that's not a good thing to feel while reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian writing","review":"You'll have to pick your pleasures out of the dross of this very uneven novel. An interesting premise in an evocative setting receives a linguistically dull treatment. In language as plain as blank paper, Hellenga disjointedly hops from family memoir to sociological analysis to romantic adventure to professional exegesis with little sense of cohesion. It's as though he strung together vignettes from a first draft. Characters come and go without much discernable relevance to the story and motivations are murky at best. The best sections deal with Margot's mother's death, the obstacles to divorce in Italy, bidding at auction, and of course the effects of the flood on Florence. If you want a vicarious tour of the city, read Mary McCarthy's Stones of Florence instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at *all* what I was expecting","review":"Though a fairly interesting introduction to the nuances of book preservation, this book was wholly disappointing. I bought it because it was billed as \\"a sensual, life-altering journey of loss and rebirth in this exquisite novel of spiritual longing and earthly desire.\\" Obviously, the marketing person who wrote this copy read something else. Did I find the book interesting? Yes, but not for the reasons I wanted to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my life favorites","review":"This was the first Hellenga book I read, and I have re-read it about 3 times since. This book sang to me -- a woman traveling alone, but with so much life, making decisions that will affect her own future and that of ART in the very capital-letter sense. Learning the intricacies of book restoration at the same time we follow a complex love story -- and we follow life in the convent at the same time we hear of rather non-nun-like bedroom behavior -- the various stories are juggled brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Margot and Florence!","review":"I loved this book from the moment I picked it up. Anyone who has ever been to Florence will know that Hellenga captured the essence of the city and its people . Contrary to other reviews that were disappointed this book was not more erotica, I was relieved and delighted about the artistic manner that Hellenga handled the eroticism. Well written. The ending is perfection! Go Margot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great detail about the book restoration process","review":"In 1966, the Arno flooded its banks and devastated the priceless collections of galleries, libraries and churches in Florence. Margot Harrington, a 29-year-old American book conservator, travels to Italy to join those who went to help rescue priceless treasures. Margot pitches in where she can and eventually she ends up at a convent. While working to save their library, she discovers a lost book of pornography that dates back to the Renaissance. She realizes that the sale of this book, once properly preserved, could save the Abbey.The author Robert Hellenga goes into great detail about the book restoration process, Florence in the 1960s and the moral and social situations in which Margot gets involved - all of which change her life in ways she never imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic, Intriguing and Fun!","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book!!!The story is about a 'mud angel', a young woman who travels to Florence, Italyin the 1960's after the Arno floods, in order to help conserve and bind preciousbooks that have been damaged by the flood. While in Florence, she comes acrossa rare, erotic manuscript that becomes symbolic of her own life.This novel is erotic, erudite, intriguing and fun for anyone who loves books. It isvery well written. I had trouble believing that it is a first novel. I eagerly awaitmore books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth the trouble","review":"It had been a while since I read this, but am clearing my shelves for new books. I remeber liking it a great deal- but of course Florence is one of my favorite places on earth, and a wonderful place to be in love. In another copy of this that I had on my shelf, a previous reader had marked this passage (typos are my own;-))\\"Which of us doesn't have a similar ghostly double wandering around somewhere out there in the big wide world? A self from whom we parted company long ago, at some unlikely crossroads? But do we ever encounter these ghostly selves? Do our worlds ever intersect? I can't believe it. The one is too impermeable, the other too fine, too subtle.\\"I also may never hear the phrase \\"Non vale la pena\\" ( It's not worth the trouble\\")again without chuckling and thinking of Margot's \\" Non vale il pene\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A love song to Italy","review":"This book definitely keeps your attention, as well as provoking comparisons to one's own choices in life. I found it remarkable this book was written by a man (unless Robert is a pen name!). Hellenga's ability to convey a young woman's feelings is very impressive, and he most certainly loves Italian culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"After reading the book's summary, I was prepared for an evocative, lush, story that would draw me in with it's sensuality. But I felt very little sexuality in either of the characters, and less so in Hellenga's portrayal of the book and it's secrets. Although the technical description of book restoring was interesting I found the characters to be flat and difficult to identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite a waste of time","review":"Mildly entertaining. Likable character but not fully developed. Many characters are introduced with no \\"meat\\"; flat one dimensional. Many areas or themes are touched upon but never explored. The idea of a person trying to find oneself is exciting; however, the author didn't complete the journey. The premise had so much potential. It never bloomed"},{"rating":"1","title":"All too realistic","review":"The story itself, I found boring. I didn't care what happened to most of the characters, and cared only mildly about Margot. I did find the insights into Italian culture and book conservation very interesting, but it barely made it worth it. I typically like books the have a sense of adventure to them, and I bought this book because it sounded like the plot would have that. The overall plot was quite normal, in the sense that it could happen to anyone. I like books to take my away from the normal world and this just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong on information, weak on story","review":"A rambling and disjointed book, this has many fascinating moments but never hangs together. The descriptions of book conservation are well done and interesting. The author has failed, though, to assemble any believable characters. His effort to assume a woman's voice fails miserably and in the midst of the well-researched text, one searches in vain for a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No matter hard they try, men can not write from a woman's perspective","review":"I tried, really I tried! I trusted that a National best seller would provide an interesting distraction, but after pushing myself through the first 75 pages, I just gave up! It could have amazing redeeming qualities, but I just couldn't engage in the writers style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Plot? What plot. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Even the sex scenes were mundane. Populated by a gaggle of one-dimensional characters & false starts striving to waste the reader's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"evocative writing, unsympathetic character","review":"The descriptions of Italy and the convent were fascinating. Margot, however was a male fantasy. I not only could not sympathize with her, I found myself actively disliking her. The fawning and obsessed way she wrotes about a lover, who had no iteresting qualities, disgusted me. Even though I couldn't finish it I consider this one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing...","review":"Being a lover of love, the arts, Florence and tales of strong, discovering women, after reading the description of this book, I was very excited to begin!By page 20, I started feeling misled. By page 100, I started wondering if I was reading the right book. By page 200, I was debating whether or not I cared enough to finish.This book is barely about any of the subjects I mention above. Moreso, it includes a few drawn out parts about book conservation that, well, just weren't that interesting.I'm just glad I bought it used. And back to the used book store it shall go."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, boring...","review":"There was not much to grab onto in this book. Sounded like it could be juicy, new love, Italy, erotic art... but it failed to be much more than a boring book about a boring book.The author totally failed in his attempt to write from a woman's perspective. Utterly unconvincing.The main characters were little more than average and their \\"forbidden love\\" was dry and unmoving.The only interesting parts were the chapters on convent life. Those parts were, unfortunately, too brief.All in all, the book dragged, the characters were incomplete, the descriptions of Italy were fairytale at best. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Drew Goes to Florence","review":"I am astonished that so many readers felt Hellenga didn't capture the feminine psyche in his character. As I was reading chapters in Margot's voice, I forgot it was written by a man! As a former Catholic school girl, I thought Hellegna was right on with the sisterly comraderie between Margot and the nuns, their appeal to her. Reading this book was like eating a sumptuous Italian meal; an easily attainable satisfaction. I was also amazed at the factual info about book and art conservation he was able to pack in -- and make compelling. I enjoyed it as a meandering, vicarious adventure ala Nancy Drew and other intrepid female protagonists. Too bad they'll probably ruin it by making it into a film starring Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis with graphic depictions of the Sixteen Pleasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did this get good reviews?","review":"This book completely disappointed me, and it's reassuring to see I'm not the only one. The premise of a young book restorer going off to Italy last-minute and to discover herself and, ultimately, a rare example of Renaissance 'pornography,' is fabulous. The characters, dialogue, and narrative are not. The voice is not consistent, the main character unsympathetic, the story amorphous, and the entire experience unsatisfying. Avoid this book unless you'd like a primer on book restoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Funny","review":"I read this book in my second grade class. This is a funny book. Even Steven likes everything even. Odd Todd likes everything odd. For example, Even Steven would like 8 pancakes and Odd Todd would like 7 pancakes. Even Steven goes through hard work with Odd Todd. Then, Even Steven notices that odd and even are both good. My favorite part was when Odd Todd and Even Steven win their $50 prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evenly Funny, Oddly Entertaining","review":"Very cute story of two boys driven by even numbers or odd numbers.

The styling is much better than previous models. I have not had the television professionally calibrated yet, but the picture and sound is outstanding.I highly recommend this HDTV over the even more expensive Pioeneer Elite. The picture quality is crisp and clean, while the video processor seems to have little to no lag time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"Great TV. I waited a long time to get a Plasma and the price on Amazon (via 6ave Electronics) was too good to beat. Delivery was on time and in excellent condition. Even the HD DirecTV installer that came to my house was impressed with the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ragtime","review":"I thought it was the movie, so, this was my mistake however, to listen to Randy Newman for more than 0.5 seconds was freakin' torturous and painful, so much so, I no longer wanted the movie even though my son was in a major part for the Ragtime play."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't even own it yet","review":"I haven't even bought this CD yet (I'm ordering as soon as I finish reviewing it) but I'm sure it will be an instant favorite.When I bought a CD burner recently, one of the first things I did was record my own crummy CD of the Ragtime soundtrack from my old LP, scratches and surface noice intact.To say that I have been anxiously awaiting this release is an understatement. Even with all the wonderful records Randy Newman has made, this is still my favorite!Thank you Rhino."},{"rating":"2","title":"About dang time","review":"Simply a beautiful score. Randy Newman is the bridesmaid of film scoring. While John Williams, Danny Elfman and others reap rewards and awards, Newman plugs away, consistently elevating the movie experience with timely and luscious music and songs (His solo albums are recommended experiences as well). They finally threw him a bone at the oscars this year, some twenty odd years after he should have won for Ragtime, is my opinion. I played my record to it's spiraling death and I plan the same fate for my CD as well. Also, it's worth buying just to read Newman's hysterically sarcastic liner notes about the CD release of this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete waste.","review":"About the only good thing you can say about the movie is that it has a song or two worth hearing. \\"I Will Show The World\\" is good.

I can't quite tell if he sings well-below average on purpose or if he's merely preternaturally unqualified to croon. Whatever the case, it's not fun to listen to - the singing that is. And though you are aware of the talent, thoughtfulness and intelligence of the musicians, the music can become irritatingly, almost pretentiously repetitive, to the point where you want to ask: \\"do you really like what you're playing THAT much?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ingredients don't gel so well","review":"Examplary of little that can be good and mostly what can be bad with indie music, this brief (though pretentiously stretched out to not be an ep) album's superficial experimentation into what is essentially lousy songwriting sometime rises above the sum of it's dislocated parts, but rarely displays enough fleshed-out form to engage for an entire song. Works best as the textural wallpaper it feels of, as when the over-indulgent vocals and routine angularity are examined closely we see seldom (though a few profound) moments adding up to little more then generic noticeability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing on me...","review":"At first I was surprised when the vocals kicked in on Wear Two Eyes, and I must admit I skipped ahead to track two, then three. Cardiac Atlas is what did it, then Southeast of Boston. When I finally listened to the album all the way through, I realized June of 44 has taken another great step forward. The vocals are languid, almost lazy, but they work well with the music. Scharin's excellent drumwork keeps everything together as the guitars and bass wander around. This album has a very relaxed feel, something that was only partly there on Four Great Points. If any of you actually care what people like us think, and have read all the way down to this review, just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This really is one of the best mascaras. My absolute favorite is Urban Decay's Super Curling, but this one is better than the ones by Josie Maran, Tarte, Buxom, Benefit, etc. I am very picky about my mascaras and would only recommend the good ones. I've also tried tons of mascaras too. It provides lasting volume and definition and it's cheaper than most department store brands.

They love them and hop right in. I noticed in a few reviews that people were attaching the straps on the seat to the dogs collar. If you get in an accident this could break your dogs neck and kill them. Only buckle the straps to a dog harness, never their collar. I never used the legs to this seat. Without the legs it boosts the dog up six inches which is plenty for our dogs to see out. Our dogs are about 18 pounds each and the seat fits them very well. I don't think it would fit a dog over 25 lbs though. I never feed or give my dogs water in the car so I recylced that tray they provide right away. Yes, the pad does slip. I just put a big towel on the seat and the dogs don't have a problem. Love the seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, horrible!","review":"If I could give this zero stars, I would. It is a terrible pet seat.The sheepskin cushion is thin and provides no support at all. The cushion also slips very easily; it does not take long for the cushion to end up in the floor. The straps that are meant to secure your pet slip free from seat, and the clasp is terribly difficult to use.I absolutely hate this car seat. Do not waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Yorkie Loves It!","review":"This is a great car seat for my yorkie and she loves being able to see out the window easily and lie down whenever she wants. The only problem, that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating, is that the legs collapse because of the raised area on either side of the passenger seat. It would be better if the legs could be locked more securely in place, but don't let that keep you from purchasing this......love it! Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"To anyone looking at the \\"Good Pet Stuff travelin' Dog Pet Seat\\". Keep your money. It is a piece of junk and will not preform as advertised. Under any pressure the legs will collapse, putting a seat belt on the unit will collapse the legs. Plastic is fragile and very unstable, wiggles all over. Will not support the weight of a pet more than 5#. Definitely not worth more than about $10 and I would not purchase at that price because it is still unusable!I returned for refund after trying to put into my car. I have a \\"Yorke\\" and it was ordered for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product.","review":"This is a very nice product. My reasoning for 4 stars is that the belt clip and the video stand compete for space on the case, and the belt clip has to be screwed in which requires some stretching of the case. And the kickstand may require some adjusting to get it to stand straight and the antislip pieces might need to be moved towards the center of the stand. Otherwise the case is just as described. It's not to slick but it isn't sticky either. I'd recommend keeping an LCD screen protector under the plastic protector provided for extra insurance. The protector doesn't glare too badly though which is VERY nice. Otherwise I love this product, it slipped on well and fits like a glove. Something else that I noticed was that the clip holds well to whatever you clip it to. It stays on things well, but can be removed without unscrewing anything, it's a very nice feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice HDD","review":"Those with 32BG BIOS limitations will find this HDD perfect.

I found out that anyone can make such an \\"ambient\\" album in their own bedroom. Just set a Mesa Boogie in the corner, plug a Les Paul in, and crank it up. Now, lay on the bed and randomly throw things at the guitar, and take your time, no need to rush the notes. Once recorded, you now probably have a better album than the new Hytari.

Mann could have written The Biograph Girl, which not only entertains but teaches about the film industry in its embryonic, pre-Hollywood years. Mann's portrayal of Florence Lawrence, who is regarded as the world's first movie star, brims with humanity as well as suspense, making the book hard to put down. Mann is also a gifted parodist, tossing in hilarious cameo appearances by Adela Rogers St. Johns, Rosie O'Donnell, and Barbara Walters. The Biograph Girl is a fine historical novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biograph Girl is a MUST!","review":"If one is fond of stories about old Hollywood, or murder mysteries, or simply want a days EXCELLENT entertainment this is the book for you. It tells the fictionalized story of Florence Lawrence, the first movie star. She is 106 years old and discovered by a journalist who, after some good investigating, finds out she is the long 'dead' star who died of eating ant paste in the 30's.I have to say I read this 457 page book non-stop over one lovely Sunday and it kept me from glancing up at the Tv, or any of a number of disctractions...it was wonderful and magical and a thrill to read. I recommended it to anyone--young, old, interested in history or just simply needing a day or twos entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Fun Read!","review":"I was looking around the house for a few good \\"beach reads\\" to take on vacation and happened upon this book I bought a few years ago for just such an occasion. Thinking that it would be a fun piece of fluff I could pick up and put down between swimming and playing with the kiddos in the sand, just a few pages in, I quickly realized that I would be spending the next day or so camped out and not doing anything else until I finished this engrossing and thoroughly researched novel. Mann's characters are rich and fully developed, and the story glides along without any of those boring parts that you have to get through to get to the good stuff. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery, old Hollywood, or 20th century history -- you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real pleaser","review":"The Biograph Girl is sure to please anyone with an affinity for Hollywood history, mysteries, and the modern subculture that is popular entertainment. William J. Mann manages to blend a wide variety of divergent elements into a very cohesive and entertaining narrative that meets the true test of any mystery - you can't put it down for want of finding out how it ends. I deducted a star because the ending, although clever, is somewhat obvious. It seems like Mann, with his incredibly intricate plot lines, trapped himself into a bit of a corner. This is not to say that it's bad - quite the contrary. It's just a bit disappointing.Also to be appreciated is the incredible amount of research that must have gone in to the writing since it is just chock full of details that are one of the true pleasures of the book. Although lengthy, it doesn't read as such and the \\"you are there\\" sense that one gets is highly effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!","review":"What were those other reviewers thinking??? Great idea, horrific execution. The characters are ridiculously 2-dimensional, without a genuine characteristic among them (a HIV-infected, former porn star? Give me a break!!) The writing is an embarassment -- when the author is not using every cliche known to man he's ridiculously mixing his metaphors. And he has taken every overused plot devise he could possibly think of -- AIDS, murder, competition between brothers -- and thrown them all together as if this were some kind of literary blender.There's nothing I like more than historical fiction.

It remains at the top of my play stack. So many believe that a David Gilmour album should be Pink Floyd (PF) set in disguise... for all of you I merely suggest you reread the album's title. The set within the album is a departure from PF. It is refreshingly simple and devoid of the layering of sound that weighs down some PF selections. The album is not locked into a conceptual theme, but rather explores a wide breadth of emotions. Perhaps most poignant is the quiet desperation of the final cut \\"Near the End\\". It speaks of faith, and belief in oneself, and the quiet strength it can take to face a day when there is little to look forward to. The sound is different from PF but is unmistakenly recognizable as David Gilmour. It is an about face and departure from the PF sound but it is a rewarding exploration of the different directions that can be taken. It may be almost 17 years old, but is ages incredibly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic David Gilmour","review":"Such a decent and well balanced recording that I had to purchase it in a Japanese CD.It seems these CD's are of pretty much the best quality one can buy in a compact disc format - of course other than the gold discs that are being fazed out, unfortunately. Can you imagine if the Japanese made these dics with gold? WOW!As must have for all David Gilmour fans as well as Pink Floyd fans.I believe he is one of the driving forces of Pink Floyd for sure and his solo efforts show this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"David Gilmour's second of two solo albums is a work of genius, from the beginning making it very clear that this not just another Pink Floyd record (see The Wall, and Dark Side of the Moon). The album starts out energetically with electric guitars and synthesizers in Until We Sleep, throws you around a bit, then backs off with the climatic acoustic ballad Near the End. A must buy for any Pink Floyd or sci-fi music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice follow up","review":"I was and am a huge fan of Gilmour's first album, which came out right when the Columbia started distributing music videos to the record stores (pre- MTV) where I worked at the time. About Face is a natural transition and fills the blank between David Gilmour and the later Pink Floyd releases (Momentary Lapse of Reason & The Division Bell) as well as On an Island. His solo work is incredibly refreshing. I highly recommend About Face and David Gilmour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd as it could have been","review":"David Gilmour's \\"About Face\\" is a glimpse of what the \\"Final Cut\\" could have been, had only David Gilmour some input on the final product. This was released at about the same time as Roger Waters' solo album \\"The Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking\\", and I find the Gilmour solo project more listenable. Song highlights on \\"About Face\\" include \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\", \\"Murder\\", \\"Blue Light\\" (even though some Floyd fans seem to hate this one), and \\"Until We Sleep\\". I only wish that Waters & Gilmour had been able to pool their creative resources together during this time, as the 1970's Floyd material proved superior in my opinion when the band collaborated. Alas, it was not to be. Although the Pink Floyd reincarnation of the late 80's and 90's was decent, one only wonders what could have happened. I still like this album, although it is a bit dated - but that doesn't mean it's bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd fan's (like me) be honnest please","review":"Hey, I'm a Pink Floyd fan, but being a fan doesn't mean you have to rate everything a band, or even a band member has released, as a five star rating !To help you see more clearly, here's some example of five, four and three stars rating. If you don't see difference in these cd, see a doctor !Five stars goes to an album like \\"Wish you were here\\"Four stars goes to an album like \\"Momentary lapse of reason\\"Three stars goesn to the first solo album of David, just a good cd.Two stars goes to this one, be honnest and don't compare it with \\"Wish you...\\" for instance. Listen to \\"Blue light\\", \\"Cruise\\" or \\"All lovers are derandged\\" and see that About face is not a great cd, few good cuts and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd Lite","review":"Gilmour's second solo album is about as much of a snore as the later albums he would record with Pink Floyd sans Roger Waters, proving once and for all that Waters was the driving force behind the band. Gilmour is an excellent guitarist and a decent singer, but his solo songwriting is fairly pedestrian. Without Waters' vision, however warped it may have been, he's just another aging veteran rocker without a whole lot to say. The same blandness that would permeate Floyd albums starting with \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" reigns here. Ardent fans may love it, but casual fans should forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't feel it","review":"Most of Floyd to me is timeless. Gilmour's solo stuff sounds dated in my opinion. That's certainly not a bad thing in and of itself but this record just seems a bit too 80's poppish to me. The song Love On The Air is just ridiculous. Of course I've never cared for Townsends style of writing and think he's written several songs that just can't be taken serious. I find no songs on this record worth even putting on a compilatation. Off to the used cd store with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God!","review":"As much as I hate to say it this album is shocking. Thank god he shares lyrical writing with his wife Polly Samson now in the post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd, or else they surely would've went out with less than a fizzle. There are two good songs on this album, 'Murder' and 'Near the End'. (By the way, has anyone ever realised how the riff on 'Near the End', is EXACTLY the same as the recurring riff on Roger Water's 'Pro's and Con's of Hitchhiking'?) The rest of the album is just really bad 80's pop. Especially 'Blue Light' and 'Cruise'. What the hell?I suppose David Gilmour just wanted to get away from anything to do with Pink Floyd or Roger Water's, so don't buy this expecting to get another dose of Floyd - because quite simply, it's not. If this wasn't given to me as a christmas present, or I didn't like to collect everything Floyd related, I would throw this in the bin! That's a bit extreme, I like 'Murder' too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"I can't believe that some people like this album. It STINKS! The lyrics are some of the most desperate, cliched, pathetic attempts at poetry you will ever hear. \\"Blue Light\\" is the WORST Pink Floyd related song I have ever heard - Gilmour is a great guitarist, an average writer of music; but even the Vengaboys can write better words!! Come on - this is awful. Sorry Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Side of Gilmour","review":"Most certainly an underrated solo album from Pink Floyd's legenday guitarist. This is a not a Pink Floyd styled album what so ever. The songs are more relaxed and diverse..A nice mix of Rock, jazz/blues, ballads and a rather haunting instrumental.Teamed with master producer Bob Ezrin and backed by musicians including Jeff Porcaro, Pino Palladino, Ian Kewley, with Michael Kamen adding his orchestrated touch. On this album David Gilmour is able to stretch out a bit and develop a diverse collection of songs. Two songs were co-written with The Who's Pete Towshend.Standout songs include Until We Sleep, Murder, Out Of The Blue, All Lovers Are Deranged, You Know I'm Right and Near The End."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make That 4 and 1/2","review":"This is a good album, with lots of great guitar playing and surprisingly sharp lyrics. On the whole, it doesn't sound a lot like Pink Floyd, with the exception of the lone instrumental track, Let's Get Metaphysical, which is (albeit coincidentally) my favorite song on the album. It's no mere standalone track however, there are lots of other good songs on here too. Murder, Love On The Air, All Lovers Are Derranged, Cruise, and the solo on Near The End (I don't like the rest of the song all that much) are good as well. There isn't a bad song, although some are only about average, such as Until We Sleep, and the rest of Near The End. Bottomline: If you like Dave get this album, it's not very PF sounding, but you'll still like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step outside Pink Floyd.","review":"Nice to hear what the real driving force behind Pink Floyd can do solo. Gilmour's guitar work has always been exceptional, but it really shine in some of the truly \\"rocking\\" tunes from this disc. If you like \\"Floyd\\" without Waters (and that's not difficult for me), then you'll love this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gilmour is amazing","review":"I love Pink Floyd, and I love David Gilmour as a solo act as well. He is an amazing talent and I personally think he's very underrated by people who aren't Pink Floyd fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilmour","review":"He is the main, or all of Pink Floyd's guitars. The group wouldn't have become the supergroup that it did wihout his songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware: original release worth it/ re-master not","review":"This was supposed to be a re-mastered version of this cd, but to be honest after listening to it I couldn't tell the difference from the original release. I love this album despite some of the negativity I've read from Floyd fans, but this purchase was a disappointment for me. I recommend this cd for novice Floyd fans, but if you already have the original 1984 release, don't waste your money trying to upgrade to the re-master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to shabby","review":"This cd is pretty good overall but it is a little too 80's sounding for me to rate it really high. I love his s/t release from 78' and I love Division Bell much better than this release or Momentary. It is a little boring at times I guess but it gets plenty of air time in my cdrom drive. I also would like to highly recommend Roger Waters solo cd amused to death and Radio Kaos. What Dave is incapable of Roger has on his discs and Vica Versa. Have a nice evening everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have....","review":"A must have, not DG's best album, but something ost worth listening to....Produced after PF-TFC, and it's just before AMLOR, so it's in between both of the breaking points in the mid 80's PF.If you like DG, you will enjoy it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Gilmour's Best","review":"Workmanlike and seldom-inspired, this album finds David Gilmour unsuccessfully attempting to capture the mid-1980s mainstream rock bandwagon. Some artists could pull this off, like Robert Palmer and ZZ Top. Gilmour can't, and as a result his voice sounds harsh and his solos seem frentic and unfocused throughout. The mix is buried in that heavy reverb that so much of 80s pop over-used, and except for \\"Love on the Air,\\" there's almost nothing that holds up to repeated listening.I strongly suggest passing this over in favor of \\"David Gilmour,\\" which is Gilmour's first and best solo album. Listening to that nearly perfect album again after listening to this only reinforces what a superior collection of songs the earlier album was. Unless you have a strong fondness for 80s corporate rock done by-the-books, I can't imagine anyone listening to this often."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Gardening Book EVER!","review":"I have had this book for about 3 years now, and refer to it constantly. I spend my cold winters reading it, finding a new plant or two to try each spring....I have not been dissapointed in the slightest. The organization is super, the pictures are great and it just has so much information about each plant...where to plant, how much water, fertilizer,climate, propagation methods, etc. Can't say enough about this book,it's my favorite, and I must own at least 20 gardening books.

I never knew she could sing.","review":"I remember Jenny Lewis from my childhood watching her in Growing Pains, Wildcats, and the Wizard. After a google search, I saw that she was a singer now.

The rest is awful, overproduced studio glop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strickly For Lonely Music Critics","review":"Why does this gal get good reviews? This music is poorly written and executed; to invoke the name of Laura Nyro or Dusty Springfield is to disrespect the dead!

Ben Gibbard sucks too."},{"rating":"2","title":"jenny","review":"I bought this record because I am such a fan of Rilo Kiley, but this record is far from sounding the same. I was not at all expecting to hear what I did. I was taken on a soulful journey of genres and it was truely beautiful with Jenny Lewis' crystal clear vocals. The questioning of religon is truely counrty but the funness to it makes it more pop.

It's, for the most part, a really simple CD, but upon many listens you really pick up all the meanings and whatnot. Jenny's voice is... you couldn't ask for anything better. It's so soft and sweet, and watching her hit those high notes is just incredible. Seeing her live was such a great experience. I was in awe the whole time she was on stage - and I was front row, center - well, to the left a tad, but just so much so that the mike wasn't in my view of her.The CD is awesome. There's nothing sufficient to say to describe it - go to her site, preview the tracks, you'll understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rise And Shine Dear Jenny","review":"Ovo nije album koji ce vas uhvatiti na prvo slusanje to je sigurno.

It sounded interesting and, musically anyway, it has a freshness that made me want to like it. However, the tunes are not so good, nor the singing so fine, that either can transcend the lack of lyrical flair. In short, not one song on this album had words that were worth listening too. They scan badly too, making for some awkward phrasing. Not one of these songs will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn the art of lyric writing, then proceed.","review":"As with her work in Rilo Kiley, Jenny Lewis' voice is quite appealing, but her lyrics are atrocious.

The author covers just about anything you've heard of and probably a lot that you haven't. The color plates and illustrations are excellent and there is an amazing amount of information packed into this book. One problem arises, however: some of the information is outdated when newer discoveries are taken into account. The author wrote the book something like 80 years ago and though it's been through revisions, it still contains information that probably should be updated. That is a rare instance however, and I'd say 99% of this book is accurate, right on the money, and DEFINITELY worth the price. You probably won't find another source that covers as much as well.

To paraphrase another reviewer, if I were to have just one volume for my collection of esoteric information, it would be this one. It's, as subtitled, an encyclopedia, therefore a reference work. Thus it can be read at any one chapter depending on the reader's interest at the time.The immediate reaction I had on perusing the book was that it appears to be a lifetime of work on the part of more than oneauthor.

There is too little melody and too many herky-jerky starts and stops for my taste. This group sounds like they are trying to imitate Emerson, Lake and Palmer and Yes, but wind up sounding like a cross between Porcupine Tree and Echolyn (two of the duller progressive groups around)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skilled musicians lack personality as a unit.","review":"I wanted to like Spock's Beard -- confess; who doesn't get a little tired of spinning their old Yes and Genesis CDs over and over again -- but if this CD is a reasonable presentation of SB, then I must respectfully pass. The band has chops to spare, and Neil Morse's vocals are serviceable, although most of the lyrics he's singing are dull-to-embarrassing. (Yes had the best answer to prog-rock lyrics: just string together a bunch of words that sing really well.)There are some memorable ideas here and there, but they're smothered by the arrangements: the band seems intent on changing time and direction every 10-15 seconds or so, which makes their compositions sound frantic and scattered. And there is no distinctive sonic profile at all, with all of the musicians displaying skill but no individual personality.Ultimately SB sounds like a somewhat unusual LA session band, a more pretentious version of Toto. Not was I was after."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This is my second spock's Beard cd after The Light. The Light amazed me. Thinking I'd found a great progressive rock band I picked up Beware of Darkness which is a fan favorite. I was so disappointed.

Spock is nothing like the Ozrics. They're atrocious.\\"Look out. Watch out now, beware...\\" Amen to that. Steer clear of this disc, and certainly the rest of them if this is one of their betters.The lyrics are painful, and the croning just as much. Just when you think they're going to take a jam somewhere, this voice from heck sludges in. Playing in obscure time sigs just to classify yourself as a progrock band doesn't cut it.Cool cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply great progressive listening","review":"There are already so many reviews on this. Spock's Beard surprised me with its huge progressive style. Whether you like it or not, these guys sound like copycats of Yes, ELP, Genesis, Kansas, Pink Floyd and King Crimson...all in one. Given today's music scene I came to the conclusion that I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT! I commend Neil Morse for his enthusiasm and for paying tribute to the great ones of yester-decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best, even if ...","review":"Well there isn't any great peak in this album, but in the average it's anyway better than \\"The light\\", because the presence of a new keyboards' player (expecially his Hammond organ), his instruments being coupled with the orchestrations by Neal Morse in an excellent and remarkable cocktail of keys, makes the whole album well worth!! \\"Thoughts\\" and \\"The doorway\\", expecially the piano-intro, are alone well worth checking out!! The rest is more accessible than \\"The light\\" and less prolix too...Highly recommended!! Even if this isn't the best US prog work of the last 20 years (listen for example to Mirthrandyr's \\"For you the old women\\" or the whole Yezda Urfa's stuff and you can understand why...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More like Kansas than Genesis","review":"Maybe it's the hammond organ with mellotron, excellent vocal harmonies, more spiritual lyrics, or catchy melodies, but this CD reminds me much more of older Kansas (circa Leftoverture or Masque) than it does Genesis, Yes, or ELP. The last song, \\"Time Has Come\\", is perhaps a blend of Kansas, King Crimson, and Beatles sounds. In fact, several of the songs have melodic touches reminiscent of the Beatles.But there are also some innovations here. \\"Waste Away\\" has a sarcastic bent, and \\"Thoughts\\" sounds like nothing a 70's-era band would have touched. This work fully deserves 4 out of 5 stars. I guess I'll have to try their other CDs now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Future","review":"From the opening riffs of this CD, this forty-something ex-prog-rocker was transported back to the golden age of rock, when you were allowed to use more than three chords and didn't have to sing about what a pain life is. True, Spock's Beard is derivative--a single chord progression echoes Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, and Jethro Tull--but that's the whole idea. They breathe fresh new life into a dying genre. And such virtuosity! Rarely has a group of such talented musicians come together on such a complex project. With new sound technology and the ability to expand tracks to CD-length, they are in some ways able to improve on the old prog gods. Yes, I miss Jon Anderson's voice and Peter Gabriel's lyrics - but this is a pretty first step back to the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical journey that pays off in the end.","review":"I just started listening to Spock's Beard within the last month. Very impressive band. I have \`\`Kindness to Strangers'' and \`\`Beware of Darkness'' and I must say Darkness is the better of the two. I haven't heard a track like \`\`The Doorway'' since the days of Yes and Genesis and King Crimson. From the opening piano you're taken on a musical journey that includes keybords, Hammond organ and classical guitar. The song is beautiful. The rest of the album is great too. With the exception of \`\`Thoughts'' there isn't a weak track on the CD. I encourage anybody who thinks progressive rock is dead to pick up Spock's Beard. You won't be disappointed. These guys are accomplished musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading","review":"There is an art to telling a really funny story, and the author of this book has definately made that art a science. The book offers a surprising variety of humor, including everthing from longer jokes with really clever punchlines to top ten lists and humorous haiku's. Overall, I found the book quite funny, and well worth the price. It would be a great gift for anyone who knows anything about computers - even those who work for Microsoft in Redmond, Washington."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute family film","review":"Yes, it's a family film.

What a versatile and amazing actor! Nice to know he made a movie especialy for his family to watch. He has a cracking sense of humour and I can't wait for the DVD to arrive in Australia.

It was great fun, Radio Disney was there having contests and giving away prizes. Unfortunately the movie was pretty weak. The best comic moments were in the trailer. Diesel didn't look entirely comfortable, I'm not sure if it was the comedy or the kids. The plot was one dimensional, and the family values moments were very shallow.In the end it was a transparent attempt at a Spy Kids like movie. I'm sure the kids will love it... once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I never thought I would like a Vin Diesel picture, but I did. We see a softer side of the usual gun-toting, shoot first and ask questions later type of guy here. Pretty good acting and a story line the whole family can understand. Several funny scenes as military man Shane Wolfe's protocol type thinking tries the grasp the concept of childcare.This is probably the only VD picture I will ever like, but this one is worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i loved this movie. Vin is YUMMY! i like the scene of him in just the towel and when the next to the youngest called him daddy. this was a very awesome out of the way departure movie for a well known actor to do. you would think that most action movie stars like Vin would bomb out on a movie like this and i am glad that it worked out for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"This was an awful movie. There was nothing funny about it. The plot was over done. We have seen this kind of movie a thousand times and on top of that it wasn't even funny. It did not have the right characters to make it funny and the plot was not strong enough to carry the movie alone. I couldn't even get through the movie because it did not promise what it was supposed too. Don't say you are a comedy and then not be. Would not buy again not even if it was a $1.00"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Friendly Film","review":"A hilariously funny action disney comedy that is fun for the whole family and Vin Diesel makes it a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"the pacifier","review":"very funny movie,real good acting by all,as for the service it was fast the movie came in real good shape,i have watched it several times and realy enjoy it,THANK YOU,i will recomened to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vin Diesel is the most EPIC actor of my generation","review":"Pound for Pound, Vin Diesel is the best actor in Hollywood. With such critical acclaim from Fast and Furious, Chronicles of Riddick 1,2, &3...11, Saving Private Ryan (Caparzo, the guy who gets taken out by a sniper. He is without question very EPIC and if you didnt pick up the sarcasm, you probably wont enjoy his finer works in A Man Apart, XXX, and Boiler Room. But if you enjoy Lady in the Water, you'll enjoy Vin's entire catalogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Shakespeare but Entertaining","review":"The review title says it all. It was a fun movie to watch. No outstanding performances, no knock you off your seat effects, just a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. A little predictable in places but it didn't take away from the experience. I liked it and will see it again. I plan on adding it to my personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"vin ofcourse","review":"I have seen every Vin movie. And loved them all.But this one is great not only because Vin is so hot. But because I could take my daughter to see and she loved it.And that makes a great movie in my mind. Please he's a great actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pacifier fires back","review":"The PacifierStarring Vin DiesilOkay what ever first of all I got to say DISAPOINTINGvery disapointing. To tell you the truth I love th comedy scenes but the movie over all I felt a little disapointed over. I actually expected a lot more from this movie. This movie would have maybe been okay for a six year old but Teens serious chance they wont.!?!?!By: Stephanie from Somerset Ky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I liked this movie, although I was skeptical. I just couldn't see tough guy Vin Diesel in a Disney movie, but he pulled it off. He played a good character that (like most movies) started out as a big tough guy who didn't like kids, but learned to love them in the end. A few pretty funny moments and some nice fighting scenes helped this movie get 4 stars from me. Bottomline I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"This is by far one of THE BEST family movies out there. It is such a great story. It's Funny, Sad, Romantic, and has action (not to mention the smokin' hot Vin Diesel). What more could you ask for? This is a GREAT movie!! Also, If you like this movie as much as we do you should also be sure to check out \\"Cheaper By The Dozen\\" and \\"Daddy DayCare\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor, get something else!","review":"This movie might have been better if it was the first time the \\"bad kids vs. tough guy\\" thing had been used. It seemed painfully preused, and of course, the bad kids and tough guy love each other in the end, the bad guys are locked up, the tough guy gets his hot chick. Plus, the acting was bad and, being a kid myself, I can say that kids aren't actually that way in real life; they were also painfully \\"Disney-fied\\". Go get youself a less predictable movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else","review":"I really like Vin Diesel, but I just could not stand this movie. I am not really sure who the intended audience is. I don't think it is Vin Diesel fans because there just isn't enough action or tough guy comedy. It isn't much of a kids movie because so much of it is not focused on the kids in the movie. On top of all that, I thought it was trite and boring. It wasn't the worst I have seen, but spend your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vin's BEST MOVIE!!!!!","review":"We saw THE PACIFIER today and it was a great movie!!!! I'm not gonna spoil a single thing from the movie for you but it was SOOO FUNNY! A spy is shocked to hear that he is supposed to look after a family's kids. And all that.

Where is the creative talents that Disney was known for? I'm an ex-Disney employee and spent 8 wonderful years working in live entertainment. What i found was after EPCOT opened, Eisner got to big for himself and many talented people left. Now, i worked in Orlando but would chat with many on the other coast about the movies that were being up out by Disney. Many of the old timers retired and the replacements seem to come from other failing studios. Because they didn't know about Disney tradition (Walt's traditions)the new movies of Disney looks just like anyone elses which is basically boring. I believe the big hay-day of the Disney Organization is over. You can no longer tell the difference between Six Flags, Universal Studios and now Disney. They are all the same. The glory days of Disney because of a lack of immagination is over, especailly for their movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Pacificer","review":"maybe the movie is good/great /bad don\\"t know never got to see it . It kept freezing up on me several times on instant video."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one brings it home for me","review":"I was in the military for 8 years and loved it. I was in the field artillary as a forward observer. The biggest reasons why I loved this movie was because of Vin Diesel, and because of the military terminology (front & center, do you copy, ect.) The only thing wrong that caught my attention was in the beginning of the movie where Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) was briefing his troops about the upcoming mission to save Mr. Plummer, he was a few feet away from the other troops and he was more or less yelling. That's the only thing that was in this movie that would never happen. A friend of mine didn't like the jet ski scene shortly after that, but for me, this movie touched a little on every one of my senses (action, tender moment, family, good fight scene, excellent dialougue, the lone hero (ex: Riddick, Blade) I would suggest this film to anyone of any age. I work at a hotel full time and talk to guests of all ages, and of the people that have seen it, all have liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Scene","review":"This best scene is where Shane Wolf changes the diaper of the baby. The baby makes noises and he uses tools to fix that. Then Shane Wolf does the funny part where he yells \\"Aghhhhhhhhhhhh!\\". Also, he said \\" Red Babby!\\". They showed the inside of the body inside the babies diaper. They also showed the poop on the diaper and the baby. It is gross but very funny! I swear this is the best scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Family Movie","review":"Could have done without the death and destruction in the first few minutes, but overall this was a decent movie. Not great and not rolling in the aisles funny, but pleasant to watch with the family on a Saturday evening. Ending could have been better, but this movie was not classed as a strong action flick with a solid plot. I do recommend it though and overall, the family enjoyed the movie.One final point.. I do not recall seeing a single person smoking in this movie. That is a major point for me when my kids are watching a movie. Even Disney rarely puts out a CLEAN movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and entertaining","review":"The Pacifier is worth taking your time to watch. It is a lot of fun. The theme has been done before, but what theme hasn't been done a thousand times? The friendship that the kids and the SEAL develop is heart-warming. It isn't reality - but who wants that? I love a fairytale and this is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The movie is okay for younger children and while there were some funny scenes in the movie & laughter from children in the movie, it didn't hold my interest at all. I'm a fan of Disney but really wished they'd go back to annimated movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello Rock Bottom, I'm Vin Diesel","review":"Has he ever made a good movie? I'm just curious, I'm not being negative about him. Has he really ever made one. I've seen 4 of his movies now, each one of them worse than the next. But heh, I guess this isn't the Chronicles of Riddick."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL","review":"I laughed throughout the preview for this film FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS. Even in action movies Diesel blew big time and now this travesty? What happened to Disney, just because Diesel has such big muscles and the typical \\"deep\\" voice doesn't make him worth a crap. Even without Vin Diesel this movie would suck. All of the other reviews with the girls crushing on Vin need to grow up and give this movie what it deserves: a swift kick up and over into a smelly, greasy trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY GOD WHY????!!","review":"I only went and saw this movie because I was curious how well Vin Diesal could pull off a family comedy after all the action movies he's done. He needs to stick with the action movies. This movie was horribly cliched, after the first 10 minutes I knew pretty much how the rest of the movie would lay out. It was poorly scripted and the acting felt like it was forced out. The whole \\"Hollywood tough guy trying to be family friendly\\" has been played out. It was okay with Arnold, when Hulk Hogan tried to repeat it, it wasn't as good, with Vin it just isn't worth the try. Please save your money and time and go see something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad timing between the U.S. and the U.K....","review":"Beginning this year, I made a promise to myself that I would refrain from watching anything cut from U.K. versions of film but left in U.S. versions of films for five years (like a long new year's resolution). Well, as of 2nd quarter 2005, my promise was broken! Both when I saw this at the drive-in (in which a couple days afterwards, the BBFC finally posted that movie on the database as pre-cut), and when the DVD came out here in the States (only to mend for a family problem, AND the BBFC posting a DVD entry in the database saying THIS WAS CUT!). It's just I think the way movies are handled across the pond are better than here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But the movie's still great. I'm only giving this one star becuase of Disney's poor timing from the U.S. release of their movies, to the U.K. release of their movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"*groaning*","review":"This movie was one of the worst ones I've seen in a LONG time. It had a plot so predictable that my friends and I knew how it was going to end 10 minutes into it, and whaddya know, we were right! The antics of the two teenage kids were childish and immature to the point that they drove everyone in the room to throw popcorn at the T.V. The ending was just like the countless other \\"action\\" movies you may have seen. Save your money and rent it if you still want to see it, or just don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fare With an Unlikely Hero","review":"Great trailer for a comedy that seems to get the crowd going. The crowd howled when the trailer played at the theater. The premise: a tough undercover agent takes an assignment to protect a family. He becomes a turbo nanny to the kids, and approaches his role with as much enthusiasm and gusto as a any other of his toughest deadliest assignment. Vin Diesel in this role is hilarious since he's the image of tough machismo. A good vehicle for Vin Diesel, this will show that he's not just an action star, but also a comedic star."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that about??!","review":"Okay, let's get one thing straight, the acting was pretty good. All the kids were cute and adorable and do a pretty darn good job on their parts. Vin Diesel is good and lovely to watch, and Lauren Graham is in the movie! (Think: Lorelai Gilmore). Though, Lauren looked different for some reason, I couldn't quite place it; added pounds? new hair style? I don't know... anyway onto the storyline, or lack there of.To put it simply, it appears the object was to write a movie with Vin Diesel in it, in the style of Kindergarten Cop. However, someone failed to hire a good writer, or director! They rushed through the intro and cut through the blah-blah's (substance) of the story just so they could arrive at the part where they could \\"showcase\\" Vin Diesel in this role of a tough guy caring for some adorable kids. It's not convincing; so many scenes just happen they leave you feeling like you had whiplash.All in all, it's probably a great movie for kids about 8, 9, 10 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the best movie I've seen.........","review":"Hello. My name is Shelby and I'm 10 years old. When I watched the Pacifier, I really thought the acting stunk in most parts. Some of the comedy was a bit corny too. It got kind of confusing, going back and forth from subject to subject. And come on, NINJAS breaking into their house and tying everyone up because they want a stupid little computer program? Give me a break! I've seen WAAY better movies than this. It was funny and it's a pretty good family movie, and that's what counts. But otherwise, it wasn't too decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUMMER OF 1973 ALL OVER AGAIN!","review":"I have not heard this album in over two decades but I remember well that summer it hit New York!

I watched it with one of the filmmakers in their own living room. If there was supposed to be some part of the movie that was for the horror enthusiasts or political reformers, please let me know. I think it must have been hidden in all the unnecessary exploits of naked women. Long Pig does not even have a plot line that their own script writers could follow. All I gathered from it was a few random stories of college kids partying, and completely non-related cannabalistic deaths. Overall, I feel like I wasted 3 hours of my life on a video of Girls Gone Wild: Horror Movie Style. I believe that this movie is more for Mystery Science Theater 3000 enthusiasts rather than horror enthusiasts and if by a political statement they mean taking 3 hours to say nothing at all then sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Rocks!","review":"I love this CD!

Now that I have some taste, I think I'd rather heard David Cassidy. These guys couldn't be much worse. In fact, whenever I hear \\"Jukebox Hero,\\" I think Lou Gramm sounds like someone is pulling out his teeth with a doorknob and some string. Actually, he sounds that way on most of their songs. \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\" is totally cornball schmuckism at its worst, and \\"I Wanna Know What Love is\\" makes my nose bleed. These guys are lucky they were big when they were, because sickening puke like Maroon 5 has taken their place.

My mind has been blown, because I haven't heard Jukebox Hero or Cold as Ice enough. How many times can you put the same ten songs on a CD? Apparently not enough if you take into account Foreigner. I guess the question should also be asked, how many times will Foreigner fans be fooled into buying the same ten songs? Well, judging by how well these schlock-rock poster children's albums sell, I'd say at least four or five times.

The only complaint about this CD is that it contains the shorter version of Hot Blooded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff Buy It Today!","review":"I really like this album it is really good for anybody who starting to get into Foreginer. Now there are those of you who say that their are some songs missing I personally wish that \\"Rev On The Red Line\\" was on this CD. But isn't it true that on every greatest hits album you will find someone who isn't happy that a certain song isn't on it. But thats why there are the individual albums out there so you can get the famous songs and then you can buy their individual albums and the songs you really like.Now that that is out of the way this is a great album. Every song on here is great. Especially \\"Cold As Ice\\", \\"Hot Blooded\\", \\"Feels Like The First Time\\", \\"Jukebox Hero\\", and \\"I Want To Know What Love Is\\".This is one of the best Foreigner albums out there. This is a great one to start or end your collection with. This truly is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Juke Box Heros\\".","review":"I never really thought of myself as a fan of \\"Foreigner\\", but after getting this, and suprisingly knowing almost every song, I guess I am. Classic rock radio must be kind to this band. This has all the hits you would expect, and then some. It includes \\"Hot Blooded\\", \\"That Was Yesterday\\", \\"Dirty White Boy\\", and the cool \\"Urgent\\". Besides numerous rockers, they also had the smooth ballads \\"I Don't Want To Live Without You\\", \\"Waiting For A Girl Like You\\", and the song of a thousand school dances \\"I Want To Know What Love Is\\". That song actually gave me chills when I first played it. Overall I would say this is the best of their few collections, and will go great with your \\"Journey\\" and \\"Toto\\" cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs","review":"There were only about four songs that appealed to me.

It's got all of the hits, very little in the way of filler (if any) and it has great sound. If you want more than this, get the Definitive Collection, but this should certainly suit the casual Foreigner fan.

Unfortunately, the statistics are so old in some cases, the students to which they applied could now have their own kids in college. For example, the data for the U of Wisconsin SAT scores is at least 10 years old. Current scores total at least 200 points higher. Also the library data of 4.8 million volumes is over 1 million shy of the current figure. As they buy about 100,000 books per year that's a 10 year gap. Several other factual errors are easily spotted. There are no bars on Mifflin St-it's State St. Students work out at the SERF, not the NAT. The SERF was built at least 15 years ago.

Ok, about one half-of-a-second, 3 note solo. Whatver happened to those long bluesy solos which showed you how mean Joe Perry was?

But Mercer's book in pretencious; sterotyping the genre, and the lack of info on thesubculture is unforgivable; given this egomaniac's know-it-all-attitude.

I learned almost two months before the First Season was come out. I was so excited. I've waited along time for this, expecting the full season.But as anyone will see when they purchase this, there is no complete season.

I love the series and have watched all 13 segments.But please--don't be surprised--you won't get the whole season."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the deaf community-not closed captioned!!","review":"Our family loved Touched By an Angel. We gave our hearing impaired daughter the Season One DVD set for Christmas. Imagine her disappointment to discover the set was not closed-captioned. It is shameful to ignore the deaf community who should be able to enjoy the inspirational message portrayed in the series with the rest of the family. It has sadly tainted the wonderful feelings we had for the series. I wish you could have seen the excitement on her face when she opened the set on Christmas morning, then seen the tears in her eyes when she tried to play the DVD's and learned they were not close-captioned. Shame on CBS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"I have watched touched by an Angel years ago on TV, so when I bought the DVD I couldn't wait to watch it. Well I have to say I got it very quickly, but unfortunately it would not work. I have two DVD players & it wouldn't work on either. I was so disappointed. I went into the website to find out how I could returned it& it was so complicated I just left it. I still have it & am very disappointed every time I look at the box. Mayby if someone reads this they might be able to tell me how to return. Fintan Moloney."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WAIT IS OVER!","review":"Finally, Touched By an Angel on DVD! We waited a long time for this and hopefully we will see all nine seasons released. I would have rated this 5 stars, but found a wee bit of disappointment in the video transfer. Many times throughout the episodes the scenes appear grainy and uneven (the exception being the two part series finale, which is an excellent transfer). I felt a lot sharper picture could have been obtained. But, I forgive this for the privilege of having these episodes. (I would like to say that Paramount did an absolutely stunning transfer on the Laverne & Shirley boxset! The picture was stunningly clear and the colors vibrant! Kudos for that!) This DVD set also has 4 audio commentaries that are delightful, and give some nice insight and behind the scenes details. Overall, a delightful release that will sell well. Looking forward to Season 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"touched by an angel","review":"Excellent, I hope the rest comes onto video. It is still as of Oct 2009 on the Hallmark channel if you want to preview it. Season 5 started and you cannot buy it yet.

If you need a reminder...this series may help and heal. I am sending it too the 14 yr old twins we have who's mother died and their dad had a heart attack and is in the hospial right now, I need something strong yet soft and realistic to life, as well as age appropriate for all to send to others right now.

After 6 weeks of dodging hurricanes here in Fl, I found this series to be so relaxing. This series is an excellent stress releaser. It reminded me that there are people in far worse circumstances and I. There is help in some form for all of us. All I have to do is ask for it.I hope that the whole series is released and soon. TBAA is a show that the whole family can watch and discuss together. For those engaged in religious education TBAA provides a forum for religious instruction.I also enjoy the singing and the comments. I have missed some episodes over the years and now I have a chance to see them again. I sincerely hope that the complete series is released and soon.

I suspect that the rain gauge has difficulty sending the remote signal through the walls of a house -- which is what you need to do! I could get the unit to work fine with both the gauge and the base unit in the house, but I could not get a transmission from outside the house to inside.I followed up with Cheney Customer service and found that the device will not transmit through the metal or brick of house frames. This limitation should be prominently mentioned on the box!Other than that, there are battery indicators for the both base and gauge, settable millimetres (0.0) or inches (0.00), and a large display of the rainfall. I really wish that the system worked. It would be fine if it could transmit the remote signal to the base unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works, it works well","review":"I am on my second exact same model rain gauge and now this one has quit as well.

So the Amazon base price is about $15 too high, not to mention the additional shipping cost.The original unit didn't work - the digital display jumped from zero to .66 inches all at once triggering the alarm (with no rain falling). Then we had a rainstorm, and it read .00 inches the whole time. I thought perhaps I had bought a lemon, so I took it back to Walmart. They cheerfully swapped it out for another. Same story for unit #2 - the counter just jumped from zero to over an inch. Walmart once again was very nice and refunded all of my money.Given that a couple of people have had good results, I'm guessing the design is OK but the manufacturing QC over in China is poor.

While it's new & smooth it may work for a while but as the poor quality plastic weathers, it either seizes up or drags to the point that readings are way off. Very poor design!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This was the 2nd Acu-Rite wireless rain gauge I've received as a gift. Each lasted less than one rainy season...spring thru fall. Each of them worked ok for about 3 months. I kept an old see-thru gauge to compare. The Acu-Rite was terribly inaccurate after 3 months. The official weather reporting station is only about 5 miles from my house so I felt confident our rain fall amounts should be similar. The Acu-Rite proved time and time again that it was Acu-Wrong. A few days ago we received .80 inch of rain. The Acu-Wrong reported .000 for 24 hours after the rain stopped. The next day the gauge read .36 inch of rain. The sending unit and receiving unit were approximately 20 feet from each other. The only obstruction was a sliding glass door. I have removed the new batteries and thrown the unit away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good wireless rain gauge","review":"This does a great job giving you a fairly accurate estimate of the amount of rain you have received. It is easy to set up and works great. I had one before I purchased this one (same make and model) and it worked for about 5-6 years. You will need to change batteries occasionally but other than that, my old one lasted for 5-6 years. I put the outdoor unit on my deck and the indoor unit is about 25' inside. I recommend this product unless you are looking for an exact reading on the amount of rainfall. If so, you should purchase a professional gauge. This one may be accurate but I haven't tried to verify it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this. Get an EZ Read","review":"I bought this as an \\"upgrade\\" to my EZ Read.

The reliable EZ Read showed 7/8\\" the sophisticated electronic rain gauge had just 0.27\\". So, the fancy electronic model is off by a factor of 3.5! Forget this unit. Buy an EZ read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A peice of junk","review":"After trying three of these, this wireless gauge is a piece of of junk It has an outside gauge, which becomes inoperative after a short time and an inside unit that also has a very short life. And they go through batteries very quickly. I kept taking the defective ones back to the store but I finally just gave up on the product.I should have known better. Any thing made by Acu-Rite I have has been a piece of junk. But that is what you get for buying anything made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acu-Rite Wireless Rain Gauge","review":"This rain gauge should be avoided in my opinion.

The receiver display unit fell off a table about 3 feet high onto a wooden floor. It never worked after that. I disassembled it to see if there were any loose wires but no luck.

Some as high as $ 30 + $9.99 S&H. This thing sells in most Walmart centers for just uner $ 20.00 with NO S&H to pay extra for. I bought one. It simpley preformed poorly. I have two manual gauges and a very accurite rain gauge on a Davis Vantage Vue weather station to judge it by. This product failed to measure rain accurritly each and every time by as much as a full half inch off. So, figuring I just got a \\" dud, I returned it to place of purchase and got another. Same results. Measurments were way off the other gauges ( which, by the way were all accurite with one another ) Its just a cheaply built plastic toy, that for serious weather buffs, and maybe even some not so serious ones, is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well enough for two years but then...","review":"This served me well for two years. It transmitted the info through bricks, glass and metal over a distance of 50 feet for about two years until the batteries needed replacement in the exterior unit. After that problems mounted, performance became spotty and I finally threw it away after three and a half years. Never did like having to unscrew four tiny screws just to change the batteries in the outside unit. This by itself is poor design. Not worth price and frustration for just two years of good service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaney Instrument Wireless Rain Gauge w/ Monitor","review":"Don't waste your money!!

This will then not come back up unless you turn the hub off and back on again after it's cooled down a bit. This also means that you can't use it to connect any critical components such as a usb mouse or keyboard to it (obviously not a great product if you are afraid to use it for its intended purpose).

If I powered it down for maybe a half an hour then re-connected it, everything was fine for several weeks... then it would happen again. I went through several cycles of this, but eventually it stopped working for good.I went to our IT guys and told them it had died. They gave me another one (same model) and the same thing happened -- okay for about half a year, then erratic, then dead. Both were rev 3's.I love the design, especially the top-loading ports.

But just about every piece of consumer computing equipment I've bought from them has been unreliable, this device included. For that reason, I'm steering clear of them for a few years. This might be my bad luck, so if you really want this hub, fine, go ahead; but if mysterious problems happen with your computer, it's probably worthwhile suspecting this hub.

The only problem I find is that the hub doesn't stay securely in place. This hub is still is well worth the price and I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"I've used a number of Belkin products over the years with no problem. So when I added USB Adapter card to my Mac, I decided to replace my older Belkin USB 1.0 Hub with this model. Bg Mistake because the product only worked a month. I noticed that the Hub got extremely hot then started to quit working or giving me a low-powere message.After looking at other reviews for this porudct, I realized other people were having the same problem as me. I contacted Belkin but they told me it must be caused by one of the devices I have plugged into the Hub- an iShuffle, Canon IPX 4300 printer and a Canon 1220 Scanner. I've tried different combinations and one item at a time to see if that would fix the prblem but nothing worked. As soon as the device heats up, it quits again. So my advice would be not buy this product unless Belkin fixes the problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ran Hot, Died Early","review":"Purchased in December, 2007, this hub worked OK for about 7 months until it began causing hangs and slow-downs on an iMac.

Avoid this and try other models that have good customer rating on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had 2 units die","review":"I love the design of this unit, and it's very convenient having the ports on top for quick connect of thumb drives. However, I had one die after using it awhile. Belkin replaced it for free, but after I loaded this one up with devices and used it for a bit, it died as well. I really need all the ports because I have many items connected to a notebook with only 2 internal ports, but I'm going to give up on Belkin and look for a different hub to replace this one. Reports here talk about overheating, so maybe someone could get by if they don't have much connected to it. For reference, I have the following on mine: printer, keyboard, smartphone, headset, external hard drive (2 ports), USB cooling pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything BUT Belkin from now on","review":"This is the second Belkin hub I have purchased. It will not power any usb device I plug into it, and my computer will only intermittently recognize any device I plug into. However, if I disconnect the hub and use that same port that I use for the hub, everything works correctly.The larger problem though, is when I left my mp3 player plugged into it as a test to see if it would eventually charge (it did not), when I grabbed the hub to disconnect the usb, it was too hot to touch. This is a definite safety hazzard. I replaced my last non-functioning hub (also a Belkin, but on a different computer) with this.

After removing add-ons, reinstalling the HP printer, rebooting countless times, and before using the hammer-fix, I unplugged the printer cable from this hub and plugged directly into the computer's USB port and of course, it worked as before. This Belkin hub was used for the original printer installation and in service for about six months before \\"dying\\" from no appararent cause.

I feel this is not a toy but a learning tool to help parents work together w/their child to learn in a special place that is all their own. so far she likes for the writting (arts and crafts) but not so much for the leap pad but we will work on that : )As another reviewer pointed out Crayons don't come off as easy as you would think it should.

The desk right out of the box was a cinch to assemble. All the legs simply snap in. Six screws hold in the little cubby hole/tray and other than that - I had it assembled in about 10 minutes.The My First Leap Pad that comes with this desk is specifically designed to sit/secure on top. The leap pad can be removed for extra space - like coloring or other projects. The basic book for the Leap Pad is a variety of ABC's, shapes, music, and so on. A great little beginner book.The desk also comes with several stencils, stamps, ink pad, crayons (NOT the washable type) all of which have their own space to stash.Overall, this is a great toy and one I'd recommend to anyone. It is designed for small bodies and hands, doesn't take up alot of space, is educational and very functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks Easily","review":"We got this for my son for Christmas and here we are, barely two weeks later and the leappad that accompanied the desk is already broken.

At least they won't cause your child injury, hopefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Lefties !","review":"The Leap Pad attaches to the left side of the desk, leaving the \\"doodle\\" space on the right.

It didn't make it 24 hours before there was stuffing all over the floor, and shortly after, our dog was pulling the squeakers out one by one. In all fairness, the legs of the toy lasted longer than most. the double stiching there and elsewhere is great, but the head of the octopus was the easy entry for our dog to be able to access the stuffing inside!

The toy did create a great deal of excitement & fun between our 2 cattle dogs but unfortunately the poor creature was de-headed, de-stuffed & de-squeaked in less than 3 days. Yes, a great deal of tugging & pulling was involved but that is also what the eel sea creature & fire hose squeak 'n fetch toys go through daily.

Side note - you wouldn't believe how much stuffing is in one of these little guys! If you have a really strong, determined chewer you may end up disappointed too.

She then ripped into the legs and removed two squeakers in less than an hour.Note my dog has done damage to all toys except the classic kong and bounzer ball.

It lasted about a 5 weeks until he trotted up to me and dropped a chewed-up squeaker in my lap. There's no layer of stitching in between Oscar's arms and body so despite him still being mostly intact he couldn't be salvaged (couldn't risk the dog pulling all his stuffing out).Overall, it was a good buy, and I would recommend this toy for smaller toys with a powerful instinct to chew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!","review":"$18 dollars and it didn't even last two hours!

Where else will you find a sympathetic book about the history of astrology written by a Senior Lecturer in Classics at the University of London?I often use this book in my astrology classes to delve into the fascinating history of our favorite field.Tester takes it from the very beginning -- the Greeks, not the Chaldeans as sometimes supposed -- and brings it right through the Middle Ages and the Age of Enlightenment. Chances are you've never heard astrology talked about this way. If you are a history buff, like me, it's just all that much more interesting. It's history the way you never heard it taught, too.Tester's work is scholarly but readable and I found the information just fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scholars only","review":"I believe that a good history book should be more than even brilliant scholarship. It should be interesting. It should tantalize the reader to go deeper into the subject.

Scholarly and readable are not contradictory terms.If you share this belief, then avoid Mr. Tester's book. I'm sure the scholarship is fine (just like your high school history text). But this book isn't fun; this book isn't interesting, it's a bore. The erudite Mr. Tester shows no emotion, wit or enthusiasm in this numbing display of pedantry.My guess is that Mr. Tester was from the \\"no pain, no gain\\" school of education: learning isn't meant to be easy.

It didn't spray in a stream, it mostly was a narrow spray with no range. Label said \\"Kills on contact\\"; I had wasps crawl through it and start flying around. When it ran out of pressure there was about 1/4 to 1/3 of can contents remaining. I suppose I could have gotten a bad can, but that's a 100% failure rate for me. The price was right, but I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"According to the product's label it:- Kills wasps, hornets and yellow jackets and eliminates the nests where they live and breed.- Kills dangerous pests on contact.- 27-foot jet spray lets you keep a safe distance while you eliminate wasps and hornets in their hard-to-reach nests.I've used this product on the same wasp nest for a week every other day only to watch the nest and its population grow and thrive. The nest probably doubled in size. Using it to try to take down a single airborne wasp wasn't much better than a squirt bottle of water. Most other brands foam up and prevent the wasps from flying. The Spectracide side product remains a liquid and many wasps easily flew 25 feet or more to a nearby tree.I feel lucky I wasn't stung.

I liked how he designed the arms and legs with standard wire. If you are going to do character maquettes then you cant go wrong with this video.Reason for the -1 star is that the video is almost entirely for character models and those that are not over 2 foot tall.

The music is very primitive, with repititions kind of like Judas Iscariot or Darkthrone. This CD has a great dismal atmosphere and is recommended, however, I think you should check out their \\"Faustian Dawn/Within the Sylvan Realms of Frost\\" double CD first (includes their first 2 albums and various demos/rehearsals), as I feel it is a better introduction to the band, and also a more \\"black metal\\" feel. If you like that release, check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought it","review":"Very good music, easy to listen to.

I give it 5 stars cuz it lives up to what it says it is. I just didn't know what that was until it was too late. I thought I was buying a soundtrack, but that is not what I got. So if you want music, don't get this. If you're really into Speed Grapher or japanese audio dialogue, then go ahead and get it. I find no fault with the item or the merchant.

The curriculum, for the most part, is a mile wide and an inch deep. Hirsch's book does little about this, and in fact exacerbates the problem.

From the crowded interstellar space craft to the deep underwater world of small, low ceiling habitats and submarines, this story leaves you conscious of every breath you take. You can almost smell the dampness and the odors of the sea.While I have enjoyed reading Jeff Carvers trilogy, I have to admit it was not my favorite book of the three.

On the computing side of things, the kids can easily wander the program on their own, it is very friendly.

The recordings were made for the Office of War Information and, except for some inevitable deterioration after a half-century, have some of the best fidelity of any Miller sides anywhere. The music goes far beyond the usual Miller standards: the selections cover the incredible breadth of the AAF Band, ranging from straight-ahead jazz to serious classical performances by the string section, along with unusual mixes of the 2 genres (e.g., \\"Pearls on Velvet\\", \\"Blue is the Night\\"). A real eye- and ear-opener for anyone who only knows the civilian band, and a tantalizing hint at what might have been, had things turned out differently that December afternoon in 1944."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Broadcasts: I'm Glad They Are Not A Secret Anymore","review":"This CD outdoes the already fantastic Lost Recordings. Sound quality and performance are the best I have ever heard of a GM band. I heard a story that Miller used to record the band's performances out of his own pocket to judge their playing. If he did do this for his civilian band or the AAF band, I wonder where those secrets are hidden away?"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Reductionist' Dub","review":"Imagine the effect channels on an old dub-reggae mixing desk; they'd be noisy, full of warmth, colour, and probably the heartbeat of any respectable dub track, with most of the chattering, shuddering chord material and light percussion trickling along and repeating until they disappear into the depths of inaudibilty. Well, 'Reduce' features this tone-colour throughout its long, sub-bass driven tracks, complimented by kick drums that harken to the hardest of techno. The album, while unique, sometimes flounders about in its own material, and the listener can feel less than welcome - as if the tracks are too occupied with their own agenda, and us 'mere' listeners are an extraneous option; cast aside like a soggy tissue. This feeling is only fleeting, and it is the album that draws these same listeners back in with some seriously catchy sub tunes and clever delay effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tomahawk","review":"I thought I was buying a replacement handle but got a nice tomahawk instead.

Like Rich \\"rubbing\\" Sue, Sue's break down and then ripping Jeff a new one, Jenna's mom, the godfather move that Boston Rob did to Lex, Boston Robb calling Big Tom son dumb and the Jury meltdown. Also the cast commentaries was great. You could clearly hear that these people have not gotten over it. A fight happen between Shi-ann and Alicia in the commentaries.

Hugh is the kind of man every woman wants, just enough arrogance to make you realize he's a man, and just enough tenderness to make you fall in love. Maddie is the typically high strung executive woman trying to eke out an acceptable career that will keep her in close contact with her artsy family. She is insecure in her job and her looks. When she was rejected by Hugh (after having had a flasy romance with Maddie's flamboyant beautiful sister), Maddie is not very willing to give it another try.

A hero who continually calls the heroine \\"Babe\\" in every second sentence gives me the pip. I think Ms Krentz was trying for an \\"Indiana Jones\\" type adventurer, but it didn't come off.The hero, Hugh, who we never really get to know, and Mattie are uninteresting characters. I thought Hugh was crass and Mattie a right twit.

Something about this particular assemblage of pickers, and the material they recorded for Columbia, just plain clicked. Personally, as only a casual fan of Bluegrass, I would say this concert is a four-star event, musically, here in the new century. However, it was an historical moment when their Appalachian sounds were offered from the stage which had hosted every famous classical performer of the 20th century. So add a star because the mountains battled Manhattan on that December night in '62, and the mountains won."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flatt and Scruggs Live","review":"This album was not as good as I had hoped.

Finally, at the end of the day I finished building. This set is beautiful to look at and what's more beautiful is the look at your friends faces when they see it.I own about 200 sets, most of them on display, but as a centerpiece this model is a sure attention grabber. Of course it has problems, I had the same magnet problem, but if you don't touch it's not a problem.

So, if you don't mind building a set for over 12 hours, and you have space in your house, then I really suggest you buy this.

I got a back pain, headache, and lots of persperation while building the bridge on the floor.

Dark, strange, i listened to the first track with the lights off: I had to turn on the lights, because it's too much sinister ! Excelent violins, oboe, basson, perfect. The strange dialet spoken in the beggining is astonishing, as dark as the gutural voices before the Daniel Dennis drums starts the epic-like rythm. The two other tracks are excelent, using the same standard of La Faulx, the first and my favorite track. A dark album, very intense and complex, excelent arrangements and a pefect fusion between rock, chamber music, medieval atmosphere and dark tales. An essential choice for people that like Magma, Art Zoyd and similar bands !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"If your child plays with the L-Max as much as mine you will make up for the cost of this item in a few months from not having to constantly buy batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"No mrore batteries!!!!!!!","review":"I was reluctant to purchase this charger after some reviewers complained about the magnet contacts.

The play time is great and I don't have to worry about the expense of batteries anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use!!","review":"I give this 5 stars because:1. we always know where the L-max is ~on the recharging dock!! before we got this recharging system the kids would never put the leapster away =(2. the kids can put it on the dock themselves where as they cannot change the batteries themselves.3. Never worry about the batteries going dead, this charge lasts all day.We tried using rechargeable batteries and it was just a pain to have to switch them out at the end of the day. I have way too much to do, worrying about batteries is the last thing on my mind. Just set it on the charging dock and leave it. when the green light is solid its fully charged, even my 2 year old knows that we need to put the leapster on the charger when his sister is done playing.When we get our son his own leapster we will be buying another recharging system for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.

And, the charging device that came with the Ni-MH batteries is much more compact. PLUS, when the L-Max eventually dies, you can still use Ni-MH batteries for other electronic devices.

It's a coffee table tome, but slightly smaller, so it fits easily in the hand, and the historic photos, both black & white and color, are crisply reproduced and delightful to study. The text manages to be both learned and droll; the author is evidently a lover of both airplanes and animals, and an elegant, engaging writer. You'll choose your own favorite airborne animal. Mine was Billy, the goat with a parachute, and Kiddo, the airship cat. And there's the Red Baron's flying Great Dane! Not that he's likely to have had a hamster. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Heart Of The Sixties","review":"It's been scientifically proven that \\"Get Together\\", written by Dino Valenti (not on this CD) is the emotional center of that golden, innocent era. This CD is a musical and lyrical brother to that great song.There is an innocence and naivete to Valenti that some may find silly... but personally I find it refreshing and life affirming to briefly escape back into the warm days of my youth.The melodies and guitars are shimmering and beautiful, Valenti's voice is a perfect echo of 1969...warm and earnest and sometimes strident.I briefly owned the 8-track tape 35 years ago, and debated over whether I would be dissapointed in the music if I purchased it now. In fact, I like it far more now than I did when I was 18.If you like Valenti's more melodic work in Quicksilver, \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" by David Crosby, \\"On The Way Home\\" by Neil Young... or if you just want to recapture \\"The Bright Elusive Butterfly of Love\\" (I'm laughing as I type this), I think you'll like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Nelson Broadside","review":"Once more James L. Nelson brings Capt Isaac Biddlecomb through one scrape after another. Hardly allowing the reader to catch his breath from one crisis to another, the Nelson style of 'no frills' and clean descriptive action plummets our hero from disaster to victory in a whirl wind of action. Never before have I been so dedicated to a story that I could not put it down before the smoke cleared from its final action. Mr. Nelson ties his fictional characters so closely to real history that sometimes it is difficult to unravel fact from fiction. I highly recommend this book to all lovers of tough living, hard fighting hero's of the high seas."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"Another attempt to mine the Hornblower vein - featuring unbelievable characters (Smeaton??

The harshiness of the audio recorded from the sax and the electric guitar are overpowering an otherwise balanced piano and bass.The accoustic guitar of Clapton was almost silent in one of the songs, he was playing most of the song while the camera was filming the silent strings.The content is still valuable enough to keep it as a good memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Boring\\" ?? ...I beg to differ, amazon editorial","review":"This DVD is a sensational value!

Everyone shines here. No blazing extended solos or gratuitous jams; just great musicians having a good time. This is, above all, a groove performance. Steve Gadd simply has to be one of the best \\"pocket\\" drummers of all time, and Joe Sample doesn't play the ivories so much as tickles them. David Sanborn hardly needs an introduction, and Marcus Miller on bass is just fun to watch.

He still presented us with awesome licks during the course of the show; even if it didn't quite fit in.Marcus Miller is DOPE!!! Simple as that. His being on this show is such a treat.Joe Sample is a wasted talent here.My main gripe?! DAMMIT!!! Somebody tell David Sanborn to stop hoggin all the solo spots! Even when they're playing ensemble licks - He's hella loud! It got really distracting and annoying. I was ready to turn it off just because of this him.

At 175 pages (the rest of the \\"book\\" is taken up by notes, bibliography and index), the book is WAY too short. Couple this with McDermott's teeth-grindingly annoying insistance on referring to Indian raiders as \\"avengers\\" (ostensibly for Sand Creek), and this is a book to avoid at all costs.As a counterpoint, readers might want to look at \\"Massacre Along the Medicine Road.\\" Although I detest the PC sensibilities of this title, it is beautifully written and a pleasure to read.

They're all good Irish folk songs, and Sinead can allegedly sing, so what could go wrong?Lots. This is the worst CD I've bought in years. It was _painful_ listening to it once, and I'll certainly not do it again. Mind you, this is not a case of an old \\"folkie\\" being put off by a modern arrangement. That kind of thing can be--and has been--done well. This is a case of a singer applying a single monotonous and absolutely dreadful effect on 12 of the 13 tracks on this CD: all of Sinead's singing is overlaid with a heavy reverb echo that is as pleasant and unremitting as a dentist's drill.I'm sorry folks, I'm disappointed. I really wanted to like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reverberation","review":"I mainly bought this CD because I love the song \\"Peggy Gordon\\", but did she have to sing it so s l o w l y ...?

Why is it that an Irish musician who should know better filled the recording with meaningless synthesized background music while distorting her beautiful voice with vocal processing?

In addition, I had seen her do traditional songs (He Moved Through the Fair, among others) live in concert. So I just knew this album was going to be GREAT! What a disappointment, even an appearance by Christy Moore cannot save this sad work. Sinead's arrangements are terrible. Everything has been \\"elevatorized\\". Instead of wonderful traditional Irish instruments: guitars, banjos, fiddles, penny whistles, pipes, etc. - all the tracks on this album sound as though they're done on a synthesizer. This is one of the worst Irish traditional albums I've ever heard. If you want a real traditional Irish album, buy Paul Brady's \\"The Liberty Tapes\\" or anything by \\"Planxty\\". Don't waste your money on this recording like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"should've gone with the minority vote","review":"I read quite a number of reviews before I decided to get this and, while not a huge Sinead fan, I am a huge Irish music fan and have been moved to tears by some of the old Irish songs I've heard her sing on other CDs (\\"Skibbereen\\" will rip your heart out & make you want to hit the next Englishman you see!). I must say, I should have gone with the minority vote on this one. What moved me to tears on this was not her voice but the fact that I spent money on this CD at all! It was PAINFULLY overproduced so even songs that might have been able to hold their own sounded.....distorted??!! Anyway, I listened to the whole thing once...will never listen to it again. It is, in fact, on the pile of CDs to go to the used music store, where, hopefully, they will buy it. Maybe someone else will like it (obviously, quite a few Amazon reviewers already did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a crushing disappointment","review":"I thoroughly expected to love this CD. But in fact, it is the most annoying, cloying and aggravating project that I have ever wasted my money on. It is so incredibly self indulgent I can't find words. Almost every track has this grating echo on screeching vocals that are annoying enough without it.The tragedy is that there is so much GREAT music today that starts with traditional Irish and Celtic music and infuses it with a modern esthetic that it is a crime to waste your money on this garbage.If you love new Irsh music and you buy this , you'll feel like a child who gets a rotten apple for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"as gaeilge","review":"Nil aon bhri le teideal an album seo!

This new album is very strong, but I wish there were more than two songs sung in the Erse. The liner notes include Sinead's introduction to each song and it's interesting to learn why she was drawn to them. She doesn't come right out and define what \\"Sean-Nos Nua\\" means, but I gather it roughly translates to \\"songs done in the old style.\\" It is a nice collection and her voice is as expressive as ever. The best moments for me are her duet with Christy Moore on \\"Lord Baker\\" and her version of the anti-war song \\"Paddy's Lament.\\" A surprising inclusion is \\"Molly Malone,\\" which I'm used to hearing as a sprightly song, rather than as the dirge it really is, as Sinead notes.

Well, it did okay in the garage, did fine on the one place I needed to take it, and now the battery is totally dead. Won't take a charge even though the light is on. While I might be able to figure out a way to swap the battery, my experience with things like this is that the battery alone usually costs more than the whole unit (I only paid $20 for mine on a special weekend sale). It just barely works if I plug in the charger and let it sit for 30 minutes...and then only if I leave the charger plugged in which you're not supposed to do (as it may blow the tiny transformer in the charger).

I am by no means an expert on Autistic behavior, but I can say that if you are truly a hands on, use common sense type of parent - this book is NOT for you! For example, in one section of the book it clearly states that you do not reward bad behavior - isn't that something we should already know?

Their romanization is the most confusing I've seen, with several words jammed together to make large, hard-to-read words. From what I can tell, this course also totally ignores the tones in Cantonese, making it extremely difficult to tell exactly which word is being mangled in their horrid spelling. It's obviously intended as a companion to a course in their university and is almost useless on its own. The very first lesson contains dozens of new words used in poor context. Definitions are not always easily found and the native speakers in the audio/video clips are so fast I suspect they work in an auction house in their spare time.Don't waste your time here.

The selection of pieces is quite good, but everything else is shadowed by Antonio Soler's mesmerizing Fandango. Anyone who is familiar with this piece will understand immediately why it dominates the record.For those unfamiliar with Fandango, it is a must-hear piece. Based on folkloric sources, Fandango moves to ever increasing tension, never really hitting a climax, but leading the listener into musical worlds that were psychedelic before the term. Antonio Soler was a monk priest at the Escorial and had a keen interest in science as well as music. His fandango is probably the best known, and Yates does it tremendous justice.While nothing else rises to the level of excitement of Fandango (how could it), the rest of the album is highly enjoyable. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes harpsichord or Spanish music, as it is clearly Iberian in character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rhythmic Jumble","review":"Sophie Yates is a fine technician, and this is an admirable program. But it annoys the hell out of me, because it constantly falls out of rhythmic focus, becoming a jumble of notes instead of the invigorating musical experience it could have been. The primary melodic lines are often drowned out by the guitar-strumming backgrounds, which lose their impetus as a result. The tricky caesuras, particularly in the Soler Fandango, are just plain botched.My absolute favorite Soler Fandango is a mind-blowing traversal by Jonathan Woods, but the touchstone in this repertory is the work of the late Fernando Valenti, whose immersion in the electrifying spirit of Scarlatti in Iberia sent sparks up my spine. Here, there are a few stretches where one hears the music with clarity -- until it all falls apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello, this is for a road bike!","review":"True enough; when I pulled this bag out of the shipping box I was reminded of that old '60s show 'Land of the Giants'.

For the next quarter-century, these two would produce some remarkable music. Hart's brilliant lyrics perfectly matched Rodgers' melodies. Hart struggled all his life with both the stigma of homosexuality (things were unfortunately different in the 1930s) and alcoholism. Drinking may have contributed to Hart's premature death at age 48, in 1943.The RODGERS & HART songbook has some fine examples, yet too much of this duo's best work is not here: \\"Blue Moon,\\" \\"My Heart Stood Still,\\" \\"Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered,\\" \\"Mimi,\\" \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World,\\" \\"Ten Cents A Dance,\\" \\"My Funny Valentine,\\" \\"In The Cool Of The Evening,\\" \\"The Lady Is A Tramp\\" and \\"Where Or When\\" are all worthy of inclusion.
