I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult.I don't think it helped that I just finished The Case Against Wal-Mart by Al Norman.I think it's great that Wal-Mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really didn't have access to a department store or discount retailer, but I can't get over the desruction of American businesses, American jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for American workers (not to mention all the foreign workers who produce Wal-Mart goods) that have become standard operating procedure.

The history and folklore of the plants are discussed with particular attention to their hallucinogenic and medicinal qualities (both plants are poisonous). Classification of the plants are illustrated in detailed charts that show flower shapes, fruits, measurements of flowers, and basically everything (and more) than you would ever need to know. Other chapters cover cultivation, propagation, building a collection, natural changes (in brugmansia) and diseases and pests. The accompanying color photographs are excellent with amble close-ups and many full plant shots. Highly recommended for anyone interested in these outstanding and exotic plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My husband takes this to help his Heal Spurs and it works great.

Black metal probably cannot be any blacker than this. This is so extremley evil, that it scared me at first. I felt all the horrifying and hellish qualities of this album come out of the speakers and tear my heart out. It is almost too black metal for me, and I'm a guy who truly enjoys countless satanic black metal bands/albums. Anyway, \\"Panzergod\\" is a highlight on this album and is evil sounding enough to make almost anyone s**t their pants - black metal should have that quality. This is stuff that will haunt you forever. This stuff makes Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir look and sound like Michael Bolton.

There are some black hole dense rhythms and an overall atmospheric touch Darkthrone would find acceptable. The album is worthy of multiple spins. Behind the screaming bloody murder there's even some strong song writing, clever hooks and respectable musicianship.In a modernized way, it reminds me a bit of what I liked about old Misfits albums: they were interesting and \\"catchy\\", but lyrically brutal.

The guitar seems to be put together well and the 15 watt amp will ring your ears.As soon as I received it, I replaced the stock strap, cable (came with 6 foot, changed to 20 foot) and put on extra-light Elixir Nanoweb strings.I took it to a friends house who is an experienced guitar player, he hooked my guitar into his expensive amp and we were both surprised how well it sounded. He then hooked his expensive electric guitar into my amp and I was amazed how clean and loud the amp sounded (boy, was I happy and smiling from ear to ear).I also bought a guitar stand to keep the guitar from being damaged by lying it on the floor.A previous reviewer stated that they received an Instructional DVD. A DVD is not advertised with the package and I did not receive one.I am very happy with this package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price","review":"I just got this package a week ago and I can't keep my hands off of it. Sure the amp is small, but is quite loud for its size. Loud enought to annoy the neighbours anyway. The modeling pre-sets are all great and the three band e q allows for far more control over the sound than you get with most amps this size.The Guitar itself has great action, though as with most strat copies don't even bother with the whammy bar unless you like re-tuning every time you use it. The high e string that came with it snapped right away but I replaced it a new one and have no probs since.Sure it doesn't compare with my vintage Telecaster for playability and the amp doesn't compare to my Roland 50 watt combo..but for the price whaddaya expect?.I really think this little package is a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"when you pay pitance you get pitance","review":"Not a very good guitar.

Please, unless you have a daughter around the age of 1-6 don't even think about buying. The movie is so predictable & most of the characters you loved in the original become your least favorite. The story is completely like the first, Ursula's sister, Morgana wants the king's triton & uses Melody's longing to be a mermaid as her advantage. None of the songs are at all good, the character Melody is too gullible & unlikable, characters like Flounder, Ariel, & Scuttle become the stupidest of the whole movie making Melody look good, & the villian Morgana is too looney & not at all evil in my eyes. The only good aspects of the movie is the stunning animation & the very funny Sebastion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to eat Flounder","review":"Like most people I loved \\"The Little Mermaid\\" when it came out and I was much younger. I still think it's a great movie which is why I feel like never buying another Disney product ever again because they completely ruined it with this sequel. If I had known how Ariel was going to turn out when she grew up, I would have been rooting for Eric to have caught her on the end of a fishing hook and had her for dinner.

I gave it two stars for keeping the attention of my first daughter when she was 2-5 years old, and the attention of the my second daughter when she was that same age. Now at 5yr she already prefers the original The Little Mermaid, for the story and \\"people in it,\\" Poorly written, musical composition is very uninspired, with the addition of being cheaply drawn; the lack of time and effort is evident through out the film. It seems Disney was a little too eager to ride the wave of their original hit's public love affair after releasing it for the first time on limited DVD in December 1999. I know LM2 was a straight to video movie and is not expected to be comparable to the theatrical release; however if such a large company is going to put out a sequel to a great hit, they need to take the time and make an effort that is a commendable, not lamentable, work of entertainment/art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Plot, No Follow Through","review":"The songs are horrible, the characters have become caricatures, and the dialogue is completely inane.

As much as I loved the original and it's wonderful cast of characters, this sequel should never have been made. It's as bad as it gets - from the terrible animation, lifeless character designs, to totally forgetable songs - an embarassment from beginning to end! It just doesn't have that incredible gee-wiz sense of wonder and innocence and dazzle that the original had. I fell in love with the Little Mermaid when I was 18.

You have been replaced by a bad replica.She's a rigid, irrational parent who evidently learned nothing from her own story. The first movie ended with a meeting of the \\"merpeople\\" and the humans, but we find Ariel's teenaged daughter knows NOTHING of her roots? What kind of garbage is this? It makes no sense whatever when viewed in context of what happened in the original movie. Who wrote this? Where they the same people who ruined the \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" sequel? (Fortunately, due to this sequel, I rented \\"Scamp's Adventure\\" [see my comments there], so I didn't waste my money buying it.) Fire them, before they screw up again!Then there's the otherwise re-tread of a story and the forgettable music. Yuck! Sheesh! Give me a break!

I enjoyed all the characters and songs. I'm glad Jodi Benson came back to do Ariel's voice (I don't think anyone can do it, but her). Yes the movie is like the first Little Mermaid movie which is still good, but perhaps too much like it. It felt like the writers couldn't think of any story for the movie so they went and basically rewrote the first Little Mermaid movie to fit the sequel, but don't let that discourage you from buying this awesome movie! I love \\"Down To The Sea\\" and \\"For A Moment\\"!! Melody's voice is SO perfect!! The extras are nice also. Even though the story lacked somewhat, the music, voices, and rememberance of the first movie is enough for this flim.

The other noble children laugh at her supposed klutziness... She's a PRINCESS, for the sake of heaven. At age 12, she is considered an awkward teenager, and to top it off, Sebastian manages to hide for 12 years before Ariel notices him around.It gets little better when she meets Tip and Dash, who are so reminiscent of Timon and Pumbaa it's not even funny.The majority of the songs are pointless and ill-placed.

About the only person that enjoy the movie was a little girl about 2 years old, and even then she was hardly sitting still. I remember when a movie wasn't a musical. Now a days there is a song every 5 seconds. About the only good point to this movie is if you have the first one and you are a collector of this series then buy it. I'd suggest watching it one, on mute with sub titles. Unless of corse you are a big muscial person.

WHile I am pleased that there is at least something out there for little kids these days, I was disappointed with the movie. I did not connect with Melody, and Ariel was like nothing I remembered. The only thing pleasing (and, I must say, humorous) was the presence of Sebastian. He alone retained the charm of the first film.Of course, maybe the reason I didnt like this movie is that I am now an adult.

And what happened to Eric? In the first movie, he was adventourous and handsome, but in this movie he looks like he could be Ariel's teenage son! And he acts like one too! Did Disney want to keep him out of the movie so we couldn't notice the voice change? And if you listen very hard you could see that they used a lot of dialogue from the original. Yesterday I saw my 11 year old tape of The Little Mermaid, and when you compare the original to the sequel, it's like a 100 to 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Mermaid II","review":"movie got to around scene 17 & froze, well I guess that's what I get for buying 'used' dvd's, sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"music is awful even for children","review":"Hearing this movie would cause any parent and child to commit suicide. The music and the acting is very poor. Disney definitely need to work on their sequels. Just seeing the movie was just painful to see. The plot is just like the little mermaid but the opposite direction. Part of the problems with this story is the background is week the villian is a spitting image of the villian in the original. This movie is a waste of you money. If you own it dump it. If you think about buying it don't. It is just plain utter trash of movie. Disney could have used the money else where promoting other movies or a revision of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"I ordered this product on Jan. 1st.

The item was not delivered in one day, despite having paid for a 1-day delivery. The item arrived on Christmas Eve and was delivered by awful, awful UPS to some random neighbor though I never gave permission for that. The item delivered was a fake copy of the movie, so it only plays on certain DVD players. All in all, it was a very bad experience for the amount of money paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under The Sea Again!","review":"THis film was a notable sequel to the story of my favorite Hans Christian Anderson tale.The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney Animated film to date. I loved everything about it. And, although the technology for animation has changed, the magic of characters and lyrics and musics is by far the best in this film still.Now, to the sequael. It would make sense that Eric and Ariel have offspring, but what would he or she be like.Well, typically the kids end up being completely unlike their parents. And this is no exception. Melody is curious, adverturous and often doesn't listen. This gets her into trouble.This cause Atlantia and Ariels father King Triton to take action. Why? Who knew Ursela had a sister - that made sense! (Played again, brilliantly by Pat Carrol using a twist on her voice.The story is fun and the music okay. Kids willlike this sequel but it still doesn't hold tha magic of the first that seem to hook adults all over the world.The DVD extras are fun too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!!!","review":"I'm a 14 yr. old girl who grew up watching the original movie. I was so excitied a bout a sequel! Then i watched....It is ALL WRONG!!!!!!!!!! Areil is just s another adult, she is so boring!! Sorry Disney but this movie ...I hope that you watch the movie to gain your own opion,but mine is one word.....dissapointed! oh welll8ter, Kyra"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"The Little Mermaid 2 cannot compete against the first Little mermaid movie. Disney really should not have made a second part. It would have been much more better if it was left alone. This movie lacks the romance that the first Little mermaid had. Eric and Ariel don't seem to be so much in love as in the first movie. Marriage and responsibility seemed to have made them grow distance towards each other. They treat each other as friends rather than husband and wife. Their daughter, Melody is rather really annoying. They should never have made a second part to the Little Mermaid. Nothing can compare to the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little nothing.","review":"from a Disney fan...The storyline to most Disney sequels is usually bad. The same applies to this Little Mermaid sequel. I don't mind that the drawing has less detail than the original - that is understandable, but the story is really boring and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like this.....","review":"I have to start with the fact that the Little Mermaid is at the top of my Disney movies \\"favorites\\" - and I really (really really) wanted to enjoy this. The story is sooooooooooo contrived. We barely see Eric (can we please get these damn Prince's involved already???) and did Ursula's sister really have to have her voice? I \\"heard\\" this movie a couple times while it played in my car on the DVD player - and hearing it without watching it drives me MAD. I just cannot un-see Ursula in the scenes where she speaks. If you can pick it up cheap, it's worth a watch - but don't pay full retail for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorky","review":"This is by far the most dorky Little Mermaid movie. First off Thats great that Ariel and Eric have a daughter. Plus they made the story dorky. Ariel's sisters never show up so shouldn;t Melody have aunts? lol They could've make this movie a lot better. Plus It was all about Ariel never telling her daughter about the ocean, so this movie was super dorky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I myself, love the first Little Mermaid. This was highly disappointing. One of the worse sequels I have seen. Maybe young, young kids will like it though. I believe Disney tried to hard to make a sequel, and it was released just for the money. The drawings looked different, the characters don't have the same lovable sound as the first one. I think they tried to hard to make it funny, it could have been so much better, or they shouldn't have made a sequel at all. Nothing compared to the fist wonderful one. Don't waste your money, rent it if you want, but it is not worth buying at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to buy","review":"Needed a last minute gift, no car, screw running to Walmarts.

Give 4 stars only cause its not as good as the first one but it is still a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased overall","review":"First of all I would like to say that I worried about getting a pirated copy of the movie I purchased. Unfortunately, the DVD is out of print now, so I had to take a chance in purchasing the DVD. When I received the movie, the box and the inserts looked very authentic, however, the label on the DVD itself looked as though it had been manufactured or copied from an original. When I inserted the DVD, it made a horrible groaning sound. Eventually the sound dies down, but for the first few minutes of the the movie, the sound is quite annoying. I don't know if I got a bad copy, but my daughter is pleased none the less. That makes the purchase worth it. I did receive the movie in time to wrap it for my daughter's birthday, even though I made a late purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Doesn't compare to the romance and fun of the original \\"Little Mermaid.\\" Ariel needs to recover some of her spunk and Prince Eric needs something to do besides smile and look fatherly!!! Meolody is a spunky, adventurous character, but the rest of the movie is basically a rehashing of the first \\"Little Mermaid\\" story. Songs aren't as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed","review":"Purchased as a special gift only to be informed that it is not viewable in this \\"region\\". I am very upset and want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars is more like it!","review":"First of all I loved the original because it's a love story and follows the fairy tale tradition. This however is an insult to my taste and love for disney films! I'd rate Disney tied in creativity to Anime! I despise disney sequels;with one exception \\"Toy Story 2\\"! Steer clear of this sham film! Sequel S stands for Sham, E stands for effortless ,Q stands for quick fix ,U stand for un-original ,E stands for economic hoax ,L stands for Lifeless! Conclusion avoid other titles \\"Lady and the Tramp 2\\" \\"Lion King II Simba's Pride\\" and \\"Return of Jafar\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it was an option, no stars...","review":"When I was a little girl I fell in love with the Little Mermaid, now, at seventeen I decided to check out the sequal, at least there should be good music, Right? Wrong.This movie is a pathetic attempt of Disney, while I liked the Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, Return to the Sea's characters are pathetic, it lacks all the romantic element the first one had and is replaced by a stupid child who can talk to animals, being the the only one in the kingdom who can, and not knowing she is a mermaid you'd think she suspect something, no?Even the music is nearly the exact same as in the first, and this gives a bad name to the Little Mermaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ariel's back, more than ten years later","review":"It was 1989 when Disney Pictures reinvented, once again and quite succesfuly, the animation motion pictures. The storyline, the technique and the music made \\"The Little Mermaid\\" an enjoyable film for both young and adult. Everything that has come since then is obviuously modeled after that (Disney and non-Disney). In this follow up, produced especifically for Video and DVD, the much beloved characters are back (and not in the much inferior TV-Show version), many of them with their original voices: Jodi Benson as Ariel and Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian. The DVD version is obviously the best option, considering the high quality of earlier Disney animated DVD releases such as \\"Tarzan\\" or \\"A Bug's Life\\". Four new songs and a new version of \\"Part of Your World\\", that will play homage to the original music composed by Alan Menken and late Howard Ashman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Crap","review":"Ariel was adventurous and fun in the original, in this one she wears too much lipstick, she's annoying, and she is incredibly boring! Don't waste your money. Like someone already said, time to eat flounder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Sequel","review":"I have a 3 year old daughter, whom is now into all the Princess'. She watched Little Mermaid one time, and after the enchantment of the fins had her hooked to wanting to watch it every day. When Little Mermaid II came on Disney channel one night, it changed everything for her. She loves Melody, Ariel's daughter. No other Disney Princess movie represents a princess that has a mother. They are all passed on, or non existent. Melody and Ariel has a great relationship, like any young adolescence child and her mother would. I think this movie is a positive role model for children, and yet there is nothing to buy with Melody represented, which is a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Now Dotted Cow","review":"13\\" Oven Mitt - CowhideA person who lives a thousand miles away and whom I seldom see will receive this oven mitt very shortly.

This purchase was made to remind her again of our great visit at her house. I cannot tell you the breed of cow, my roots are in the city, but its coat was very much like this mitt.

This book was about absolutely nothing. It didnt make me want to read it from the jump but after being given it by a friend I went ahead and read this waste of paper. I cant go into everything wrong with this book because I dont have enough space in this review area, but I can tell you this; storyline was on crutches, characters were 'average' and 'expected' - so many things about this book were just 'typical' of this new AA Urban Fiction genre. This story is like she took a piece of all the great ones out there and made one big story.

Silver was schooled my her mother a lady of the evening that wanted more for her child than she had. Silver took a chance or Chance,and fought for her man, because the eyes don't lie!

WAITING FOR THE NEXT NOVEL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a little while...","review":"I must admit that I almost didn't finish this book. It was starting off way to slow and \\"regular\\". It dang sure didn't keep up that way. This was definately one of the better urban novels I've read in a while. This book will hold you until the very end.It did seem a little \\"not real\\" at times. Like how could Silver's mother be sooooo wise and have all this knowledge and STILL be a hooker? Didn't make sense to me but this wasn't a history book, this was a fictional novel and I enjoyed it as such. You should as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effulgent!!!!!","review":"There are very few that can critique a book and mean what they say. What I am about to say comes from the heart. This is the best book I have read in years. There are no words that can express how much I enjoyed reading this book. I am not just saying this because of what everyone has viewed the book to be. First, let me be frank & tell you that I rarely read books, but I had heard too many people mentioning this book. I overheard some people on the streets talking about this book called \\"A Harlem Girl Lost\\", and I am a firm believer in hearsay so, I immediately went searching for this book. While in the store, I started reading the back of the book to get an overview. I read the first page of the first chapter and had not been in the store for 20 minutes & was almost done with the first chapter. It was then I purchased the book, read it, and I have no regrets. It is definitely a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the nearest trash can?!!!!","review":"I am so angry that I spent my money on this utter and complete garbage. This book is a soap opera gone bad with absolutely no plot and was all over the place. Characters jumped into the story out of nowhere and they never fit in and it totally made no sense.

There were so many twists and turns, right up to the last page. I didn't want this book to end. It touched all emotions. What a powerful story. I loved Chance and Silver. Silver, was in a class all by herself, a love story made for the movies. Treasure Blue you really did the thang with this story. I don't want to give it away, but for those who want to read a good Urban Lit book, you will not be disappointed in this book. I felt for each character, and who would have thought that Mitts, was who he was.

This book for sure is from one of the best and in my opinion an urban lit classic.Treasure Blue takes you on an old school journey as well as an emotional one while we follow Silver Jones and her life dealing with all types of drama, set backs and highs that will leave wanting more.Just when you think the climax has come to an end he hits you with another twist...the first thing I said was \\"No way!..\\"I only give it 5 stars because they dont allow 10. I've been a fan of his hustle game now I am a fan of his books and look forward to reading more titles.I smell a movie here....AJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written with clear bias","review":"I got \\"The Minnesota\\" looking specifically for historic accounts of wildlife along the Minnesota River, knowing it would mostly be about people. While it was lacking in wildlife accounts, I found instead a biased document account of the Minnesota River. Based on his choice of words throughout the book, published first in 1962, Evan Jones highly regards the efforts of white explorers, settlers, and politicians and is repugnant toward native people, lifestyle, and landscape. This blatant bias makes this book very difficult to read if you are a person just looking for facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bright Start","review":"We purchased this one at a local store- again after reading many reviews from Amazon...but waiting until the last minute!! Out of the box it was missing a part- so I called the customer service for Bright Starts the next day...within just a few days we had the replacement.-Excellent and courteous customer service on their end. Our daughter was 5 months old when we first got it for her. She immediately loved the see saw toy and loved trying to eat the spinner ball!! I understand and sympathize with parents whose children have had accidents while using this toy- but accidents do happen. We have loved this seat and would recommend it to any parent! And if the need arises don't hesitate to call their customer service for replacement parts like beads, bars etc- again they were very easy to work with when I called."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for Baby!","review":"Although this looks like a fun and entertaining toy for baby, the beads that twirl on the rounded bar have sharp 'wing' and 'antler' type things that stick out. We got this for my 6 month old grandson and as he bobbed his head he ran the risk of taking out an eye! We dismantled and removed those beads but I cannot believe that this would pass a safety inspection for babies. I would pass on this and purchase something safer for baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for the price","review":"My daughter loves it. I got it for her at 4 months. Like the other users, I just put a blanket around her until she balanced better. She likes the sounds it makes when she bounces on it, its not too bouncey though so it helped her learn how to stand and built up those leg muscles. She loves turning around in the rotating seat and can get the ball going really fast. She likes the mirror because she can reach it to adjust it and chew on the zebra if she wants. She is fascinated with the seesaw toy that clicks as she moves it from side to side. She will spend hours in this toy. The piano is a little hard to reach but at 6 months she can hit it easily now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish iIwould have known","review":"This product is horrible. I am glad that my husband came home to help me put it together otherwise I would have been there all night by myself. My 8 month old daughter likes it, she loves to bounce but the toys are right at her eye level. And whenever she sneezes she hits her eyes on the see saw in the front. This is a huge waste of money, thank goodness I did not spend an arm and a leg on it. I would much rather recommend a traditional excersaucer. My best friends mother runs a daycare and has a regular excersaucer and my daughter loves it, she wont stop bouncing. The toys on the traditional excersaucers are better and they can fit them into their mouths... no pointy edges or anything, nothing can fall off into their mouths and nothing that they can hit their heads on. I wish that I would have known what I was getting myself in to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe","review":"Not only does this item have the toy bars at head/eye level making it likely that your child will hit there head on it, I've noticed that one of the height adjustment knobs for the bouncer pad doesn't lock in place. Seeing it, I'm worried that if my daughter bounces too hard, she's going to knock the pad out of its place, misbalance and hurt herself. Save your money. Don't waste it on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 8 month old son lost his front TOOTH on this item!","review":"We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Product","review":"This product seemed to be the perfect toy for my 5 month old son. After putting it together, we realized the toy bars are at eye level. So, when he gets excited and starts to wiggle around or move his head back and foward he hits the toy bars, which have pointed hard objects on them (very dangerous). He fits the guidelines because he is 26 inches tall and 20 lbs so the toy bars are just not idea with pointed objects on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item good for children with neuro. problems like Cerebral Palsy","review":"My 9 month old baby has mild CP. We bought this seat for her when she was younger, but she is just now able to use it. She loves it. It has worked well to help her with her balance, her muscle control and provides a safe environment for her to play. It is limited with the number of activities. Our only complaint is that we have to check the screws on the bottom of the bouncy foot rest, because they often fall out. But we just check it periodically and it hasn't been a problem. I have a few pictures of Hope in her seat in the customer photo section for this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the time and effort!","review":"This was the biggest waste of my money and time! It was such a hassle trying to fit all the pieces together- which never ended up happening. There were also 2 screws missing. Cute concept that just didn't work out well and was made too cheaply. I took it back and got the Deluxe Jumperoo which is the best bouncer I have ever seen. It is worth the extra money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety hazard","review":"This product is NOT safe. Every toy seems to be so hard, and easily jabbed into a baby's eye. I never felt safe leaving the room with my son in this.

I would never tell a parent to buy this...it is NOT safe. Plus they don't jump in it or really seem all that excited while in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad purchase","review":"This product just doesn't have much variety.

She loved it at first, but then about the second week we had it, the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it. Luckily I had not let go of her yet, because the whole thing fell apart on the floor. The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks. Upon investigation, the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover \\"material failure\\". I will not buy anything else from this company.

I have long been a fan of Georgette Heyer's Regency Novels but only recently discovered her mysteries. The mysteries are light reading - much like Dorothy Sayers - but with the marvelous character developement and amusing dialogue charateristic of Heyer. I found myself laughing out loud whenever two of the main characters (brother and sister) had a chance to analyze the mystery or have any discussions exploring the various characters' possible motives.I advise reading this title before reading \\"Behold, Here's Poison\\" since some characters appear in both stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"British Classic Crime - At Its Best","review":"When they re-issued the dozen or so Georgette Heyer mysteries recently, I was taken in by their appealing vintage cover artwork. What I discovered - to my surprise and delight - were wonderful English manor mysteries, similar in the Agatha Christie style.These books blend a nice, cozy, old-fashioned mystery with Ms. Heyer's wonderfully snarky and dry wit, which adds up to genuine reading pleasure. I've plowed through nearly all her mysteries and will be sorry when I read the last. I wish she wrote as many myseries as she did Regency romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"random, rote list not a good way to learn","review":"Hungry for Korean listening materials, I bought level 2 of this 3-level set. It is boring and pointless to listen to an endless list of words uttered first in English, then in Korean. Worse for Korean learners of English is the random inclusion of articles \\"the\\" and \\"an\\" before nouns. I suppose the purpose is to distinguish nouns that take \\"a\\" and nouns that take \\"an,\\" but \\"the curiosity\\" is unnatural because this countable noun would need the article \\"the\\" only if modified by an adjective clause as in \\"the curiosity that children show...\\" The \\"a/an\\" distinction is easy to learn. It would make more sense to distinguish clearly between countable and uncountable nouns by using \\"a\\" before countable nouns and nothing before uncountable nouns.A companion CD to a textbook would reinforce language learned in the context of a thematic unit, but a random list is not a useful tool for increasing vocabulary.I will not buy any more Vocabulearn CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"i use it","review":"everyday at night with straberries before sleep i dont like eat a lot at night ti e the flavor is verygood"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE JAY ROBB PROTEIN","review":"My whole family prefers Jay Robb's egg white protein.

Thank you Jay Robb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I used to buy Jay Robb's egg white protein and loved it, until they put stevia in it. I am allergic to it, and there is no point in putting it in there. Let people sweeten the protein the way they like it. Now the unsweeten egg white protein is difficult to find.

Plus whenever I use it as a shake for some reason my body can't digest and/or process it well because it gives me a wicked stomach ache I feel like crap for about an hour straight. However when I bake with it I don't have this problem. It's not that great to bake with as waffles, muffins etc blow up and get huge and then when removed from oven they deflate obviously because it's egg white powder.

I have yet to try other egg white protein powders, but have tried both the vanilla and chocolate varieties of this one. They were both so sweet they actually made me nauseous...I don't eat a lot of sweets, so maybe I'm just not used to it.

It's the fact that this particular company selling it SHOWS a picture of Jay Robb and SAYS Jay Robb and then sends you some BEE POLLEN protein from another company.

Anyway I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible headaches, wished this worked for me","review":"This product was recommended to me by others who had success with it.

This product gave me massive headaches, and it took a day or two after I stopped taking it for them to clear.

I was really excited to try this protein since I began following the Paleo diet, but I was greatly disappointed. I can't quite pin point what it is exactly that makes this protein so gross, but I just couldn't do it. After one sip, I gagged and had to put it away. I've tried my fair share of proteins, and I am usually pretty good at just powering through them, but this one was just too gross.I'm not super excited about sticking with my current protein because it has a very small amount of sucralose in it, but it's a small price to pay for a protein I can drink warm or cold and at my leisure.Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Very Disgusting Protein Powder","review":"I purchased this product yesterday at Kroger! I thought after reading all the reviews that this stuff was going to be the bomb-diggity in terms of taste. However, when I took the first sip, I about gagged and spit it out - at least I wanted to spit it out but I was driving. I didn't make the connection at first that the product was just gross. I thought it had to be the milk. But, to my dismay, the milk had not gone bad but rather it was the protein powder that was disgusting. I am sooo disappointed. What makes him say this stuff tastes so good? Seriously? Who was involved in the taste test for this?Anyway, I'm done with the bad review. Just know that if you plan to purchase this mess, don't do it for the taste, especially since the price is exorbitant, rather, purchase it for the benefits as I am sure everything else it purports is fact.

On some of the songs you can just tell that the singer is trying to copy Corey Taylor, right down to his inflection. Two or three of the songs have a more melodic side, but the lyrics are just crap.

I had hoped to see them again in anticipation of them touring in support of their second album which MCA had agreed to release. Sadly, in June of 2005, Andrew Howard and Ben Goins parted ways with the band for their own reasons. Not too long after that, Andrew Howard was found dead from unknown causes. I am glad that I was able to see him on stage for those sole 20 minutes, he is greatly missed in the music community.

After that, the band falls into a boring R&B-meets-Linkin Park drone that lasts most of the rest of the album. Even the few parts that poke their head out of that muck aren't enough to make you forget when you just heard and/or be optimistic about what's coming up. But those first three tracks...super-aggressive, super-pissed, and very loud and offensive.

I had not listened to this album before buying it. I bought it on faith. And it was faith well placed. David J continues to prove that he is one of the smartest singer/songwriters working today. This album seems a lot more personal and open. He was going through a divorce and that emotion really comes out in the music. It also reminds me alot of \\"Songs from a Different Season\\" which had a much softer feel than say \\"Urban Urbane\\". I highly recommend this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Jesus!!","review":"This is another well written book by Max. I enjoyed this book and the message that was in it.

It has been very powerful as each chapter brings a \\"minor\\" element of Jesus' death to a new personal level.The beauty of this book is that it reaches your heart no matter what your circumstance. For those who do not know the love of Christ to those who have grown up in the church always knowing that Jesus died for them...this book gives a shocking revelation of the extent of God's love through rich, intimate pictures.The Gospel accounts of the Jesus trial and death have a deep and personal meaning for our youth since we studied HE CHOSE THE NAILS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lenten Reading!","review":"We are doing a Lenten study using this book. The short chapters are easy to read and very thought provoking. I was especially glad it came in large print for a friend of mine who has trouble with her eyes. We have enjoyed it very much.

His intense love was shown to us by becoming a mortal being. God wrapped Himself in flesh, was criticized, laughed at, scorned, and crucified, just so we could be saved. And the way the Max inspects even the tiniest details of the cross and the emotions behind it, is certainly most intriguing and unique. I have had this book for a week and I have read it twice. If you have trouble realizing God's love for you, or you are doubting, you need to buy this book and be refreshed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be more pleased","review":"We have purchased a number of books now from Amazon, at WAY below any retail price and all have been exceptional quality.

Forget music transfer or sound quality issues ... this ISN'T Asia. And the management and everybody tried to pull it off as if it was, at the time. The concert itself and the build up, up to it was one of the biggest scams the American music business had ever perpetrated on the public, particularly the people of Tokyo, who loved the band Asia so much they took it in whatever form they could get it.

Well, Kirk Douglas plays a Sheriff whose wife was just raped and murdered. The clue to the identity of the killer comes from a saddle he recovers while in pursuit. Oh yeah, he knows who the owner is right off cause it belongs to his best friend from the good old days, one Anthony Quinn-who is more comfortable playing Greek fishermen and Mexican banditos. Not much intrigue here folks. Anyway, ole Kirk just saunters into Anthony Quinn's ranch (aka. Saddle Owner) just grinnin' and yucking it up like old times.

The characters are not just deep but convoluted with a complexity that would make fine subject matter for a novel unto itself. That is only the beginning of this book however, the Macroscope is a fantastic invention of PA's imagination and the none of the socio-political implications that such a device would have on society are missed in PA's treatment of it.

I won't go too much into this book in particular, others have done a better job of that than I could.Buyer beware, though, that the formatting of this book is a bit of a mess sometimes. This is my first kindle e-book I've purchased, and I really hope they're not all like this. There were many places where separate lines of dialogue are clumped together into a single paragraph, making it confusing and difficult to pick up on who's saying what. Several words throughout are split, so they appear somet hing like that.

It does have 92 pages of recipes with beautiful photographs of food. In the beginning of the book, there are tips for reducing fat and sugar in general food preparation.

The solo on Blue Highway, which I understand he recorded in one take, is a flawless classic; and his playing on Flesh For Fantasy is some of the finest, tastiest stuff I have ever heard. Neither he nor Idol ahve ever recaptured that genius.As for Bozzio, listen to Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop.

The writing is fresh and snappy, painting the atmosphere of each successive city through dialog more than description.True, there's more here about what Barcelona's hot dogs tasted like (great) than who scored Barcelona's goals (who cares?), apparently annoying for some but a big plus to me.

He is bright enough to see outside the box that his culture tries to keep him in, but is amoral enough to use his impressive skills literally to start wars and pull down nations to achieve his own personal objectives; \\"sociopath\\" would not be too strong a word to describe him. Parker does nothing to make Vaatzes more sympathetic to the reader as the book proceeds.In short, if you enjoy well-crafted prose but do not demand characters worth caring about, you may enjoy \\"Devices and Desires\\"; otherwise, I'd recommend avoiding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for a long trip","review":"I am really enjoying this book.

I especially liked the names he created...unlike anything else I've seen or read recently, which is a nice change. I'm kind of tired of books with characters who's names seem slight variations of current day names, with unusual spellings. The author has taken pains to create unusual but believable characters, and created a world that works in similar, yet oddly different ways from our own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving up on page 260","review":"The idea for the book is pretty cool - hey, how often do you find books about engineers. The writing flows decently well - I have seen much much worse. With all that, I am on page 260 and do not see a reason to continue reading the next 400 pages. The rhythm and the storyline just do not avail themselves to something this long, not when there are much more captivating books out there. So, I have enjoyed the reading while I could, but at this point I cannot bring myself to care about what happens next with the characters. This rocket could not overcome the earth's gravity. I have given up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review by an engineer","review":"This book falls in the uncommon category of books I chose not to finish. It's horribly drawn out, much like Quicksilver, another book I had to give up on. The politics and characters in the neighboring countries are boring. Even the main character is a total drag. I stuck with the book hoping for some good action when the big battles came around, but the focus skipped past them for the most part. I can accept that in a TV series without budget to do a battle justice, but words have no limits. Besides the war, the plotlines are dreadful. Too much time is spent in teen-angst over \\"repressed love\\" letters passed back and forth between two of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"Ok, I almost never review on Amazon, but I really felt the need after reading this book. It was the biggest waste of money I've made in a long time. The characterization felt very forced with the characters feeling very artificial and the descriptions of people changed rapidly from scene to scene with little to no justification. Furthermore the plot relies on several glaring Deus Ex Machina's and has quite a few plotholes that even Parker's final detective in the parlor way of having the protagonist explain himself doesn't really fill up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rather throw myself down a flight of stairs...","review":"I don't know if you people are reading the same series as me. I bought the trilogy at the bookstore after going through the first chapter, because it saves time in the long run as I read a lot of fantasy. Her writing style is good, but the plot, or what is meant to pass as one, is atrocious. I have never given up on book, and usually don't write reviews, but I am now halfway through the second book and I quit. The pages are thick but I still may be able to get my moneys worth when I run out of Charmin. Honestly what's to like? What kind of special olympics superstar gives it a 5 star review? It had promise- I did buy all 3 after looking them over, but after over a 1000 pages of suffering I have now lost all hope that the series will realize its potential.

Peake is a longtime employee for the CIAwhose chief task is pushing out agency propaganda, as well as running a little detective agency to supplement his CIA pension. Peake is not a historianand does not have a bone in his body that is able to produce anything that comes close to accurate and objective writing.

This book goes into depth that will assist someone in full time ministry, but the material is explained in a way that anyone else can easily comprehend it.

As a result, there is economic stagnation, poverty and despondency. The people for whom apparently the revolution was made, are shunted off.Unfortunately, this novel has no plot, no main characters, no progression.

The more you bleach your hair before application, the better it turns out.Every other dye I've used begins fading within the first week and needs to be re-applied way too frequently.

I LOVE this stuff! My ends didn't bleach as well, so they were a little darker and over processed, but the colour still looks ridiculously nice, and I get nothing but compliments on it all the time.If you want orange hair, try this stuff. It's amazing.

That was a stupid idea and is probably a reason why it didn't sell as well as the previous albums and would begin their downfall on the charts. But for fans, like myself, this is well worth having in your collection.

There are a couple of tracks which I keep playing over and over again and they are Take Good Care Of Her and Maybe Someday I also like the track Something's Wrong as well.Once again David has really put his heart and soul into the songs, and when listening to the songs I can really believe in the songs. I can only end by saying that after listening to this album, I am really surprised it didn't sell more copies than it when the album was released in the seventies.

And it finally happened, and you can all thank me (just kidding. I must say this is a very good album and a lot of teh songs bring back memories of the televison show. This album is far superior to the Family's prior release \\"Shopping Bag\\" (which is currently oput of print). Although origionally this album wasn't overwhelmingly successful, it should have been, and it is well worth it. A must for any partridge fan.

I appreciate the backup vocalists, but without Shirley Jones there would be no Partridge family sound with the beautiful harmonies. I have the complete Partridge Family catalog on vinyl and cd.

Bad sound quality.. even if the songs are good.. you can't enjoy them. I was severely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defintely do not buy this","review":"This CD features very lousy live recordings and indeed several repeated tracks. While the repeated tracks are alternate versions playing a song without the background noise of the beer hall, the fact that they bothered to do that makes me wonder why they didn't include only the less noisy version on the CD and make room for more badly recorded original material. There are plenty of German drinking/folk CD's on Amazon that are better than this. Go check those out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring music, poor production - AVOID!","review":"I have an extensive collection of Oktoberfest and European polka music and this could be the worst disk in the bunch. The song selection seems like a random mix of 2nd rate semi-pro bands and poor beer hall recordings. It doesn't help that the music production, sound clarity, fidelity, mixing is also terrible.Here's the worst part: they actually repeat songs on the disk. Song 13 is the same song 1!! I think song 3 is also a repeat!! So, the extensive list of music is maybe about 2/3 of what's listed.Again - steer clear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Book","review":"Within cities, gay life has always been marginalised. Despite the fact that their significant places are often centrally placed geographically within cities, gay communities are not centrally placed in the political, social and cultural lives of cities. These international accounts draw on first hand ethnographic research and reflect the responses of gay men in particular to the changes that have taken place during the last 25 years in urban settings. They look at the physical and spatial development of gay places, at the same time as viewing the social placing of the communities that use those places.The cross-disciplinary studies within this book look at the tensions that arise between gay communities and their cities, the political and economic implications to city planners of the \\"pink pound\\" and the legal and social implications for gay men as they attempt to reconcile being both the outsiders and insiders of city life."},{"rating":"1","title":"W.T.F.","review":"OK, CHECK THIS OUT, i love chimaira, no doubt about it..they are one of the best metal bands to come along in a while...but am i the only one that thinks watching this dvd is like watching some cheap kung fu flick from the mid '70s!?!?!? they could've spent an extra 15 minutes making sure the audio matched up with the video being shown. anyway, like i said, i love chimaira, but am very dissapointed with the dvd. better luck next time fellas"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Chimaira","review":"I love this band and I like having their DVD in my home to see them when I miss them and they are not touring.

The only valuable entries were specific people's personal ships, like the Lady Luck or the Wild Kaarde.

I highly recommend this eye-opening and very personal novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galant","review":"This gripping and enlightening narrative about modern life and the law is an irresistible tale of romance and marriage, separation and divorce--and paternal love. The story weaves the reader through a father's suspenseful struggle with a heartless legal system, in costly attempts to gain custody of his young son from the hostile new family of his ailing former wife. Sadly, the situation is made worse by the consequences of the ex-wife's rapidly deteriorating health and her ultimate inability to function as a mother.

It gave me trouble for months and I finally threw it away. It claims the be able to capture to .avi format, at 640x480+ resolution. In reality, however, it cannot capture to .avi using the supplied software. If you use 3rd party software (i tried them all), you can capture to avi, but not above 320x240, and even then, there are serious glitches. Furthermore, the supplied software can only capture to MPEG format, which wouldn't be so bad except that it DOES NOT capture at VARIABLE bitrate... so you have to set a fixed bitrate for the capture and it ends up eating up your entire harddrive very quickly. This card is absolutely worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"Although this product is good for the price, remember you get what you pay for.

The same applies for \\"the Three Marias\\", mixing fluidity and rythm. The trio works well though I would enjoyed more solos from the side girls.

Wimmer portrays the Artist, in various incarnations--the frustrated, the famous, the obsessive, the unrecognized, the paralyzed. These characterizations are poignant, yet completely irreverent. As a result, Wimmer creates an unexpected literary delight: fast-paced poetry that you can't put down.What an accomplishment!As an added bonus, no male writer I've ever read, has written better about sex from a woman's point of view, than Wimmer. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Language that transforms","review":"Apart from everything else that works, Wimmer's sex scenes really sizzle, and it's his language that does the job, robust and sensitive, lush and precise, poetic and simple, all at the same time.

Good songs, beautiful harmonies. The musicians have done some thorough research and their attention to detail shows in the liner notes. The liner notes provides a social, historical and political background to the origins of the songs. The Renaissance Players make a potentially \\"foreign\\" sound accessible.

It's kinda tough, and very confusing at first. I guess after playing it for sometime you get used to what you have to do, but, my 7 year old won't play it if it's too, too hard. I don't blame him. Games shouldn't be too complicated. He really likes the Crash Tag Team Racing for PS2. I recommend that one over this one.

The game is simple to play, and beat, but the loading times are excessively long, especially since the graphics are not that wonderful. The end result is you get to have parts in a movie that is being filmed, and the person with the most popularity points gets to be the supervillain in the end of the movie.

It must be charged regularly, and after a short time the batteries could no longer hold a charge. If you open the back of the monitor to check the battery pack it clearly states, \\"Use only original battery pack. Warranty void if other batteries are used.\\" A replacement battery pack is $30-$35, but I don't want to have to buy a replacement every 2 months for a warranty-less monitor!?!

The picture quality could be better, but it is great to be able to \\"check\\" on the little one while she sleeps and plays in her crib without having to go into her room and disturb her. Money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it","review":"This monitor is fabulous. Kept me from going in and waking up my son every five minutes when he was smaller. We even have it hooked up to our TV in the bedroom so at night it projects to that instead of the handheld. It's so great and we have no reception issues unless we're out of range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for keeping an eye on my autistic son","review":"I bought this video monitor system right after we moved into a new house when my son (with autism) was 4. Because his bedroom was on a different floor, I was repeatedly going to check on him at night to make sure he was okay and still in his room! I mounted the camera for the widest possible angle -- near the ceiling in a corner of his room -- and now I can check on him all night long. (I leave the volume on very low, so I can hear if he yells, but he doesn't wake me up if he's just playing or drawing.) As parents of autistic kids know, our little ones are often very clever escape artists, so having the reassurance this monitor offers is fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"We bought this monitor a week ago and we are returning it today. This device has awful reception and very low battery life. You will be spending most of your time trying to get a clear image. It defeats the purpose of having a video monitor, that is being able to see your child quickly when you are concerned. Its incredibly frustrating waiting for the image to stabilize, most often it just doesn't. And on top of it trying to use this device to monitor the sound coming from your baby's room is impossible. All you can hear is a loud crackling sound. We are very disappointed with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme amount of interference! Not worth the money!","review":"We have been using this monitor for over 3 months and the amount of interference it picks up makes it almost unusable. It can be sitting in one spot not moving and suddenly it will go haywire and make all kinds of noise. We do not live in a townhouse setting other houses are actually quite far away from us. We don't use cordless phones and I even disabled our wireless network to see if that would help but it did not. It only gives you two different freq. channels to choose from and I haven't noticed one being any better than the other. The picture quality is fine, but that doesn't outweigh the negatives. It also has lights that light up to show you the audible level and there is no way to disable these so you can either have lights flashing randomly at night (when the interference comes) or do like I did and cover them with electrical tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitor - Does the Job!","review":"This monitor does the job. It's small and portable: I brought it on a recent 1 week vacation and it's so compact. The reception is fine, the picture is clear, and the battery lasts forever. When you don't have it plugged in the picture turns itself off every few minutes but you still hear the sound and are able to get the picture back with the push of the top button. I guess it saves the battery life. You can hear fuzz and interference if it's too close to other electronic devices but that hasn't been a problem. It also works in conjunction with other summer infant monitors (at least the other one I have) so I now have it set up for 2 rooms. You can't beat it or the price. I bought mine from babyplayroom and it arrived in a timely manner and their customer service was great. We also did a lot of research first until we came across this one.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby monitor","review":"used it one time to see how it works........ worked great....... still waiting on the arrival of the baby in Sept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reception. Upgrade to the digital model.","review":"This model monitor works on 900 mhz which means many electronic devices you have in your house (alarm clock, cordless phone, etc.) will cause static and impair the video and audio reception. I upgraded to the digital model and the reception is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but not durable","review":"We have owned this monitor for about that year. It works well, the signal is clear and it is great for checking on the baby. However, our first one broke after about 6 months of use - the volume knob stopped working. We got a replacement monitor from the company, which again broke after 6 months - now the on/off button on the top has stopped working. This product just doesn't seem to be durable enough for normal wear and tear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice video monitor","review":"We've been using this video monitor for our newborn for almost 6 weeks now. It is indispensable. The battery life is surprisingly good. Since our baby only sleeps for at most 3 hours, we have never run low on battery. The fact that it is analog (not digital) is a big advantage. Whenever there is interference (from cell phone, microwave, etc.), the picture and sound are mildly degraded rather than being lost altogether. The range is quite good -- we have used it up to 100 feet through several walls with no problem. The microphone is very sensitive which is great. If I listen carefully I can hear our baby breathing (our house is pretty quiet -- in a noisier location it might not be possible). Although the display is quite small (1.8 inches) the picture is very sharp. Even though we placed the camera about 4 feet from the baby, we can still see if his eyes are opened or closed. We're very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Reciever Moniter","review":"This product worked well for the first few months. After a while the screen on the monitor began to flicker on and off. It became more and more frequent untill it quit working altogether. We took it back to the store where we got it and the representative said he has seen many come back due to problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"i had seen this monitor at a friend's house, and when i found out i was pregnant with my second child, we remembered this monitor and wanted it instead of the regular kind we had with our first. i was so excited to get it set up, however, we were disappointed very quickly. although the video picture is fairly clear, the reception capabilities are very lacking. if we stand 500 ft away, there is so much static noise that it takes over the entire audio and you couldn't possibly be able to tell if the baby is crying or not. great idea, very poorly executed in this particular product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitor!!","review":"Purchase this monitor! You won't be sorry. The picture quality is good. No static. Does not receive interference from my cordless phone or wireless router. Good battery life. A little pricier than some of the others, but well worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS!!","review":"I've had my monitor for 6 months and have used it for probably 4 and yesterday it completely died. It's never been the best monitor- static, only 2 channels, pointless \\"color\\" - but I've dealt with it until now. A few days ago I plugged it into the wall to recharge it and it made a crazy fuzzy noise and wouldn't turn on if it was plugged in. It got so bad that I could only turn it on every now and then and only see my baby for about 3 seconds before the screen went black. Finally today it completely died. I would not recommend this product. And I never believe the bad reviews! Baby monitors are supposed to last for more than 4 months. This is ridiculous. Maybe some of them are just flukes, but what if yours is the fluke? Just don't throw away the box or your receipt if you're brave enough to purchase this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picked up neighborhood cribs","review":"I purchased this from another vendor this past weekend and will be returning it. We live in a very dense subdivision (townhouses, etc) and I was able to view 3 other cribs from the neighborhood...including sound from one of them. I'm not at all comfortable with the fact that if I can see them...anyone can/would surely be able to see into our home as well.I was hoping that we wouldn't have the problems with the interference, because it is a very nice design, video had good quality and a decent price."},{"rating":"1","title":"just OK...not worth the money","review":"I bought this video monitor because of the great reviews. I was really excited to get it, but it has a ton of static. I've now had it for 3 weeks and can only use it as a video monitor (without sound) because of the bad static. I tried changing the channel as the instructions stated, but it did not help. additionally, i unplugged all other wireless devices around the house, thinking this would resolved the issue, but that also did not work. Besides the noise of all the static, the picture goes out for a few seconds at a time (randomly) if you are walking around the house.Overall, the video quality is nice, but the static is unbelievably bad! I'm sticking to my fisher price sound monitor for the time being."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've already returned it.","review":"The audio static from this monitor made it impossible for me to sleep. Most of the time the audio and video reception were fine, but about once every two minutes a loud static would broadcast making it impossible to fall or stay asleep. By the second week of this of this, I was too jelous to watch my son sleeping perfectly soundly on the monitor while I was kept wide awake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interference, video shows other children in our neighborhood","review":"We were so excited about the video monitor. My husband hooked it up, turned on the video monitor and to our surprise saw a baby (not our baby, who is due any day now). He switched to the second channel and there was someone else's baby. If we can see other people's babies, then they can see ours, which really creeps us out. So, if you live close to someone who has the same monitor, then it is likely that you will be able to see their baby. We returned the video monitor and purchased the Philips Avent Sound Monitor, which was highly recommended on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea!!","review":"This product is wonderful!! It helps so much when you are a new parent (like me) and have th eurge to check on your baby every five minutes. Instead of creeping into her room at night, I can now put my fear to rest by picking up this monitor! Well worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great! Glad we have a VIDEO monitor","review":"We reviewed the different types of Monitors before our son was born and settled on this one after hearing good things from a friend. I am aware from the comments that people have had trouble with it, but we've had no troubles in 9 months of use. The screen is bright and easy to view. The screen's 1.8 inches is perfectly sufficient to view enough of your child to know what is going on.Many parents, including ourselves, may think why do we need a video monitor when audio-only monitors have been used for years? Well, our experience has been that our son will often wake up and start crawling around without making any noise at all. It is nice to at least be able to know he is awake, even if we don't always need to rush over. So, for a little extra money, we are glad we purchased this product. I would recommend it to all parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Wish I would have gotten this earlier","review":"With my first child I took some advice and didn't get a video monitor. People said it would make me check on the baby everytime she stirred. Well after about 6 months I wish I had not taken the advice and had gotten a video monitor because I wanted to see my baby and what she was doing so that I knew whether or not I really needed to go into her room. So with this 2nd baby I decided I would just go ahead and get this video monitor. Now that we have been using this video monitor for two weeks and I LOVE it!!!! We bought an extra camera so that we could have one in each room. The picture is very clear and it is super to switch between cameras. It's so great being able to see what the kids are doing and whether or not they are just stirring in their sleep or if they are really awake without having to go into their rooms and risk them actually waking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product on the beginning - problems some months later","review":"I bought this product when I was expecting my second baby, about ten months ago. A friend showed me how it worked perfectly for her, so I was excited to use my first camera-monitor.However, three months ago it began to fail. When I turn it on, whether it is plugged or on batteries, it won\`t work immediately. I had to walk around the room with it until it started to transmit the sound (camera works perfectly though). And this problem only went worse. Now, I have to shake the monitor, sometimes evently harshly, until it works. Tonight I spent almost ten minutes shaking it until it started transmiting.Since I live in Southamerica, I cannot return it easily. So now I only have two options: get used to the shaking or buy a new monitor.It's a shame, since I paid a good money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste money on this","review":"I had to buy a new $20 battery after one year of life, then the sound won't work, and if it is working sometimes, you also have a very loud hum. What a waste. The camera doesn't stay in place, just flops all the way down. Piece of junk. My baby was screaming and I didn't hear a thing on the moniter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 2 years","review":"Loved this at first. Great video and sound quality and volume could be shut off completely and still see image. My first one broke after a couple of months and Summer replaced it free of charge. My second one just broke after exactly 2 years. I am not buying this one again. For the price, I would have liked this to last another year or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old model was better","review":"This monitor is not great. We had the older model and you could move the camera around to see different angles of the crib. On this one you cant!! So annoying. We returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasts for 2 years","review":"Battery was out of juice after just a year of use. Screen went out after 2 years. This won't last through one kid, let alone multiple kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves us well","review":"We live in a ranch home so there are few monitors which have good reception from one end of the house to another. I purchased this on clearance and despite the static issue and having to find just the right spot we've really been pleased. I think it really depends on your home re; the reception issues. I'm not sure any monitor would be crystal clear for us. This monitor does the intended job and that's to keep an eye on my baby. I love the peace of mind of being able to see him. I would say overall this is a good choice and all the bells and whistles are nice but unnecessary. The best thing about this monitor is the portability factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a mom-monitor too!","review":"My wife and I are the caregivers for my 98-year-old mother who lives alone three floors below our 12th floor condo unit. We needed a way to periodically check on her both day and night as although she has very limited mobility, she still has the ability to move enough to fall from her bed or a chair. The Summer Infant Day and Night Monitor has been the perfect solution as the images and the sound reproduction the camera provides to the handheld monitor in a solid concrete building have been clear either in full daylight or total darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"After many, many hours pouring over customer reviews of all the various video monitors in our price range, this is the one we settled on. Nightvision works great, sound quality is good. Only downside is that it doesn't have the \\"talk back\\" feature that others do, but that wasn't on our \\"gotta have\\" list. I'd definitely recommend this monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts Mom's worries to rest.","review":"I really love this monitor. It allows me to check in on my son without risking waking him up!

It gets very fuzzy when i bring it outside, but other than that I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked for a year, then stopped working","review":"My handheld video monitor worked for a year or so then started to flash rapidly to the point that you can barely see anything on the monitor anymore. For the amount of money this costs it should last more than a year. I was hoping to use it for a second child. I would not recommend or buy again until they either drop the price or make it more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure if it will work in the long run","review":"We are a little disappointed with the reception - there are only two channels. One doesn't seem to work very well, the other conflicts with our Airport Express. Right now we're only using the audio, and even that doesn't seem to pick up the soft sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Before You Buy Summer Video Monitor","review":"Hello: First the good - monitor has a picture. Here is the bad - static on monitor 15 feet from camera (I am not exaggerating); if you lean the monitor back on the stand, it will make a high pitch hiss, stand straight up and it stops (but remember to stay within 15 feet of camera); picture only stays on 10 mins when on battery, a pain; forget going out of the house and hearing anything and of course no picture. We bought this item based on the reviews here and I cannot determine why anyone would think this is a good monitor. Also, disappointed in Babies R Us too because they would not let us return. Bought item 3 months before we used due to the fact we kept our new son in our bedroom and once we moved him to his room, tried to use for a month. We have spent $1000's at Babies R Us over the years and no credit allowed period. This is a bad product, please avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have video","review":"I purchased this from a local store when I was pregnant and loved the product. A year later I dropped the monitor down a flight of stairs and the video portion broke. I lived for two weeks with just the audio when I broke down and bought another one. Once you can see what your little one is up to in his crib, you won't want to go without it! The range is pretty decent, we're able to garden outside and it just barely reaches our fire pit out back maybe 120 ft or so? The picture is excellent even in the dark. My only minor complaint is the battery doesn't last long enough on the monitor so I have to keep it plugged in at night or I'm awakened by the sound of static when the battery dies after about 6 hours on a full charge. Still, I recommend this product to my friends and family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"We have owned this monitor for 19 months.

However, if you want to be able to listen in on your baby as well, this is not the way to go. I was very excited to have this monitor until I plugged it in. I have tried to use it in my home, my parent's home, and now our new home in another city and in all three places the video worked great, but the sound mechanism put out a very loud static that prevented us from ever hearing the baby (yes, I tried it on both the A and B channels in all locations). Friends of ours who also have this same device have the same issue. We think that maybe the wifi we have in our homes could be interfering with the sound mechanism, but for $135+ that should not be an issue.

It was very easy to install and the picture is wonderful. It has great color and night vision. However, after 3 months, the battery started dying after an hour of being charged. After 2 months of poor charging, now the connection between the battery charger and the monitor is very poor. It has to be angled at the exact angle and cannot be moved, or else it won't work. When the connection is poor, the picture dies and the monitor turns to static. This has been so unreliable, I will need to purchase a new one. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY Summer monitors","review":"Do not buy a Summer monitor! It WILL break in approximately 12 months and the terrible customer service team expects you to mail your monitor in before they will send you a new one, which means you are out of a monitor for two weeks!

It's still in use and working perfectly 2 years later and we even bought a second one to use with our second child (the older one sleep walks so we needed two once we moved the baby to his crib). The portability of it is great and the night vision works very well.Occasionally we get interference when using the two channels at the same time but moving the unit a few inches usually clears it up right away. I carry it all over the house with me and out into the yard to garden while the kids nap and have no issues (other than a little static now and then that clears up when you move the unit).If you live close to your neighbors it might not be a good option since they can pick up the signal if they have the same monitor (we can see our neighbors child sometimes when out in the yard). Not really a problem for us since we have a huge yard and can only see the other signal when outside near our shared fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"We bought this about 3 months before our daughter was born. I am now watching my daughter sleep on the monitor while I write this review. She is now 4 and a half years old. Besides the merits to have a video monitor (witch I highly recommend) this has been a perfect product. We have had to get a new battery for it but that is about it for maintenance (and to be expected after almost 5 years). I have dropped it at least 5 times (once from waist high on a brick fire place hearth, only months after we got it) and it is still working flawlessly. The range is amazing. I can go all the way in the back of our yard to do weeding (about 30-40 yards) and it still works fine through 2 stories and the brick exterior of our house. There has been no interference from any of our other devices since it runs in the 900 mhz range. We have taken it everywhere when we travel and have never had a problem. What a great investment for extra paranoid parents!

The sound captures every breath and the monitor works perfectly in the dark. The hand-held monitor is the best part, as I clip it to my belt as I work around the house and yard. This monitor goes every where with us. We take it on vacation, set up the baby in his room for the evening, and can relax on the deck knowing the monitor is right there to see. Having the visual confirmation was key as a first time \\"worrier\\" mom. It has saved me countless trips to his crib to check on him.

We have an acre of property and I'm able to walk all around it and still get crystal clear reception of baby sleeping in his crib.

I repurchased thinking I'd have better luck with a second unit. After only a few months, I started having problems with battery life in it. The second unit still works, but the battery won't hold a charge. Therefore, it only operates when it is plugged into the cord. It is still useful, but the portability is gone.If battery life were not such an issue, the product would be great. I've had recurring problems with these, so I don't think I got a lemon.

This baby monitor lacks any security so you are broadcasting out to the whole world your baby's room. There is significant audio and picture static and other interference.

Their customer support was great, sent out a second unit via Fedex with no questions, nor requesting deposit, with return label on the original. If you have a non-network house might work but for us, forget it. I'm trying another monitor so we can sleep again.

Our floors are very noisy, so sneaking into his room to check on him would wake him most of the time. To us, this is a must have and I highly recommend.

Unfortunately, in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours. We do not live in an apartment or townhouse (which I read was not recommended for this product), but we do have wireless internet. Only we aren't using it when there is static, so who knows...I love being able to see my boy, but the static makes the monitor REALLY annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT!","review":"I've had to deal with interference from the 1st day I used it, but after about 4 months, the screen burnt out. So now all i hear is static when i expected to hear and see my baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk! Only works when it wants to!","review":"Although having a video monitor is wonderful, this one only works when it wants to! The static is frequent (we don't have interference from landlines, etc.) and occasionally we get a blaring, loud interference that takes several minutes to end. Often times the static will increase if you even move around it! I've never had this problem with our other sound monitor. We have only used this product for 6 months and there must be a short or something in the monitor itself because when we adjust the volume we sometimes lose the sound! For the $200 I paid for it, it's not worth it at all! I hope to return it for my money back. This monitor will not last much longer at this rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will keep you awake more than the baby!!!!!!!","review":"I always listen to what other mothers have to say in their reviews, it always helps. I thought I should give back and give you a heads up on this monitor. I have this monitor and it cracks and makes all kinds of crazy sounds. It has kept us up more than the baby. At first I thought it was just mine but, my girlfriends had the same problem. I gave it one star because I do recommend a monitor with the screen, it really helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars?","review":"I must have gotten a dud, because this thing only crackles and pops with intermittent audio. The video reminds me of 1950's TV pictures--with broken tubes. I am returning it. Its a real piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Range of reception great if you never leave the room!!","review":"As we plugged it in and saw the first images we were amazed. This will be great for monitoring our baby......until we walked out of the room.By stepping through the threshold of the baby room, we lost picture and had tons of static interference, even after trying both channels. We needed to immediately return the device.As a monitor for freely monitoring your baby, I could not reccomend this product.The main reason for going with this model was becouse of the 900mhz frequency which was not supposed to be affected by the wireless internet we have. It just lacks in reception capabilities altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant see anything in the next room","review":"well, maybe it is because that i am living in a villa that it is not build with wood and stuff, it is concretei cant get it in the room that is only 10-12 meters (30-36) feet awayi bought this one for my sister's first babyi really was thinking it is gonna be great present ,but it turns out it is not at allany howi think it is a good for regular wooden housesbut for the hard core buildings it is not good at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad vendor","review":"I ordered the item over a month ago and it is past the date that the vendor said it would be here. I have contacted the vendor and gotten no response.

However after using this one every day since we've bought it, we both really like it. Our daughter had a lot of difficulty learning to sleep. When we moved her into her own room, this was great because we could see if she was just tossing and turning and we should not go into her room, or if she needed us. And perhaps the cutest thing is watching her play alone when she first wakes up. :) It has a nice color picture when the lights are on, and a black and white picture in the dark. The volume is adjustable. The battery life is a bit short so it needs to be recharged frequently, but overall it's a nice monitor. I wish we had just bought it at the beginning instead of the sound only monitor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor is junk","review":"I received this as a baby shower gift. 2 months after we started using it the monitor stopped working. My twins are 10 months old and the thing loses it's charge within an hour. If it's not losing it's charge it's pure static and white noise EVEN when plugged in. I wouldn't recommend it to watch over my bird let alone my twins."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"I found this item to be great for the price (lower priced compared to other brands). The nighttime view is great- easy to see you baby, clear enough to see if their eyes are open or shut, clear enough to see if they are crying. I am VERY pleased with the monitor componant. The sound is clear- and if it's turned up loud- you can even hear your child breathing. I have had a few difficulties with occasional interference- the screen \\"rolling\\" and messing up- but it clears up- if I move the monitor a few feet another direction. Additionally the battery life has not been very good- so I have to leave mine plugged in all the time. Overall very pleased with this monitor and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor - peace of mind and good for sleep training","review":"We received this as a gift and are so thrilled with it after 4 months of use. The microphone is extremely sensitive and picks up very slight sounds. The picture is clear even in total darkness. We have not had any problems whatsoever with interference, just a bit of feedback when we carry the portable unit by baby's room (our house is tiny). The handheld unit is very easy to use, and the camera was quick to install. It is great being able to peek at him when I'm in bed to see if that sound he just made necessitates a visit from mommy or not. It's also helped us keep an eye on him when he goes to sleep without disturbing him or interfering with him falling asleep. This is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"So far, I highly recommend this video monitor. The picture is extremely clear, the battery lasts a long time and the range is perfect. The clip is handy, especially when I am downstairs cooking or in the basement doing laundry. Very easy to set up and charge as well. I have been using since my daughter was born in Oct. 2010 and I haven't had any issues so far. I have read the past complaints of seeing other babies, but I haven't seen anything but my baby in mine. Static flickering does occur sometimes, but I can still see and hear everything perfectly fine. I feel it is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good product","review":"The screen is wide enough, you can see the baby clearly. The only drawback is that it picks up noise from the whole neighborhood due to its high sensitivity. I am using it inside a brick construction (inside walls, too) and it still picks up a lot of noise from the outside. It is still ok because I have the camera to check wether the noises are coming from the baby or not. I end up using the camera, only, on mute. It is a great product, though, and I'd recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used everyday","review":"IT is pretty good for everyday use. got some interference but had really good range ( i could go and take the trash out without losing picture)... Son broke it so keep receiver out of reach of babies lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice monitor","review":"I really nice monitor that has a large screen and a handheld little screen. The only thing is that there is noise feedback on the large screen. Not sure what the issue is. Overall though the picture quality is good and it has really been good for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This monitor was awful!!! It worked for 3 days and then the screen went blank and that was it. It is not worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great! For a while...","review":"We loved this product until a couple nights ago. We started using it when our son was born, and he is not yet 10 months old. The night vision camera just quit working. Summer Infant customer service made me produce the receipt (luckily I bought it on Amazon, so I could access the invoice) to prove it was purchased within the past year. They are saying the model was discontinued and they are sending me a replacement that is supposed to be a step up, the Secure Sight Handheld. Judging from reviews about the Secure Sight Handheld, and based on the price being much lower, I am not sure it is a step up. Haven't decided if I am going to go along with the swap or argue for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME, cannot live without","review":"We bought this before our second child was born 18 months ago. We use it EVERY night. We also travel with it often and it is easy to set up, the picture is perfect on it still 18 months later. My 5 year old sleeps in the same room by choice so even if we are not checking on the baby and we hear her need something or have a bad dream we can check on her. We don't stare at it like we used to, but it is comforting to know we can always check on them without going upstairs and opening doors. We can also see if our youngest has wet through her diaper on this, which is nice because we are able to change her in her sleep so she is not like that all night. We absolutely LOVE this monitor, it is a must have for all parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well at my friends home, very poorly in mine","review":"It worked ok at my friends, altho it was black and white in the day, so I bought one. Unfortunately, it was grainy, lots of noisy feedback on both the camera- woke the baby, and on the receiver. and I saw my neighbors baby more than mine even when I switched back and forth between the 2 channels. I was sad it didn't work in my home, I guess it depends on the home. I tried everything, changing positions of the camera, changing antennae positions etc, etc. I guess, it's just incompatible with my house so I had to return it. Giving it a 2 star cuz it worked ok. at my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I gave this monitor one star because it is dangerous. It will randomly turn off during the day or night with no way of knowing. One night I woke up to my son crying and the monitor showed a picture of him sleeping and silent. It had frozed or something). We returned it and got a new one thinking it was just a fluke, but it happened a second time with another one. Don't buy this if you want any piece of mind that your child is safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performer - not recommended!","review":"This monitor has performed very poorly for us. It worked for a couple weeks when we first purchased it (approximately two years ago), then we started to get constant interference with the sound. Even after adjusting anything and everything that could be interfering with the signal, it still didn't work well. We can still hear things but cannot leave the volume on because the interference is so annoying. We never replaced it because we mostly used the video capabilities (which are fine but not fantastic) but a few weeks ago the night vision stopped working. I didn't really care but then my daughter got sick this week and I couldn't see her at night, which was problematic. We will be buying another monitor which will most definitely not be a Summer! This is NOT a monitor I would ever recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery stop working after 6 months","review":"when I first bought this monitor I was ver pleased. the video is excellent and night vision works perfectly.unfortunately after 6 months the battery of the parent unit stopped working and would only worked if plugged in, so it was a pain cause I couldn't go outside and relax, had to stay near the unit where the plug was. as I live in another country I couldn't call for the warranty. would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for child care but was not exactly what I ordered!","review":"I purchased this unit as a present for my sister and her first baby in December 2010 and she told me that she LOVED this monitor so much because it made her life so much easier while being out of direct view of her daughter. I made my first visit this week (Sept. 2011) to her house since being born and came to discover that the handheld unit was a black and white screen instead of the color video monitor as promised in the add. I think it works fine but I definitely would enjoy getting exactly what I ordered instead of finding out 9 months later that you didn't get exactly what you ordered! This was the only reason why I didn't give this a perfect score...My sister loved it and that is what was important to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best monitor ever!","review":"got this for my first daughter and have been using it 18 months, it's awesome! I got it after seeing my brother use it for the past 4 years with his son and have had nothing but good luck with it! We bring it outside in the back yard while she naps and it still works perfect! We are expecting our second and I will be purchasing a new one because since they will both be young I want both of them on the camera/noise monitoring all the time... They do sell the camera through summers website, however it will only do sound/video on that channel and at night I need to know if either of them wake up crying not just rely on switching channels to check!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the $","review":"This is my second of these monitors. I'm only replacing it because the handheld was dropped and we couldn't use the video anymore. Picture is pretty clear but we do get a decent amount of static. Never really had a problem with battery life. I spent hours researching when my 1st one broke but this monitor kept coming out on top with the features for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice video monitor","review":"This monitor works great in our house. We haven't had any interference issues - there are no annoying static noises in the background. Love the video feature - picture quality was clearer than expected. When on battery mode, it stays charged long enough to last all day. I plug it in every night though since the static starts to flare up whenever the batteries run low. My one complaint is that the volume dial is not marked so it's hard to tell if the monitor is set to the ideal volume. Also the gradation between getting no sound and being able to hear every breath and sigh the baby emits is really fine. Otherwise I think this is great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Handheld Video Monitor - excellent!","review":"This product has been great so far. I bought it as a replacement to a video monitor that just stopped working. It offers a great picture and features rechargeable batteries which saves you money (and the environment) in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something different from somewhere else","review":"The first one I purchased was obviously a return from someone else. The packaging was cut into, paint(YES PAINT) and scratches on the monitor. I was able to get another one sent to me...had to pay for it prior to the refund even though the first one was a reject from someone else. Three days, three days, three days after the package was opened, the monitor stopped working. Based on the poor customer service from amazon and the poor(two in a row) product sold by amazon, BUY SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for new and pro parents!","review":"I have had this camera for almost 4 years and it works great!It allows me to see (night vision) my little ones in the middle of the night without having to walk to their rooms.It gives me peace of mind.I have two cameras, you can't have more than that. there are only two channels available.Pros: durable, good image day and night, excellent sound.Cons: battery life (rechargeable). After the first 6 month, it held its power for very very little. I have to keep it plugged in at all times - which it is not a problem for me.Also if you use your dryer or other electronic devices you may have some interference.Overall, I love this camera and all the friends I have recommended it, they love it too.This is a MUST for new parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Screen size and resolution.

In fact, all someone needs is a handset and they can sit in the near vicinity of your house and see your nursery!! It is a big security risk. If you want a monitor that doesn't have this problem... make sure it is a digital one. This one is NOT!!!Also, on a side note... this monitor tends to crackle and have static a lot and the battery life on the handset didn't last long.The one positive note is that the picture was good.Also worth noting: Summer's Customer Service is excellent. They took care of the problem for me when I called to complain. Yay Summer Infant!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disclosure - Save Your Receipt","review":"I bought Summer's \\"Color Handeld Video Monitor w/ Night Vision\\". It was not quiet, but all static!

The new one does not work!! **Apparantly if you have a cordless phone of 900mz, it will not work at all. Additionally, Customer Service stated if you live in a townhouse or apartment building they tend to get interferance as well. Summer cannot issue a refund and there suggestion was to return it to the store.

We couldn't be more pleased. It did what it said.But all of a sudden, the video part stopped working, and we could no longer see our baby at all. The screen heated up and it probably killed the screen.We ended up getting another one, same model.The video on this one works for a few minutes, and when it gets hot, it stops working. We have to keep it off and only turn on the video when we really need to see our baby. And sometimes the video stops working for no reason at all. And it had now stopped working and we cannot see anything any more. And we have only had this new monitor for a few months.Pretty disappointing, since the whole idea is to be able to see.We are currently shopping around for a monitor that has a screen that actually works for a long time. Hope we find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video doesn't work!!","review":"My baby is due on early June and at the beginning of May, as I was finishing the nursery, I decided to test all the products, only to find out that the video on the monitor is not working, there's no image at all. I went over the \\"problem solving\\" on the manual, but it didn't work. I'm very disappointed and frustrated, as the product is ranked as number 76 in the best seller section of the baby department at Amazon, but mine won't work.I sent e-mails to Summer Infant, try to call the 0800 (more than 30 minutes waiting), but I couldn't find/talk to nobody.A company that sells baby products should understand the importance of the products that surrounds the arrival of a baby...[ASIN:B0007OD8SU Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8\\" Screen - Silver]"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE BABY MONITOR - DO NOT BUY!!","review":"My wife and I purchased 2 sets of these monitors for use with our 2 children.Both monitors broke within ~12 months from time of purchase.I reached out to the manufacturer and was told that the warranty is only for 12 months.If we had known that these baby monitors would only last 1 year, we would not have spent the $200+ for the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"No security (this should be clearly stated on the box)","review":"My experience is identical to K.Sindelar (see #1 -ve review) - I added this review so I could give it my 'one star' vote. When I first turned on the receiver I got signals from neighbors houses on both channels (I live in a typical Midwest suburb of 2200ft2 houses on 1/5th acre lots). I was surprised as my expectation was that the data transmission would be secure; there is no indication of this issue on the packaging or instructions. I don't want to broadcast video & audio from inside my home to my neighborhood, or get interference from other units. The video and audio looked & sounded fine in the limited testing I did before returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible static and no picture half the time","review":"I thought this would be a good replacement and upgrade for my previous large screen monitor which stopped working after 2 years. Unfortunately we couldn't get this thing to work properly. The static was a nightmare and the screen is so small you can't see anything at a distance. Maybe it would work better if the camera was directly above the baby but we needed a whole room view which didn't work. We returned it and got the summer infant monitor for $80 instead. It has it's issues as well but seems to be working better for our needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be waste of Money","review":"we originally received this monitor as a gift. We tried it out on the spot and it worked great! We then got it home and set it up in the nursery and that was where the troubles began. The monitor sometimes worked and the only way to get any sort of sound (which was usually a sqwelching noise) was the turn the monitor and camera to OPPOSITE channels (the directions state they must be on the same channel to work). The manual that comes with the monitor instructed us to contact the company directly-which we did...several times-and the company refused to respond back to any and all inquiries. Eventually we exchanged it for another monitor. It would appear that this is a fairly typical problem with these monitors. Would not recommend to anyone that plans on actually wanting a FUNCTIONING monitor. Considering the cost of this monitor compared to many others out there, it should be stellar, but that does not appear to be the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for one year","review":"I have had this video monitor for a year and a half and used it everyday for one year. Overall it was great for exactly one year which is how long the warranty is good for. After the one year, there was tons of static, the volume stays silent until you blast it all the way up to the highest and then every little sound wakes you up frightened something is going on in your baby's bedroom! I would not recommend this monitor for longevity use- especially if you plan to have more than one child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen failing after 2 years","review":"We have loved this monitor. I disregarded the hype about how video monitors make for paranoid parents and so on. It is reassuring to be able to both hear and watch my son to ensure he is ok. But after two years, the battery life is going, and big black splotches have appeared on the screen. I intended on the monitor lasting a while longer, so this is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst reception and static static static","review":"I hate this monitor with a passion. I can't sleep at night because all I hear is the damn static and cracking that's if I can even get the sound to work anymore. The only time you get a clear picture or clear sound is if you are in the same room as the camera or literally the next room. That's it. Forget the 900 feet of reach. BS This thing is POS don't waste your money or peaceful sleep at night. All night it's just cracking and static...I would rather hear my baby cry all night. I didn't have to spend money on that noise. Get a different monitor. Not to mention if we are just in the right spot we can spy on the neighbors who also must have one of these crappy monitors, which by the way, only has two channels. So if neither works well then you're screwed. Like I said POS! Get something else. I am ordering a differnt monitor and drowning this thing in the pool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal.","review":"It's the second time I buy thisproduct - I have the main monitor and now got an extra one.

After our fourth monitor is starting to go, we've decided to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty great!","review":"I can't believe that I waited 2 years to buy a video monitor! We got this because my daughter had a feeding tube put in and we needed a way to keep an eye on her while she was in her bed and I'm so pleased with the monitor. The infrared lights work great at night and it's not hard to at all to see her in her bed. There are three things that I'm not thrilled about that kept me from giving this product 5 stars. 1) I wish that the audio was voice activated. The constant static is a little annoying while you're trying to sleep. 2) The indicator light on the reciever are very bright, again annoying while you're trying to sleep. 3) The picture tends to jump at weird times. It never goes out completely and I'm guessing that it's just interference but it's just unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I love this monitor! The picture is so good that I can even see my twins breathing on the monitor while they are sleeping. Sometimes I get a bit of static, but I just move the monitor a couple of inches and the problem is corrected. I have had this product for ten months and just yesterday the picture stopped working. I can still hear sound, but the picture is gone. I just called Summer and they are going to send me a replacement. Great customer service to back this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little interference, but overall worth it!","review":"I already had a summer video baby monitoring system and it was operating worse and worse. I purchased this one to replace it and have been very happy. We keep one camera in my baby's room and one in my 4 yr old's room. This unit only comes with one camera unless you purchase an additional one. There is only one spot in the house that I have found a popping interference sound on the monitor. We have a two story home with a finished basement and when my 9 month old naps on the 2nd floor I often am in the basement with my other two children. I just bring the portable monitor with me and it works wonderfully. I was impressed by the clarity of the monitor, even though it is much smaller than my old one. I even bring it outside if I am working in the yard while he is napping. Overall, a good buy for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baby Monitor","review":"Awesome Baby Monitor! Highly Recommended!We originally purchased the Lorex LW2002W Portable LCD Wireless Surveillance System. But the problem with that setup was that the audio would automatically shut off, and our baby would be crying but we couldnt hear her (unless she was screaming and it set the monitor off). But this video monitor is clear and loud if you want it to be and you can keep the video on all night or turn it off and leave the sound on. This is the way a baby monitor should work!

They lived with us for a year while their house was being built and we just loved watching the baby while she slept or played in her crib. The picture is very clear. Fast forward two years and another baby. The first unit still works great! They bought another unit to use in another room. It doesn't work as well with both on but just turn one off while you look if you want a clearer picture. Grandma and Grandpa couldn't live without it so we now have one in our house when they come to visit. We also purchased another unit as a baby shower gift for a friend.

She loves them with the exception of they have little static once in a while but our bedroom is quite far from there bedrooms and they work much better when they are closer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, night vision is excellent.","review":"After reading the reviews and comparing this unit to others, we decided to purchase this monitor to help look after a live-in parent with dementia. The transmit/receive range is acceptable to excellent from one end of the house to the other (approximately 70 ft.) depending upon how much obstruction is between the camera and the monitor. The night vision capability is excellent. Even with very little light, we can see everything in the room and any movement. At night we connect the audio/video output to a video recorder so we can review overnight activity. It definitely works as advertised... okay, the operating range IS overstated, but it has been very reliable since we purchased it about 4 months ago. For the money, you'll be hard pressed to find a better value."},{"rating":"1","title":"As other reviewers have noted: Unsecured video","review":"Great way to stream live video of your baby out into the public. Received as a gift and are using as an audio monitor only (camera pointed at the wall), and works fine in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else","review":"We had this product for only 4 months. The on/off button broke after a month and then the screen broke on month four. Called customer service and was given the run around. In the end, we were told the warranty didnt cover the problems we had, and they could sell us a refurbished unit for 50% off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say it didn't do it for me.......twice","review":"First one arrived with a snapped off plastic transmitter antenna, I put it back together but it had an annoying buzz on the receiver. No matter where I placed it. Figuring the 2 were related it was sent back and a replacement was promptly sent by Amazon. The second one had this same annoying buzz, that would only get louder as I turned up the volume. This makes it unusable to us at night, unless you like sleepless nights that is. Then the power started cutting in and out on the transmitter so it too went back. I ordered their upcoming product with the little LCD monitor, hopefully some improvements have been made to their product, as conceptually I really like it.PS: No we do not have any 900mhz phones or other 900mhz electronics in our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it worked...","review":"This monitor was great for the first three months after we got it. Then, for no apparent reason (I treated this thing like a baby itself, so it was never dropped), the sound started cutting out. At first, it did so intermittently, then it pretty much stopped transmitting sound altogether. I tried contacting the company to see if they could repair it, but they never responded. We bought the Sony Baby Call, and it works like a charm.Don't waste your money on this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this","review":"This monitor is great if you're in close range, but if you get a room apart from it, it starts to have static. You're losing enough sleep because of the newborn, you don't need a monitor keeping you up because of the static as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longevity to product!!","review":"Yeah, its a great concept, but come on, for over a hundred bucks the product should last longer than a year!!! I bought one unit in 2009 (at a babies r us) and was in love with it for the first 8 months. Thought it was the best investment we made for baby! Then it started going downhill.....the plug to charge the monitor wouldn't stay in to charge and the static interference got worse. Also the volume doent work anymore, you have to turn it all the way up but then you get a buzzing sound. We have a second baby due next month so decided to buy another unit (the one I bought on amazon) the screen is so bright you cant even see the baby in the crib. I have mailed it back to the manufacturer. I am really dissapointed this product isnt made better for how much it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"Monitor is very noisy with lots of distortions. Have switched all devices that might possibily interfere with monitor still no use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated and Disappointed","review":"I have had this product for 17 months and up to this point was very satified with the monitor, however, one day the screen started to flicker and you couldn't see the image anymore. I contacted the company and they said that since my one-year warranty was expired all they could do was offer me a refurbished model for $104 and then a one year warranty would start all over again. So, in other words, basically buy a used monitor for practically the price of a new monitor. What would the purpose of that be? I am so frustrated by companies who can't stand behind their products. I paid $180 for this product and I would definitely expect it to last more than a couple years.I feel bad because I have recommended this monitor to other friends. I will not be purchasing from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The monitor stopped working only after 1 yr","review":"I have had this item for a year and I loved this item until 2 days ago when the monitor screen started to flicker on and off constantly then turns black. My guess is the monitor has burned out or something. I called the customer service to seek for a solution for this problem. Unfortunately my warranty has expired and the only thing the company will do is send me a refurbished set for $104. I am very upset because for the price that you pay ($179.99), this thing is only working for a year! It's never been dropped and is in a perfect condition. I guess you have to replace the whole set once a year. This company is unfair for charging a lot for something that doesn't last at least 2 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only one that would work.....","review":"This monitor was the 4th monitor that we tried. It was the only one that even would remotely work in our house. All the other monitors would pick up radio channels, or have high pitch squealing coming though the speaker. We live in a small house (800 sq feet.) and have a lot of wireless tech in our house (which we read causes interference with baby monitors.) This monitor worked perfect out of the box, and the only time we have had any problems with reception was during a lightning storm, and even then we never lost reception is just wigged in and out a couple of times. The picture on the screen is the best that we came across, I also love the fact that I can turn on the video screen with a simple touch of a button. The sound is perfect and is simple to change, which is a blessing in the middle of the night. Even if this product doesn't last we have already decided that we will purchase this exact same monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monitor stopped working after 15mos!","review":"The hand held monitor stopped working after 15mos. We could get sound but no picture. The company is only willing to replace the entire set (camera and monitor) for $104. That is a cheaper price, but I am not sure that I would want to give my money again to a company that puts out a product that only lasts 15mos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"This monitor works great. The distance is more than adequate, the quality of the display is fine, there is no delay, and multiple channels is a good idea on the crowded 900MHz spectrum. The video/audio out works great as well, I hooked it up to my TV, and was able to view the video just fine. About the only suggestion I could make would be to add in a wi-fi function so that you can automatically stream the video up to a website (or at least FTP still shots every X seconds). Really a great setup though, works great, worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even last until second birthday","review":"I would not recommend this monitor. After reading the reviews, we had high hopes. Our first video monitor was a Graco and it didn't last past a year. Graco wouldn't replace since it was outside of warranty. So this time we went with Summer. First we lost sound - it sounds like there is massive interference.. but still had picture. Today we lost the video feed/picture. I have sent the company an email- hoping they do something to stand behind their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"reliable and reasonable video monitor","review":"I've used this for over a year now and it has done a great job at home or when we travel and set it up temporarily at somewhere else. I'd recommend it based on the following:Pro:-easy to set up and easy to bring along and set up temporarily at other locations-clear video and audio-convenient clip and standCon:-while we can see most of the crib mounting it on the wall near the ceiling, we can't see all of it so there are times when the baby lays at one edge and we only see a foot or an arm, or only see her feet when she is standing up at the far end. this would probably be resolved by a little more complicated install on the ceiling a little further away.-after a year or so, the battery life deteriorated dramatically. that's probably to be expected leaving it plugged in every night and easily resolved with replacement batteries available on Amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Received used","review":"We bought this monitor because we needed a second camera and at the price it was half off of the reg. price. We didn't know what to expect but the box had already been opened, but everything had still had the original twist ties on it. The camera works great and that is why we really bought it. The monitor seems like it was dropped because there is a black line that goes up and down the screen. The picture is much clearer then our other one but this one easily gets interference with our cell phones and wi-fi signals. We love the video monitor and are glad we got it for the price we did, otherwise we would of sent it back. Now if only the seller had mentioned why it was being sold at this price, we probably would have spent more money on another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy customer","review":"I bought this monitor for my son and his wife just over a year ago and it has already stopped working. A phone call to the company said it was just past the one year warranty so not covered - so we have to figure on buying a new monitor every year? It certainly won't be this one! Not very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long...","review":"I bought this 2 years ago before the birth of my son. Now I'm pregnant and have to replace it(I will NOT be buying this brand again!) The only thing that works now is the video.From day one it was very static which is very annoying when you're sleeping with the monitor on. Now it doesn't even pick up the sound reliably, it'll only pick up sound half the time and when it is working I have to listen to a ton of static as well. I currently use it only for the video (ALWAYS keep the sound off), I check it to SEE if my son is awake.The battery only lasted about six months, from then on I had to leave it plugged in at all times.This product was a big disappointment for me, if I'm spending that much on a monitor I'd expect it to at least last through 2 children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!","review":"We were given this monitor as a gift, and thought it was really great. It had a clear picture and it was nice to see our baby sleeping, especially since we moved her into her own room at 6 weeks. HOWEVER THIS PRODUCT MADE IT HARDER TO SLEEP THAN HAVING THE BABY IN OUR ROOM. It cracks and pops all night long. I tried moving it to different locations in our bedroom, which defeats the purpose of the video and still got all the interference. Our baby has slept through the night since about 4 weeks, but BECAUSE OF THIS MONITOR we have not. One night I gave up and just turned it off, and turned it back on early in the morning. We live in a small, one-story house. I am currently on hold with Summer to complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Once I received the product as new (first time I was sent a used one even though I paid for new), I experienced more issues with it than the used-sold-as-new version. There was a consistent delay of 10 - 20 seconds before the sound kicked in whenever I turned on the monitor. Also, the picture, while on battery mode, cut out way too much--the monitor wasn't even that far away from the camera albeit on a different floor. If I lived in some spacious house instead of a small townhouse, I wouldn't have thought the problem was with the monitor itself. Sadly, it was. Also, forget about using the monitor without the AC adapter unless you want the annoying headache of listening to static half the time. On the plus side, the picture quality was pretty good, even in the dark. And, when the sound was available, I could hear every utterance from my twins. Still, those two things were not enough for me to keep this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much interference","review":"I would not recommend anyone wasting their money on this product. The concept is great (including video) and the picture quality is great however there is continuous interference because this product uses 900 MHz analog technology. We have tried moving it to all areas of the house and its just too sensitive which produces static all the time. It has even picked up other baby houses that have the same monitor and it picks up phone calls from other homes as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've should buy it along time ago","review":"its a very nice product,I've should buy it along time ago, the camera quality is good, the monitor screen is very good.But the handheld size is too big comparing to the product picture.Overall, the device is great, I recommend it to everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect for what one needs.......","review":"For the price and available options for online purchase, this is definitely good value. The sound is just perfect (obviously with any wireless device..prone to interference if a very strong signal is close by).Video quality is better than expected as most of these devices have fairly low resolution, but surprisingly this had a good picture quality and it holds well even within the range specified.In short cant go wrong if you want to be able to see or hear the baby's movements from anywhere within the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is great.. sound os horable!","review":"We love that we can see our baby sleeping ...works great day and night but..... all we get for sound is a high pitched screech. no matter where we are in the house or what frequency we have it on... so we are stuck using one for sound and one for video..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monitor","review":"Great monitor. The picture is very clear. The only drawbacks are: the base is not able to scan (the other summer monitor scans) and if you need 2 monitors in your home because you have 2 kids you want to watch at the same time you will need a different monitor. We have this monitor and the Summer monitor that scans."},{"rating":"1","title":"no sound","review":"Used this monitor for about six months and it already has lost the sound sometimes. At times it is very loud and others it just quits working. Defeats the purpose of using a monitor if you can't hear. Very disappointed I spent so much for good use for about 6 months. Wish I got something cheaper that actually worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving up on this monitor","review":"Have been through 2 of these monitors now. The first one worked well for 9 months and then just quit. (Note: we lived in a rural area then so it may be why it worked well for as long as it did). The second we got did not work straight out of the box. We had no picture and it would not hold a charge. Will not be getting another video monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Products By Summer Infant","review":"I had a simple audio monitor with my first child and I had no problems with the unit. I bought two Summer Infant Video Units for my twins and both broke. The screen on one unit cracked, the end of the plug fell off of the other and one machince just stopped working after 5 months. I sent both back to Amazon, 3 months ago, and I have not recieved a refund. I would NOT buy this brand and I wouldn't buy a monitor from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"static static static","review":"This monitor worked good for the first couple of months or so. After that, every time we turn it on, we have to adjust the volume just right or it won't pick up a sound, or only picks up static. I really wish I would have bought a different brand, maybe one that just has sound and then the company only has one thing to focus on and can get it right. Then, when it is unplugged, the picture only stays on for a minute and then turns off. You have to keep hitting the button on the top to see the picture. Well, the reason I bought the one that has a picture is because I want to see a picture...Very disappointing. It has one job ta simple task to perform...sound and picture and does not do either one adequately enough for the money I spent. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for a few months...","review":"I am so frustrated with this monitor right now! I bought it last year while I was pregnant thinking it would be a great thing to be able to hear and see my baby. I started using it shortly after my baby was born in January and it worked great! Just a little bit of static every now and then, but otherwise I loved the thing. Just eight months later, it has started getting tons of static and sometimes wakes me up at night. The sound randomly cuts out sometimes too - not something you want a baby monitor to do. I can't turn the volume up and down without getting tons of static either. I can't believe this thing won't even last a year. Now I am on the hunt for another monitor, but it won't be made by this brand. If you want a monitor that will last longer than a few months, I would steer clear of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad signal and lots of static","review":"I returned this monitor after trying for several days to get it to work effectively. I had a great deal of difficulty getting a clear signal that was free from static and interference.

Product itself works very good, but i have to pay extra just to get the adaptor fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Well it sounds pretty bad, but I purchased this video monitor above others because my two sisters had it so it should have been good.To be honest, I am not impressed. If I happen to forget to plug it in in the morning after I get my baby out of bed, it is useless to me the next night for a few hours..... The battery life is horrible. By her afternoon nap, I'm having to plug it in which isn't convenient because of plugs in this house.But that and the fact that when you turn it on, it doesn't always kick on.... we have had to smack the side of the unit to get the sound to start playing... and sometimes it can take a good 3 minutes!The other thing is that it isn't a clear and consistent picture.. It goes in and out of static... and I'm only just across the hall from my baby... living in a really small house anyway.It's a good monitor in that I can watch her.... but I might be able to do that for one that's half the price with none of the headaches..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static!","review":"I can't say it any better than the customer who posted the video \\"I hate this bloody thing\\".

They say that there are less than 1% returns on their products but I find that difficult to believe after reading the reviews here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I can't imagine having an infant without this! Our son is now 21 months old--and I can honestly say that this product has been used every night since he was born. We take it with us on trips, grandparents houses, hotels, everywhere. It has been tossed around quite a bit but it still works fine. You do need to plug it in everyday to charge--but since you don't need it during the day--this hasn't been a problem. I would recommend this to every new parent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the price for a few weeks if you can","review":"I just received the monitor and it seems to work great, but the main reason I'm writing this review is to let potential buyers know you can save a LOT of money if you don't have to purchase this right away. I watched the price on amazon.com for 2 weeks and saw it differ by as much as $60 with no \\"sale\\" listed. We ended up getting the pink one on a day when it was $50 cheaper than the silver one. The very next day it was back up $40. The same with the Summer Best View monitor. It was down $45 below one day than it was the following day. Unfortunately I missed that sale since I was hoping it would drop more, but it made me watch the other prices carefully and that's when I snatched this one for a steal.

The only drawback from this product (why I only gave it 4 stars) is because the pressure switch at the end of the cord will only turn on the laser if the cord is pulled a certain distance.

Comes with batteries, a screwdriver for the mounting screws, an allen for sighting, and an elastic band for holding the pressure switch in place (hold = on, release= off). It's a little weird to sight in, but not hard by any means. Because the travel of a paintball is far more arched than a faster moving projectile I sighted this in low. A ball fired inside 30 meters will find its mark (with good paint and my 14\\" inch barrel). I didn't have an issue with spray finding it's way into the lens, but it didn't take a direct hit either. I shone this through the woods at some buddies near the treeline and had them ducking for cover looking 180 degrees for me. My only issue was that the included mount came loose twice during my day, so I had to leave the field to tighten it back up. I was also a little bummed that you can't see the laser in direct sunlight, or from too terribly far away in indirect light conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vendor beware!","review":"The product arrived late and was defective.

First off, this lazer does not even stay on when you hold the pressure switch. Second the lazer does not stay fixed in its position, so as soon as you pick your rifle/pistol up the lazer will be off from the mark you sighted it in at. Sadly there is no option for zero stars, as this lazer is not even worth the bubble wrap it was packed in.

I put this sucker on my mp-5 airsoft AEG and makes it works like a charm. I would love to rate it higher, but after not having it for even a full week, it seems the soddering that was done on the wire that connects to the pegs on the pressure switch was over done, and broke the wire to the swtich. The only way for me to fix it is to cut the plastic around the wire and to re-sodder the wire to the peg. only problem is the plstic is too thick and tough that i could not get anywhere with it and i am thinking about scrapping it. Makes me angry that my brand new laser breaks before i can even test it combat at the airsoft feild. Any segguestion?

They must have been clearance because they were only $2.00 but the shipping was $10/per laser. just for shipping When I contacted them they told me the low price was offset by the shipping.

I have had many of these sights before and never had an issue with calibration until now. No matter what I did I could not get this sight aligned correctly. I even took the device apart completely and reassembled which did get me somewhat close to being aligned but still not what most people would consider acceptable. On top of that the cable connecting to the device did have a bad soldering job or something because the light would flicker if the cable moved. Also the laser itself would slide with a lil force in the connector even if tightened completely though I did remove the sticker that was on it which perhaps would have provided a tighter fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine on my 5.56 cal Keltec PLR-16 Pistol :)","review":"Hey I paid $9.00 for it so who's complaining. Nice laser, mounted easily once I chucked the screwdriver that came with the packaging (nice thought, lousy screwdriver!) and used a good one. Good bright laze, zeroed and stayed that way from shot 1. Put it on my KelTec PLR-16 (real 5.56 cal round using military ball) pistol and cranked her up, I figured if it was going to have issues, I'd blow a spring or something out of it in short order, but it worked fine. Note: it only sits about 1.5 inches (err that's about 4cm for the Canadian/European folks who can't convert ;) just below and behind the muzzle and this 5.56 pistol has one wicked muzzle blast ;) Fired about 30 rounds though the PLR-16 and everything is working fine. So I figure it might be that getting a good one is just luck of the draw, but this one works great! Oh why only 4 stars, it is a little bulky and heavy, but what the hey get one and give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth $8.00.","review":"The first one i bought was defective but i contacted the seller (HDE) and a week later a new one arrived.

This video isn't the best, nor is it the worst. Amelia is sure to give you a good laugh when flips and falls on her face. The second episode on this tape is the best one. Amelia thinks of Lina as a role model of justice and the scenes where Lina gets posessed by ghosts(perverted ghosts I may add)are funny too.

South Park is a great example of how to make toilet humor work well. This movie is a great example of how ugly it is when it's done wrong. This goes below low-brow, even below no-brow; watch it and you'll wind up beating your brow against the wall.

I saw his version of the Aristocrats joke and thought it was great, so I went into this movie with high expectations. This is certainly not a kid's movie, though it does mock one(March of the Penguins). It feels like Bob and a bunch of his comedy friends improving a bunch of dialog as they are watching a nature documentary. Sometimes it is funny, but more often than not, it is not funny. Since this is a low budget affair, they did not use CGI to make the penguins lips move, so they shot has to keep going back and forth as the characters talk so you know who is who. It starts off well, but it just drags on and on. This would have made a fun 10 minute bit on SNL or Mad TV, it is just doesn't sustain for an entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, don't walk away from this one","review":"This is the worst attempt at comedy I have ever seen. Bob Saget owes me $18.99, the money I wasted on this garbage. Wow, talk about a lame attempt at comedy. It's like two guys (with no comedy training) sat down and talked over a movie in an attempt to make each other laugh. What makes this even worse is the number of \\"actors\\" that contributed to this garbage. I know they were only reading the lame dialogue created by Saget, but at some point they should have realized that they were stealing from the public and their fans. Lewis Black did such a horrible job reading his lines, it couldn't get worse. Please do not waste your money..If I can help one person avoid wasting their money on this, I'll feel better about the money I wasted.

But I found it on sale for $3.99 at a store, and couldn't pass it up. I'm so glad I took a chance on it. Very few movies give me consistent hard-to-breathe laughs, but this is one of them. Lewis Black was phenomenal, and some of the other cameos were priceless. I honestly don't know why some people hate this so much. But then again, I think \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is the worst piece of schlock ever put to film, and some people actually think it's funny...so to each his own. This is not serious art, folks. This is just fun. They even make fun of the fact that it's \\"stock footage\\". I think Bob Saget on that Home Videos thing was possibly the most annoying human in history.

I wasted four dollars renting this painfully un-amusing movie and could only stand to watch 15 minutes before turning it off.

Why does everyone laugh when guys tell fart and booger jokes, but if a woman tells the same jokes, the jokes fall flat? Why do women value a sense of humor in a man, but men rarely mention it as important in their ideal woman? Imagine a woman writing a Dave Barry-style column--it wouldn't work. There IS a difference. Nancy Walker's book really connected with me.

If there are children involved, and you have been divorced, you will certainly identify with some of the same situations.Lance and Mia are a couple in love. Both, have suffered through a divorce, and are now trying to make a life together. The abusive ex-husband uses the children as pawns, for the sole purpose of hurting their mother. They are characters you will become involved with, for Smith, makes it impossible not to care about the outcome of their lives.In the climax, Smith, shows the family as a simmering pot of churning human emotions. It is inevitable that it boil over into disaster. It is devastating for the whole family and for the children it truly is a \\"Loss of Innocence.\\"The book is well written, realistic, and a look at what goes on in the world every day.

In fact, it would take volumes of works to do that. I disagree, however, with other reviews that say that what is shown is TKD.

Still, I am unsatisfied with the book because it fails to convey the feeling of motion and adaptability that is inherent in the art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple","review":"I hate to be a partypooper but I disagree... The book hardly had any Hapkido techniques in it such as wristlocks or throws.

This book would be better described as Taekwondo - the martial art. The kicks section is good but the self-defence section is disappointing. A chin strike is Bong Soo Han's suggested defence against a rear wrist grab. This is not my experience of Hapkido except at the very basic levels. Added to this, the pictures are terribly dated and calls up unhappy memories of a nation's fashion faux-pas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book if for general martial art beginners","review":"I was disappointed that I bought the book after reading most of it.

Will Farell makes a few appearances and brings his madness and crazy comedy we all know to the show.

There is a bit of confusion in that the author seems to relate God to the Christian vision of God. If you look at the Islamic, or other religions in world, they are not Christian, but certainly have a basic God somewhere in their religion.This is a rarely explored area of philosophy that explores new concepts within the age old concepts of the Christian faith. It makes a fascinating read and opens new doors to some interesting areas of thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title ... little content","review":"I was disappointed. The book title, and chapter titles, promise a very interesting subject matter, but the book delivers mostly logical syllogisms about the existence of God and morality.The book looks back in time rehashing old arguments, without managing to peer creatively into a future world without a moral code derived from a divine will.What happens to value and virtue when the gods are gone?

However, There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly is read in Cyndi Lauper's loud and affected Brooklyn accent. It leaves the watcher feeling flat (and annoyed!).

He then sets up a \\"model\\" for assessing performance measurement techniques and uses this to \\"prove\\" that such techniques must fail, are totally useless and have adverse impacts on any organization deploying them. He then indicates that he alone knows what's best (apparently the rest of us are fools). Having poured scorn on his competition, he then puts forward the technique of Catalytic Coaching but of course fails to subject it to the same model that he used in his diatribe against performance measurement. The truth, as any management professional well knows, is that if you don't measure it, you can't manage it! Avoiding the issue does not resolve it.

Little known facts were revealed, though many of these items have been collected elsewhere.But then, at the end of the book, Jones launches into a viriulent attack on Martin Luther as the root of all of these problems, outrageously claiming that Luther's doctrine of the bondage of the will (similar to doctrines found in Augustine and Aquinas) was developed virtually solely as a justification of Luther's breaking his monastic vow and getting married. Jones actually claims Luther is some sort of medieval Hugh Hefner! All of this is quite ludicrous, hardly in the spirit of Vatican II, and outweighs (and even calls into question) the veracity of the profiles of the other secularist persons herein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reassuring for ardent tradtionalists only, perhaps","review":"Most of the critiques of the book are actually more generous than I would be myself.However, for those looking for a very, very traditional view of modern art and sexual behavior, especially one colored by an openly religious thrust to it (specifically Catholic, but that is tertiary perhaps), the book may be OK, even if---speaking as a historian---it is loaded with minor obsessions and analytical flaws, from my perspective. But, even so, why would you want such a narrow and incomplete picture? It is so far from not merely the avant garde, but much of the clear-headed mainstream of today. Well-intentioned perhaps, but a little sad in its pinched view of human creation and existence. Do we still need to be scandalized by the private quirks of famous figures who did important or wonderful things, to the point we reject them for fear that civilization will fall because we aren't grown-up enough to deal with it reasonably?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lose the \\"lustful Luther\\" motif","review":"I really enjoyed Jones' book, but the last chapter where he rehashes old Counter-Reformation-til-the-turn-of-the-20th-century indictments of Martin Luther as a sex crazed inventor was outdated and contrived.I also think he could have cut the Freud & Jung chapter down a bit. Other than that he makes a wonderful point about the ability of our minds to rationalize our own behavior to ourselves... and to society at large.Good job, Dr. Jones. Keep writing books... As a Protestant I would appreciate you not reducing the Reformation to \\"Luther just wanted to have sex.\\" ...that's a bit simplistic.

John Shirley-Quirk sings the score with an unbridled reach of passion and musicality. He and conductor Shallon cast the symphony with a liturgical pallor that gives the mighty thing cohesion and a strange calm. The Dusseldorf Symphony is recorded beautifully. Shallon's musicianship is front and center - he's a superb center of calm. It shines in his work. The reason for this recording is of course Shirley-Quirk's audacious, heartbreaking, utterly musicianly singing of a great score, a great symphony. The Dusseldorf players are elegant in the long singing passages of Im Laden, even witty. Shallon sets them loose to soar with the great baritone in the performance of a lifetime. This is a great recording. (Interestingly, I find the few 'live noises' actually enhance the listening experience.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively Perfomance, Great Singing","review":"This Shostakovich #13 is quite good if you can adjust to certain idiosyncrasies of its live recording. The audience is pretty quiet, there is some stage noise from the performers (page-turning, etc.) and the dynamic range is quite wide, making it hard (for me, anyway) to find a satisfactory volume level.

The plot of the married couple who die and must separate is incredibly intricate and delicious! I am surprised it is not already a best seller. I know it will be when folks wake up and try this one!

From a Christian stand point it was really awesome, his vision of Heaven is what I'm hoping for. I really like the bibliography in the end citing where a lot of his ideas came from, not just the Bible but other liturgical texts as well. The science involved was also another delight with some suprising inventors stepping into the mix.

Having said that, the series overall is one of the best ever presentations of espionage and counter-terrorism, the equal of 24 and second only to Homeland, and the BBC adaptation of Tinker Tailor.This season is largely self-contained with little reference to what came before, and can therefore be recommended to those who want to watch only one season.

The loss of my favorite character actually brought tears to my eyes. This entire series is so well written and acted and is 100 times better than anything on American tv. Not knowing from week to week who is going to survive has been the ultimate cliffhanger. Is there a petition or something to let the BBC know we'd like more of this fine show?

Salt Lake City, 1973 is my favorite song on the album. It sums up what most of us know as children. Joshua is another song that made me look back at those adults which had a big affected in my life when I was young. Each of his songs hits a heart string and memory which gives his music on this album an impact not felt when I listen to other artists.

Ick.I suspect many of the positive reviews here were written by young women smitten by Wood. And he is cute, and he is in every scene in this film. If I were still 15, I expect I'd feel the same.But if you happen to be a grown up, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book!","review":"If this movie worked for you, that's great! It was a real disappointment to me although I love Elijah Wood's acting skills, and think Richard Cormier's books are fantastic to read.Something was amiss with this movie - the acting other than that of Elijah Wood, Janeane Garofalo, and the young boy in the wheelchair, was stilted - they sounded as though they were reading, not acting. The adaptation from the book by the same name left out a lot, and the actors weren't able to relay that message very well.It may be an OK movie if you haven't read the book - but don't watch it without reading the book, first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent acting, so-so plot","review":"Elijah Wood (The Faculty) stars as Barney Snow, an amnesiac patient in a ward for the terminally ill, who is desperately trying to remember his past.

The last twenty minutes will take your breath away. Excellent acting, especially from Wood, though the entire cast is strong. If you feel frustration and a kind of disjointedness in the beginning of the film, realize that you are meant to. It makes the end of the story powerful and heart-wrenching. This is an under-appreciated film, and I can only encourage you to watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunning.","review":"To be honest, I only saw this the first time with my friends because it had Elijah Wood in it. It immediately became my favourite movie (tied only with Lord of the Rings). What I love about it, is that it isn't an ordinary shoot-em-up, American terrorism movie like those that have become so popular lately. Instead, it is about life, and death, and love, and how the human spirit can triumph over greater odds. It's the sort of movie that makes you wonder what it would be like if the same thing were happening to you; if one day, you woke up and didn't know who you were, or where you were, or anything about your past. This movie is the only movie besides Lord of the Rings that has ever made me cry. The acting is amazing, the directing is beautiful, and there is no need for special effects, unlike most of today's films. An absolutely brilliant piece of work, and it's such a pity it's not better known- it deserves to be. It touches the heart and the mind, and is a definite must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and heartfelt","review":"I rated this movie 4 out of 5 stars based mostly on the heart-touching quality of it. It doesn't much matter if the ending is confusing and questionable. The ending just denotes that we all have spirits who need to fly, not be immobilized by an uncurable disease. If you watch the movie closely, there are some very artistic qualities about it, such as when Elijah Wood is bouncing the ball against the wall and there is a star of light shining between him and the wall. I enjoyed the acting, except (slightly)for Jeanene Garofolo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Elijah Wood can't save this movie","review":"I'm a fan of Elijah Wood, but even he can't save this movie. The glacial pacing and confused story destroy an interesting premise. Also there is a total lack of chemistry between Elijah and Rachel Leigh Cook. The suffering of children with fatal illnesses is depicted with a certain realism in the Burto character, but it is only a partial picture because he is completely disconnected from his friends and family. Still, for me that was the most interesting part of the movie. The physicians are wooden zombies. Barney Snow's sufferings didn't project at all. Overall boring, a waste of otherwise talented actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of disjoint excerpts taken out of context.","review":"The title of this book is misleading. Not only is it limited to the first of the seven books of the Hadiqa, but even that book is abridged mercilessly. It is a loose collection of short phrases quoted out of context, selected by the translator Mr. Pendlebury. As such, it reveals more about the views of the translator himself than about those of Sanai. The only thing worth reading is the 20-some page introduction to Sofu poetry, but even then, it is overpriced. Stay clear of that book. Try, instead, to find Major Stephenson's translation entitled \\"The first book of the Hadiqa: the enclosed garden of truth\\", which has an honest title for an accurate, unabridged translation of the first book only.

I found myself skimming over large hunks of text that were either descriptions of historical events or the inevitable and prolonged descriptions of what the characters ate or what they were wearing. Another annoying habit the author has is to have her characters tell other characters about events that have been described earlier in the book. So you read about the event and then you have to suffer through repeat descriptions of the same event as a character relays it to others.

Maybe that would make her books more intersting.

I could not warm to any of the many characters who were introduced, and thought I know it was part of a series and so I could not know all the characters, I did not really care enough about any of them to get involved.

Even though some people thought it wasn't much it was home to a lot of people for a lot of years and I loved the way they all pulled together in the mist of a tragedy, a very cruel tragedy.Only thing I wish Ms. Miller could of focused more on the main character Brenda, but I guess she wasn't trying to single one character out, she was trying to focus on the buidling as a whole.This book is a very good fast read, with hopes and dreams of people just like you and me.Later......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made leather loafer!","review":"Very nice shoe, great quality.

Only the most minimal amount of infomation is conveyed. Global maps are divided by the spine so as to be worthless. The whole project is unimaginative. This book not worth half the price charged. I wish Anchor Books would up-date their pocket atlas with more attention to the nonwestern world. It was superior in every way to the Longman product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tic Code","review":"This CD Soundtrack of the film, THE TIC CODE, is a fittingly amazing soundtrack CD for an amazing movie. The music is swinging, melodic, and emotional. You don't have to be a jazz lover to love this CD, but if you are it is a dream come true. Beautiful and exciting music by Michael Wolff and his various groups-quartet, trios, larger ensembles, and score work that mixes accoustic instruments with sound design. Also, there are wonderful, historic jazz cuts by Cannonball Adderley, Thelonious Monk, and Wayne Shorter. The best soundtrack Cd I've heard in a long time, as well as the best jazz record. Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Public Speaking","review":"I used the text book for a \\"public speaking\\" course at California State University Hayward campus.The book does an excellent job of taking the reader through the steps in preparing public speeches.

The author actually, literally, suggests that you can stop time by staring at your watch. Was anyone successful?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality, a Different View","review":"A really thought provoking book about the Universe, our selves, and everything else.It provides an interesting take on the Objective, the Subjective, and Time.It is also one of a few places that describe kundalini energy problems.It is a book that with simple illustrations and a few graphs that help with the appreciation of the concepts presented.It is a mind opening book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, and yet disappointing","review":"The ideas presented and explored in this book are interesting and are worth the buy.The arguments and justifications given to support the theories, on the other hand, are incorrect, misleading and baseless.I wish the author had discussed his theories (that are based on physics as it is understood today) with a good physisist. This would have prevented the book from becoming a piece of pseudo-science instead of simply remaining as a wonderful, thought inspiring, pioneering work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to clever or way to obtuse","review":"Hello,I read this book - three times - and obviously didn't get it. Far from being a revelation it kept begging the question, how can works like this get published? and moreover, we wlecomed with such acclaim?Maybe it's because Itzhak Bentov is such a nice guy, maybe its because some people prefer mystical speculation and opinion to anything else, do I know why? haven't got a clue.Anyway, it's sitting there on my bookshelf ready to be read again, someday. Meanwhile, i'll just speculate on more mundane things.Regards,Martyn R Jones"},{"rating":"2","title":"I caught the drift","review":"I must commend Ms. Powell on her debut novel. She developed her characters very well. You felt like you knew them and felt their pain. She had alot going on to hold your attention. It had good messages in the plot, It displayed how many women act in real life relationships. I don't know if I know any Karen's, but I do alot of confused sistas that act like Nikai. It also showed that life is to short, don't take your love ones for granted, appreciate them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long","review":"I don't think this was a bad story, just way too long. I wish the author could have focused more on making Nikai a stronger person than that ridiculous relationship with Robert. By the end of the book, Nikai still hadn't accomplished anything more than what she had before she moved in with Robert. Nothing really made me feel good about the ending of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not catch the drift!!","review":"Needless to say I did not like this book!.

I hope the stories get better, but I will never find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!!!!!","review":"This book was a little bit over the top! Nikai and Robert move in together within a few weeks of knowing each other, and then proceed to claim that they love each other although they barely speak to each other. Like other reviewers have commented- this book is simply about 300 pages too long. It is need of some editing. I would read an R.M. Johnson book over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader","review":"This book was just okay for me. I am now reading the other part to it, \\"Anyone Who Has a Heart,\\" and I am getting the same effect. The book drags on and on. It is to the point where I just want to get to the end of the book. Nikai is not very strong and it is not like she is naive. She has a job but it is taking her a year to save $500. She is living with her man and he is cheating (which she knows about it) but doesn't confront him about it or even accepts it for herself. It is like she is just moving around the situation. Rob is a mess in himself. I don't understand his whole part in this book. The ending of it seemed rushed with Karen's confession and it doesn't really tell what is going on with Rob. I don't think the author really dealt with any of the issues that she wanted to explore in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoutely Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. I knew this incredibly long book was going nowhere but downhill after NIkai moved in with Robert after the second date. These characters were downright stupid & not at all likable, making it a trial to finish this book. I'll never read this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unrealistic...","review":"There were so many things wrong with this book: First, it was way too long with too many unnecessary details. Second, nothing (I stress nothing) was believable. Who moves to another country with someone they have only know for a week? Who tries to have a baby with someone they know is cheating on them? Third, the ending; there were too many things that the author introduced but never addressed. What ever happened with the second music group? She moves in with the producer but are they a couple? Can she have children? I'm glad I got it from a discount store for only 1.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"This book was so incredibly boring, I have no idea what it was about.

There is absolutely no way someone can have a positive experience with this crappy device."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN BY DESIGN - A true piece of junk.","review":"Bought this thing expecting a miracle. Did not expect a piece of junk. It's cheap flimsy plastic (why not anodized aluminum for a $240-$300 device like this?). It TURNS OFF after every scan (absurd). It TURNS OFF while you are DOWNLOADING pictures over the USB cable (ridiculous product design).You also have to specifically buy san-disk brand mini-sd memory or it will not work. I had a nice Kingston piece. Did not recognize it. Nice to let people know ahead of time.Sorry, this thing is pretty much a rip-off. How these guys get away with this junk is probably BUYING OFF Ziff Davis PC magazines and relying on the lazy folks who do not return this broken-by-design piece of junk.

The pen automatically turns off after scanning for a few seconds. I tried to charge the battery, assuming it is a battery problem, but since there is no indicator showing it is charging, I still do not know whether I have been able to charge the battery, and the scanner still can't scan for more than a few seconds, which covers only a few lines of a page. The manual is badly written, does not cover trouble shooting, and does not explain why some buttons are flashing after a few seconds of scanning and before it shuts off automatically. It also does not take user through step by step, such as start by checking if battery is working, how to charge it, and so on. A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately SKIP this ONE!","review":"I bought this crappy \\"scanner\\" so I could use it at the jobsite without having to haul my computer everywhere. To this day I can't charge it completely, I can only scan ONE page before it goes dead. So now I have to take my computer if I want to use it.

For such a cheap price, it is WELL worth the money!Tavener's music is perhaps an acquired taste. If modern, \\"hypnotic\\" sacred choral music appeals to you, then you would certainly do well to buy this recording, which includes some of Tavener's best works. I personally enjoy the Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis best. Everything on here is very well sung -- sometimes truly beautifully so -- by the men and boys of St. John's College Choir.If you like Tavener, this CD is certainly worthy of your collection. If you are not familiar with Tavener's music, then this is the CD to buy to discover it -- the quality of singing is first-class and the price can't be beaten!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great exposure to tavener's work","review":"i've read that some of tavener's recent compositions have ranged from pretentious to excruciating, but the selections on this naxos issue are very approachable and performed with a great deal of reverence.the longest piece, \\"svyati\\", is also the most haunting. a combination of mournful solo cello and simple choral underlay is wonderful.my main complaint is that in places it sounds... mushy. it possibly has to do with the acoustics of the venue, but on passages like \\"the tiger\\" the vocal layers end up smearing each other.comparing it to the clean sound of \\"psalms for the soul\\" (naxos 8.554823) only adds to the frustration. still, a good cheap way to get some excellent late 20th century choral music and a must for tavener fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Tavener","review":"If you're a fan of John Tavener, then you would easily admire this CD once you purchase it. Presented here are some of Tavener's short choral works. From \\"The Tiger\\" & \\"Song for Athene\\" to \\"Svyati\\" & \\"As One Who Has Slept,\\" the composer gives us fine examples of his brilliant mysticism. The only problem here is the sound quality. Naxos usually gives us some top-rate sound that's almost equal to Chandos and Decca. Here, however, the acoustics are a bit mushy in many places. I think it's due to the recording location (St. John's College Chapel, Cambridge). But despite the sound quality, it doesn't detract from the magnificent singing of the St. John's College Choir, Cambridge. In every choral work, they sing without hesitation, nor do they overblow it. This is a superb choral ensemble that is almost as great as Polyphony and The Sixteen.Tavener's Music: AChoir: ASound Quality: B-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Market Day by Lois Elhert","review":"I purchased this book for my 6 year old grandson.

On the other, it is a disc I don't really like to listen to all the way through. This is due mainly to the programmer's apparent intent to educate us by juxtaposing works written while Part was finding his unique minimal voice (Collage on BACH, Sym.#3), with 'Tabula Rasa', written in his mature style. So after serenely anguished 'Tabula' which opens the disc, you get a the 'BACH', a kind of baroque neo-classical affair, followed by #3, a kind of romantic neo-medieval affair, both of which are at odds with the mood of the first work. By the end, I'm not pleased. I suppose I would rather have early and transitional works their own disc, and mature works on a separate disc, working together to create a sustained satisfying listening experience. I'll probably check out some other programming arrangements containing the 'Tabula Rasa' but not the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it Again Sam","review":"I was a personal friend of Sam's in fact a neighbor of his in Maryland for 6 years. I spoke with him a week before he passed away and he was telling me that Shakespeare's Identity was still an elusive subject for him and other scholars. He felt that his book ,William Shakespeare : A Compact Documentary Life, a lifelong pursuit was a good primer for beginners but that he felt incomplete about it and wished he had another life to make changes. This I found powerful as he was willing to be open about this and not be stuck in being an expert. Although his research in this book carries influence as authoritarian on Shakespeare's life , Sam up till the end of his life was convinced there had to be more. His publisher of course was unwilling to consider a new revised edition. But one thing Sam stressed over and over in the book as well that it was important for teachers who used his research to be careful in not telling students this was the absolute Gospel on Shakespeare's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably their best..","review":"I haven't heard all their albums, but I think it's a fair guess this album is likely their best.Usually, I'm a bit wary of any artist that tries to copy the Fab Four to a tee. The Spongetones are an exception. At least, they are a tad more genuine than yer run of the mill, low-rent, power pop, Beatles clone.The vox are a little like Macca's and music is early day Beatles- but no so much that they are copy cats.The bottomline, Beatles references aside, the songwriting is fairly top notch and catchy. Most songs are under 3 minutes; only a couple are over 3 minutes (and one of those is an 'epic' 4 and a half minutes in length).Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good material but Not Bogel's Best Work","review":"Songs range from humorous (\\"Silly Slang Song\\") to serious (\\"What Kind of Man\\" - BEST Track on the disc).Some of the material seems to try to hard at being socially conscious. \\"Amazon\\", in particular, falls victim to the type of rash generalization that makes Greenpeace so annoying.All in all, not a good first introduction to Eric Bogel's fine body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I bought the Mini Vert after having had the blue version.

The characters are all highly endearing though some might take offense as one of the characters is a male cross dresser, even though the series comes subbed only the cast played their roles terrifically and I truly hop that if this series gets dubbed that the cast they get do just as great a job.

This one is my absolute least favorite. unlike some of the other negative review I did not find the direct references to black people to be racist or otherwise disturbing at all. What bothered me most was that the music itself is not soothing. Much of it feels discordant which gives the disc a very subtly haunting feel, as if it should be in the movie score for something like Chucky or Dolly Dearest.If you are looking for truly soothing music that is agreeable for both adults and babies the current top choice for me is the Acoustic Dreamland by Putamayo.

I do believe this text would be very good in the role as a primary undergraduate transport text, but I expect to see the use of the Bird text continue because of its quality and longevity in the field.

I liked it so much I went out and got the second Alexis Albright novel, The Jade Crucible which I am going to start as soon as I finish typing ...now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you Gunnm","review":"Your review saved me from selling an item (I sell books on ebay) that is so contrary to my own morality. We picked this one up at a library book sale, and the back cover in no way indicates the depth of the Christian Right proselytization within. As an open-minded Pagan I would normally sell just about anything, but there are a few things that stick in my craw. I don't supprot banning this book from a public library, but I can keep this particular copy from going further with my name behind it. Would have put 0 or negative stars if possible.Thank you again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to recommend it.","review":"I've studied the \\"Gated Community\\" debates for years, professionally, and this book hasn't a single original idea in it--the research is rehash, the conclusions tepid, and the writing itself is sallow at best, and sophmoric otherwise. One suspects this project was designed for Ivory Tower purposes, as the authors give no indication of ever having been involved in Urban Planning in any way--a necessary prerequisite for a monograph such as this, I'm afraid.... MY suggestion to the potential reader is to simply relfect on the obvious issues at stake in any discussion of Gated Communities, and *think*--for the present volume is sorely lacking in intellectual rigor as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is an important topic, but the empirical work in this book is at the level of the average newspaper.

It was a fun book, and I enjoyed reading it, but it just came nowhere near what I've come to expect from Varley. The characters were two-dimensional, especially by the standards of the rest of Varley's work, and the deus ex machina of the drive technology of the ship irritated me. If this is the first of Varley's books you've read, you're in for a real treat when you pick up Wizard or Steel Beach and see what he's really capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stench of gratuitous antisemitism mars book","review":"I noted some mild antisemitism in the ending of this book.

Desire the oft-told stories of good people who cannot fit into big projects? Thumbing their nose at regulations- Varley has conspirators outmaneuver the local law, FAA, NASA and a slew of others. Doing what? Taking a jaunt to Mars.You will love how they settle issues of leadership, as well as adapt and test items. The story has its emotional moments, and people change as a result. And yup, their reward is great.It says a lot about me that I welcome and expect the next big space travel breakthrough to be discovered by independent researchers and not a military/industrial combination.This is a series: get them all because you will want to see where they take you."},{"rating":"2","title":"'squozer' makes the story work","review":"This is a very interesting story.

His Titan trilogy stands as one of the finest works in all SF. That's why this is --so-- disappointing. As others have pointed out, this is vaguely reminiscent of Heinlein's juvenile SF, but it is not nearly as good. This isn't appropriate for juveniles and I don't even think they would find it interesting. The first half of the book is about the variously messed up lives of some uninteresting teenagers. The character development is poor, the dialog is wooden. The \\"washed up ex-astronaut\\" and the events that led to his disgrace are implausible and the \\"character\\" is very poorly developed. The novel is supposed to be filled with coon-ass cajuns from south Lousiana. Well, I grew up in New Orleans, and these characters are completely hollow, with no authenticity.I can't recommend this book at all. Read Titan/Wizard/Demon or the short fiction by this author, but this book is one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter disappointment..","review":"While I have thoroughly enjoyed John Varley's other books, this one was a major letdown.

And as for the rescue, well, I had a hard time caring.An average read, IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Thunder","review":"There is no doubt that John Varley is one of the best science fiction authors. There is no doubt that this is his weakest book. I have read everything Varley has written. I would give most of what he has written as many stars as I could. His short stories are superb. His novels are superb.Unfortunately, this book borders on juvenile fiction, but isn't quite simple enough. This book borders on adult fiction, but really lacks any sort of suspense or involved plot. In short, this book is a tremendous dissapointment from an otherwise great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, too much sex","review":"I'm afraid I must agree with some of the other reviewers. Characters somewhat cardboard, but there are some real moments.

AN eccentric inventor comes up with a new power technology (that sounds alot like Zero Point Energy) that basically obsoletes everything else. So pooling some spare change, they build a spaceship that can get a crew of 5 to Mars and back inside a week.While the characters have a certain charm, there really aren't many surprises in this story, and you have suspend belief a bit when it comes to all the family members who have just-the-right skills necessary to prepare RED THUNDER for launch.I'll we looking for more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Heinlein","review":"Classic '60's Heinlein, only more so.

I thought I was buying a listen and learn CD course. What you get are CD's, a dictionary, and a course book. I have to admit I was not keen on the idea of the course book and I hated the whole thing after a couple of days, but I stuck with it. Over all I will say that the course is good and you do learn to speak, read, and write Russian. This course teaches you how to pronounce the words really well. I feel this was better for me than courses I have tried for other languages. The only thing I really think could use improvement would be the CD's them selves. There is no English spoken with the words and sentences come one time really fast. You will find your self pausing and replaying a lot. If you want to learn to read and write Russian as well as speak it then this is a good course. If you just want to lean a few phrases and how to ask for things I might try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird pronounciation","review":"I bought this product a few months ago.I started using the cds and everything seemed ok at first.I also take classes in russian.My teacher is russian.I'm taking classes for 6 months now.As i was getting better i realized that some of the words where pronounced very wierd.For example the female speaker pronounces the word \\"shto\\" which means \\"what\\" as \\"chto\\" while the male speaker pronounces it regularly as \\"shto\\".This is not standard russian accent.I've never heard of any russian saying \\"chto\\".So i thaught that this must be some regional accent.I even asked my teacher about this and she laughed.She said that she is not aware of any region in Russia where \\"shto\\" is pronounced as \\"chto\\".Also some word endings are pronounced wrong.For example a \\"b\\" at the end of a word should be pronounced as p,while a b in this course is always a \\"b\\" no matter where it is positioned in a word.Has anyone else noticed these?A review of a native speaker of russian would help a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless course in Russian","review":"This set has 3 CD's, a Russian coursebook, and a Russian dictionary. The coursebook does have information in it but the book is not put together in a way that aides learning.The first lesson is 5 pages long. Part A is titled The Letters and Sounds of the Russian Language but tells you that the letters and sounds will be learned in another chapter. Part B gives a list of people's names and Part C lists geographical names.Lesson 2 is just another list of words and names.Lesson 3 gives a list of the Cyrillic alphabet and the names of the letters but not the sounds!The dictionary might be ok but since I don't know Russian, how would I know. The front of this book gives a 4 page pronunciation chart.I do think the coursebook would be ok for a phrase book.I don't think the CD's are very useful except the parts that conjugate verbs.Overall, this is not worth paying full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock album I've heard in years!!!","review":"SPOUT is absolutely amazing!

It says its good up to 100 meters but that's a lie. I went swimming in a swimming pool and it leaked, its still working but i can't read the screen at all. I bought this watch because it was almost like my old watch that worked just fine for 7 years. I took that one scuba diving tons, it went with me to about 115 feet and it never got any water in it. But this one is horrible it died in less than 5 feet of water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, inexpensive","review":"My husband loves this watch - his 'weekend watch' ... it replaced the previous one, same model.

Summers we live on a boat and I needed something that was minimally waterproof, reasonably reliable, reasonably cheap. I've had Timex watches since I was a kid and they either die the day after the warranty expires or they last forever, so I knew what I was getting. Watch has performed exactly as I needed with the additional benefit that when my husband put it through the washing machine, it didn't miss a second. It actually has more features than I'll ever use, but I'm just plain tickled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch, but the band is a little small.","review":"Overall I am satisfied with this watch. I bought it to replace a Timex Iron Man watch I have had for the last sixteen years. The watch is very readable even at steep angles. All of the controls are intuitive and conveniently placed. Buyers should know that the watch band may feel a bit tight on larger wrists, however. I am 6'7\\" and about 285. About the last inch of the band is a thick rubbery material and so cannot be adjusted down all the way to the end.

In 2007 I purchased this same watch for my husband and sent it to him in Iraq. Now, 4 years later the same watch is still working perfect but the poor face is so beat up that one can hardly read the time so figured it was time to replace it. Bought 2 of them this time and will put the other away to replace the new one when is becomes to hard to read the time.. Takes a beating and keeps on working. Happy with this for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch for Great Price","review":"I Have had this watch for about a month now, and am happy with it. I have had it in hot/cold/sandy water, and it has not lost its water resistance.Cons: The watch face is even with the bezel, so scratches easily (I can still read it, though, and the deeper scratches slowly buff out and do not inhibit visibility). The Indiglo button on the front of the watch, so it can be bumped rather easily. For smaller wrists (6\\" circumference), the Velcro hooks extend beyond the Velcro, so can catch on clothing. In the month that I have had it, it has lost approx. one second.Pros: Setup is very easy. One can't mistake what the words/numbers on this watch say. Great features include the following: time, date, hourly charm (on/off), two time zones, button beep (on/off),timer, chrono (with split lap options), optional night mode feature (light comes on when buttons are pressed), and 3 alarms that can be set to daily, weekends, or weekdays.Overall, this watch works well for active people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought I ordered","review":"I ordered this product for my wife's work and Norton 2006 is the latest product that is usable on Windows 2000.

Carol Shaya is so sarcastic, something like Gina Gershon in \\"Black and White\\" and \\"Insider\\" both of which I also really enjoyed. She is also surrounded by a good cast. She is also cast in a part perfect for her but she really does have acting ability. I thought it was going to be an exploitation film but there is a good story. A jewish female cop goes undercover to solve rapes at a catholic school. In cop stories, I am SO TIRED of superiors fighting against the cops on the street.

Her blissful marriage is positioned at center stage, regardless of its relevance to menopause. She is passionate about her husband AND her topic.By midpoint, her cloying and repetitive praise of her husband, Gerald - (\\"dear,\\" \\"wonderful,\\" \\"eternal partner\\") becomes an unseemly bit of bragging that I, a cranky perimenopausal woman, was in no mood for!

Chris Stewart impressed me with his ability to convey the jet piloting experience in writing, so that the reader believes he is right in the officer's shoes. The scenario of biological warfare was quite creepy and believable. So what if the plot is familiar! I get back on rollercoasters I like.

It is computer-generated and is one of the most colorful atlases. The shading is also exceptionally accurate and amazing. The satellite section shows a variety of environments, and they are all large, clear, and colorful. The cities are labeled by population, a useful feature. The thematic section is also quite fun to read. The map projections and relief are extremely consistent.

I have been involved in several physical altercations while wearing my watch, and never had a problem with it.

Seven years ago I lost it in a river, amazingly found it a few months later, and it was still working. I have replaced several bands and it is a little beat up, but it keeps on ticking. Just last week it started malfunctioning, but I think that is due to a depleted battery. I *almost* hope it will die for good so I'll have an excuse to replace it! $1.66/year is not a bad price for a watch! I gave it four stars because the face tends to scratch easily.

The Indigo lasted about a year. The leather band is fine. Using this as a running watch has a drawback - it is hard to cut on and off so that you have to be very focused on starting and stopping. There is a delay of a second or two to get this done. The start and stop are two different controls. The good part of that is that you are unlikely to accidentally stop the watch. I use a cheap watch with easily accessible on/off switch and separate lap timer. Despite years, I still find it cumbersome to try to use this for jogging. As to general functions and looks, I still like if and wear it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as durable as I was led to believe","review":"Within a few weeks there were many scuffs on the watch face.

A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good watch, but . . .","review":"It has a good strong alarm, and the three alarms with daily/weekday/weekend options are very handy. Also not a huge watch, very well-sized for smaller arms like mine. I had one for a couple of years that finally go too scratched up.

It is light-weight, goes through metal detectors without having to be removed, survives water and sand, and keeps great time. As a no-nonsense timepiece it can't be beat. My law partner has put away his fancy, expensive watch and purchased this model out of envy for its utility.

It is sold 2 in a pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I ordered this two pack for my Bell-branded hitch rack and it fits perfectly. Any rack with rails that are about 1\\" in diameter will work with this. I wasn't able to confirm this before I ordered so I figured I would take the chance and return if needed. The way it attaches to the rails is perfect, every secure clam shell clip. The two rubber bands per cage are thick and look like they will last a long time. Holds bikes very well. My only complaint is that there is still some movement of the bike and where the plastic of the cage touched the bike frame, it rubbed away the paint. Good thing both of my bikes are aluminum so I don't have to worry about rust, but it would be nice to see a thick rubber pad built into the cage to protect the finish of the bikes. Only 4 stars because this is something Thule should have thought of. Other than that, they are perfect, even if you don't have a Thule rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't fit","review":"I purchased these cages for my Thule Hitching post rack. The cages do not fit around the arms of the hitching post. I went to Wal-mart and bought and assortment of bungee cords for less than $10.

How effective could these actually be? But for the price I figured \\"why not give them a try?\\"Worth the extra $20 or so. Although there was little to no sway with the Thule rack in the first place (I love my Thule rack - the 912), these keep the bikes extra firm and in their place when you're on backroads. But, I think most importantly, these cages keep the bikes from banging into each other and causing unnecessary frame dings.Cons:A little bit of a hassle to put on and take off - maybe 5 minutes extra to secure two bikes.Also, you have to throw them in your car rather than leave them on the rack - too easy to steal so why risk it.I like them - I recommend as long as they're less than $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works much better than expected","review":"I had a problem with the front of my mountain bike coming out of the cradle with my 937 rack.

To make matters worse, the Silex manual, FAQs and support resources are all 2nd rate to the point of being amateurish. The Silex documents are written in what we used to call, \\"Jinglish\\", meaning that they need additional translation into English to be considered readable.Not only was I unable to get the SX-2000WG working with my printer, but the Silex Virtual Link software would repeatedly prevent disconnection from the printer once my PC was logically connected. (Note that it is necessary for each user to manually \\"disconnect\\" from the printer before others on the network can use it, a weak design in my opinion.) The only way to disconnect was to repower the server.In short, this product is defective by design and implementation and was ultimately returned to the vendor for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mac friendly","review":"I bought this device so that I could scan wirelessly on a Canon MP830 which is currently connected to an Airport Base Station.

Unfortunetly, this will only be read by fellow liberals, who are already angry enough. This book really deserves to be read by the moderate in your family, or as a gift for the republican we all keep as the skelaton in the closet.

There is good detail for those that read intuitively, but for those that wish to stretch beyond the traditional... you may want to go for another set of cards.

Yes, the colors are vibrant. Yes, the symbolism is identical to the classic Rider-Waite. But the images themselves possess none of the artistry of the original. They are poorly executed copies. The faces of the people and archetypes in particular are dull, expressionless, lifeless. Consequently I couldn't connect with the cards at all. If anything, they gave me new appreciation for my old Rider-Waite deck, yellowed and tattered as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"RADIANT INCOMPLETE","review":"Ok, so after reading the reviews I thought that I'd love this deck.

I went through every card and when I reached the suit of cups I realized that it was missing about 5 cards. I thought they'd be mixed in with the rest of the cards. I didn't have many left and this concerned me. I went through the rest of the cards and what do you know, the last suit was missing 75% of the cards. NO JOKE.I contacted Amazon and filed a return.The colors are bright and pretty, but the deck is not as pretty as the Universal Rider Waite.

That has provided a wealth of material to draw on for this 4-CD set, which spans his earlier years, from 1930 to 1952. As a reference guide to his career progression, from the Chocolate Dandies, Spike Hughes Negro Orchestra, the London and Continental sessions, thence back to pre and postwar America, it is hard to see how this compilation could be bettered.Throughout, Benny Carter's sophisticated and elegant approach is on display, which marked him out early on as one of the supreme stylists, particularly on the alto saxophone, although his talents encompassed also trumpet, clarinet, trombone, tenor sax, and piano. The set is rounded out in Proper Box fashion with a 52-page illustrated booklet by the indefatigable Joop Visser."},{"rating":"2","title":"music master indeed","review":"it was easy for me to pigeonhole Carter when I was learning about jazz. He was not Johnny Hodges, not Charlie Parker, not a swing tenor (my favorite species). I took his reputation for granted, and didn't really get what the reality was. The shift started several years ago when I first acquired \\"April in my Heart\\" by Billie Holiday and an unbelievable group -- Lester Young AND Hershal Evans, Harry James.

So far it is very good. I got the bigger brush and this one is faster than the one I had before. One thing I learned with the other Oral-B is that if you put the holder on the charger with the toothbrush attached it will drip water onto the charger and eventually corrode the base away and the machine will fail. I remove the toothbrush, put it into a small glass, then use my towel to wipe the holder dry. That eliminates the problem.The price has come down since I first bought this. Many years ago the first one was at least $60 and the brushes were $8 each for 3 at wallyworld. But they are greatly superior to the traditional brush. My dentist commented how clean my teeth were, especially around the rear teeth where the traditional hand longitude brush couldn't reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great brush!","review":"This brush is great.

After reading the positive reviews on this much less expensive brush, I thought I would try it. I barely lasted through one toothbrushing session. The action of the brush is so aggressive, my jaw was shaking wildly. I felt like I was in a torture machine. I am used to using an electric toothbrush so it wasn't the adjustment from manual to electric. This is just a wild machine. I won't use it and haven't a clue what to do with it now.

Smith combines humor, suspense, and Connecticut history to great effect. She deals with serious subjects (autism, the death penalty, rape) in a sensitive way, yet she manages to inject the funny misunderstandings of children (\\"Hail, Mary, full of grapes...\\") into a narrative that I didn't want to end.

Reading about the areas and the streets and businesses was so familiar it made me feel I was back there in that time again. A very good read.Back at that time, most of us walked to where we had to go. We felt very safe on the routes. My memories of Charter Oak Terrace start in 1947.A friend emailed that her daughter had read the book, and as it was local and written by someone who was part of the experience, thought she might be interested in reading it. Consequently, my friend knew I had lived in Charter Oak Terrace for 4 years and she had visited there often and she felt I would especially be interested in it.As a result, I found it a compelling read and now that I've found her, will be looking to read other books by Mary-Ann Tirone Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls of Tender Age: A Memoir","review":"This book was very easy reading.

Interesting. The murder? Not so much.","review":"I enjoy reading memoirs- idk why, I just do. So, at the first chance I read Girls of Tender Age. The first half of the book was a memoir of Tirone-Smith's childhood in a silent house- her older brother, Tyler,was autistic and could not stand noise of any kind- laughing, crying, and dog barking, to name a few. If Tyler heard such noises, he would knaw at his arm. We also are told of Tirone-Smith's family history, which is quite interesting, as well as a background of a killer. The second half consists of Tirone-Smith's attempt to recall, make sense of, and write about a murder that occured when Tirone-Smith was 10. Her classmate, Irene, was strangled to death with her own scarf. Despite what the bookcover says, Irene is not Tirone-Smith's neighbor or even friend. She was only a quiet classmate, and the book falls apart after her murder. I was disapointed, because up to that point I had been throughly enjoying it. It became quite uncomprehensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"A wonderful book about a multiple of things, I loved it from start to finish.

The first issue of Fantastic Four was likely a rush job, and you can almost feel the acceleration in which Jack Kirby produced these drawings, so it's all the more startling to see the energy and creativity he pored into each panel when they are blown up to giant size in this volume. I love Mosley's idea of presenting those panels in even larger format in a museum exhibit, and am glad to see that the The Hunterdon Art Museum is hosting an exhibit of Kirby's work this spring. As other reviewers point out, the book is not perfect, but it's an excellent start in assessing and accessing comic-book art in new and exciting ways. I'd love to see a similar volume attempted for Steve Ditko's surrealistic Dr. Strange adventures, and the list goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"clean historical romance","review":"I really enjoyed the action and adventure in this western romance. It was a very interesting well put together book. I had a problem with the immaturity of the main characters but when I realized they were only 16 for most of the book, I understood. The dialog was not as natural as I would have liked, but this is the first book by this author and it did improve as the book progressed again I wonder if it was because of their immaturity. As they matured I grew to like the book more. This is an adult romance as it deals with premarital sex, but was cleanly written by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable novel","review":"This is a very enjoyable novel by a talented new writer.

Those familiar with Moffatt's music know that she is one of those singer songwriters who helped invent Country Rock back in the 70's and that almost all of the music we listen to on the radio today has in one way or another been influenced by artists like her. On this CD, mostly an album of covers, Moffatt sings with an understated simplicity that makes songs like old standards \\"You Don't Know Me\\" and \\"Miss Otis Regrets\\" seem totally brand new. Three of the songs are written by Moffatt and her long time partner, Tom Russell and contain a depth and sophistication that is not often found in music today .

So, I'm gonna get to that point with this Hamilton Beach: this unit brews excellent, full-flavored coffee just like the \\"Flavor Plus\\" feature promises! I've been here and there and spent beaucoups of money on different types of gourmet beans trying to get that restaurant quality of coffee with the Gevalia/Melitta model I have been using. Now, with this Hamilton Beach, the search is over. I even brewed some supermarket, in-the-can ground coffee not even using the FlavorPlus feature and the cup of coffee still tasted great. This one's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee","review":"We bought this unit to replace another coffee maker because of its styling. Of course, it was bought to make coffee, which it does quite well. The pre-wet cycle adds about 5 minutes to the brewing time. But the great coffee smell in the morning is enough to wake me up. Its also a breeze to clean since the filter basket is easy to remove. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally A great coffee maker","review":"I bought this coffee maker after reading the reviews here. I have had two Cuisinart pots and I was not satisfied with them They leaked and the basket would overflow (not drip)often. This is a real mess!!! The Hamilton Beach brews a very full flavored cup of coffee when you use the prewet cycle. I love strong rich coffee and now I can have it every morning. I recommend this coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice exhaust tip","review":"I rated this tip a 4 only because the first one I bought had a visible weld seam right on top.

Much higher quality than chrome plated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suitable tool for the serious Bukowski fan.","review":"The logic is clear. The examples are numerous. The only such work of its kind to my knowledge. There is plenty of academic jargon, but the ideas are recognizable. Only the complete Bukowski nut will not find something new worth considering. Readers will find the sheer volume of quotes useful, but some literary background helps, there is a chapter on 'Metonymy'. Probably too specialized for those unfamiliar with the author's work, unless they happen to be preoccupied with the American Labor Movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry...Buk was NOT a lefty!","review":"Despite the efforts of liberals,and the leftto claim bukowski as thier own,the simple fact is..he wasnt.Buk was apolitical.In FACT,he made several comment's onhow the left was so consumed with thierown self importance,they *lose* credibility.You want proof?Of course you do.Read \\"The captain is out to lunch....'It's right there in plain buk english.That of course doesn't mean buk didn'tunderstand the poor,and the suffering,because he was one of them.It just means he was aware of the elite left's abilityto pimp these kind of issues for thier own agendas.If you read his books,you will see his opinion varied from issue to issue.The \\"author\\" of this \\"book\\",is out to lunch,buk would have vomited on it,and wasted no time in throwing her confused carcass out the door.I'm sure if she really knew bukowski as well as she claims,she is already aware of it...and probably loves the thought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Program For Web Development","review":"I am a owner of a web design firm.

Kudos to Joey Green for writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This book is terrible. This book is for 3rd-graders. It will tell you what you already know, is overly simplistic, and offers no details, no inside information, and is not enlightening. It is written in super huge type so it can offer you 280 pages of headlines with a sentence or two below each entry.

Otherwise I would not recommend buying this four CD set even though the price is low. Three of the CDs offer only seemingly random and disorganized words and 1 CD offers similarly disorganized short phrases. (To illustrate how randomly chosen they are, I'll just give you the first 4 so-called expressions: \\"My pleasure,\\" It's over,\\" \\"Why not?\\" and \\"It's about time.\\") A first time visitor needs the basics - greetings, numbers, polite phrases - and this product doesn't offer those necessities, at least in any way that's easily accessible. Words and phrases are spoken in English and then repeated once in Swahili; later on the same CD Swahili comes first and the English second, but the words are not in the same order. The whole thing's a mishmash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you're interrested in some music tech history.","review":"This documentry can be a bit boring, but it is fascinating to hear first hand about the developement of the electronic synthesizer from its creator and associates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfactory documentary","review":"Well worth the time spent on watching it.You can see how this man was able to change the face of all music genre from electronic to hip-hip to prog rock by thinking outside the box. You can also see the parallels between how Robert Moog thought and how a modern dj thinks.It also reveals that no matter what age you are in humanity in general tends to react to change the same way. Skepticism and fear on the instrument abounded, until something triggers the change and then it becomes broadly accepted if the right conditions are given. Now we hear those kind of sounds every day.Very good jokes by Rick Wakeman.I was a little bit let down they didn't credit Jordan Rudess who's in the back playing with Rick Wakeman at what probably was Moogfest.What Robert Moog says at the end is the most important thing and I think is what motivates musicians to be on stage on the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin on context, rambling, Tedious.","review":"The best part of the film is the animated intro and title sequence done in an early 70's style. If only the film could've carried on some of that creativity and interest. Sadly, it's a bit of a waste of hours of interviews with Mr. Moog.To be short, it's dreary and tedious. Partly because there's no organizing direction and we're left with interviews jumbled together. I kept waiting for the film to start because it felt like clips spliced together. One wonders if the interviewer ever followed up on a question he asked.As soon as the film starts with the interview with Mr. Moog - no setup, context - that's what you're in for the whole way.It's really for hard core Moogiacs or if you want to get a glimpse into the man. Overall, very disappointed. How it can earn 4 or 5 stars is beyond me unless the scale goes to 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"mumbling, muttering mess","review":"A documentary about Robert Moog, one of the most important figures in electronic music? Yes, please, sign me up. Alas, this premise goes awry from the outset. This mishmash of a documentary feels like a collection of outtakes from a better work. I don't need to see Robert Moog talking about pepper plants and Money Mark diddling around on a synthesizer.MOOG demonstrates that sometimes it's best to not rely on the subject of the documentary as the subject matter expert of the film. Robert Moog is not the most well-spoken advocate and historian of his life's work. Likewise, showing the electronic guts of his machines doesn't do much to explain how they work or why Moog's work is important to the music world.When utilizing archive footage, MOOG works. Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between leaving MOOG a mumbling, muttering mess for its interminable seventy-two minutes. Moog and electronica deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Giant Deserves Better","review":"This wonderful pioneer of electronic music deserves to be praised and studied. This documentary does neither - it consists of long, tedious diatribes by people like Rick Wakeman. That's about it.And how can you offer a documentary about Moog without mentioning Wendy Carlos, much less interviewing her?Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's wendy/walter?","review":"Finally having seen this, I'm troubled and shocked by the fact that there is no mention whatsoever to Wendy,or Walter,for that matter,Carlos in this program.In fact Robert Moog starts the film by saying that 'Switched on Bach' started it all,that it was the sole cultural artifact that introduced synthesis,and sinthesizers to the mass audience,and general conciousness,but he was either been shamefully edited or samelly omitted 'Switched on Bachs' creator,and mastermind ,sinthesis pioneer Wendy Carlos,by then going by the name of Walter,and obviously of another gender as well.Whatever caused this,and appart from unwillingness of Wendy's part to colaborate,one can fairly assume the worse,only descredited the works as at least historically incorrect,and frankly,perilously bordering on revisionism.You get Rakeman instead.I pass.P.S:R.I.P Bob Moog."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're lucky to have it...","review":"Nobody would fund this poor guy Hans Fjellestad... Wendy Carlos apparently even threatened legal action (for what he did or might do, I don't know). Apparently nobody else had the foresight to realize that Bob Moog wouldn't live forever. We're lucky to have this document on Bob's life, imperfect that it may be. Mr. Fjellestad was working on an extremely limited budget, so how much can you complain when it's clear nobody else was willing to share his dream, or at least help pay for it. Now it's too late to make anything like it again, at least with Bob himself in it. I for one own a copy, and am grateful for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!

There is a static type noise through the entire DVD but it is not overwhelming and you soon grow accustomed to it; it does not overly detract from your viewing experience.The quality of the shows themselves more than makes up for the less than perfect sound quality. Both of the stories told on the DVD where simplistic yet very well told and entertaining. Not to mention thought provoking and at times moving.

Raphael presents a world that can never be, with car flying down the road, air cushioned, at 600 miles an hour.The men are handsome and crewcut in coveralls, traveling down the super highway in a tank of a vehicle as big as an eighteen wheeler. The women are doctors, riding in the back of the vehicle, ready to jump to the assistance of a civilian in need.In many ways this is a perfect example of SF from the late 1950's early 1960's.This novel is well worth your time and effort to find and read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Code Three (Updated et al)","review":"Very disappointed to discover less than one-third of the orginal book was included; the print version was 176 pages long.

As it goes on, however, you really start to wonder about her choices. It seems she puts aside no burdens, imposes no boundaries or thinks that it is important her child learn to engage with other children outside of his mommy-centric world. The whole book is basically a defense of this tactic, all the while wondering why she feels so isolated in her suburban bliss. There are some good points, but I personally am tired of seeing our modern world over-run with kids and parents raised to expect the whole world to devise entirely new rules & systems just for their 'special' ways.She ends the book mentioning the importance of finding a 'fine line' between a child's uniqueness and sociability, thought the enire book is really devoted for us to witness this kid doing & saying whatever he wants, while she brings out small violins for herself.

I read the first 20 pages or-so. Today, I finished off the book. It is very suspenseful & you may just read it as fast as I did.I will say that this is a very interesting book & it is well worth your time. There is just two problems with it:-The last 20-30 pages, you're waiting for something for something suspenseful to happen. But nothing does. That's the reason I gave it four stars. Something huge or radical (nyuk, nyuk) was going to come in my mind.-Luke McHenry, who is the character in first person, is a huge Giants fan. Sorry, bub, but the Angels rock. Can't avoid Halo Magic.Otherwise this is a great book. The characters are well developed & the author puts an interesting twist on the book by placing most of the story in Alaska. It shows that they DON'T live in igloos. They're all just regular dudes up there. A very realistic story.

The sliding pads for some reason are made of a plastic material that has a high coefficient of friction. The mouse simply would not move freely across my desk.

After all, this is thier first record and I'd never heard of them. The truth is \\"Riot by Candlelight\\" is amazing. The whole record is unique in its feel with crunchy beats that vary greatly from song to song. And the rapping is sick. Quick and sharp with flavors of Hieroglyphics and the Pharcyde. There aren't any annoying MC beat downs or gratuitous self glorification. Their raps aren't violent and aren't sexist, but they retain a certain grittiness and darkness that keeps things interesting.This is a completely original albumn.

It worked great for the first 3-4 months, until one morning I went to turn it on & the on/off button not only fell off, but sparks and smoke blew out the place where the button once was. I returned it to the store and exchanged it for another one, exact same model (I really like the coffee maker), yet again 4 months later the button popped off and out came sparks and smoke.

I didn't even try to make cooffee with it, I'm returning it after looking at it. The assembly that clicks the filter basket in place is TOO small and looks like it's NOT GOING TO LAST through many openings and closings. IF the basket is not locked securely into place, the caraffe DOES NOT FIT in easily. If the small part breaks, which it's got too coz it's so SMALL, it's not going to stay in place. Also in order to remove the filter assembly to clean or fill with coffee grinds, the lid for the water assembly has to be open. This is really ackward. Too much to have to balance! A coffee maker should be easy to fill and to clean out, incase grinds get into the filter basket. I LOVE COFFEE TOO MUCH TO KEEP THIS PRODUCT, EVEN IF I ONLY GET A CUP! I WANT SOMETHING BETTER!

It's wonderful !!! takes up very little counter space, makes a terrific cup of coffee, shuts off temporarily without any drips when removing the carafe mid course in brewing, carafe pours well, and it looks sharp !...

Limited counter space was the decision maker when purchasing this Krups 4-cup model. The sleek, compact design was also appealing. While it is not the sturdy 10-cup a day coffee drinker's coffee maker, it is just the ticket for that occasional cup. I've not found the carafe hard to clean, but I do wash it more than once a year so that may make the difference (hint, hint). Handle with some care and this unit will serve you well.

A collection of essays from various Jewish intellectuals who either lived Israel's history and birth or through their standing in the Jewish Community wrote their impression and their testimonies. For me this book was a key to the Holocaust Theology giving it definition and understanding.The collection includes essays by Isaac Deutscher, Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein and others. The essays revealed they were not anti-Zionists, but that they believed that for Israel and the Arabs to find resolution a mutually agreeable solution must be found where the sanctity and the right for the Arabs to prosper as a \\"valued entity\\" must occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Anti-Israel \\"not antisemitic\\" diatribe","review":"This book will be loved by the ideological followers of David Duke, Noam Chomsky, Amy Goodman, Pat Buchanan and Robert Fisk. They all share something in common. That is singling out the Jews of Israel for opprobrium or condemnation on the one hand. And on the other hand ignoring the atrocities committed by Palestinians,Arabs and Iranians on the other. I don't know which one is more detestable the pseudo-liberals on the one side or the anti-Israel conservatives on the other. While it is acceptable to call David Duke a bigot, the anti-Israel bigots on the left are far more dangerous to the fate of the Jewish Israelis. If you criticize their one sided presentation they will quickly try to shut you up by claiming \\"criticism of Israel is not antisemitic.\\" Of course its not but singling out Israel is also not mere criticism. Call it what you will, but it is by definition a bigoted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Israeli make their decisions","review":"Some people think that they can dictate to others what they should or should not do.

(Cut down a 8.5\\"x11\\" paper to 8.5\\"x8.5\\" square.)The process of mandala making is fairly easy. You rotate the stencil a certain number of marks (along the outside, like a clock) and trace the picture.

My 8 year old isn't as much into detail work, but still made several (so that's impressive!)The kids enjoyed making cute mandalas with snowmen, angels, trees and more.

Although I have never met Mr Buck O'Neil I feel that I know him very well now. I know him better than I know a childhood friend, a brother or even my wife. Included in this book are many uplifting stories about real events throughout Buck O'Neil's life. There are stories about father's and sons, husbands and wives, friends becoming family and even enemies becoming friends. And all the while baseball is the backdrop, the background, the scenery, the stage .... Joe Posnanski is an amazing writer. He writes a book about the good things in life, even in bad times, sad times or mad times. This book is with me now, everyday, for the rest of my life. I quote the book and Buck O'Neil regularly.

Five stars for Buck O'Neil.","review":"Buck O'Neil spent some of his baseball life scouting players. He said anyone can spot a young player who can already hit, run, and catch. Buck O'Neil described how to find the next great player to hit, run, and catch.In a connection to the Negro Leagues, the book describes why no major leaguer wears number 42, and why there is one red seat in a sea of blue seats in the Kansas City Royal's stadium, and how to play \\"Cool Papa Bell\\". My kids and I play it when we are driving places.There is much more about the man, the sport, and how America has changed for the better.Even if you don't like baseball, you will love the man in this well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential baseball reading","review":"When you put two master story tellers together for a year of baseball experiences around the country, great stuff happens.

Simply a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buck: Almost too good to be true","review":"Like many baseball followers, my admiration for Buck O'Neil can be traced to Ken Burns' documentary on baseball. How a black man could live through the era in which Buck lived with the attitudes he has is beyond me. (I am white, not American but lived in the US in the 60s and 70s.) Mr Posnanski's book is is a little too sugary, uncritical and unprobing for my liking. I cannot but help to think that with a little probing there is probably bit more to Buck's attitudes than is presented. However, if you want a feel-good book about this topic, this is the dream book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"I couldn't put this book down! I had to force myself to not finish it all in one sitting. It is beautiful and sad to follow one of the final years of Buck O'Neil's life knowing how it recently ended and how he was spurned from the HoF. But, as the book makes clear, Buck would not want anyone to feel sorry for him. He has an amazingly optimistic outlook on life that we could all use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A baseball history and personal story that will captivate you.","review":"Terrific story of the engaging Buck O'Neil and the interweaving of the Negro Leagues and modern baseball.

I have owned the Krups 2100 for years and love it, which is why when needing a second espresso machine, I believed the newest Krups would be equally as good.

I called Krups and the customer serviceperson said \\"We haven't had any complaints with the 2300\\"...Krups obviously does not pay attention to their customers. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you work hard for your money.....","review":"If you work hard for your money, do not waste it on this horrible product. I bought it on Sunday, tried it out, and returned it on Monday. It was an easy decision.Like the other people write in their reviews, it leaks - a LOT. It is another of Krups recent 'piece of junk' products. Ever since they recalled a large number of coffee machines as fire hazards, their product line has been just pitiful. And so has their customer service.I used to buy ONLY KRUPS coffee machines. Now, I refuse to buy them at all. Even if the product works somewhat OK, wait till you try to get spare parts from Krups. I needed spare water filters and a spare filter basket for a Krups ADC machine. After 6 weeks of being on backorder, I told them to take a hike.How can you be out-of-stock on basic parts like water filters? They come with every machine.

Water leaks out of the brewing head, thus delivering watery espresso. This isn't because the gasket was faulty - the store convinced me to exchage it for a different one before I finally gave up and returned the second one. And having used other espresso machines, I know that the filter holder needs to be tight, so it wasn't a wimpy preparation job either. Secondly, the automatic frothing attachment is too low and doesn't swing out far enough from the machine to hang over a counter - so if you have a taller mug, you have to tip it to get it out from underneath. If you set a regular sized cup on the counter and dispense the froth, it spatters all over the place. So, I owe an apology to the others who took their valuable time to review this machine. I should have payed more attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product, did not expect from Krups","review":"We 've had Krups coffie and cappucino machines for at least 10 years. We 've always been happy with their low end models. Which lasted for a number of years and produced excellent quality product.

I sincerely hope someone from Krups actually reads this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the extra money","review":"I currently have a Krups cappucino machine and I like it. I was in need of one that makes more than one cup at a time so I bought this one. I liked the fact that it shoots the froth into the cup for you. What I didn't know was that it would have a long tube hanging out of the side of it and shoot this watery milk out into the cup and all over the counter. Other than that, it's a nice machine, but if you're spending the extra money to have the special frothing, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"If clean, it works like new.","review":"Great little machine. Had all the problems with leaks etc. finally turned the thing upside down to expose the O-rings, remember the Enterprise?, cleaned off old coffee grinds, lubed them with some olive oil, and presto!! it works like new.

But the type 968 is junk. They got rid of the handy push button grounds ejector. Now the filter cup is very frustrating to empty. Our filter cup blew out the screen at the bottom after several months of use. The screen just bent and broke open at the edge. I'm still trying to find a replacement. It sporadically leaked from day one. When and why it leaks is a mystery. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with Leakage and Temperature","review":"There were wonderful directions and diagrams for using this product, so I have no complaints there. However, the machine took an incredibly long time to warm up and I either had to run a whole container full of water through it or make several espressos before it would make coffee that was actually warm. The warming plate never got warm enough to keep the cups warm. While it worked moderately well for making one cup, when I would try to make additional cups by taking the filter basket off and putting fresh coffee in, it would not reseal, and would thus leak around the filter basket. The troubleshooting guide in the owner's manual indicated that this problem was caused when grounds got trapped between the gasket and the filter basket, however, no amount of cleaning (and burnt fingers) seemed to make a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible machine","review":"Like the other reviews state, this machine leaks.It also doesn't get very hot.

It immediately leaked, and continued to do so...and like the previous reviewer, this had nothing to do with me trying to froth/steam anything, as I hadn't gotten to that point yet. So I made a huge mess. Secondly, I didn't like the automatic froth/steamer gizmo...I like being able to control it in a separate container (like the professional baristas do), and this tried to make it automatic. It wouldn't even suck up my milk, even though I was following the instructions implicitly. Finally, I was unhappy that you can only put squatty little cups under the actual filter system, since the clearance is so low. Spend your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate machine, worth the low price","review":"After using the machine for a few months now, I can almost make a decent cafe latte. The espresso shots produced by this machine are not good enough to drink straight, so the foamed milk masks the bitterness. The machine's automatic frothing wand doesn't do a great job, but it is convenient. The machine takes a while to heat up to the right temperature. The ESE espresso basket doesn't work for me; it leaked everywhere and I quickly gave up. As for regular espresso, it seems to do an adequate job if you are very careful about the grind of the beans, the amount of grounds, and the tamping pressure. Screw the basket in _very_ tightly or it will leak. Always descale your machine with those tablets.In sum, if you aren't picky about your espresso and you'd like a cheap machine, this isn't a bad gadget to pick up. If you are a coffee geek, buy a fancy machine. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troublesome","review":"I bought this machine as an upgrade from my old, small, non-pump, but dependable, black Krups espresso maker that I had in college. This machine worked okay for a couple of months, and then I started having trouble getting water to flow with enough pressure to push coffee out in a stream-only tiny trickles would emerge. I tried everything to fix it, cleaning, decalcifying, using thinner coffee grinds, but the problem seems to be the mechanism. The pump does not seem to be reliable. I will have to get a new machine, unfortunately. Italian this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lemon No Matter How You Do It!","review":"What a disappointment from Krups!

No Go!!!!!","review":"My coworkers and I were excited to get this machine to keep at work, and we thought that for the price it would be a great espresso maker. Boy were we disappointed! It works ok when you use the ESE pods (which are expensive), but forget using your own coffee. The head leaks no matter what you do and gets water and grounds in your coffee. You have to just use your judgement as to when the machine done brewing and stop the cycle yourself - the result is that the grounds in the filter are wet and soupy rather than packed and dry, making clean-up a huge pain. $200 is too much to pay for a cup of bad coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"good improvement for the shipping","review":"overall, i like this productors.

Besides, we like to think that all those bubbles are scrubbing and cleaning when we really know their not. And last but not least, since it's not petrolium based it's a whole lot easier once it enters our drains and municipal water systems.

Like all Usborne books, the simple, almost cartoonish, pictures will draw the child's interest to the equally simple and understandable text.The book covers the period of 1450-1750 and explores art and learning; science and invention; new religious ideas; war and weapons.Other topics are the Incas; the discovery of America; the Muslim empires; the Habsburgs; the Elizabethans; European settlers in North America; plantations and trading forts, the Mogul empire; life in Japan; merchants and trade; and lastly, kings and parliaments.Each topic is simply but thoroughly presented for this age group. The book provides a springboard for further learning about this period of history. A book like this will never be out of style for avid learners and for those whose interest in learning you want to encourage or increase.Even adults will learn from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm concert in the rain","review":"What a great dvd this is. Dionne comes across as being very natural and warm in nature. I am sure if it wasn't pouring down with rain, there would have been more audience participation. The backing band is sensational. This is a very enjoyable concert from a very professional entertainer and polished vocalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO MADAME WARWICK!","review":"I have had the privilege to see Dionne live back in 2004 in South Africa when she just embarked on her world tour.

This DVD is going to become a collector's item in years to come! This is a must have for all music lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Instrumental - Boring","review":"This CD is mostly instrumental songs and my son was bored of it easy.

There are so many wonderful Thomas the Tank Engine songs on the videos that we were hoping they would be on this soundtrack. No such luck! Most of the songs are unrecognizable to my toddler Thomas the Tank Engine fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This makes no sense - just like the movie!","review":"This soundtrack contains songs that were not even in the movie - Why is Locomotion by Atomic Kitten even on here? Because its about a train? I can't figure it, since this song wasn't in the movie. It is a perfectly dismal soundtrack to a perfectly dismal movie. My daughter, a HUGE Thomas the Tank Engine fan, thought the movie was \\"okay\\" but I was amazed at how horrible it was. If you see the movie, be prepared for some bad acting an a story line that is confusing and terribly written. This soundtrack fits, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas and the Magic Railroad Soundtrack","review":"My son and I saw the movie four times with a friend and friend's mother. They are 3 and 3 1/2. The repetition was good, and they were as excited the first time as the last.The music was a reminder of the story, and yes, \\"Locomotion\\" played over the closing credits, so the boys, who sat until the lights came up in the theater, knew that as well. Try to remember who the target audience is - not adults, but small children captivated by both Sodor, Shining Time, and all points in between. Depending on his mood, my son becomes Mr. Conductor, or Junior Mr. Conductor when he hears this music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare find!!!","review":"This cd was new and still shrink wrapped as promised. Hard to find even when it was still being made now it is not even made."},{"rating":"1","title":"The suckiest book about Guardian Angels !","review":"This is the suckiest book ever written about Guardian Angels. Hamilton so totally anthropomorphizes the angels to the point where the reader, instead of thinking *angels*, thinks Super Powered People and the angelic is lost. These are spiritual beings, for goodness sake! They can dance on the head of a pin! Why are you putting them in bodies with faceted ruby eyes and bi-color wings? (girl, what on earth were you smoking or were you on acid????) The book is all holier than thou preachy with all kind of human foibles foisted on the angels, and limitations as well. I'm sure Hamilton thought this was a good book when she was writing it, but an English major does not a good writer make. I had hoped to be inspired instead of disgusted. This book is kindling. I bought the book used. Apparently the person who owned it before me only got as far as the dog-eared page 28 as the ensuing pages are pristine. Can you tell I hated this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"these earrings were way smaller than i expected. so i then exchanged it for the skull and crossbones earrings from sabrina silver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing aganist the book itself but Amazon's service is the worst.","review":"I bought this book on 15th July, its been over a mnth and I am still counting my days.

I wish I was buying thsi book from ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful guide","review":"This is very much a study guide and is not really aimed at the inexperienced user. It presumes a lot of knowledge and focuses on preparation of the exam elements only. If you need in depth knowledge then there are better books (QUE, other Microsoft products). As a refresher for the exams I have found it to be excellent. It can highlight the areas needing more study and its exercises get your mindset into the MOS exam process. I would recommend it as part of your arsenal in preparing for the MOS exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT PRACTICE TEST????","review":"The book/CD I received from Amazon DOES NOT contain the practice test as advertised.Per the readme file on the CD the information to access the test is either printed on a sticker on the inside back cover or on the CD itself. Bull!!! The inside back cover is BLANK and the CD has a useless MicroSoft URL on it.Of course you have to break the seal on the CD to find this out. Once the seal is broken, you can't return the book. Just lovely.Additionally, there is no information to reach MeasureUp! anywhere in the book or on the CD. The book refers you to MicroSoft's website. There you will find NO information directing you to the practice test supposedly included with the purchase of this book - only to practice tests you have to pay for.I bought this book based on the review that stated a 2003 practice test is included. Someone care to post exactly WHERE (is any test for that matter) before anyone else loses money on this???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Office 2003 Study Guide","review":"I have not had time to study the guide and will not read study guide until late 2009.

I have used MeasureUp in the past and found their tests to be very helpful in my training. That's why I was concerned when I read in Brett's review that MeasureUp did not actually have MOS 2003 tests. Having contacted MeasureUp's support team in the past, finding them extremely helpful, I decided to contact them again to inquire about the MOS 2003 tests. Once again I was not disappointed. I found out that MeasureUp indeed does have MOS 2003 practice tests and have for some time now. That sold me. I have now bought a book and have my MeasureUp MOS 2003 practice test as well. I am enjoying them both. The sky is no longer the limit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed!","review":"I'm an IT professional that always said \\"some day I'll sit down and really learn the Microsoft Office application.\\" Like all the other IT professionals who say that, I never got around to it until I saw this book. It is exactly what I needed to explore and practice some of the features I had never used like collaboration and using other \\"views\\".There are plenty of good examples and I found that using the eBook on my laptop was easier than carrying around the hard copy. I started with the Word Core test topics and went through each exercise twice (reviewing the topics that I didn't know well and skimming over the familiar ones.) I purchased the test voucher and will schedule my test tomorrow.Overall, I feel prepared and believe this to be an outstanding resource to help me learn the basic and advanced topics for all of the Microsoft Office applicatioins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft A NAME TO TRUST!!","review":"I had to replace my very overworked keyboard, I went looking at ALL THE DIFFERENT MODELS..

We are very light users of our blender, and our last one lasted us for ~17 years. In February of 2010, about 3 months after we purchased it, the bottom ring (that holds the blades in) cracked. Sunbeam (which now owns the Oster brand) sent us a new one. It's now Sept of 2010, and I took it down from the shelf intending to use it, and the ring was cracked again.The body and ring are cheap plastic, and evidently don't hold up even under lightest of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"junque","review":"2 stars because it did crush ice, and because the store where I bought it let me bring it back, so I'm not bitter.however:-after the first use, the motor smelled like burned rubber-the glass jar doesn't lock or snugly \\"fit\\" in the casing when you use the blender - it just sort of sits there flimsily-all those buttons - does anyone know what all of these subjective sounding functions mean, or how many of them - \\"mix\\" vs. \\"blend,\\" \\"liquefy\\" vs. \\"purefy,\\" - even differ from one another?Keep your 12 buttons and give me an old-fashioned, 1 or 2 speed, solid kitchen appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaws","review":"The carafe is too narrow and tips over extremely easy if you set it on the counter. If the lid fit tightly it wouldn't be that big of a deal but when I knocked the carafe over, the lid came off spilling the contents.I use this thing daily to make frozen banana smoothies and need to let the bananas soften before the blender can handle them.Otherwise its decent for the price but I wouldn't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"biggest piece of crap in the history of crap","review":"I don't expect my blender to be able to crush a pile of diamonds, but it would be nice if it was strong enough to at least stir plain water. This thing is so weak, you are better off using your toes to crush the food.My other blender just broke - it used to take me less than 2 minutes to make my daily shakes. Now, with this thing, it takes at least 10 minutes, and it's frustrating because you keep having to unplug it, stir the ingredients and then start again. Not to mention that disconcerting smoking smell that everyone else complains about.Don't buy this piece of garbage - if you really want to spend $30, you are better off donating to your local childrens hospital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible - just not that very good","review":"Doesn't crush ice too well. Leaves small chunks. Stuff on the top doesn't make it down to the blade. I got this thing to make stuff like frozen margaitas, but it just doesn't blend the ice and the mix and alcohol into a smooth drink. I predict the item will hit the garbage when I find one to take it's place. I think I will give Hamelton Beach a try.Forget about this one. Not worth it regardless of price. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!Oster is junk","review":"Don't waste your money!!!!Oster is junk.........I have owned a vintage Oyster 10 Speed from the 1970s. I had used at least 4 times a week for 25 some years. What a great blender it was. It had finally died 4 months ago. Since then I have had 4 OYSTER blends. I tried 2 14 speeds- 2 12 speeds. Each one of them the motors smoked and quit. WHAT A PIECE of crap oyster is making.I thought after 25 years they would have made them better! NOT!!!!!!!!. I make a smoothie just about every morning with bananas, a few frozen strawberries and yogurt. It can not handle that. So today I went garage saleing and found a vintage OYSTER blender for $2.00. Works great. Im sure it will last longer that any new one I bought. I will be looking for more antiquers for backups.DEAR OYSTER COMANY: You have just lost a customer. No more products I will buy from you. You better go back to making them the way YOU USE to-because I will not keep buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blender, lousy cap.","review":"The other day, I was blending for a pie and trying to make sure the lid was on snug, so I wouldn't throw pumpkin all over the walls. My thumb touched the plastic cap in the center and it fell in, ground up and got little minced plastic cap all in my pie mix.So, Beware. The Oster blenders either have a rubber square lid or a rubber cloverleaf lid, but all of them have that same plastic cap in the center. The rubber lid bends and the cap has all the room in the world to drop through.Oster has always made great kitchen products. That is why it came as something of a disappointment to see such a shoddy design."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to continue after first year study is done.","review":"I am just a lay person who has a strong interest in God's Word and would like to be able to utilize the original Greek text of the New Testament for my study. I have been working through this book for several weeks now and am finding it very helpful and enjoyable. When I completed my study of first year Greek I asked myself, \\"Where do I go from here?\\" I think this book is the perfect place to turn. It helps the student build a stronger vocabulary (I believe all word occurrences from 49 down to 17 are included). The book provides a very good introduction to intermediate Greek grammar, with concepts clearly explained and illustrated (and with a bit of humor). Most importantly, the author provides a commentary on the Greek text of 1 John, relating his remarks to the grammatical points just learned. I like this book a lot, and I don't know of anything else out there quite like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"I can't say enough about this release. One fantastic pop song after the other, it's truly fantastic. If you enjoy the bands made famous by ��l Records back in the '80s, then I think you'll really quite enjoy this disc.

Well the TV picture quality is not so great, but for a monitor, while close to a tube, the resolution just isn't there, and if you have the shades open in the room it is almost impossible to see anything on the monitor, or the TV, I also was not crazy about the color of the case, there are two different colors, Black and Silver, I wish it was just one or the other, not both. Needless to say, the TV, and the huge monitor are back, I guess I will wait awhile, and hope that the image quality gets better in LCD monitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!!!","review":"Great Display for TV / Computer.I have been using it every day for seven months.Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great; Poor Television Picture","review":"Sleek looking monitor, but if you are going to use mainly as a television, beware. When switching between cable channels, this set is apparently unable to regulate the brightness or contrast of the picture, so that every time you switch channels you will have to spend minutes fiddling with the brightness and contrast controls. If you are at all a channel surfer, you will be very unhappy. Other than this problem, the picture for television is, in my opinion, mediocre, and does not compare to even bottom of the line crt televisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine - great price","review":"Fine basic monitor.

I remember when this show was sharp, well written and hilarious. Sadly, none of what made the original series so brilliant is on display here. What we get is a plot lifted from earlier, better episodes, secondary characters with nothing to do but make an appearance for nostalgic's sake, and a main character (Patsy) who no longer resembles herself. And it all plays out with nary a laugh in sight. How disappointing! Jennifer Saunders is an undeniable talent, but she seems determined to drag the memory of this once ground-breaking show through the dirt with these senseless \\"Specials\\". If you absolutely have to see this (and if you're a long time fan, you will feel like you have to), then rent it first. And be prepared to be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some funny moments, but...","review":"it is uneven at best. It felt a bit rushed and the humor forced at some points. Still, Eddie and Pats are two funny ladies and there are some gems to be found in the main title - Patsy's delayed surgical procedure, Bettina and Max's insane imagining of Eddie's kitchen. However, if you want to see the best bits of AbFab, watch Eddie's very funny video of a day of her life, spent with her Mom at the sad ole' Charity shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a devoted AbFab fan, I eagerly looked forward to this long awaited Christmas Special. Jennifer Saunders, being the huge talent that she is, did deliver in a few instances. I found the past lives regression scene to be terribly funny, but.... most of the show seemed to be cross between rehashing of previous jokes (Patsy's bones breaking) and a struggle to include all the cameo appearances. The WORST THING about it is toward the end when Edina struck her granddaughter. I couldn't believe what I saw. Nothing is ever funny about striking a child. In my opinion, Jennifer seriously crossed the line on that count. I can rewatch all the AbFab series and specials endlessly, except this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better than this!

Way to go, mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Across the Narrow Seas - Jill Rogoff revisited","review":"\\"Across the Narrow Seas\\" is Ms. Rogoff's third album (sadly the first is out of print) and it is truly a gem. Although hardly a sequel in the musical sense to her previous award winning album \\"The Celtic Cradle\\"; one clearly senses her affinity for and understanding of her material. Particularly outstanding on this fine fine album is her rendition of Raymond Scuderos haunting lullabye of the recent civil war in Yugoslavia 'Through the Night' and her musical adaptation of poet laureate C.

However, installation failed on both of my computers. When running setup (automatically started when I put in the driver CD), I got a \\"Please Plug-In C-Media USB Sound\\" alert message, which I am guessing indicates it did not discover the device. After this, installation does not continue as described in the PDF user's manual, and the device remains unrecognized. This device is likely a dud, and StarTech probably put their logo on some cheap USB Audio Adapter coming out of Asia (the manual requires a Chinese plug-in for the PDF reader). If Amazon replaces this device easily, and it works, I will do a new review or modify this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"This is the worst product I have ever purchased.

It is about 43 minutes in length (plus 10 minutes of extras at the end...see the end of my review). Film has very poor visual quality - dark, blurry and the film sputters once in a while. The sound is a bit scratchy too. Looks like it was taped off the TV years ago. It is a shortened version of the original movie with different actors. It is a nice Christmas / holiday story for the whole family and we will probably still watch it (or listen to it more like a radio show) each year. There are vintage commercials at the end, discussions with the stars of the movie, and an ad for a vintage upcoming show (10 minutes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best science video ever","review":"I learned so much from this video, and we beged to watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Simply - one of the best poetry books I have ever read.

It fails to do justice to either. It's more like Ann Radcliffe writes a Holmes horror story, with everything neatly explained in the end.

However, if you are looking for further stories about the interaction of angels in rebellion and humans, these are a pair of very good stories. Think of it as more stories in the same universe by a completely different author, but still it is an author who gets the universe, and had a new story to tell.I found the story of Prophecy 4 and 5 to be spookily good, enough to recommend to a friend.The filming is done on a budget, and not all the actors are as good as in the first few films (although Jason Scott Lee is pretty good in his role).

It's a movie if your a big fan of gore and a big Lucio Fulci fan which I am. Unless you can enjoy his movies like The Beyond and Don't Torture A Duckling than you won't like this. This movie got two stars because the makeup was incredible. As was the gore. I'd give the gore and makeup a 20 star if I could. Especially the scene where Olga Karlatos gets her eye pulled into a wooden splint. It's agonizing and not for the queezy but then again thats Lucio Fulci for ya.

The quality of the tape is the worst I have ever seen. First of all, it won't play well in ANY VCR!!! It jumps and scrolls up an down the screen for the entire film! The color is horendously. It is UNWATCHABLE! T-Z video (a division of EDDE entertainment) got the rights to an awful reel to the film ZOMBIE, blatenly added their own spliced in title called ZOMBIE 2: THE DEAD ARE AMONG US, and released it on the unsuspecting world.

Oh, forget it. Had this been done with a trace of style, a bit of flair, a hint of humor, it might have gotten by, despite its limited budget, but the pace is plodding, the dialog flat, and the action sequences loud rather than exciting. What's more, the movie's painfully-limited sets and woefully-undernourished \\"crowd\\" scenes mock its ill-advised attempt to tell an epic story. In the cast, good-girl Kate Rodger and bad-girl Katerina Brozova manage to rise above their material, but Josh Barker lacks the \\"chops\\" to be a he-man hero.

It was okay at the begining but I couldn't skip the dialogues at all when I accidentally clicked on the same thing twice.

There's only one episode so it's sort of repetitious and there are no points or rewards for having the right characters in the episode (or so that I know of).

Anyway, I have only had about 5 bags of this but so far it's very good.

Besides the fact that the popcorn itself is no longer big, fluffy kernels, the biggest problem is the amount of hulls. There are so many hulls, we have to rinse our mouths out after eating...I hardly have ever even noticed hulls in popcorn before... but these are hard and there are way too many per kernels of corn. It is not just an annoyance, it really degrades the popcorn...So sad...how could they ruin a perfect product like that...?Since then, we've discovered Pop Weaver Light Butter and although it's not as good as the Old Newman's, it's five million times better than the new version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Other organic is better!","review":"I really enjoy organic foods, so when I came upon this item I was thrilled they were making organic popcorn- especially Newman's Own, a brand I've liked in the past.

Shah Rukh Khan appears as a narrator briefly before the film begins and the storyline occasionally pauses for him to interject a few comments here and there during the film. The story depicts the lives of three women who are seeking independence and to discover themselves. It shows them making choices which might be appealing to people who don't hold to traditional, old fashioned values. I think the point was to show the process as women were \\"progressing\\" in society. Because I have conservative values, this film was very un-appealing to me. And as big of a fan I am of Shah Rukh Khan, it was not worth buying, even to see him. In fact, I thought it was incongruent to have Shah Rukh Khan associated with this film.

It didn't seem to make too big of a difference to my son if the wipes were warm or cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries Out Wipes","review":"It dried out my baby wipes so badly I had to pour water into it to keep them moist. After two months, I just quit using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Need, just a Want","review":"I registered and received this item as a gift and after using it a few times, i was quite disappointed. The wipes up on top almost immediately turned yellow and had dry spots.. you have to continuously add water to maintain them moist, which quite frankly to me, is a pain. They do 'warm' the wipes up but you have to take them out one by one individualy and use them immediately if not, they will chill, so what is the purpose of it then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wipe Warmer With Changing Light","review":"I bought this wipe warmer as a gift to a friend; so, I don't have any specific information on its quality. However, my daughter had one just like it, except hers had no light, and she said it worked excellently. She highly recommended it and thought the light would be very welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prevent Screaming Diaper Changes with this","review":"In the hospital, there wasn't a wipes warmer and our baby had super fits with every change. Once we finally got home, the screaming diaper changes stopped with the use of the wipes warmer - it just makes this new task less truamatic for them. I do find keeping it as full as possible is the trick, so that the wipes are closer to the top/heating element. Also, cheap wipes do not work because they're not folded together and you can't get them to go through the top slot. The Huggies wipes work the best as they come out the top nicely. LOVE this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!! Bad Smell!!","review":"We used this wipe warmer for about two weeks. This product did keep the wipes warm as stated. Usually the first wipe would be dry at each use and the others were fine. That was to be expected. However, what was not expected was the smell that started about two weeks after use. I walked in the room and something smelled like it was on fire. After searching I found it was coming from the wipe warmer. There was plenty of water in with the wipes but the smell was so strong I was afraid it was going to catch on fire. So we unplugged it and the smell lasted about a week or so. We finally just said \\"no way\\" it is too risky. I am not sure if it would have actually ever caught on fire but I would rather my little one feel a jolt of cold with a wipe than be caught in a room with a burning wipe warmer. I would not recommend the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Warmer","review":"I received this as a gift even though I did not register for it. I didn't think I needed it, but I must say that diaper changes are a much happier experience now. I didn't read the directions and have never added water. I have no problems with wet, warm wipes all the way till the last wipe. I use Huggies pop-up wipes and they work great. They seem to be thicker than pampers so I use less of them. The light is a nice feature for middle of the night changes when you want to keep baby in a slumber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries out your wipes after 3 months","review":"I really liked this for the first 3 months, but sometime around the end of month 2 the little rubber \\"teeth\\" holding the wipes broke off and it's now only spitting out \\"wipes\\" and not \\"Wet wipes\\". This needs to be addressed quickly. If we wanted dry wipes we'd just use a paper towel. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay little gadget","review":"This was something that was more of a pain to load and monitor than it was an asset.

I eventually gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally UNNECESSARY","review":"I don't have this model with the light, but we have a Dex wipe wamer. I wouldn't have purchased one but a family member gave it to me. As others have stated, this thing dries out the wipes, so much so that they really are ineffective. I thought it would bring my baby comfort because they would be warm, but instead I need to use a ton of wipes to get her clean. She really doesn't seem to mind when I use wipes at room temp. The only way I would recommend this is if you live in a very cold climate and it's really cold in your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the Hype!","review":"I absolutely hated this product! My sister-in-law warned me about the \\"issues\\" with this product but I had read the box which says - No Drying or Browning of the wipes- and felt I should give it a try (I liked the night light option). Well, I found that each time I removed wipes for use, about 3-4 of them were too dry to use and I had to throw them away. I even tried to use the foam insert from the Prince Lionheart warmer but that didn't help either. Finally I tossed the thing and bought another brand warmer and so far so good. The moral of my story - don't believe the hype (on the box) and don't buy this warmer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Warmer","review":"Good wipy warmer but you have to use Huggies pop-up wipes and add 2 onces of water every time you refill wipes. If you don't want dry brown wipes use water like the instructions recommend. If you use Pampers pop up wipes when you reach for a wipe you can't disattach it. It takes like three wipes before you can pull it away and it's a waste of wipes. The wipes come out warm but if you let out for a bit they become cold really fast. So be ready to wipe when you pull it out of the warmer. I give it a four star rating because it took me a while to figure out what kind of wipes to use and adding water is annoying. But it's no big deal and it's worth it. Now that winter is coming I'm glad I have it.Forgot to mention that there are new Huggies refill bags that come in a ziploc kind of bag. If you buy these you can add the right amount of wipes in warmer and avoid the rest of them drying up in the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and powerful","review":"After going through 3 other blenders in the span of 2 years, I finally found a blender that is durable and effectively does the job. This blender has a stainless steel blade and blade holder that is made to last unlike the others that I previously owned. Other blenders that I previously owned leaked due to the cheap plastic blade holder or the motor stopped working. This Oster blender only has two settings, but I found that I didn't need many blending options for making smoothies and pesto sauce. It should also be noted that this blender is very loud due to the extremely powerful motor... but who cares if it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Great - Works the Best","review":"This is our second beehive blender. We got the first one for it's classic good looks and to make occasional blended drinks....Brandy Alexanders, etc. Then we started eating healthy, and wore it out (the toggle switch) after several times a day use for smoothies and protein shakes.

I'll give a full report in my next message."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't return this product fast enough.","review":"This was the cheapest product I have ever purchased. Piece of junk! I had an Oster product for over 30 years and it was a great product, so I ordered this blender to replace it.

I looked at the bottom and saw that the 4 legs were all bent, or had somehow been installed (backwards?) so that it was impossible for it to sit evenly. I must also say, although I never even got to the point of trying to actually use it, that I had concerns regarding the water tightness. The screw on plastic base did not have any kind of gasket or seal.Also, the jar did not fit easily into the base. The motor has a square peg that the jar fits over; the jar wobbled back and forth and I thought that it was not seated properly. The whole item had a cheap, shoddy feel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD!","review":"This machine is ear-piercingly loud!!!

What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4th time's the charm","review":"I've burned through 3 other brands of blenders -- each time the plastic \\"spinner\\" in the motor base (which mates to a plastic spinner in the pitcher's base that turns the blade) broke. Finally we decided to try out the Oster \\"Classic\\" because it uses a metal shaft that fits directly into the pitcher's base to turn the blades rather than the plastic disks that all the newer blender designs seem to use. That does the trick. I make a lot of fruit smoothies using frozen fruit -- which can be pretty hard on blenders -- but so far the Oster Classic has been up to the task. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes trashed!","review":"We purchased this blender about 2 years ago, mainly based on price, simplicity of design and reviews from Amazon. After living with a high-maintenance Kitchen-Aid blender (all those little parts to clean!), The Oster seemed liked the answer to our blender dreams. Unfortunately after weekly use simply for smoothies, it quickly became apparent that this Oster was not like its formidable ancestors...The power is totally inadequate. Food constantly overwhelms the blade and any kind of blending totally stops. Close to its 2-year birthday, it gave up the will to live - following a weird grinding noise, smoke came from the base and then.... nothing. And now, here we are, searching for a new blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"4093-008 Beehive Blender","review":"This blender is unbelievably loud, will not keep the mixture moving (aeriates in the bottom requiring manual mixing), leaves black marks on your countertop and on the third morning, a nut and 2 washers fell off the cooling fan and out of the bottom of the machine.

This thing is a complete piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after a few years of light use","review":"Exceedingly noisy, fell apart after a few years of very light use. There seems to be no way to open the unit to see what exactly broke but screws came rolling out the bottom and the guts including the fan rattle like something's loose on the inside. Other than that, the unit operates only at one speed. We knew it when we bought it and thought it would be fine given our light use of blenders but after some time found that a single speed really isn't sufficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been Using Unit Everyday for Years! Works Great!","review":"I've used this unit for 4 years now EVERYDAY, except when we are on vacation. I only had to replace the parts twice and replacement parts are very inexpensive. With everyday use(and two batches, too!)I'm surprised it holds long until next replacement. What I love about it most is the ability to crush ice and frozen stuff.Every morning it churns in two batches. Constant ingredients are kale, carrots, yogurt, soy milk, cantaloupe. Then I toss in strawberries, grapes, or whatever is in season or on sale. So everyday it churns in at least 5 fruits/veges combined.Mind you, it is very loud but lasts less than a minute. Bound to wake up people but they should be up anyway.My friends started using it and they said they feel good because of the health benefits they get from it. My two kids are moving to college and wanted to get one each.We've never thrown fruits and veges away since we got this wonderful blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job well, as expected","review":"Based on all the reviews, I decided to buy this over the other 2 I was considering: one was a Waring for $150 and the other a Breville for $200.

My wife uses it everyday for her shakes with frozen fruit and ice and purees everything with ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart twice!","review":"The first one of these that I purchased fell apart within the first week.

A washer fell out of the vent hole and the unit's organs are just rolling around inside. Nothing was done incorrectly, the unit just literally fell apart.

Simply put, our ceiling thanks us.

Vitamix is warrantied for 7 years, so the cost of replacing a beehive every year, which had been the case here, just about evens out. With the Vitamix I am eating much better, feel better, and have lost a few pounds already!!!

So I used it about 10 times, to make smoothies, with ice, almond milk, & fruit. It worked very well at crushing & blending. So while cleaning the counter I find a small lock washer, no idea where it came from.The next morning, pick up the blender to make my smoothie...rattling noises from the base.... look underneath, and the entire motor is in pieces within the base! Totally unusable. I called Osters customer service, and they are replacing it with a new one.... pretty much \\"no questions asked\\" so this may be a problem they've encountered before.

It did fine crushing ice, making breadcrumbs, and pureeing soup.

After that- not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast, but not furious","review":"I decided to buy a blender for its dual functions: blending small batches & to make smoothies. My first smoothie with the Oster was a great hit & delish. The more I tried other recipes, the more I noticed that I prefer juices over smoothies. But this has nothing to do with the product. The other reason, my main reason, why I wanted a smaller blender/food processor is to make my own dressings. I like the size of the blender, just enough to make small - to medium batches of dressings. However, the things I don't like is the shape & noise level. High-pitched sound makes your skin crawl & the design of the blender will challenge you to get all your contence out w/o pulling your hair out. In short, I dislike it enough to only use it for dressings, but even then I ponder which product I'd rather clean afterwards my Breville food processor or this darn thing. A product I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks pretty, blends not","review":"While this blender may look pretty on your counter-top, that's about all it's good for. Nice retro styling from Oster but the product is useless, just like their toaster-oven. I have owned this door stop for over a year. It will only blend something that is completely liquid. Never mind smoothies or sauces, etc. I end up blending it myself with a spoon or just dealing with huge chunks. It is also extremely loud. I am still on the hunt for a good working blender at a reasonable price.

The first morning I diced up fresh fruit and put them in the blender, flipped the switch, nothing happened (it didn't begin to blend). So I try taking some fruit out and see if maybe there was too much, even though it wasn't filled to the top and was not stuffed. Taking fruit out didn't help either. I turned it on and let it run for a bit and finally it began to blend (bottom thing turned). It is VERY LOUD! The second morning I tried to thinly slice the fruit to see if this would make a difference. Sadly it was the same experience, it did not begin to blend (bottom thing did not begin to turn). I highly doubt it can crush ice cubs, since it can't handle soft fruit. :-/ Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster 4093-008 review","review":"Looks great. Very nice functional appeal.

She likes to make smoothies and margaritas and the reviews sounded like this might be good for that. Retro design was ok; extremely noisy like most reviews have already mentioned. The biggest disappointment was that with just the single small blades at the bottom, the blends tend to get stuck blending within a small radius of the tiny blades and the rest doesn't move. You end up stopping the blending, manually stirring and starting up again. Our friends bought us a Ninja(?) blender as a gift and wow, what a difference those multiple blades make. No more blending just in bottom of the blender.

I had an Oster blender much like this one for about 30 years, until the glass pitcher broke. My husband replaced it with this newer model which is by far a lesser quality from my original. I've hated it ever since and am now ready to toss it. Forget the fact that it is the noisiest blender I've ever had, and that there are only two speeds--fast and faster, the biggest problem is the cheap, black plastic ring which the pitcher fits into has now broken for the second time. The first one broke within two weeks of owning the blender. I contacted Oster and they sent out a new one at no charge as a \\"favor\\"--a one time offer. To me that states they do not stand behind this product, knowing they would be replacing the cheap plastic ring over and over again. I'll never get another Oster product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Handle Frozen Fruit","review":"This blender works fine with fresh fruit and ice cream/yogurt but broke a month after I started using it daily to make smoothies with frozen fruit chunks and berries. The device in the bottom that spins under the blades snapped right off. Now this blender is useless. The blender also got stuck constantly and I'd need to scrape the sides and stir it and restart it. Now it's back to searching for a stronger blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... while it lasted","review":"I thought I'd finally found the perfect blender, and it worked great - for two months. I used the blender exclusively for smoothies, usually made with chunks of frozen banana, OJ, and yogurt. I was careful to make sure the blender was running and there was plenty of juice in the jar, but the \\"all metal drive\\" broke - there is actually a hard rubber coupling beneath the drive spindle, and it sheared right off. Oh well - on to the next blender! I also have to agree with other reviewers about the noise - this puppy will wake the dead! Don't plan on making midnight snacks with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm & sounds like a boat motor! Cool!","review":"I purchased this blender when I finally had enough of my fancy KitchenAid Blender. The KitchenAid could not even blend fruit into a shake, and forget about crushing ice, it just wasn't happening.I did a little Internet detective work, and decided upon the Oster 4093-8 with a 500-Watt motor (Note: The Oster 4093-800 has a weaker 375-Watt motor, the 4093-8 and the 4093-800 are NOT the same model).The Oster is fantastic, making quick work over anything & everything I've thrown at it. It's loud enough to wake the dead, but that's a small price to pay for a tool that actually works.Two thumbs way up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic base to jar cracked","review":"I've only used this blender a handful of times since purchasing it in 2009, and I usually hand-wash it rather than put it thru the dishwasher. But the black screw-on base to the blender jar has already cracked (in three places) - completely unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes Classics are Best","review":"Bought this product back in September, and was hesitant at first because this product had been out there for awhile. I thought, \\"well of course they will have something newer and shinier out there.\\" Don't fall for any gimmicks, this is a classic blender that's worked like a charm, even when blending ice and tougher fruits. Haven't had an issue with it at all and my girlfriend loves it. Claims it's the best gift I've given her (even more than the jewelry). I would suggest to anyone who is looking for a blender of this size for anything from mixes to smoothies."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not have an all metal shaft","review":"It does not have an all metal shaft, it includes a rubber drive coupling.Rubber drive coupling for Oster blenders & Kitchen Centers.This ripped in half after about a year and the replacements have last a few months.

It is very frustrating to have the blender unusable every few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Imitation of the Original","review":"In the past I owned this Classic Oster, although the base was stainless steel and it lasted (literally!) 30 years! The motor never wore out, instead, what made me have to give up on it was that the shaft on the base got loose and would not turn anymore.So when I purchased this look-alike at Sam's I was confident that I made the right choice. WRONG. I used it for less than a month, and the blade will no longer turn because plastic teeth on the cap are shot, because of the cheap plastic they used. It no longer has any teeth to hold the shaft in place! I was so irked to learn that Oster had such shoddy parts now, I went out and bought myself a nice Hamilton Beach and its been a dream now for more than 6 months! Too bad, Oster is no longer on my go-to list. I wish I would have perused the feedback here first, from now on I will, even if I buy elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeated failure","review":"I bought this blender based on the good reviews that it had received. Unfortunately, these reviews did not consider reliability. The black plastic ring that holds the glass pitcher broke right away. Oser gave us a new base for free (one time).

It mixes margaritas like no other and I make them almost every day, my time to come home start dinner & watch Ellen while sipping on my drink is the best. It just now finally gave out and it was not the motor! I never dried the metal between base and jar and it got rusted and of course now they don't sync with each other. I am using duct tape for now until my 2 new ones come in. I decided to pick up 2 just in case they get discontinued; that's how much I love my blender!

You won't regret this purchase just remember to dry the metal parts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blender I've Ever Owned!","review":"I love this blender! (Amazon's price was the best.) I read the reviews here before ordering it. Was worried about the noise level, but needed a good blender so took my chances. Loud? Sure it's a little loud, but all blenders are noisy. The difference with this one is that it's so powerful, that the job is done so quickly that the noise isn't even an issue!If you need a blender, with no bells and whistles, just pulse and blend continous, this is the one to get. It's nice looking too! (I have chrome) Even better than the picture! Easy to clean, and such a powerful engine. We make the best blended drinks and it chops throug ice like it's butter! Love it!VickiIndiana"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks when used with frozen fruit","review":"I make a smoothie almost every day with milk, frozen fruit, and spinach. I bought this blender because it had such great reviews, and I wanted something that would deliver consistent results. Well, this is not the one. I've used this for about a week, and yesterday when I added the frozen strawberries, the part that connects the blade to the motor sheared off.

Its awful. There are better blenders out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just for blending beehives","review":"A good blender for a variety of different blending options. While most other blenders only have one option ( blend) this blender has many different buttons to choose from. The transparent holder is a vast improvement over their model with black electrical tape wrapped around the interior. For one you could not see what you were blending, secondly little bits of the tape would end up in everything you made, and thirdly you always had to get more tape, like every two weeks. in this model the tape is optional and goes on the outside if you prefer not to see what you are blending. As well, the tape is only 1 inch in width, unlike the 10 inch width tape, what a nightmare. kudos to oster for fixing all of the flaws of the previous model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 4 months!","review":"Bought this blender in March 2004 - by August it was dead!

Consequently I haven't been able to use it! I purchased this particular blender because we had one that we bought here in Australia and it recently gave up the ghost after 5 good years service so I thought I'd get another BUT I've got to say that the one we had was much better, it was more solid, better finished and had two speeds including a pulse mode.

I needed another since I now have a country house and a city apt. I have always liked the fact that it had only an on/off switch since I could never understand why blenders came with 8 buttons that did nothing more than make the machine go faster or slower no matter what they called it (puree, blend, whip, etc.).The new one is cheaply made and VERY noisy. The old machines were made with a metal screw cap on bottom while the new ones are plastic. The plastic bottom screw cap cracked within three weeks as I tried to tighten it before use. I had to order a new one on-line but still could not find a metal replacement.The glass pitcher wobbles no matter how I place it.I am so sad since Oster was a sentimental favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is perfect!","review":"My husband and I make a lot of smoothies that include both vegies (frozen and fresh) and fruit (frozen and fresh).

It is now 4 weeks later and I have not received a replacement blender yet. I have attempted to contact Oster directly and no one has responded to my complaints.

I assembled the jar, put the liquids first, then some frozen fruit and press the pulse button. After a few seconds I hear metal falling. Out of the bottom vents of the blender's base I see washers that flew out of the inside of the blender. There is a piece of metal now loose inside the base and, of course, the blender does not work.

I think I am done with all blenders for now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bells and whistles need not apply","review":"The Oster Classic Beehive Blender in Chrome has endured many tasks in my kitchen and now work in my daughter's home. Unlike the more contemporary designs in plastic with buttons galore, this is simple to set up and simple to operate. A single switch gives you a couple options and if you don't mind hearing a blender's motor operate and the ingredients churn, I think you'll be as pleased as us with the output. I have a Cuisinart food processor that I've had for almost 30 years and I find this blender to be just as reliable, sturdy, easy to assemble and a breeze to clean. Blending icy products is no problem and at one time, I even used this for making paper. I also like the beehive shape more than boxy blenders. In my opinion, this is the best blender in the price range and I will buy another to replace the one my daughter has prematurely inherited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blender to date!","review":"Had a Kitchenaid blender with the plastic/rubber base for the spinner. The rubber pieces ground out one day making the blender useless.This blender has a metal spinner and very sharp ice crunching blades on the inside of the bowl.

First, the KitchenAid had a rubber coupler (the part of the base that spins and attaches to the blade) which was constantly rubbing up against the underside of the blade, causing it to deteriorate rather quickly, which in turn would cause it to skip (meaning it would spin without catching the blade). Second, it was a very weak blender. We used it primarily to make smoothies from frozen fruit and it could never blend through frozen strawberries. Third, it was very heavy. This Oster is far superior in every way. The coupler is steel and will never deteriorate. The blade is very sharp and the motor is far more powerful. It blends through frozen fruit in a few seconds. And it's at least half the weight of the KitchenAid. We couldn't be happier with our purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy duty","review":"I love my bee hive blender.

I wouldn't want anyone to buy this collection imagining this is a good place to start with this author. Of course, if you also are a Fante fan, you'll want to read this and you won't be disappointed, as long as you accept it as a collection of miscellaneous pieces. But they are unmistakably, recognizably Fante, and I'm grateful for any scrap I can get. Moreover, there are some very, very good pieces here. The prologue to Ask the Dust, for example, is stunning, and several of the stories are on a par with those published elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting...","review":"Spider-Woman was a different and daring book for the time it was originally published (late 70s). If you're looking for a female version of Spider-Man, look somewhere else. This book is edgy and shows a character who's not comfortable with her super-powers and really isn't that powerful overall. Jessica Drew has a unique problem; her spider-blood makes others not like her. This plays out for awhile before Michael Fleisher takes over as writer and takes her in a new direction. There aren't a lot of big-time villains outside of Hydra in the beginning parts, but it's an eclectic group for an eclectic heroine.

He told about how he had loved the first issue...but wasn't a big fan of what they ended up becoming. I enjoyed this book because it had so many different opinions and veiw points of the same thing.

I haven't tried the longer sessions yet for one reason: I lose the flow of the poses when I have to flip back and forth between the portion that shows all poses and the portion that shows each pose in more detail. Do I inhale or exhale here? It doesn't say in the section showing many poses, so I have to stop, flip back to the details, then start again. Sounds minor and it is, but it (and occasionally confusing drawings, as with \\"Threading the Needle\\") are drawbacks to what is otherwise a very useful book.

It has several daily yoga sessions you can practice, according to time and what you need for that day. The notations and instructions on each pose is direct and clear. I felt the only down side of the book was the illustrations. They have stick figure people demonstrating the poses, and it does not clearly illustrate the detail of the human body. I felt the visual demonstrations were as equally important as the detail of the written instruction, especially for me as a beginner. I wish I could have given it a higher rating because the rest of the content was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new under the sun","review":"If you can play for 6 or more hours, if you have a bankroll the size of Montana, and if you don't get wiped out at the beginning this system may win.

This system is the oldest one in the book- the \\"due\\" system with a Martingale attached. Why would anyone risk thousands to win $10 ($5 level). You are then forced to play at increasing levels.

I purchased it and was immediately disappointed about 10 pages in. The first half of the book is nothing but hype and fluff. The author goes on about how he's made so much money with his system, then wastes 5-10 pages explaining the odds of each bet in Roulette? Give me a break! I thought this was suppose to be \\"Roulette Secrets\\" not \\"Roulette 101.\\" When he finally got to the system, I was floored. He basically wants you to use the Martingale (increasing bets after each loss) on a specific section of the Roulette Board. Anyone with half a brain isn't gonna press their bets up to $1000 or more to chase a $10 profit. I immediately requested a refund. This book was a waste of time and money. I can't believe the author had the audacity to publish this with a straight face!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worthless information","review":"Using this supposed system will lead you to the poor house. I have read several books about playing roulette and while this book explains how to play, the premise of winning large amounts of money by using the betting system he espouses will not work on an ongoing basis.

One of things I liked about this set was the episode which looked at the power struggle within the organization following Capone's prison sentence and how the Mob began to turn to drugs following the end of Prohibition. This set is definitely more expensive but still worth it (although I would pay less if I could). Good acting by all concerned and the black and white format makes it better somehow.

The editing of this book leaves much to be desired - there are some really terrible errors throughout. I am usually partial to books that have CDs with them, but in this case it doesn't add anything. The tools on the CD are freely downloadable from the internet, and are being updated constantly.

None of them were one dimensional. The story is plausible. I loved the beginning of the book the best, from that point on I couldn't stop reading:Sarah feeling so awful with a group of mommies (empty-airy types)...that was something that happened to me eons ago, when I was young very young and a mother of twins...what a waste to waste your mind as a person, regardless of your obligations...Tom you showed this in your book... Little Children is a must read for women who felt at odds with their lives in the 60s, 70s, and now this backlash of the 90s, etc...It is a timeless piece... and I recommend it wholeheartedly...honest, got twists and down to earth writing, what more can you expect of a book... Hope to find many more like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"deja vu all over again","review":"I wanted to like this book since I am a fan of the author's other work. But something about it just didn't sit well with me. It does have it's humurous points and the relationship between Sarah and Todd is engaging. Overall though, it just feels like it was done before. Stories and satires about suburbia abound and this didn't really offer anything new to that conversation. The characters are fairly interesting though typical, but what is the point? None of the characters grew or changed really and the story didn't offer any new insights to suburban life. I just felt blah after reading this, like I neither got a particularly good story out of it or any new musings about modern life. I hope his next novel offers more."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a read!","review":"I actually sought this book out after watching the sleeper movie adaptation of it (co-written by the author) that's been playing on cable. The movie stayed very close to the book, though some of the secondary characters' detail was either cut from the final or not fleshed out. But there's so much going on in the book that relates to the desires of adults not wanting to embrace their responsibilities both as parents and partners. Perrotta's sparse writing style packs a wallop though. You feel like you're in the room, whether it's during the intimacy of a sexual tryst between the characters or during the discomfort they feel at a dinner party with their spouses. There's a lot to like and learn from here, while the tale weaves in and out of dark humor and ironic passages. Check this book out. I look forward to now reading Election (which became the brilliant Reese Witherspoon/Matthew Broderick film) and Joe College."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I'm not a mother, I'm not even a wife but I sitll loved this book. The different facets of everyone are intriguing and make you look at the people you know in your daily life a little differently.

Totally worth it to pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Little Children got great reviews, but I couldn't get past Chapter 1. Perrotta thinks he knows how women think, feel and talk, but he doesn't. His cliches are so embarrassing they made my toes curl. His prose was patronizing and superficial. I developed an attitude problem before I'd finished the first two sentences in the book: \\"The young mothers were telling each other how tired they were. This was one of their favorite topics, along with the eating, sleeping, and defecating habits of their offspring, the merits of certain local nursery schools, and the difficulty of sticking to an exercise routine.\\"His characters sound like lobotomized Barbie dolls. Yech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so much acclaim?","review":"I read all types of books, but when I picked this one up in the entry section of Borders recently, and noticed how much acclaim it had received, I thought I was in for a good read. Something a little deeper. I enjoyed reading it, and it read quickly, but, it was a little too soap-opera-y for me. Perhaps it bordered on a romance novel - which is one book type that I am not a fan of.I really do like a lot of the \\"chick lit\\" books, and I'm not sure this one quite qualifies, but I was disappointed in this one. I probably won't hunt down this author's other titles, given my experience with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lousy book full of generalizations and the author's biases","review":"It's almost laughable. In a book based on stressing the importance of notholding prejudices, the author's characterizations are full of them. Note how he falls back on biased notions to draw the characters of the ex-cop and the Republican stay-at-home mother. There are no shades of gray for them at all. The whole book lacks depth and the reader walks away with nothing to ponder. I'm no prude, but it's funny how the only characters the author puts upon a pedestal are the child molester and the adulterers. No wonder Hollywood is making this trash into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I cannot figure out why this book has won such critical acclaim.

I read through it all with hopes that it would improve eventually, then it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much good here","review":"Cliched characters and situations, trite and predictable plot, mediocre writing at best. The novel panders to the tired, irrational fears and ignorance of suburban America by showcasing played-out issues in all their superficial glory. Perrotta's attempt at making pre-midlife crisis suburban adults compelling is an utter failure. A downright annoying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"One of the very few mistaken selections our Book Club chose.The writing was fair and the plot ordinary.A better writer might have taken any number of the topics touched on this novel and woven a more compelling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writer; Real Characters","review":"Though I did not find a single character in this book to be the least bit likeable, I liked the book itself very much (no doubt because Perrotta's writing is superb, as are the plot lines). Read this book, if for no other reason than to confirm that American suburbia, in all of its \\"predictableness,\\" still contains its occasional -- or perhaps inevitable -- infidelities and felonies. Then go read Perrotta's other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian, Mundane and Muddled","review":"Some times readers are impressed by an earlier publication of an author and tend to read more into a book than there is. Little Children wouldn't make a good episode of \\"Desperate Housewives\\". There is nothing new here. Not only is it \\"old\\" but it's going through the motions old."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it, I didn't like it...","review":"It's funny: I understand where all the previous reviewers are coming from, but I gotta be honest: I didn't ever feel like I was in suburbia! I do recognize character types and they are pretty-well portrayed, but they're really not altogether interesting people: they do act like \\"little children.\\"I liked the dialogue; Perrotta is very good at this! And there is his brand of humor, which is also very good.I read the novel because I have read everything Perrotta has published, but I was left with an unsatisfactory feeling. As a reader, I didn't learn a damn thing from the novel. That's not a good thing... I couldn't enthusiastically recommend this novel to anyone for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Letdown","review":"I'd read Perrotta's \\"Bad Haircut\\" and though I haven't gotten around to reading the book, I found the movie version of \\"Election\\" to be witty satire. So, with all the great reviews this book got, and the hype from the movie surrounding Jackie Earle Haley's Oscar nomination, I was expecting great things. Boy, was I disappointed. It never grabbed my interest, and I eventually found myself anxious to get to the end, hoping he might redeem himself there, but still no. I couldn't get myself to like or care about any of the characters, and the story lines were blandy predictable and not at all compelling. In the first chapter, Mary Ann seemed like she might provide an interesting story line, at least from a saticical point of view, but she just disappeared (except for one brief chance encounter, another highly contrived plot element) until the last few pages. Save your time, don't read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted it to be better","review":"This book is a fast read. It was enjoyable enough, but I have some problems with it. I just don't think Perrotta gets the female \\"voice\\" right--not like say, Wally Lamb did in \\"She's Come Undone\\". Most of the characters are over-the-top, especially the retired cop, and a lot of the situations that they face are a bit unrealistic. Would Catholics really switch sides of a church mid-service if a child molester sat among them? The satire, however, is dead on. One Catholic met her husband in a wet t-shirt contest.The biggest problem I have is with the utter lack of any love these parents show for their children. While it does mirror my neighborhood quite well in that respect, I really felt like Sarah and/or Todd needed to have some remorse for what they did because they cared so much for their children. The best one mother can do is say \\"Isn't he a cutie pie?\\" several times.Given that, it is really hard to feel anything for the characters. Not even pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but I thought it was drivel","review":"It was a day-time soap opera. With equally unbelievable story lines. I'd heard that they made a movie of it before I started reading it and now that I'm done I can see why, the story is just like the movies of late...drivel. And I loved Election."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Build Up Ends Badly","review":"Although this novel promises readers a surprise by including a convicted child molester/murderer, an obsessed ex-cop, and a Peyton Place of suburban angst, it all culminates in a puff of smoke rather than the l-o-n-g awaited fireworks. In short, a big dud. I regretted both the time and money spent on \\"Little Children\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure","review":"Hhhmmm....I didn't love this book yet I didn't hate it either. I was initially turned completely off by the satirical suburban angst-filled, sexually obsessed and self absorbed tone of the characters at first but once I just relaxed and went with it I admit I found the dialogue VERY funny, like a previous reader said, laugh out loud funny at times. I couldn't relate to any of the characters (thankfully) even though I'm a working mom and have lived in the suburbs.They all seemed so stereotypically exaggerated but maybe that's part of the point of satire. I thought the ending was building towards some huge climax and was a little let down but I guess it fit. (I was totally grossed out by Sarah's fungally infected toenails and the thought of Todd......oh, never mind.)I give the book 1 star for dialogue and 1 star for inspiring me to check \\"Madame Bovary\\" out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Dull","review":"You would think a book filled with adultery, pornography, and pedophilia would be compelling or at least disturbing-- anything but boring. Sadly, boring, more than anything, is what it is. The book's characters are flat and almost uniformly unsympathetic. Almost nothing, from the dialogue to the adult \\"children\\" of the title, to the actual children, to the situations, from the most mundane to the most bizarre, rang true. The ending, which I won't reveal, was both anticlimactic and totally bizarre, which is quite a feat, I suppose. It's not a terrible book, and, unlike some reviewers, I didn't find it offensive, but I definitely won't be reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"...yeah, i don't quite understand all the hype surrounding this book. it wasn't anything special. the plot was ridiculously predictable, unimaginative, and, frankly, boring. the writing was particularly \\"blah.\\" i wasn't impressed. money down the drain...if you're still interested, borrow this book from a friend or your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book I'd be ashamed of if my husband read...","review":"I read this book over a weekend, I was utterly incapable of placing it down.

I wanted to both scream at Sarah, and pat her on the back. She is such a lost woman, but at the same time, she is just finding the person she once was...I love this book, and was so utterly heartbroken...I strongly encourage a few nights on the porch, with a glass of your favorite mixed drink to fully indulge in this tasty treat.I would be utterly ashamed if my husband read this book...he'd wonder why it is I loved it so much...he has nothing to fear...because our Sarah lived out the fantasy for us all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My entire book group hated it!","review":"I am still mystified by the popularity of this book. Generally, my group splits 3:2 on a book, with some loving the book that month and some not liking it so much. We've never agreed so completely on a book before. I can't figure out where it is coming from and who it's intended audience is. The reviews called it a hilarious parody. I found it neither. Nor did I find it deeply affecting. All I can figure is that it was written by a man and is full of \\"male humor\\", so I'm missing it. I also think, perhaps wrongly, that the author isn't really that familiar with daytime suburban life, so what he thought was over the top, was actually pretty close to true.

I never really cared about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I dont want to be the kind of person that recaps the whole book, i just want to tell you how i felt about it, and my impression...

Between frumpy housewives with fantasies, the child molester next door, and the ridiculously languid descriptions about how \\"hot\\" the key male character is (and his signature \\"corkscrew\\" move--GROSS), this book did nothing but make me grimace in despair that I actually kept turning pages. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY and get yourself some smut elsewhere, you will not find it here. This book made me more uncomfortable than anything else, and to the author, if you are marketing toward women, leave out the page after page description of a tackle football club sport game. Poor, weak story line, awkward relation to the reader, amateur writing at best.

It was easy to read, and I stuck it out till the end, hoping for a good ending, but I was disappointed. There really was no good resolution for the characters in this story, they were written into a corner. (I suppose this is true in life as well.) I found the sex offender character a far fetch from real life and a bit stereotypical, making me think the author didn't do much research for this character. There were some good sections and realistic qualities but mostly I was just tired with the story by the end and wanted it to be over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Children","review":"This was a great read - entertaining; good for the beach.

Absolutely perfect those last 20 pages or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-paced and exciting, but character development falls flat.","review":"I've read _Election_, and I went into this book hoping for more of the same--developed, interesting characters and a plot that kept me guessing. Unfortunately, Tom Perrotta has apparently become the next incarnation of Dean Koontz, complete with the action-packed unrealistic ending and the flat-as-a-pancake Evil Guy. People just don't behave the way that the characters do in this novel, especially at the end.I enjoyed the writing--on the whole, Perrotta is a very talented author and deserves to do well. I think, though, that he can do much better than this book. When I finished reading the novel, I actually threw it away because I was so frustrated with the shallow character development and the typical deus ex machina ending (in this case, the \\"god\\" was somehow in the characters' heads, making them behave in ways completely unlike the people who they were supposed to be). I've never thrown a book away before.But this one deserved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good picture of suburban america","review":"I really enjoyed Little Children. It does a good job of capturing some of the desperation and apathy that hides under the squeaky clean surface of middle class suburban America. Perrotta does a good job of capturing his various characters, from a suburban housewife to a child molester, and the story is complex yet simple enough that any reader knows a similar tale.I will say that all of the characters in the novel are archetypes, but the author seems to know this, by referring to characters by their stereotypes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama or Comedy?","review":"As I read this book, I kept asking myself if I should be laughing or disgusted/sad/angry at the events and characters in this book. I would have stopped reading if it wasn't for one of the story lines that seemed remotely interesting. You don't get to know the characters very well and a few are introduced late in the book as if the author said \\"oops, I forgot this person!\\" It seemed as if this book was written for a Lifetime Movie or maybe Comdey Central."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I guess I have to join the group of readers who just don't understand why the critics seemed to love this book. The characters were two-dimensional; the plot was contrived; the humor was hit or miss; and the ending seemed rushed (though it couldn't come fast enough for me) and wasn't very satisfying. The characters certainly didn't seem to grow organically. Mostly the book just didn't seem to ring true. I could see the writer working in the background, adding bits of detail to fluff up the verisimilitude. A jester's cap for Todd's son? That just seemed a ridiculous. The one-dimensional skateboarders are thrown in there pretty much as a plot device, and not a very good one. I didn't much care for the dialogue, especially coming from the stereotyped characters, which this book has in abundance.I give it 2 stars because I actually laughed at some parts, but I would have gladly traded those laughs for some believable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't even finish this book","review":"Bad all around.

I kept thinking the whole time that the author was developing the wrong characters. Maybe I'm just atypical..but this was not anything like MY transition into adulthood. I thought the book was as shallow and predictable as its characters....excluding the last 25 pages or so. Here's a real challenge...how about a book that TRULY deals with transition into adulthood...young adults trying to figure out how they got to where they are, all the while struggling to do what's right and live up to the choices they've made. I guess that's too much to ask. Don't let the major reviews fool you...this is not that book. Oh, I also didn't find this book as comedic as I did disturbing.

MacDonald, who would've written this kind of story in a couple of weeks--and done a much better job.I wish I could've enjoyed this novel more, but the characters (or caricatures) just aren't very interesting, and there is no real protagonist.Instead, we get a routine tale of love and adultery in the suburbs, with a paroled child molester thrown into the mix. Too bad he wasn't a mad bomber; he might've blown up the whole group on page 9 and saved the readers a lot of wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable drivel","review":"This highly lauded book was, to me, a very predictable two dimensional book. The characters were all stereotypes and the plot contrivances ludicrous. In the end, I just sped read to get to the end, skipping chapters to make it end sooner.To me, for satire to be truly biting it must be somewhat relevant. I did not find these characters relevant at all. Actually, McGorvey was relevant, sadly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My casting choices","review":"Terrific book. One of my favorite movies is ELECTION, however I was just a tad disappointed with the book (which I read after seeing the movie). It wasn't that the book was bad, it's just that the movie was so great. Anyway, Perotta's latest book kicks ELECTION's butt. So, here are my casting ideas: Vince Vaughn for Todd (I know Brad Pitt's an obvious choice, but Vince hasn't done anything relatively serious in a while), Lili Taylor for Sarah, Phillip Seymour Hoffman for Ronnie (once again, a bit too obvious, but that's because he'd be perfect), Kate Beckinsale for Kathy, Will Smith for Larry (it wouldn't hurt to get a little bit of color into this story)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No resolution","review":"I usually enjoy Tom Perrota, despite his apparent allergy to denouement. This one lead you down a road that was at times either uncomfortable without purpose or depressingly banal. I stuck it out to the very end, and if it wasn't for the fact that my Kindle was so expensive, I would have thrown it in disgust. I need more than colorful characters - I need them to say something, do something, other than the ordinary. Otherwise, I'd just watch the drama in my own subdivision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Tom Perrotta is a fantastic author. His prose is a delight, and is always in service of the story, never to show off what a good writer he is. His characters are nuanced and compelling -- people you can identify with, or at least understand, even when they are making terrible choices that might wreck their own lives, and those of their loves ones.I found it particularly impressive that Perrotta manages to get in the mind of the child molester, so that, despite his atrocious tendencies and crimes, he comes across not as a monster, but as a profoundly flawed and ill human being.This was the first book by Perrotta I read. It won't be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I really liked this book. I liked the writing style. The story was fast paced and the characters managed to seem real yet this book functions very well as a satire. I laughed out loud multiple times. I did think things got a little messy with the child molester. That part of the story had potential but it seemed like Perrotta didn't quite have a thorough understanding of him. I thought Sarah was so realistic that I double checked to make sure the author was a man instead of a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent treatment of a life history","review":"Robert Black does something unusual in this book; he edits and annotates the life history of a Hopi/Tewa Indian who was not a traditionalist, nor an especially warm or amusing man. Standing Flower - the traditional name of Irving Pabanale - was a Hopi policeman, judge, and negotiator with the white government early in this century. Black sat with him for many summers, recording his story. In this book, he does an outstanding job of writing comprehensive explanations and history to anchor this man's tale. I've studied many life histories, and always find them to be the best way to learn about other cultures. This book offers both the narrative and a scholarly - but readable - education about the Hopi and Tewa of Arizona.

It is not really a story about how we ended went about measuring land, but how the concept of property ownership and property rights sets America apart from the other nations of the world and did much to define the American character.The book is very well composed - Mr. Linklater has a gift for the written word.

It presents a very nice way to get at the physics, with creative and light-hearted diagrams.I'm not so sure that Wheeler's own poems, which introduce many of the chapters, are a great success, but I admire and salute him for including them.

Let me just say this: Connie Willis deserves much more fame than she currently recieves, and the Christmas tales she has produced over the past few years are proof of why. The woman is a master of character, a great humorist, and a wonderful writer. Read this book, then go on and read her spectacular BELLWETHER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable group of short stories!","review":"I've never read any of Connie Wllis' Christmas stories before I bought this book. In fact, the only other book of hers that I have read is \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog.\\" I enjoyed that so much that I thought I might enjoy \\"Miracle and Other Christmas Stories.\\" And I did. Immensely! I particularly liked \\"Miracle\\" and \\"Newsletter.\\" If only I could write a newsletter as off-the-wall as the one in this book! Of course, as soon as I read the term \\"pod people\\" - and knew exactly what the author was talking about - I began to wonder if I've seen one two many science fiction movies.

I've enjoyed 'To Say Nothing of the Dog' and when they finally said 'Miracle and other Christmas stories' was out, I was thrilled! This is an excellent collection of short stories for those that enjoy fantasy, for those that enjoy Christmas, for those that have enjoyed Willis' work in the past. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful stories, even to a bah-humbug sort like me","review":"Unlike Connie Willis, I *don't* love Christmas. I don't put up Christmas lights, I don't kill a tree, and I don't send out Holiday Letters. Yech.But this collection of short stories made me contemplate becoming a Christmas fan. That's because Willis -- as in her other work -- writes about people with warmth and humor. Even if it's people who encounter a new-age Christmas Present or get trapped in a strange little toy store. She manages to capture what Christmas is *supposed* to be about -- faith, hope, love -- without falling into sappy sentimentality.Forget the Christmas stuff. These are simply enjoyable short stories. You'll fall into another world, 20 pages at a time. And that's what fiction's all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but formulaic","review":"After reading some of Connie Willis' other work I was excited to read more. Her forward on avoiding the tropes of X-mas stories further bolstered my hope that this would be something special. However, the first story written violates pretty much every trope she mentions just pages before the story, and everything else seems like a variant of another story you had heard.This gave me the feel of stories she made up for her family on x-mas eve, not something that she put as much thought into as her full stories. Things ended up feeling a little underdeveloped, and what could have been magical became just passable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I generally love Connie Willis novels, and had read great things about this book. I must have missed something. A couple of the stories were okay, which got me through the rest of them.

Her other books are nothing short of brilliant, \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" is perfect, so what happened here? I tried desperately to like it, but I was so glad I checked it out of the library before spending money on it buying my very own copy. The stories are nothing short of incredibly clumsy, fanciful and amateurish writing where Connie continually slaps you about the face to remind you of her pure dislike of the movie \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\".

The stories are a prefect balance of what is best about Christmas; joy, hope, love, and the possiblity of redemption and miracles, without becoming maudlin or trite.

Tammy is right again: the attachments don't stay on very well (need a tighter fit). But the suction of both the vacuum and the hose is powerful. The hose is so easy to use; pull out and re-attach without any fiddling. I also like the fact that it uses a bag that is easy to change without having dust billowing everywhere. Putting on a new bag is also a cinch. For that, I am buying another one for use in my basement alone as it's rather heavy to haul this vacuum up and down stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow.. for me a big improvement","review":"of course, my first vacuum was a $45 bagless and it lasted about a year and a half with okay performance. this thing, even tho it's not \\"self propelled,\\" to me felt like it was pulling and helping me out. and the edge cleaner is impressive. yes, it does tip over when you use the attachments. i figured out that if you pull the attachment hose out and hold it, it doesnt tip the vacuum over."},{"rating":"2","title":"(used to )Love this vacuum","review":"I originally gave this vacuum a 5. However after 4 months of use it went downhill fast. My first Windtunnel that I bought this to replace now outperforms it's newer brethren. A defective model perhaps? Regardless I am sorely disappointed in Hoover this time around. And of course it is out of warranty..--Original review below --This is a great vacuum. I bought my first windtunnel several years ago and just recently needed to replace it. The vacuum is still going strong but I've run over the cord a few too many times and the cord is starting to fray. Aside from that I'm sure it would be good for a few more years. Anyway I liked my windtunnel so much that after shopping around I decided to replace it with the exact same vacuum. It's powerful and reliable. The only negative I can think of is that the hose is a little short, the vacuum will tip over if you stretch it too far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful vacuum...","review":"This is a great vacuum. But be prepared to replace the drive belt if you don't adjust the cleaning height on the vacuum. If you leave the setting on 'bare floor' and go into some carpet with tall fibers, it will shred the belt in seconds. But this is due to operator error, so I recommend this vacuum cleaner. Works great on pet hair. (The belt is easily replaced...I'm an expert now.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have used a lightweight Hoover for years and was very pleased with it. When I first received this new cleaner I was really excited with the power it had. The third time I used it the belt broke. With each use, my back would start hurting. The forward motion was very easy, but pulling it back was hard. I returned this product because I felt there was something wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine at First then Serious Problems","review":"Worked well for a few months and it does have really good suction from the hose. However, over time the spinning brush got less and less effective and now will not work at all making it pretty much useless.I have had much less expensive vacuums last much longer.I would not recommend buying this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"It cleans.","review":"I have had this for a year. I have two areas that are carpet and the rest of my house is hard wood. I do a lot with the hose and attachments. I wouldn't buy this again. First of all the on/off switch stopped working and my husband had to put a permanent fix on this. The hose is too short. When I am cleaning with the hose and attachments the sweeper falls over usually hitting me in the back. Let me tell you, it hurts if it hits the wrong way. The back clip that holds one of the tools broke off while sweeping. The front clear closure kept breaking off until I eventually kept it off. Again, I wouldn't buy this machine again. I will make sure my next one has a long enough hose and doesn't fall over on me or my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Make","review":"I've been using this vacuum just a little over a year. The slide off/on switch is a very bad design. The vacuum stays on even after I slid the switch to off position. Finally, the motor would not start in the on switched position. Now it's junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken switch in only 16 months","review":"Owned this vacuum only 16 months and the on-off switch is already broken. We're not too compulsive about vacuuming, so I doubt if it has been used more than 20-30 times. Already had to replace the brush drive belt once. No complaints about the way it cleans, or the weight.

The switch broke after six months, so now you have to unplug it to turn it off. The belt has broken twice, and the upholstery pieces don't stay in place. I'm amazed at the number of positive reviews. Maybe these people have never owned a decent vacuum, but I have, and I'll never buy from Hoover again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it and you'll be sorry","review":"We bought this a year ago, were never happy with it, and now we are throwing it out. It's cheap - e.g., the cap on the handle falls off all the time. It tips over way too easily, and the attachment cord is too short. A couple of times now the belt has broken, but we didn't know it. For some reason, that made it get very hot - so hot, in fact, that it actually melted (for real) some of our (non-wool) carpet. Now, the on-off switch doesn't work - it can only be turned off by unplugging it.This is a piece of junk. Don't buy if you want long term satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"I called the Hoover company regarding the product I purchased.

I've had nothing but trouble with it! I took it to a warrantee dealer a few months back because the red warning light stayed on all the time. It took them 4 weeks to find a bad integrated circuit. They replaced the IC, returned it and two days later the light came back on, to stay!(All filters are clean and always maintained.) About a week ago, the machine is now 13 months old, I tried turning off the machine with the on/off switch. No dice. The machine stays on as long as plugged into AC. I tried moving the on/off switch back and forth several times and the vacuum still stays on! The only plus is that it does a fairly good job of vacuuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great... at first","review":"I bought this vacuum in August 2006. For the first year, I loved it. It performed wonderfully. After about a year, I noticed that the on/off switch was a bit fussy. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not. Now, I can only turn the vacuum on and off by plugging it in and unplugging it. At around the same time that the on/off switch started acting up, the dirt sensor light started to flicker aimlessly, too. Now, when I dare to vacuum, it works OK on carpet (set at the hardwood floor setting) and it just blows dirt around on a hardwood floor. I used to own a Hoover that was about 30 years old. Then I bought this one because I wanted hoses and I chucked the old one. What a mistake! I'm now shopping for a new vacuum that will stand the test of time and other user reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk....Don't Buy","review":"Our previous Hoover vacuum cleaner lasted 4 years and was a great vacuum. So, when it died we replaced it with a similar model. I could not be more disappointed. Initially, it worked great. After 4 months, it has been nothing but problems. It breaks belts like it is what it was made to do. We have been replacing belts at the rate of one or two a week. It also does not seem to pick up dog hair at all. The carpet light that is supposed to indicate whether or not the carpet is clean just turns off and on at what appears to be random. I would not reccomend this to anyone. Do not buy!! We just went out and bought a Bissell...Hopefully we will have better results!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks and Not in the Good Way!","review":"I spent days researching vacuums and thought I had a winner. TOTALLY WRONG. I knew when I was unpacking it that it wasn't gonna be great. The very FIRST time I used it the belt broke. I tried replacing it and it was impossible. I quit when I cut my finger. Also, there is a gap between the roller assembly and the actual vacuum. When I took it apart to change the belt it was jam packed with fur and dirt. And that wasn't even in the roller assembly where it could have explained the belt breaking! All of this in 10 minutes of vacuuming. Needless to say, I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wot aload ...","review":"OMG!i am a massive fan of jt and that cd has ruined his brill songs!'let's take a ride' was my fav song and now that stoooopid cd has scared me for life!TO ALL THOSE EEJITS WHO THOUGHT MAKING THIS CD WOULD BE FUN AND A GOOD TRIBUTE I HAVE ONE WORD TO SAY TO Y'ALL.....

This tribute album is kool for the fact Justin has a tribute album, but the beat sounds a little weaker and the vocals are just not the same. Listen to the samples and deciede for yourself. I like Justin and the group Phantom Planet, but this album is like having Phantom Planet (the guys who sing fox's show 'the oc' theme song 'California') sing Justin Timberlake songs.

The author should have just written her own life story instead trying to fit it into a suspense novel about other people. I found this book very dark and hard to get thru - meaning there just wasn't anything there - nothing compelling you to read. I made it to 2/3 thru and just skimmed the rest. I didn't like the character development of Nicky and I didn't get much in the way of a growing love relationship between Nicky and Callie.

Just a little research, like actually reading the opinions in Padilla's case, would show that the U.S. government has not cited a single provision of the Patriot Act as justifying his detention.

The documentation did not match the product in the box at all.

Unfortunately, on the manufacturer's website (UC Logic, the other name for DigiPro), those were the most recent drivers available.I finally uninstalled all those drivers, rebooted, plugged in the pen tablet--and Microsoft found a more recent driver for it somehow and installed that.

The tablet itself works well - you don't even need to install the software to use it. Just plug it in and go! My only dislike is the small rocker switch on the side. On my tablet, almost every time it was pressed (accidentally or on purpose,) it would stick there. A little annoying, but as long as I kept my fingers out of the way all was good.(Happy ending: A moment of carelessness left the pen portion in my book bag, where the entire rocker switch broke off and disappeared. The pen works just fine without it, and now I don't need to watch where I hold the pen.

Its well worth the cost even if it doesn't magically write script in all documents. It does write in documents you just have to write it in a little yellow box and then it will insert it.

Now it won't work at all. I'm not sure how this product got so many good reviews, you all must have reviewed right after getting it.

We've tried everything... and yes, we've replaced and cleaned around the bag... but this Hoover just keeps dropping dirt. Instead of sucking it up, it combines the dust and dirt into clumps that are randomly shot around your floor.Initially we were really excited because of how well this was rated, and how it performed in consumer magazines.

It certianly does that job. It also is very reasonably priced compared to other vacs that got the same rating. Only draw-back is the cord is shorter than my previous vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"BELT BROKE FIRST DAY!!!","review":"Here's what happened: I paid $59.99 for this vacuum on sale, brought it home, put it togheter (easy assembly) and began vacuuming. It REALLY does have a lot of suction power! I was REALLY impressed! It did a wonderful job. After 20 minutes, the belt just SNAPPED! It's a great vacuum, but it has belt issues.HOOVER... ARE YOU LISTENING?? Fix the belt problem and this vacuum could sell for $129.99"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific - worst vacuum I have ever owned","review":"There is no way this vacuum could have deserved the positive rating consumer reports gave it. Even for its low price, it is not worth it. Simply does not work; belts come off and break, are hard to find; had to order from Sears parts department website. I will not buy another Hoover product, and will research to find out who actually makes it so that I don't buy any products made by the same OEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 4 uses","review":"I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this product. The first time I used the Hoover, it worked like a dream. My carpet looked almost brand new! I was so impressed and very grateful for all of the positive reviews that encouraged me to take a chance on this affordable product.Well, my attitude changed after I noticed that after only 4 uses, the vacuum stopped sucking up the dirt and debris. My change bag light was not lite, but I decided to replace the bag anyway. All of the dust and dirt continued to get caked up inside the vaccum cleaner and NO dirt was being filtered into the new bag.I am very disappointed. Now I'm going to have to spend the money to have this shipped back to the Hoover for a replacement.Buyer Be Aware!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't get another one","review":"Bought this in July 2008 and the agitator is already broken. I have no pets and my house is all tile except for two area rugs so there's no way it was overworked. What I really didn't like was the hose, the suction was great, but it made the hose less flexible and harder to extend fully when using attachments making the unit very cumbersome to use. If you assume I got a lemon, and all you're going to use it for is the floor or rug, then it's great; otherwise I'd continue shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT SUCKS SO GOOD!!!","review":"I wanted a vacuum with a bag and NOT have to empty a dust cup every 5 minutes, so I embarked on a search on line and after thorough comparisons on all counts and with the help of reading reviews, I finally ordered this vacuum and I am very pleased. It sucks up everything!!! We have tile floors throughout the house and a few large area rugs; it practically sucked the grout from the tile and got every single dust bunnie and dog hair from the tile floor and area rugs! The headlight is great, the long cord is wonderful, the edge cleaner is amazing and the self-propelled action assists with the workout! I would highly recommend this vacuum - it sucks so good!!! The only issue I have is where the cord connects to the unit - it's a bit low and gets in the way just a bit, but it's not a deal breaker! And the bag fits in the compartment just fine. Don't hesitate - this is a great deal for a great vacuum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for hard floors","review":"This product does not perform as advertised. It can not clean hard floors. It disperses the dust through the back. You are better of with a broom and a pail. In addition, I had to replace the belt after only one month of use. It does vacuum carpets OK. So, if you only have carpets in your house and don't mind changing belts often,it may be worthwhile due to the low price. (I guess you get what you pay for...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"meets the need","review":"Oreck expired after 8 years so found this unit which meets my needs; relatively light, good suction and filtration, and inexpensive. In the first month I'm quite pleased. Good value and no frills. Expect a plastic unit that sucks hard and picks up the carpet crud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Vacuum","review":"I purchased this vacuum as it was highly recommended. I have found it to be very powerful and does a very good job. My other vacuum is a cannister and is bulky and heavy. I do find that the Hoover is very noisy and the cord is short and has to be directed by the user. Overall, I find its power and size make this machine an excellent value. I am very pleased with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great vacuum for the price","review":"I purchased this vacuum for our newly purchased second home and love it. It has great suction and is easy to use. It's also less cumbersome than my hoover windtunnel. It seems a bit noisy but the cleaning capabilities are more important to me. I have already recommended it to people who want a very efficient vacuum for under 100.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great except for two things...","review":"We love the weight and the price but two things drive us nuts.1) That blue, plastic front panel constantly falls off. Touch it, it falls off...hit something and it falls off. I finally used duct tape.2) We've had to replace the belt countless times. It does not break, it just comes off. Then you have to undo the bottom to refasten.These are easy fixes for Hoover...or so it would seem.But it is light and does a good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"DAMAGES CARPET WHILE USING ATTACHMENTS","review":"I bought this vacuum after much research and hoped it would be a good investment. However, I immediately noticed that it is very LOUD. But my bigger issue with this vacuum is that it has caused burn marks on my carpet. When you use the attachments, the brush continues to spin -- even set at the second notch from the \\"hard floor\\" setting this caused deep grooved burns in my Berber carpet. I contacted Customer Service about this issue and was told that there was nothing they can do about it. Now I'm stuck with a loud vacuum that literally SUCKS. Don't buy this if you plan to ever use the attachments!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like my vacuum","review":"I like my new vacuum. I like that when you remove the hose, it automatically sucks from the hose--in my other vacuum, I had to turn the switch. Can't tell you how many times I vacuumed and realized it was on the wrong setting! Vacuum is light so would be good if you had to carry it up and down stairs. It seems to propel itself. The negative is that it is very loud! I use ear phones when I vacuum. Overall, a good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Bought this vacuum 2 years ago. When i got it i loved it. Great suction power but then about a year in i notcied that the suction was not as good as it was when i first bought it. in two years i replaced 4 belts and filter twice. the hose was mangaled and non-fixable. now it won't even pick up the dirt. I took it apart to clean it and the dirt was everywhere inside but in the bag where it should be.. I did a lot of research on uprights and heard so many good reviews on this vacuum when i first bought it. I thought it would last longer then 2 years... boy was i wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Apartment Dweller's Dream","review":"My last vacuum was a Bissell Cleanview II that lasted for 3 years. Everything with it was great except when I had to empty it. Emptying the dirt cup and cleaning the filters sent dust falling all over the vacuum and going in the air. After that I decided to get a bagged model. I did some research and the Hoover Tempo Widepath looked like a great buy. And after using it I'll say it's a great vacuum for apartments or other small living spaces.It's low cost, but has great suction and is pretty lightweight. Plus it has a nice compliment of attachments and the bags are not expensive. The main downside with it is the obvious low cost parts. Specifically with the hose, attachments and lack of a headlight (it would have been worth paying $10-20 more for better materials). It wouldn't be appropriate for a regular size house and probably won't last more than a couple years. However, for the price it's a terrific buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective though heavy","review":"I bought this based on the CR reports and other reviews. This is a solid basic vacuum with minimal controls but works very well to clean carpets. Not very convenient for cleaning stairs etc. given the heavy weight and short hose length."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for older workers","review":"This vacuum was a replacement for a heavier Hoover. It works extremly well. We do miss the headlight the old one had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this vacum- Poorly made","review":"This is not your old American made Hoover upright we all know. This machine is made by the lowest bidder and it shows. I have had nothing but problems with mine. The attachments do not stay on the machine, the vibration is awful, and the worst of it is this loud growling noise from the motor that started a month after we bought it. Hoover defintely cut corners in the manufacturing process in keeping the price down. Mission accomplished! You made a shiney blue piece of junk. Go to your local used vacuum store (if you can find one) and pick up an older refurbished Hoover. You will be way ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a \\"sucker\\"!","review":"This product really cleans up. I have used the carpet nozzle on my very good cannister for several years. It did a good job but several things needed to be replaced and that would have been costly. While lying on the carpet, I noticed bits and pieces that shouldn't have been there after vacuuming. I researched vacuums and this Tempo was highly rated by several sources (including Consumer Reports). I was a bit dubious that such an inexpensive machine could be as good as it's PR but thought it was worth a try. The suction is so strong, it actually leaves vacuum marks in my Berber carpet. I use an extraction shampooer regularly. The solution it picks up is less mucky than it was when I used my previous vacuum. The Tempo is pretty noisy but it more than makes up for that with it's cleaning power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hoover","review":"My vacuum came quickly and works great on carpets and wood floors, and gets into corners well. So far it has not chewed up the rug corners. It is relatively light and has not bothered my bad back, but seems to work as well as the heavier models. It came with lots of special tools which are holstered right on the machine so they are convenient for use. The cord holder is a little inconvenient, but this is a minor point."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this vacuum","review":"We purchased this in Oct of 2010 based on the Consumer Reports ratings. My wife is begging me to buy a new one now even though this one still runs becuase it has never been able to vacuum the carpets. It sucks, just not the way you want a vacuum to. Someone posted that they have changed since they were initially reviewed. If that is the case Hoover is doing a huge disservice to folks. Don't buy this - sometimes you actually do get what you pay for and having a vacuum that won't do it's job is not much better than nothin' at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned -- Major Disappointment!!!","review":"Wish I had paid more attention to the recent LOW reviews. Cheap and nearly laughable product. The attachments are like toys instead of tools. Sure it is cheap; but if it lasts a year, I will be very surprised. It is so disappointing I do not even plan to send it back. I will use it as long as it will work then send it where all junk should go. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRUDE & BLASTING LOUD Tempo also does serious damage.","review":"I skimped and bought this after my $600 Dyson Animal died after 3 years.Buying this model is a Major, costly mistake.This is a Basic very crude vacuum that's intensely Loud and blows out tons of heat - but the big damaging issue is that even on it's highest carpet setting it's stillfar too low and burns and shreds carpet edges - it wasn't until months later I realized what was happening to my good carpet. When my neighbor borrowed it, she quicklynoticed this defect, much faster than I. It also now sparks when turned on, the bag cover constantly pops off, the hoses pop out of place frequently. Just a pain.It's the cheapest vacuum out there with 1925 technology, it's just not even worth $25.The damage it's done to all the edges of my carpet is costly. Do yourself and your carpets a favor - avoid this crude damaging vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Didnt receive on time. When I did finally get my vacuum after 2 days of use the hose kinked up with just regular use. I bet a lot of hoses are sold!! Im just gonna use mine now til it breaks down. This has been my first time ordering a vacuum online and my last. Way to much hassle!!!! I dont even know how to get a new hose without paying for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I got this vacuum for my daughter as she will have carpeting in an apartment she is moving to. She wasn't able to put the vacuum together as the handle wouldn't go into the base of the vacuum and she didn't want to force it and break it. So she used the vacuum with a wand and an attachment and she said that dust spewed everywhere. Unfortunately it will be past the date that I can return the product since we don't live in the same city. I have had good experience with Hoover in the past, but I can't say the same about this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"I should not have expected much at this price point -- but what I got was basically a $75 toy vaccuum cleaner. Wish I had saved my money and put it toward a good one. Very rigid plasticy hose that doesn't bend, and the plastic housing is beyond cheap. The vacuum spits back the dirt while using the cleaning tools. I should know by now that you get what you pay for, and I have learned my lesson not to try and save a couple hundred bucks on a decent vacuum cleaner. Save your money and put it towards a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This thing is a complete piece of crap. Normally I don't read one-star reviews, but in this case it's appropriate. I bought this based on other reviews, and I recently saw that they redesigned this unit. The new version is a waste of money, even at this low price point. Bare-floor pickup is supposed to be excellent, but it excels only in shooting debris at your feet. The hose is too short to be of any real value, and the electrical cord should be cut off and replaced with anything else that will carry electricity. The tools don't stay in their assigned holders, and at least they could have designed it so the extensions sit small side up - that would allow you to put the brush and other tools on the extensions, where they might actually stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 21 units","review":"I have purchased over 20 of these units over the past several years for maintaining facilities. These were awesome in the beginning. The latest one lasted about 8 months. Older models are still in service. Something has changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN,T LAST LONG!!","review":"This vacuum was pretty cheap, and worked pretty well when we first got it, but now, after less than 2 years, it has stopped sucking from the front, only the attachments will suck. We have tried everything to fix it, but we are now having to buy another vacuum. I am bummed because I really like bagged vacuums but they are so hard to find these days in a vacuum that really works well. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacuum, buying another","review":"Got this a couple of months ago as per the CR recommendation. It works good on carpet, not so good on hard floors. For hard floors, the brush does not turn off and shoots the bigger junk around. But it works good on carpet, is pretty light, LOTS of power, a bag change indicator, and the attachments work well. Going to get another now! Make sure to get extra bags soon, they go fast.Jan 09 updateStill going strong. I use it in twice a week on average for 15 min, no problems so far. Sucks like a...well, its strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"good vaccum","review":"I bought this after my bagless needed the filter changed. After checking the price of the replacement of 2 filter. i decided to buy a new bagged vaccum as the 2 filters will cost up to $50. It's about the price of a new one!!! Then i checked the consumer report and found this U5140-900. It is light and powerful. a decent vaccum which is exactly what i want. It is even quieter than my old one. After i tried the bagless' messy way of emptying the waste bucket. i far prefect to go back to bagged vaccum. I will never use bagless again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is just a good deal","review":"This is a good deal. I will never buy another bagless vacumn. I'll take a sealed bag any day of the week. This vacumn works better than most models selling for 3 or 4 times the amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great vacuum for the price","review":"My husband and I first bought this vacuum while in college having bought our first puppy together. Two years later, this vacuum still works pretty good. The motor is starting to crackle and the cord holder broke off a long time ago. Overall this vacuum did a great job picking up now two dogs and a cats worth of hair. The attachments were a huge bonus as I am constantly cleaning off furniture and corners with pet hair. It does struggle on bare floors, but still does a decent job. We definitely got our value out of this vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent. Only pitfall is that the hose is loose","review":"I love this vacuum. It has excellent suction on carpet and hardwood. The only downside is that the hose does occasionally come out while vacuuming."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hose is too short","review":"This is the 3rd Tempo that I have purchased in 10 years, I put a lot of miles on these vacuums, 30 minutes a day and run them to death. I love a bagged vacuum and you can't beat this for the price, the long cord is a bonus too. The most recent one that I purchased came with a hose that is just a smidge too short and I am constantly stopping to pop it back in. I should have saved my old one, but it went out to garbage in the new box. Overall, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum","review":"I bought this Vacuum cleaner on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. What a disappointment! It is too heavy for my wife to push, and worse, it does not vacuum very well. It has trouble picking up little pieces such as paper or string. When I vacuum the wooden floor in my den, I have to go over the area twice in order for this vacuum cleaner to pick up all of the dust. The clamp that holds the bag is a bit tricky to click open and close. The setting for height for carpet/floors is very difficult to move between settings. it constantly gets stuck and it requirs a lot of force to move the setting. This product is also very noisy. After using this thing for about one year, we're going to buy another brand and put this clunker in a closet or give it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This vacuum has SUCTION! It's great and powerful. We use them a lot. The only downside (loss of one star) is that the attachments/accessories are below par. Not ergonomic and don't hold up well.

We use it on carpet and rugs only, it picks up everything. It is easy to use, and the tools are simple to attach. Although it has a wide path, it is smaller than our former vacuum. It is lightweight and easy to carry and store."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this sweeper!","review":"I did my homework, read the reviews, and LOVE THIS SWEEPER... I had a Hoover previously, and it lasted 9 long years - I run the sweeper at least once a day in a busy household. This machine is amazing - it is lightweight - easy to put together (within minutes)- picks up EVERYTHING & filters very, very well - it has fantastic suction - The cord is 20+ feet & the on-board tools are very handy and easy to use and put away. I am so very glad I made the choice for this one! Easy to find and clean filters & they are re-usable - no need to buy more at high prices - simply pop out clean & dry and pop back in... Super! A1 in my book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Broke on First Usage","review":"I guess it's a good vaccuum -- I don't know. The belt broke on the first usage. Also, the darn thing had to be assembled when it arrived and the instructions were very reliant on the drawings in the manual -- but the drawings weren't clear. In fact, they were confusing. And be prepared to use a screwdriver.As for the vaccuuming, I'll be able to tell better when I get the belt replaced. At this point, I'm sure you'll understand when I say I'm not very impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"uuummm the hose???","review":"i needed a vacuum that had a hose so that i could vacuum the stairs.

This one I'm getting rid of after 1.5 years. I hate it. The brushes continue to spin when using the hand tools and it put a hole in my rug. The cord doesn't stay locked in the channel up the back of the vacuum, so it effectively attaches at the base of the vacuum and I continually run over the cord. The hose is short. I spent the money for the separate extra long hose, but the vacuum tips over whenever I use it because it is too heavy for the vacuum. This vacuum is cheap and it has alot of suction power, but I can't say much else positive about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value","review":"We have owned several upright vacs of all kinds... bag type, bagless, HEPA, etc. This is rated very highly by Consumer Reports and it is right on the money.

The suction on this vacuum is so powerful, I've had to change the bag once a week!It was very reasonably priced here through Amazon. Best price around. Trust me, I did a LOT of price shopping before making this purchase.Overall, good value, good machine.

The price is a steal. It does its job fabulously. The suction helps to move it along. No more tugging. This Tempo takes the job out of vacuuming. I clean HUD homes for a living and baught two and paid much less than you would pay for any other top-rated vacuum. I'm recomending it to everyone. Very affordable gift but you will want one for yourself. It would be perfect if it had a bit longer cord. 10/26/2011 Update this one has been used in over a hundred houses and is still going strong. We do use a shop/vac for edging but as far as any carpet goes this thing works great! 12/21/2012 Still working.

Excellent vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Happy","review":"I read a ton of reviews and went ahead with the purchase.Others mentioned that you can't stop the aggitator while using the hose attachments... that's a bigger problem than I thought. Since I have long carpet, that continuous motion keeps lifting carpet fibers up and sending them up through the hole that's left from removing the attachment hose. It becomes a mess.Second, the hose for attachments is so short it really serves no purpose. I am just using it for a push vac. and I will have to use another machine for the jobs that need a hose.The suction is really good... it actually lifts up the carpt off the floor in some areas... not in a bad way, just shows how strong the suction grip is. Even though it picks up the carpet, it seems it doesn't pick up every piece of debris... how can that be?Overall, I am glad I bought this machine because I had limited funds and needed something quick. I would have probably bought a better machine if I had the money, but for now it does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I just took it out of the box to give it a try. Geez!

For $66 it was a bargain, but I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I've only used the vacuum twice but both times was impressed by its suction power and ease of handling.

The shiny metallic Orange exterior and \\"space age\\" look intrigued me I guess? It was a $129.00 lesson learned as far as I am concerned.Bottom line is it would be hard to find a better vacuum at twice the price. We love this product! Thank you HOOVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows dust up not in the bag.","review":"Hi, I never write reviews but when my husband noted the same problem I had wished someone would have written a review about this.When vacuuming on hard wood floors the vents from the motor blows all the dust and bird feathers around the room before you get a chance to vacuum them up.And the cord is to short. Nowhere in this ad does it say the cord length , I didn't know the length of my last vacuums cord , but I guess it was long enough, This machine is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this vacuum","review":"The vacuum works as well as promised. I haven't had a belt go out on me yet but I'm sure it's coming based on all the other comments I read.

Overall the vacuum so far does a great job and I'm pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"best value","review":"This was the first vacuum I bought. I bought it years ago because the price was good and hoover was a known brand. I was happy with it but kept dreaming about buying an even better one when I had more money. Then we lost the vacuum in a flood. So after lots of research I decided to go ahead and upgrade and bought a $170 bagless bissel, which worked ok for the next month and then proceeded to almost drive me nuts (no suction, heavy, messy and the list goes on). After 2 years I gave up on it and bought another $70 hoover tempo. I am SO HAPPY with it. It's light, it does the job well, it's easy to keep clean. To me it is the best vacuum for the money. I did not give it 5 stars because of the way the cord is supposed to be stored, I think it's a bit clumsy due to the position of the hooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing power for the price","review":"This vacuum is a hidden gem! I researched in Consumer Reports and nearly passed this one by on Amazon. I figured, wrongly, that it's low price meant low quality. Thank you to all that took the time to review this product! The suction is amazing, especially with the cleaning tools. I easily vacuumed all the cat hair off my furniture - and I mean all. The only thing that the vacuum is missing is for my personal preference = a longer attachment hose for the tools. I intend to order one from the form that came enclosed in the box. You can't go wrong with this vacuum, especially with it being shipped from Amazon to your door in a matter of a few days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off","review":"This can not be the model that consumer reports recommended. It is very cheaply made and does not pick up near as well as my old machine. I empty the dirt collector on my old machine after vacuuming each room due to cat hair that is collected.

I am returning it as soon as I can get it shipped out.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine","review":"This replaced a $250 kenmore model that broke after 5 years. The kenmore was good but did not feel like paying that much again. So went to amazon and obviously this model stood out based on number of reviews. This was back in 2009. We got it and have lived happily ever after. No reason to pay more.The reason I wrote a review today is beacuse the belt broke and I had to get a replacement. $3 through amazon! How great is that?As backwards as it may seem, the belt breaking actually made me appreciate this hoover more due to the cheap new belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy..","review":"This vacuum cleaner is not a good buy and I will not recommend it to anyone! It is heavy and not easy at all to move around...worst of all it seems to be blowing the dust around instead of actually vacuuming the floor. It is also difficult to use under sofas, beds etc. We have to vacuum the floors three times before all the dust is gone...as it just moves it from room to room! Would love to return and buy something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacume Great Price","review":"I bought this vacume 4 years ago and it's still working great. My daughter liked mine so much she bought one. I tell my grandkids this vacume has so much suction it would suck them up. They laugh,run and jump on the couch when I vacume.

My home is undergoing remodeling so we are constantly struggling with dust and other things tracked onto the floors and rugs. This little lightweight vacuum cleans it all up in short order. It's not too loud (my cat is not afraid of it) and it is easy to switch from upright to the hose and tools. Just one issue - I would prefer the tools to be a little wider. It's hard to vacuum a chair or couch with a five inch wide upholstery tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"I read a lot of reviews on bands breaking before purchase but haven't had any problems.

The first time I used it, I thought of a self-propelled lawnmower as it was so effortless to push. I had just vacuumed with a different vacuum and was so surprised at the difference in appearance in the carpet. I found it quite easy to use and effective on my tile flooring also. With former cleaners I had felt a reduction in suction when using the attachments so was amazed at the cleaning ability with the attachments on. I couldn't resist vacuuming the sofas and lampshades, just for the fun of using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath","review":"Excellent machine for the price. We have gone through at least one vac a year, over the last several years due to dog hair mainly from our Great Pyrenees. Nothing we've tried picks up the hair better, and that includes vacs like the Dyson, Oreck etc. The only downside is the bags don't hold a housefull of dirt and dog hair. However, this machine does the job more than adequately and might even last longer than a year. Even if it doesn't it beats paying 3 or 4 hundred $ a year for a vac that only pics up half the dirt and hair. The beater also needs less cleaning than the other more expensive types.

So this round I decide to go cheap and but this $75 hoover. Well, it made it just 11 months and is now spitting out more fur-balls than my 15 year old cat. I am really disappointed.

Used it for bare floors and carpets maybe a couple dozen times in a 9-month period. Although it's not too heavy, it's bulky and awkward and the cord connecting at the bottom means you step on it a lot. It also was extremely noisy, but the suction was great so I soldiered on. Last time I used it the height adjuster for the brush broke, so now it is permanently in the lowest position and it takes a team of horses to push it across a carpet--the use for which I mainly bought it.

This vacuum is decent for carpets, and the cord is long enough for two moderate sized rooms. But the negatives outweigh the advantages. The bags do not secure very well, and dust builds in the container that should stay in the bags. On hard floors, this vacuum is a disaster. It just flicks dirt around instead of picking it up, even on the bare floor setting.

BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum!","review":"We did a lot of research before deciding on this vacuum. My main concern was pet hair. The Hoover Tempo Widepath did not disappoint! I love it because I can actually see the cleaner carpet when I've finished. Not so much with my old vacuum. I used it on Berber carpet as well as the linoleum floors. It really gets the job done! The only thing it needs is a longer cord.

Lots of suction, lightweight and easy to push. I purchased a 6' heavy-duty extension cord to extend its reach just a little. Later, I sent my old (also CR recommended) \\"Boss\\" vac to the thrift shop and was glad to get rid of the beast! Too big, noisy, heavy - couldn't bear to Flug it upstairs. At the Tempo's price, I may just buy another for upstairs anyway. It's a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little vacuum","review":"Works well. We've been pleased with it.

It replaced a Bissel that had cost twice as much, and didn't work nearly as well. It is somewhat heavy, but I am a small woman and I don't find it hard to maneuver.The only cons are the sound (very loud, though tolerable) and the cord (not as long as my old vacuum, though long enough I can usually do two rooms without having to unplug and move).I would recommend buying Hepa filter bags that have the rubber seal. The bags that come with the vacuum only have a cardboard ring that slides onto the output tube, and it allows a lot of dust to escape. With the bags that have the rubber seal, this is not an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Vacuum","review":"This is an impressive vacuum!

It's a little loud, though not much worse than most other vacuums, but that's the only real con. It has good suction and all the attachments one might need. Also, it tilts a full 90-degrees to lay completely flat, which is great for getting under tables and furniture.Replacement bags are reasonably priced and widely available. I'm very satisfied with this vacuum, and I highly recommend it over other much pricier options. Incidentally, this vacuum also got a great rating from Consumer Reports, which is what first convinced me to make the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Deal After All - Poor Ergonomics and Loud","review":"Buying this model vacuum without physically examining it was a mistake, even after the 3rd place finish in Consumer Reports, the sub-$80 price, and past good experience with a long-lived Hoover. The first clue was the on/off switch placement, almost half-way down the handle, instead of near the hand grip. The second was the noise, 8dB more than our old Hoover upright. The third was that the shorter power cord exited the vacuum near the floor, so you have to hold it to keep from running over it. The old Hoover's cord exited near the top of the handle and was longer. Fourth, the new machine is harder to push. Last, the new machine is too wide to fit in some places that the old vacuum would. We are going to look again for a new vacuum, but this time we will try it out before buying it. Hopefully, we will find someone local in or out of our family to give the U5140-900 to. It would be cruel to sell it to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Before I make a purchase on items, I always go to my consumer report guide to get the most highly rated product at a reasonable price.

It picked up good the first couple of times and now it is not even picking up 1/2 the stuff on the floor! It is NOT easy to maneuver like it says in the description and when you try to change the level from the bare floor to carpet heights - forget it - it's a struggle every time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More for less!","review":"This is an excellent vacuum for the price. It performs extremely well on carpets and does a nice job of picking up pet hair. I had to change the bag after just 3 uses where I would go for weeks before changing with our previous vacuum. It is fairly lightweight and easy to maneuver. There are almost no bells or whistles, you just get a straight up good cleaning machine. The only downside is that it doesn't perform well on bare floors. When there isn't carpet it just throws the dirt around. Otherwise you can't beat it for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This vacuum is fine for pushing back-and-forth on carpet, but is prone to high-pitched whining. For tool use, it is terrible. The materials are excessively cheap, the hose is way too short (and does not expand well), the rolling brushes on the bottom do not stop turning while in tool mode, and cause lots of problems. In tool mode, it especially whines with a very irritating high pitch reminiscent of finger nails on a black board. It's cheap, but better to spend a little extra dough and get a proper vacuum. I got this one because Consumer Reports listed it as a best buy, and said it cleans great for the money. I'd steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great vaccuum","review":"After reading the positive reviews, I was certain this affordable vacuum was going to be great. It turned out to be a disappointment.The suction on the floor is rather poor. It's obvious that it leaves a lot of small and large particles and pet hair behind. The hose and tools work well for spot-cleaning, but that's really about it. It's nice and lightweight for carrying up and down stairs. But the inconvenience of buying and changing the bags was a drawback after using a bag-less model.Depending on your cleaning needs, I would recommend spending a little more for a higher quality model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome vacuum","review":"LOVE this vacuum. SO much I have 2 now. The only problem is the belt breaks easily - run over a sock, corner of a rug, a toy, etc - pop the belt goes. It's easy and inexpensive to replace and if you don't have four kids, a dog & two cats running around you may never even have this problem. Other than this - I think this vacuum is essentially indestructable. It's tolerated all sorts of abuse and we've had the first one for around 6 years. I like it better than my mom's oreck that I have used many times at her house to help her out. I also volunteer clean at our church & use 3 different kinds of vacuums there & the Hoover Tempo is by far and away the best for getting ALL the dirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"After reading all the reviews, this sounded like a good buy, and I was prepared to change the belt as needed.But I'm finding that it just doesn't pick up what's on the carpet or bare floor; after repeated passes on carpet, only about 50% of the visible debris has been removed, not just relocated. It's about the same on my laminate floors. Also, it's almost impossible to get the little tab that adjusts the height to stop anywhere in the middlerange: it just snaps from bare floor to high pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had for ONE day and stopped working","review":"I researched a bunch of vaccums and found one with good reviews so I took a chance and bought it online. Boy, was that a mistake! When it arrived, my wife started using it in our living room. Once she went out to do around the dining room table, it stopped picking up anything. We checked the bag and all of the suction vents, and EVERYTHING was clear. We didn't even have it for 24 hours. I was at the post office the next day to return it.Some positives were the shipping time was fantastic. The return policy and procedure was also hassle free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Rocks!!","review":"I did my research when I made this purchase.

What a total piece of garbage. No matter what floor height setting I put it on, it won't pick up ANYTHING. I've replaced the bag, I've checked the hose for clogs. It's just a weak, pitiful vacuum. The hose attachment has solid suction, but unless you are going to go around your entire house with the hose attachment to the floor, don't bother getting this pile. For the cost and effort, I'm not going to attempt to get it fixed or looked at. It's going straight to the trash pile and I'll never buy a Hoover again. There was a little tiny ball of cat hair on my carpet. I went over it a dozen or so times and it didn't pick it up. Not sure if it ever did any good. Regardless, I strongly encourage you to get a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works incredibly well!","review":"I purchased this vacuum cleaner based on the recommendation of an independent product rating guide.

But it hasn't worked well since about 2 months after we bought it. The plastic extension tubes splintered and the hoses kinked. There's good suction if you detach the hose from the head, but there is absolutely no suction at the head when the vacuum is run over carpet. In fact, the air flow seems to be opposite -- the rotating brush actually seems to be blowing dirt away at a greater rate than air is being drawn into the machine. Based on this experience, I would avoid buying anything with a \\"Hoover\\" name on it ever again. I suspect (by reading other reviews) that this was once an excellent, inexpensive model, whose manufacturing standards dropped to the point that it is essentially junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempo widepath","review":"Like the other reviewers say, this version is not the same as the old one which had such good reviews. It lacks the headlight, doesn't feel very solid, and the attachments on the back won't stay clipped into place. As far as the price goes you are probably getting about what you paid for, maybe a bit over priced though. Wouldn't buy again. Suction seems adequate but wasn't impressed versus our $50 bissell vacuum that it replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Now that I've used this for about six months, I can offer a few words about this vacuum. It is probably the most powerful vacuum I've ever had. This is good and bad, however. Even on the highest setting off the floor it will suck up area rugs. It does a great job on wood floors and medium shag carpet. The only design flaw is the cord connection is located too low to the ground so you are constantly holding it up to keep it out of your path, and the cord is also too short in my opinion. But otherwise it does the job well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Pick Up Dirt That Well","review":"I purchased this vacuum cleaner to replace a Hoover Sprint Vacuum I used for 6 years.

I have the Boss and it's a great vacuum-great suction,well engineered and reasonably priced; but it is heavy and someone in my household broke it. My husband wanted something lightweight for the stairs-the Hoover is the one. It has excellent suction--it feels like it is self-propelled--and it is light enough to use on the stairs without causing any strain. The best part is the price. Be advised: you get what you pay for--it is not as well engineered as other vacuums and is rather flimsy. That is not to say it won't last with proper care. We are very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tygartgirl","review":"Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright VacuumSweeper is very light. Attachments work very well.

Fairly easy to handle; keeps all dust INSIDE (no dust flying in the air!). Has a convenient usage indicator.We purchased the item in tandem with a very convenient (inexpensive) package containing several high-quality filters.One minor blemish: if and when using the extension tube (e.g. to pick up dust from surfaces above the floor), one end of the flexible tube has to be extracted from its socket. Placing it back tightly enough in the standard position requires considerable strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"crapped out after 3 weeks","review":"I was really excited to get this vacuum because I heard all the good reviews. When I received it, it worked great! I really liked it. After about 6 or 7 uses, the brush on the bottom of the vacuum just stopped working. I noticed this when it wouldn't pick up anything. I don't know which suppliers amazon gets this from, but I suspect the belt broke and it may have been a refurbished piece. Got an exchange on the way, hopefully I won't be writing another 1 star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Broke within 4 months","review":"I bought this vacuum in March for relatively light home use.

I wanted a simple machine, more lightweight if possible, with the cord in the right place (not at the bottom which makes it easy to run over) and attachments that are simple but stay hooked together and don't flop around. This vacuum is all that, and in addition, has a terrific price tag. I've had it for about a month now, and so far, no complaints!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum for the money","review":"This vacuum is a great one, especially when you factor in how affordable it is. I have tile and hardwood floors throughout my house and with 5 pets in our home, there is always vacuuming to be done. This one does the job. I have not found it spits out things (as other reviewers mention)...it even sucks up kitty litter crystals, no problem. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone in need of an affordable machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Vacuum at an Economical Price","review":"We purchased this vacuum to replace a Dirt Devil which was similar in design. I am very pleased with the price and quality (so far) of this vacuum. It tends to be a little noisy but most vacuums are. It is much quieter than the vacuum it replaced. Two additional features would take my review from a 4 to 5: 1). Longer cord, 2). Place near handle to clip the cord closest to the vacuum and keep it off the floor and from tangling with the vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great vacuum!","review":"We were searching for a more light weight vacuum, as we are getting older and our old Thunder vacuum is heavy & hard to find parts for. We came across this one. With three small dogs, we needed something that worked well.Since the ratings were great and the price was so low, we sent for it. It does a great job on our carpet. The suction of the hose is amazing! So far, we haven't had a problem with the accessories coming off. But, if they do, we can just put them in the closet until needed.We really wanted another bagless, but were happy to find that this one didn't leave that \\"just vacuumed smell\\", as many bagged ones do.If you want a great vacuum for a great price, I suggest you check this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vaccum for the price!","review":"This vaccum has powerful suction and easy to use tools.

Great buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I was a little concerned about having to put the vacuum together, but it comes almost complete and putting a few pieces in place was really simple. It's a little bit noisy, but not to a great degree. I really like this vacuum and, for the price (which includes attachments), you just can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"People that spend $300 to $500 on a vacuum are crazy. Just get this for a fraction of the price. It does exactly what it's supposed to. The only complaint I have is the hose for the attachments is on the short side. But all in all great product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vacuum I've ever used and extremely inexpensive.","review":"This vacuum cleaner is better than several others I have purchased costing much more money. I liked it so much that I bought two. The suction power is unbelievable and seems to self propel itself. The attachments are great, easy to use and stay in their respective places of hold. I can only say this is a TREMENDOUS value for the money and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but short lived","review":"Bought this vacuum because it was rated a best buy by Consumer Reports and the price. It arrived at my house in July and it was \\"buried\\" in December. The suction was great, but obviously the durability was lacking. In addition the hose is too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent budget vaccuum","review":"This vaccuum is rated high by Consumer Reports - and rightly so. For the price, there is not a better powered vacuum on the market - even vaccuums $20-$50 more do not do as good a job vaccuuming. The unit does not lose suction when using the attachments - it's amazing on getting rid of dog hair! Drawbacks are few, but include - doesn't do edges well (you have to use the attachment to get close to the baseboards), on/off switch is low, and it is loud. Pluses well out-weigh the minuses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best value available","review":"Unbeatable deal for the price. Very good machine. If you do not need frills this is a great machine. Consumer Reports said that it was on the loud side. I do not think it is unusually loud at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great secondary vacuum","review":"This is a great vacuum with lots of power. This is probably one of the most powerful vacuums I have ever used. The name widepath is a little misleading as the head is not very wide in comparison to most of today's vacuums and the power cord is very short. I use this vacuum as a secondary vacuum for my basement because of the great price and the great performance on carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, buy another vacuum!","review":"For the price of this vacuum, I wasn't expecting much, despite the good reviews and consumer report's recommendation. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This vacuum had great suction, is easy to maneuver, does not weigh too much, and is very affordable. However, it works MUCH better on carpet than bare floors. It does pick up small particles and leaves on our linoleum kitchen floor, but does not pick up cat litter-it spits it backwards at you. I have to sweep the kitchen/utility room before I vacuum it. Besides this inconvenience, I would highly recommend this vacuum.UPDATE 1/2011: One month after writing this review, we took this vacuum to the dump one month after this review. The cord split in half lengthwise, and the suction stopped completely. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk; Not a vacuum at all","review":"This goes down as the worst product I have ever purchased. It barely picked dirt up when it was new and after only 15 uses it does not pick up even the smallest piece of styrofoam. Other issues: hose pulls out of the back when extended to use the wand. Hose itself is way too short so vacuuming high spots means picking up the whole \\"vacuum\\". This \\"vacuum\\" is great at spreading the dirt all over while not actually picking anything up. Avoid this cheaply made item. Makes the top of my worst product list and I will never purchase another thing from Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Widepath vacuum - disappointing","review":"I purchased this vacuum via Amazon because it was recommended by a well-known consumer rating magazine, and was affordable. It does have good suction and is very lightweight. However, the belt breaks very easily because there is no way to turn off the suction quickly if something large is accidently sucked into the machine. I have had the vacuum for four months, and have had to replace two belts. It also seems almost as if I was sent a used vacuum instead of a new one because the accessory hose was bent, and the first belt and some of the accessories looked worn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum at reasonable cost!!!","review":"After checking some online reviews, decided to give this vacuum a try since it was priced sooo reasonable - I LOVE IT!! It has the best suction of any vacuum I have ever had, lightweight, only drawback is the cord could be longer, but I can live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, doesnt clean at all","review":"I bought this a month back and I am very disappointed.I have a carpeted floor, I tried this vaccum and instead of sucking the dust, it just keeps spreading it all over the place.(Even if I keep it on the maximum ). For cleaning a small area it takes 15-20 mts of several rounds . At the end its EXTREMELY furstrating to see - dust still remains!It is not worth it! Please dont waste your money.

Didn't leave with much, and a vacuum cleaner was on my list of things to buy, though not necessarily at the top. When married my husband decided he was the expert on anything that plus in, came home with a $500 Miele canister one day. Didn't pick up great, was cumbersome and hard to store away. This time I got to select, and did search all the different reviews out there from other Amazon customers. Decided on the Hoover, not as light as I thought it would be, but as I am on one floor that is okay. Picks up great both on carpet and hard floors. I have a dog a 2 cats, so getting up the animal fur was a must. Hoover has always benn a reliable name, remember when I was a kid (and I am 58 now) we had a Hoover. Most people did, no one said vacuuming they all said Hoovering whether they had a \\\\Hoover or not.

When it arrived, easy to put together and get working. VERY noisy, but worth the noise - this is the most powerful Vacuum we have ever used. It replaced a 10 year old canister model (Kenmore) that never had this much pickup power. Does not work well for getting under things and the Hose/attachments are not great, but does a wonderful job on carpets and BARE FLOORS (do not know why others had problems, but works for us.) For the price it is worth a gamble - and we really think we got a bargain (Only had it for 3 days.)All right this is an update (1-17-2010) After more than a year of use, the noise just finally got to us. It still works good, but we were tired of it and got a new one.

The price is fantastic for what you get. I searched around after I read about it in Consumer's Reports, but the only place I could find it was on Amazon which turned out great with the super fast shipping. My biggest complaint is that the attachments seem to fall off very easily while moving the Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum around.

But now that I have had it for a year I absolutely hate it. There are 2 screws at the base of the handle that hold the handle to the rest of the machine and those screws dont screw into anything, they fall out all the time and when they do its impossible to vacumm, you have to stop, push the screws back in and then continue till they fall out again. I do not reccomend at all. I have had multiple people look at the screws and try and secure them in without sucess. The suction of the vaccum has also decrease dramatically since I first bought it. And the tools dont stay in their storage areas well either, they fall out frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor caught fire after a year and a half","review":"I was reasonably happy with this vacuum cleaner for a year and a half. It's not the best I ever had but it was getting the job done. However I am very disappointed that the motor literally caught fire after a year and a half. This could have been a very hazardous situation. Plus, the motor isn't a user serviceable part and the warranty lasts only 1 year, so getting it replaced will cost more than buying a new vacuum cleaner. But this time I won't be buying another Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"Sorry I wasted my money on this one last year!

However, as the owner of 3 cats (2 long hair) this vacuum does a terrible job handling the pet fur. The fur fills up the bag after 2 once a week vacuums. The fur sometimes clogs the tubing leading to the bag and clogs the hose easily.Changing the bag this frequently is awful. The bag always poofs large amounts of fur & dust out into the air removing it. The bag is a pain to reinsert and the cheap plastic cover is difficult to maneuver back onto the little pegged slots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item as expected.","review":"Easy assembly. Easy to use.

Fire!\\", and sure enough the vacuum was on fire.

It's OK on carpet, but when you use the wands and attachments it's a disaster. The hose won't stretch far enough to dust walls, or around doors and windows, and repeatedly slips out of its coupling on the the base unit. It is also extremely noisy (and I'm hard of hearing!)

While unboxing it we noticed several differences from the 2008/9 version:-The new version does not have a light.-The attachments are much flimsier. They are no longer gray (as pictured), but black. The furniture and crevice tool are comparable, but the dusting attachment is much cheaper.-The brush is of much lower quality.-The pieces do not fit together as well and many of the edges are unfinished.-There is no longer a full-bag indicator, but this is a minor thing.The motor, body, hose and extensions appear the same, but it is no longer the value that it was three years ago.When deciding whether to purchase this product, keep in mind that older reviews cannot be trusted.

This Hoover Tempo has a long cord, is fairly lightweight and the bag-changing is easy. But... it doesn't work well on all of my rugs. I have a couple thick ones, and it works pretty well on those, but on the area rugs with low pile it sucks the rug up and makes it very hard to push the vacuum across the rug. I get a work out every time I clean my house. The manual adjustment is easy to use but feels cheesy, as if it will break off soon. I have tried every height adjustment on my thinner area rugs, none of them work.

The hose is made of cheap plastic that is not flexible when using the 2 Extension Wands. Hose often disconnects itself, is too short making it a struggle to control when using On-Board Tools.

NOT!!! Cord on back of vacuum too low to ground - when you go back and forth you run over it. Cord is too short [could live with that, personally. if all else was okay.] Off/on button not easily excessible with thumb... you need to use your second hand while holding vacuum to shut it... if you need to turn off quickly. Vacuum positions: floor, many carpet heights - no position for \\"tools\\". Beater does continue to run when using tools... suction is probably okay... but did find dirt from beater was spilling out slightly as I continued to use tools. Found vacuum didn't get ALL dirt off \\"floor\\" had to use tools to catch it all. Light on vacuum good. I would certainly seek out another vacuum.

I bought it because my last vacuum cleaner was a Hoover, and I loved it. It lasted well over 10 years with no problems. This vacuum cleaner, however is a disappointment. After a while, i noticed that it did not pick up like it used to. I had to pass the same spot several times in order to get up loose dirt. Then last week it died. While vacuuming the living room, I spelled something burning and shut it off. After opening it up, I found the belt torn. So I went to the store and replaced it with a brand new one, thinking that this was the problem. But immediately after turning the vacuum on again, the burning smell returned, and the brand new belt snapped.Compared to my last Hoover vacuum cleaner, I am very disappointed in this one, primarily because of its short lifespan. Then, after reading the Consumer Reports, I found out the Hoover is not good these days on longevity. So I am switching to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward with no suction","review":"This is an awful vacuum. The vent is placed right by the ridiculously short hose, ensuring that any time you reach with the hose, the air is blowing on the exact area you want to pick up.

I have been pleased that the overwhelmingly positive reviews are absolutely right - this is a wonderful vacuum cleaner, especially considering the price. The suction is very strong and catches almost everything (including my son's toys(!)). It is built very well, not flimsy or plasticky like some I have seen. Negatives: It is very loud but I can deal with it, given its efficiency. And I wish it has a retractable cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad","review":"My previous vac was a Hoover so I was confident when consumer reports gave this such great ratings for pet hair. After 2 weeks of using it and being horribly disappointed, I asked my 18 year old how she was liking it. She too complained that it never picks up the cat hair from our Maine Coon. Bags are a terrible idea.

Does anyone else have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased after a few months","review":"Belt broke after a week and had to ask for Manager at Hoover Customer Service to convince to send me a new belt. Besides that, I've had awful luck cleaning tile and hardwood floors with this vacuum. It just send the stuff all over the place and yes I adjust it down to the floor-setting...(and even try other settings) The other thing it can't do is pick-up lots of fuzz from new carpeting. The hose just blocked up entirely despite the bag being new. It's really sad that my wife's old vacuum cleaner from 20 years ago can do all these things - I'm glad we kept her old one despite the fact that it squeaks... Better luck to the rest of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"I ordered one of these for my Mom. It did such a good job that I ordered one for myself. It's light, easy to handle and has great suction power even with floor tools. I only found 2 slight drawbacks: the bag is small and therefore needs to be changed more frequently; and the hose for the onboard tools is short. However, I ordered the extended hose which works just fine. The performance greatly outweighs the minor inconveniences."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased this vacuum to use on my wood floors. The review claims it is excellent on hard surfaces. This machine is terrible on wood surfaces.

Not worth the hassle to return so I will just deal with it for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Broke on 1st Use","review":"The cleaner worked well for a few rooms, then the belt broke. This happened couple hours after I received it, so I wasn't inclined to gamble on future reliability. Someone I know has same model, however he purchased his a couple years ago, and there are differences: bag indicator light, etc.. This leads me to believe that Hoover is cutting corners to make more money off of a popular model. It'd still be a good deal for the price, assuming that it worked consistently for a year at least. I hate shopping for stuff, but will send this one back, I don't feel like taking a chance of adding another cleaner to the junkyard soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good value","review":"We have had this for about 1 month and so far so good. It is great on carpeting + large rugs - REALLY sucks up a lot of stuff; and seems okay on bare floors. Even though it is one of the lighter uprights out there, it still seems heavy to me after using a canister vac for so many years. For me the biggest drawback is the short attachment hose. If you plan on vacuuming a lot of upholstered items and drapes with this vac, it is not good for that purpose. No suction control either. I kept our old Eureka canister for this purpose - still good, but the beater bar on the carpet attachment was worn down + more expensive to replace than buying this vacuum. I haven't had any problems with the exhaust either. Easy to assemble. Power cord could be longer, but easily remedied with an extension cord. Overall a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just moves stuff around on floor, doesn't pick up anything!","review":"Got this vacuum at BestBuy and it broke after 1st use.

Will never go this cheap on a vacuum cleaner again, I get burnt everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"It picks up dirt and debris from carpet","review":"I am satisfied with this vacuum.

Great product, does the job, and does it well- I have four cats to determine my assessment on suction--sucks up cat hair with ease. As for complaints about noise, not a problem, as it sounds like other vacuums to me. It is light and easy to move around. Geat buy for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't pick up cat hair after 6 months","review":"I purchased this vacuum about 6 months ago and I was very pleased when it first arrived. We had a vacuum that was picking stuff up, but it was also leaving a line of dirt on the floor everytime you went from pulling it backwards to going forward again. And it smelled really bad when it was running. After reading glowing reviews about this low-priced vacuum, we went ahead and purchased. Now it won't even pick up cat hair even if you run over it again and again. It still seems to work on our hardwood floors, but we really need it to take the cat hair off the rugs. I tried our older vacuum yesterday, and it worked better than our new Hoover. We're very disappointed and probably going to have to suck it up and buy a Dyson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a vacuum should","review":"Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright VacuumIncredible value and it works better than any of the other over priced vacuum cleaners I've owned or tried while shopping around."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great vac","review":"This vac is recommended by Consumer Reports as one of their Quick Picks.

It has alot of suction power and does it's job on dog hair. I knew when I bought it that it would not have features that other more costly vacuums have,(retracable cord, floor setting where the brushes stop,quiteness etc.). It does what it was designed to do, suck up the dirt. On the down side, the power cord is rather short, it is quite loud,the on board tools hose is a bit short and if you stop to use the on board tools, be sure the vacuum is not sitting on a hand made carpet.I anticipate that this vacuum will last a good long time, it is well built and is exactly what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have seen better","review":"After reading the many great reviews on Amazon and Consumer Reports I was thrilled to get a great vacuum for a great price. What I found, however, is that the vacuum is extremely loud with a shrill, high pitched sound. The upholstery tool is attached behind the handle and hose continually gets knocked off. When you use the tool it falls off of the hose easily as well. The cord must be wound over the hose which is very awkward. The vacuum blows dirt around on the hard floor, and when you detach the hose to vacuum upholstery or a corner, debris blows all over the back of the vacuum and floor/carpet. The hose is very short and makes it difficult to reach very far without repositioning the vacuum, even from the front to the back of the couch. If you do not reposition, the vacuum falls over.If its use is only to vacuum carpet and you can stand the loud noise, due to its decent suction, it is a good vacuum for the money which is why I gave it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"The Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum is a great vacuum cleaner at a very reasonable price. This is the second time I have purchased this model. I have one in both of my homes. The first did have a headlight and a vacuum bag monitor, but those things really are not missed on the new model. I am smart enough to check the bag and who needs a light on their vacuum? I wanted a vacuum that picks up lint and dog hair. This model does everything and I did not break the bank in purchasing it. Why drop $300 and up for a Kirby or an Oreck when a $70 vacuum does what you need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy I've made all year !","review":"I purchased this vacuum about 6 months ago and wanted to wait until I'd used it for awhile before leaving feedback. So far this has been a great deal. It has excellent suction and for the money (I paid $56 and got free shipping) it was well worth what I paid. Getting the bag in and out can be a bit challenging and the overall construction seems a little weak (a lot of plastic parts) but it's held up okay.

They installed it backwards, and I can not use the machine. I used the help website to send an e-mail and found no acccess to e-mail. Called the help phone number and hung up after being on hold for 20 minutes. Called the nearest service center and he said return it to where you bought it, eventhough the Hoover documentation says go the service center first. The service center also mentioned it would take a while to get the replacement hose because they are very slow. Poor quality and customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Not the best vacuum I've ever owned but a great value for the price. Fairly light weight and easy to use. Cord wraps a little awkwardly on the back - looks like a design after-thought. Converting to hose use is not ideal. You basically pull the main hose out of a receptacle and add the attachments. No separate hose. Not as solid feeling as other vacuums I've owned. Minor quibbles aside, you probably have to spend 75-100% more to get something better. If you assume you will be replacing your vacuum every 5 years or so this is a safe bet. Or if you want a vacuum for each floor, buy a few of these and don't deal with dragging one up and down the stairs all of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I just assembled this vacuum and must say I'm pretty disappointed. It is outrageously loud. Second, as others have mentioned, its motions are jerky. It's difficult to turn while vacuuming because of the auto-propelling feature. Third, it is brutal on my thinner carpets. I have several oriental carpets on the smaller side (4x6) and it practically vacuumed them up. I have another shaggy rug, large, that it dug into and raised off the floor. The hose is thick and awkward to use, and honestly, with the noise I can't imagine putting my head anywhere near the motor while using the attachments. Too bad. Sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vacuum I've ever used","review":"I bought this a few years ago when Consumer Reports listed this as a Best Buy.

The top rated vacuums were Kenmores at Sears costing around $300.00. We did check them out but we couldn't get anyone in the store to tell us what the warranty was. We were told in information was inside the box in the instruction manual. We weren't comfortable purchasing without this information. So we went home and reviewed the consumer report again and discovered that this Hoover vacuum was very highly rated for less than 1/3rd the price. We were surprised at how well it cleans. The suction power is great. Cleans exceptionally well. It evens as a bit of self-propel motion. If needed, we could replace this one 3 times for the cost of the Kenmore. The only one draw back is that the bag is a bit small, but we still feel we got a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"No frills, but works great!","review":"This is a no-frills vacuum cleaner, but its cheap and works very well.

We have yet to regret this decision. It works really well for us. We have two small children and a dinning room table on a carpeted floor so we have put this vacuum to the test and it has done great. I only dropped a star from the rating due to the hose is a bit short even for vacuuming the couch. Also the cord is a little short I have to unplug it move it now to finish our main floor.

I have to turn off the machine a billion times to get it to stop sucking itself in. then I have to squeeze and stretch the hose until it finally goes back to its original shape. Now after using the vac maybe 5 or 7 times its not picking up hair...Im wondering if the carpet hight adjustment thing is broken because if I tilt the machine back raising the roller slightly it seems to pick the hair up.

Otherwise, I think we would have had to pay shipping charges for something that broke almost as soon as we plugged it in.That said, the vacuum works great. It is noisier than other vacuums I have had, but that's probably because it's so powerful. I saw someone complain about the cord length and I think it's just the same as any other vacuum.

I was concerned about switching from a bagless to bagged unit, but found that I do not have to change bags nearly as often as I emptied my prior vacuums dirt container. Much cleaner. The \\"bag full\\" indicatior and unit light are usefull features. Cord is short but no problem. Negatives are cumbersome cord winding and flimsey storage of tools. Great cleaner for low cost unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum, great price, great satisfaction","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner from Amazon because I was tired of my old clunky Hoover.

I read all the great reviews, and felt good buying this vacuum, but it literally BROKE the second time I used it. There was a ribbon hiding under the edge of the couch - the ribbon immediately got caught and the agitator belt snapped. I know these things aren't supposed to be bullet proof, but geez, consumers be warned - you'd better not have any socks or ribbons or whatnot hiding under your couches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible parts","review":"I can not rate this item. It arrived with bolts and nuts that do not fit together. (the hold the vacuum together) Calls to the number listed on the vacuum are of the your call is important to us variety as you wait, wait... The company instructs the purchaser to call them and not to return it to the store. Given this policy I would recommend that purchases be made at a local store that will assemble it for you. We are familiar and experienced \\"at do it your self\\" but that is impossible when you do not have the right parts.The Hoover Vacuum was purchased on Amazon.UPDATE!!When we finally spoke to a HOOVER representative they said they could not be certain that they could replace the defective parts so they were SENDING A REPLACEMENT VACUUM!! We hope this works out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum","review":"I didn't expect much for the low price and was pleasantly surprised. This little vacuum has a lot of power behind it. It's much lighter and easier to use than my last vacuum that cost 3 times as much. I don't expect it to last 10 years - I'll be happy if it lasts for 5. I wasn't impressed by the bagless vacuums I saw for several times the price. I have allergies and emptying the vacuum becomes a messy problem. I would have to wear a mask and empty it outside. This is a pleasure to maneuver and easy to empty - just change the bag! The attachments stay attached while in use better than my last vacuum. The only complaint, and it's slight, is that the cord doesn't stay in the cord holder so I have to keep pulling it out of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEAVY","review":"Works great.

I am stuck with a vacuum that doesn't do what it says it's supposed to do. I took it in for service and there is nothing wrong with it. It just doesn't do what it is advertised to do!

Within the first year, its performance dwindled. I finally replaced it this week after going over and over and over the carpet and having no suction whatsoever. I changed bags a lot, used all of the different settings, but it was a major disappointment. It would not pick up lint. It was especially poor at picking up debris from a carpet runner sitting atop our carpet.I really hoped it would outlast my supply of bags, but that was not to be. I expected more from the American brand that's been synonymous with vacuuming, but this product's performance declined to the point of uselessness. Four years of waning performance is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"Total junk. On the second use it sucked in a string and in a few seconds ruined the beater bar.

It has good suction, gets close to the walls, the attachments have great suction as well, and is fairly easy to manuver. The one thing that I would warn you is that it is fairly loud...I don't vacuum past the nursery when the baby is a sleep anymore....But when I do vacuum I am more than pleased with it's performance. I have had vacuums that cost 6 times this much that do not work as well...I recommend this to you, especially if the noise doesn't bother you."},{"rating":"1","title":"rotating brush ruined every carpet in my home","review":"I have owned this vacuum for a couple of years. I have had to change 2 area rugs thinking they weren't made well and am finally realizing it's this awful vacuum!! The rotating brush is so coarse that is makes every rug in your home look like an afro. It just frizzes up everything in its path. It made so many pulls on my area rug too. It doesn't matter which setting you put it on - the brush still rotates and touches the carpet. I'm so mad at myself for being such a cheapskate and buying this thing!! Never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LIKE CHANGING BELTS...","review":"You'll love this vacuum! With a new belt, it works great. But I'm changing belts constantly. I'm lucky to get 3 vacuums out of this bugger without changing them. And its not a snap to change either. I would NOT recommend this vacuum. And I will never buy a Hoover again. I had previously had a Dirt Devil which finally died after years of use and bought a Hoover as I grew up with one. My mother had one that lasted for 30 years (and I never saw her change a belt), so I felt this was a good choice... WRONG! My next purchase will be a Dirt Devil. This vacuum is just too much work to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ours is smoking as I type","review":"We were very happy with it the first few months. We switched back to bagged because we were sick of all of the dirt the bagless we had was spewing with every empty of the canister. It had great suction and got the job done even though it was WAY bare bones. The cord is in an awkward spot too so you almost always run over it. We've owned this vaccuum for 6 months. The last time we used it, something didn't sound right and it started to smell. So the hubby took the plate off the bottom and cleaned it (most other models you can pop the brush out to clean it so this is just one more strike against it). We turned it on this time, vaccuumed about 2 minutes, if that, and it smelled horrific and when we unplugged it we discovered the bottom was smoking and melted.NOT recommended. If you buy this just remember, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you have hard floors with rugs!!!!!","review":"I really don't know how this vacuum got so many good reviews.

Even on the bare floor setting this vacuum cannot and will not suck all the debris up. And, if you have a dog that sheds, like I do, forget about it. You'll be swimming in dog hair up to your elbows!!!!

This is by the far worst product I have ever bought on Amazon. I have had it repaired twice at Hoover store, no warranty coverage even though it was under warranty, fine print said it was not a warranty repair, each repair was $25, so now I am up over $100 for this piece of crap! The belt will not stay on it for over 5 minutes without slipping off. You then have to use a screwdriver to take off 4 screws to get the bottom cover off to put the belt back on, only to have it slip off again 5 minutes later. I finally got more pleasure out of taking it out to the driveway and smashing into as many pieces as I could to dispose it in the garbage can. Hoover is a joke and this vacuum is a joke!

I have bought Hoovers for yearsMary Ann"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"This self propelled vacuum was a great buy. It doesn't have bells and whistles, but it's easy to use and has good suction for all flooring (from hardwood to high profile carpet). The bags are relatively easy to change (emphasis on relative -- since when are vacuum bags ever easy to change?). We've had two broken belts, not abnormal for our amount and time of use. Replacement was pretty straight forward but requires screwdriver and scissors (to cut away all the long hair that gets wrapped around the axel/brush). It's not pleasant, but that's because of my long locks that shed like crazy, not due to the vacuum's operation.In general, I would recommend this product for its ease of use, functionality and durability. It was definitely worth the price as it cleans better than some of the higher end products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This is by far the worst vacuum I have ever bought. The belt constantly comes off so that the brushes stop working. I am not exaggerating when I say that from the day I bought it, I have never gotten through vacuuming my downstairs rooms (only three) without having to remove the bottom, and replace the belt on the spindle at the motor. Usually have to replace it two or three times.On top of that, there is no quick release for the bottom plate. Have to fully remove four screws each time. When it works it's ok, just a pain to keep working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value and power!","review":"This vacuum is so much better than the bagless Bissell that I had. This has amazing suction power especially for the price. If you use the hose you do have to be carefull because it has so much suction that it picks up anything you get close to. Also when you use the hose the brush still runs and if left on your carpet in one place might damage your carpet. This is a great price for the power. In a local store it would have been $20 more. It arrived quickly and I am very pleased with this product. Very simple to put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"great vacuum and carpet powder sucker","review":"This vacuum has been such a blessing. We just moved into a new house in which the carpet had been saturated in carpet powder. We went through a two vacuums trying to suck up all the carpet powder but it just ruined the vacuums. They were both bag less vacuums. We bought this one hoping it would not ruin it and it didn't. We were on the verge of replacing all the carpet because we didn't know if there was a vacuum out there that could handle all the carpet power. This vacuum powered right through it and sucked it almost all up. So we can continue vacuuming with no problems. It still sucks up some of the deep down carpet powder but it seems like its almost gone and it didn't ruin the vacuum.We have had no problems with this vacuum although a bag full indicator light would be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a great deal","review":"It's cheap but it doesn't pick up well at all on bare floors. The edge cleaning is poor. My 20 year-old Sharp was better by far. There's no good way to recoil the cord so it's left half-dangling. Carpet pick up is better but again edges get the short shrift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to Impressed","review":"Works well on carpets not to well anywhere else. The hose attachment is horrible, the hose is about 4 ft long and stiff and is not permanently attached to the vacuum, and when you try to clean furniture the movement losens it and it comes off. I have 2 dogs and 3 cats and I need to be able to clean the furniture. Also when you could use the hose on something all the dirt piled up on the floor where the vacuum stood, it was not pulled into the bag. Very disappointed with it and would not recommend to anyone with pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for about a day","review":"I loved this vacuum for the few hours it worked.

These are probably very worthwhile machines, but what a price tag! After much debate and consideration, I found I really don't like bagless vacuums. To me, they're gross, because you always have dust in your face when you empty the canister. So, I took a chance and found that this affordable Hoover still uses bags and provides allergen-free features. My impression is this is a very hardworking vacuum that really MOVES OUT! It's almost as if it wants to do all the vacuuming for you. One small drawback is that it isn't an overly quiet machine. It zooms and roars, but you get your money's worth. I like it a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet","review":"I ordered this vacuum because I wanted a light weight one and also one that used a bag.

The exhaust just spewed it all over and I\\"ve had to go back with a brush and dust pan where ever possible to reclean. The vacuum is heavy, it is noisy, it is unwieldy, and it is difficult to manage the cord, the body of the vacuum, and the extension at the same time. The extension tube bunches up so it's difficult to get the full length of it, and under the bed, where the big thing doesn't fit, the brush on the extension tub is way too small to do a good job. I have only used uprights a few times and am going to get myself a high quality, more expensive vaccuum that I test out in a store. I'm sending this one back as soon as it stops snowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor for dog hair","review":"I just received this vacuum and after reading some reviews about it being good for dog hair I thought I had found a good value. It is terrible at picking up dog hair. I had to go over the same spot 17 times and it still did not pick up all the dog hair. I vacuum my rugs every 2-3 days. I have two dogs, one with wiry white hair (Jack Russell). My old, cheap, Eureka Boss that I've had for ten years as an \\"extra\\" does a better job than this new Hoover Widepath. The moveable lever in the front, to go from HIGH to hardwood floors is cheap plastic and feels like it is going to break; I couldn't even get it to move. Very, very cheap, plasticky..don't buy this one. Someone just told me that he bought an inexpensive Bissell and it is great. He said he paid under $100. If I could find one that wouldn't aggravate my tendinitis AND pick up dog hair, I'd pay any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value vacuum","review":"This vacuum is an excellent value at cleans unbelievable.

I had to hand pick up lint, hair, and threads, all left by this terrible Hoover vacuum.

I've already ordered a new LG, it can only be better than this vacuum. I have had a previous Hoover and had been impressed with their quality. I have learned that Hoover is now made by Dirt Devil - won't buy a Hoover again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long has Hoover been making vacuums?","review":"The Tempo worked fairly well at first but after 6 months it no longer sucks. Also the cord wrap blocks the hose. You have to unwind the cord completely to get to the hose.

It is a HUGE pile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not too bad","review":"i read some bad reviews about this vacuum and was a little hesitant to buy it but i have had it for about three or four years now and it's pretty good. it picks up nicely but the belts seem to break quite often. otherwise it would say 5 stars. pretty light, the cord could be longer, but overall, there is a lot of crappy vacuums out there so i would recommend buying this one over others."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was all right until it stopped working.","review":"It worked for almost a year.

He told me that I should be using it at the highest carpet setting, and it broke because I was using it at a lower setting. The instructions clearly say you should use it at the lowest possible setting. He told me it was normal wear and tear, and the warranty would not cover it.

If we get anywhere near the fireplace, unless the vacuum cleaner is pointed directly toward it, this same blast of air sends ashes spiraling out of the fireplace and throughout the living room. This makes the vacuum cleaner useless, which is probably just as well as the noise level is so high and it is extremely difficult to push over our rugs. After about a dozen attempts to use it, the cleaner stopped picking up all together except through the hose attachments. I guess the bright side of this is that we no longer have a layer of ash on our rugs. Needless to say, we are off Hoover products now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I purchased this Hoover, after having a Dirt Buster vacuum, for less than a year. When I received it, I immediately started using it, on a newly installed carpet. I was totally impressed, by its suction power, even with the attachment hose, for edges and ledges. I would recommend this product, to anyone who is looking for a reasonably inexpensive, efficient vacuum cleaner. It is well worth the price I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and affordable vacuum","review":"This vacuum is great, especially for the price. The suction power on this machine is very strong. I have cats and this vacuum managed to pick up all the hair off my carpets. The only drawbacks I've encountered include the short hose, the noise, and the tendency for \\"stuff\\" to get around the rotating brush. You really have to keep an eye on the brush...clean it out after each use otherwise it will make the motor overheat. You also need to change the bag after 2-3 uses or else the machine will lose some suction.Overall, it's a great vacuum. I'm sold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product For The Price","review":"I researched vacuums on a popular product testing and \\"consumer reporting\\" website, where this product was recommended, based on superior performance and lower price. By and large, I have been very satisfied with the machine, but I do have a couple of quibbles.First, I have noticed that the vacuum does not pick up dirt on bare floors as well as I would expect. In fact, I have felt it kick out dust particles as I have used it. Second, there is a gauge on the front of the vacuum, which is supposed to show how full the bag is. I have never seen the gauge change, regardless of whether there is a new bag or a full bag.I would be far more disturbed by those issues if the vacuum were more expensive, but I could have paid a lot more and gotten a lot less. For the price and overall performance, this is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to expectations.","review":"I purchased this model because I read a good review for it in Consumer Reports. It has disappointed me in every possible way. It keeps breaking down with issues like the belt slipping off, the bag comes lose and blows dirt everywhere, the attachments that ride on-board drop off at the most inconvenient times... I've had it for less than a year and will be replacing it soon. FAIL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For $80?!! Best bang for your vacuum cleaner buck bar none.","review":"Honestly, I'm surprised Hoover actually produces these as it's got to cut into sales of higher priced models they sell. Okay, there are no bells and whistles, but for every day vacuuming needs, for LESS than 100 bucks, it's an awesome deal. I've had mine for several years now. I'm no 'clean gene' so this serves my needs to the 'T'. Five stars in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"Save your money. Not the same vacuum as in 2010. CHEAP imitation. Brush is horrible for low carpets. No bag full indicator. Only good thing is suction. Consumer reports rated this as a good buy. I call it a good bye... Mine is sitting in the trash as I type this. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS VACUUM TO ANYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacuum cleaner for a very good price","review":"Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright VacuumI looked for the lightest weight vacuum cleaner for the lowest price and I am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud but excellent","review":"I have been seeing this product in my Consumer's Report Magazine for the last three years. It is ranked with other vacuums that cost around $300. The only issue was it was only good on noise. They were correct. The suction power is excellent and the allergen filter bags are also very nice to have. It is worth it, especially due to its cheap price!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lived up to expectations","review":"I read the product review of this in Consumer Reports. I was seeking a bagged cleaner as I see no point in these overpriced bagless models that require you to dump the dust. (Why do I want to put dust back into the air in my home after I sjust spent time removing it?)They rated it high on the features I was seeking, and comparable to many vacuums that cost 5 times as much or more. I'm very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the price","review":"This vacuum has excellent suction and is easy to use. This is the second one that we have purchased. These work great in our rental units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but noisy","review":"I didn't use it myself, but my cleaning lady told me that the vacuum is light, powerful and very effective. I myself noticed that it is VERY loud. If I'll use it I'll definitely put ear-plugs in.But, again, for THIS price you can't expect 100% perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum for the money","review":"Arrived quickly. Product exactly as described and seems to clean well so far. Easy to carry and all the attachments were a nice bonus. Assembly is not intuitive, but reading the directions does help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful.","review":"It is noisy. noise aside, there are many drawbacks. Even after running this unit on the same place for a long time, i am still able to pick hair, dirt from the carpet just by hand. As another reviewer said, it is not useful for hardwood also, air coming out of the side of the unit blows more dirt. hand tools are connected by a short hose, which makes it very difficult to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud","review":"For the price, this vacuum cleaner is a good deal. The beaters are good on wall to wall carpeting, but I find it extremely loud. The beaters rotate constantly, making it almost seem self-propelled, which makes it easy to push on carpeting. However, I worry what that would do to the finish on wooden floors. The brush adjustment height seems to do nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value/year later","review":"I read every one-star review but decided I'd take a chance since the price was so low. I'm very satisified so far (only had it about four weeks). It works well, hasn't had any problems listed by many reviewers, and is lightweight, a prime consideration since our children do most of the vacuuming and our youngest, age 10, needs a vacuum he can maneuver easily. I'll be buying another one soonn to keep downstairs so we don't have to lug it up and down each time we vacuum.We've had this for almost a year now and it's still performing admirably. The quality would be tremendously improved by using a different material for the hose. Ours has a bit of a bend in it and while it's not cracked there, I anticipate it will be so some day. when it cracks, we'll duct tape it and continue vacuuming. I still think it's definitely worth the price and plan to get one for the downstairs so we can stop lugging it up and down the stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER SUCTION","review":"Cant beat this vacuum for the price. Only had it a short time and used it 3 times...But the suction on this vacuum is great. Ideal for me because I use it and leave it on my 2nd floor instead of lugging my cannister up and down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"Very powerful vacuum -- better than vacuums costing more than twice as much. Accessories all stored on vacuum for very easy access. Accessory hose permanently attached to vacuum for easy switching between upright vacuuming and vacuuming with nozzles. I am so satisfied with this vacuum, that I have bought 4 of these over the last year for myself and various family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Tempo Widepath Vacuum U5140-900","review":"Consumer Reports gave this machine a high rating. Ordered it from Amazon for a good price. It actually arrived the next day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"Several hundred 5-star reviews say it all. There's little I can add to what has already been said. But this is such a great vacuum, at such a great price, that it deserved another 5-star review. The motor is surprisingly powerful and although not self-propelled, it does have a bit of a pull, making it easy to use over carpets of all thickness. Another plus is that this vacuum doesn't produce lots of dust and odor, like some cheaper vacuums. This is great for someone with allergies, like myself. My previous vacuum (Hoover supreme soft and light) was so bad that I would periodically have to clean the exhaust vents at the bottom of the vacuum because they'd be so covered in dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Have had the product for 2 months; very pleased with the purchase. Great suction/pickup. Recommend the use of the HEPA filtration bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap 'n' Good","review":"I've only used this vaccuum a couple times, but it seems to work great. Easy to push around, light, a long cord(definitely important), and works well on carpet and bare surfaces. I can't say about durability, but Hoover has been making vaccuums a long time, longer than most other brands, and it seems sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum sucks! (that's a good think in a vacuum)","review":"This vacuum is fantastic. It really cleans and you cannot go wrong with the price. I am very happy I got this vacuum instead of another really expensive one. This cleans just as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and great price","review":"I love this vacuum! My house cleaner loves it so much she bought a bunch for her business after using mine. It is a great sucker and is easy to carry and push. The price is amazing for such a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacuum for the price","review":"This seems like a pretty good vacuum cleaner so far if you don't want to spend a lot of money. My previous Hoover that I purchased in 2001 worked very well for 8 years and I only remember that being about $90-100, so I figure if I can get that same time out of this one or even a little less than it will be worth it. I did a lot of time consuming research on vacuum cleaners only to end up more confused as for every good review, there is a harsh negative one. I even went and tested a top rated Kenmore that was much more expensive and it was so heavy, I hated it. I hate the bagless type cleaners b/c the dust flies everywhere and is disgusting. So far, I can't think of anything really negative about this vacuum, the price was right, seems to do a good job (how do you ever really know???), and amazon shipped it super fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"The suction on this vacuum is great. However the hose is awful. It is made of really cheap plastic and collapsed within 6 months of usage. It is sad I have a good machine and can not use it because I can not find a hose for it. Will never recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum, Great Price","review":"I can't exactly add much to the already glowing reviews on this product, but I had to add my two cents. I was doubtful that a vacuum at this price could actually provide quality cleaning. I was wrong. I haven't had it too long, but it picks up just about anything on both thick carpet and tile floor. My husband is allergic to dust-mites, which is the reason we bought this vacuum. It actually seems to be helping."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAVORABLE","review":"i HAVE USED THIS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AND FIND IT QUITE SATISFACTORY- A GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"Before purchasing the Hoover Tempo Widepath, I spent a lot of time online researching vacuums. Fear of commitment, I guess. What made me finally choose this product was the price. I knew about some of the complaints about the short cord, short hose and that it doesn't always pick up well on bare floors.The shorter cord is not too much of an issue for me because we have a fairly small house. The hose does take some getting used to because I use that frequently. I do wish it was longer. And if it spits something back out on a bare floor, I just use the hose.What I like about this vacuum, other than the great price, is how easy it is to manuever. I also like having a bagged vacuum again because I hate emptying a bagless. The suction is awesome and it picks up well along walls. Just don't accidently run over the cord or a thin rug.So far, I have been pleased with the Widepath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacuum cleaner","review":"We have been trying to find a vacuum cleaner for several years to pick up the dog hair in our apartment. This was a pleasant surprise and the shipping was so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"Worked fine for the first few weeks. It is now IMPOSSIBLE to push in thick carpet. I am not sure how I will be able to use the warranty as the nearest service center is 50 miles away. It replaced another Hoover that also became very difficult to push in carpet. I am tired of buying vacuums that work for a few weeks/months and then stop working. I will be shopping for a different brand, one that has a local service shop where I can use the product's warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice the cost, not better than a Bissell","review":"I bought this based on the good reviews and thought it would be better than my bissell which was no longer picking up on floor level. I am SO disappointed in the performance. It is about equal tothe bissell which I only paid $40 for and yet this was twice as much! It sucks up well with the hose separately but the floor vac part doesn't seem to do very well at all. Such a pain to return big things so I just emailed amazon to tell them how disappointed I was. Next time, I won't buy big items online. Better to buy local so I can return them easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempo-NOT SO GOOD","review":"The Vacuum arrived in 2 days. The height adjustment on this vacuum is not very good if you have high pile rugs. The vacuum itself is very good with great suction. If you have expensive rugs I suggest you buy another model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Deal for the Price","review":"I was a bit skeptical at first, and wondered if this would live up to the reviews i read on it. It definitly does live up to the reviews and i think is hands down the best vaccume cleaner you can get at this price. Fairly simple, and not overdone with features (which i like). The only thing i would like to see added is the ability to turn the carpet brush off if you are using the hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Vacuume for the money.","review":"I bought this vacuume from an ad int local newspaper. a special price. It is one of the best I have ever used, my daughter uses it more than I, and she too likes it very much. The Tempo is rated very high by consumers research. I love this vacuum and now I found where I can get the bags cheap. what else do you need to know. BUT IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Piece","review":"I bought this vacuum and one of the extensions was missing. I didn't have time to wait for an exchange, so I returned it and got the Dirt Devil Breeze bagged vacuum at my local Target. Quality-wise the Breeze it seemed to be the same but it was half the price, not to mention much lighter and more maneuverable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the value you think it is","review":"I bought this thinking it was a great value. What I got was a vacuum cleaner that often pushes dirt around instead of vacuuming it. And the bag compartment is so small (much smaller than the actual bag) that you are constantly changing the bag. I wouldn't buy this vacuum cleaner again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with purchase","review":"Disappointed with the vacuum performance. The belt has been broken twice in six month. I have a high pile carpet and it does not do a very good job to cleaning it deep. Also, bare floor cleaning just does not work. It just keeps on throwing stuff at the back of the vacuum (you can feel it if you vacuum with bare feet). Also, yesterday it started smelling of burned rubber with some smoke coming out of it. Called the customer service, and they won't replace it. They advised me to take it to one of the warranty repair center - the nearest one is 20 miles away :-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I got this vacuum after buying and returning a more expensive one. This vacuum is small and simple but it is mighty. We are so glad we got it and what a great price! We only have 3 small bedrooms to vacuum so it works fine for us. Not sure how it would hold up if we needed to use it more frequently and for a larger space. You have to assemble it yourself when it arrives, but I found that to be fairly easy. Lightweight and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Significant problems","review":"No way to turn off the spinner while using hand-held attachments. The heat from the spinner partially melted our area run in three places while my wife was cleaning the sofa. Good deal on this vacuum cost us a $300 rug. If you're careful with it, though, it may be adequate.The belt broke on third usage, but hopefully will work better with replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"This vacuum is a good buy for the money and performs well enough. It takes care of all the pets' hair on my carpets. Yes, it is primitive and heavy and does not go all the way under the furniture but it sucks up the smallest dirt particles from the carpets. The best use: for a quick but effective carpet vacuuming."},{"rating":"2","title":"great vacuum","review":"this vacuum is a great vacuum for the money,the only reason i did'nt give it 5 stars is if you vacuum next to any dust it will blow the dust, but it really is not a problem.the best part is the vacuum is light and pushes easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"BET YOU WON'T STOP WITH JUST ONE !!","review":"Incredibly comfortable operation; simple to use features; wonderful performance; and, fantastic value!

Why must I return the whole product why cant they just send me blue cover I have to take product apart because I had it put together before I realized this part broken last purchase from amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"If I could leave less than one star I would. This is without a doubt the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever used. After the first few passes the hose will crimp and collapse and then there is no suction. You have to shut it off and unkink it and start again. What it does manage to suck up gets clogged in the tube so you have to take it apart ( you will need a screwdriver) and clean it out. Vacuuming a 12 x 12 carpeted room took me 40 minutes. Even after that it didn't look very clean so I did it over again but this time with a broom. Felt like I was back in the 18th century but I finally had a clean carpet! Consumer reports dropped the ball on this one. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built like a snap together toy","review":"Skip on this one please and avoid some frustration. I have lost to many brownie points with the Mrs. due to her frustration with it. I purchased this vacuum based on consumer reports ratings. I beg to disagree with their assessment of this unit. No Joke when I say it reminds me of a snap together toy that you have to put together every time you want to use it. The hose collapsed when on and you have to 'unkink' it. I cannibalized another vacuum for a poor fit for the hose but is better than the old one. The power cord is annoyingly short. The blue cover for the bag holder busts easy (the two little plastic prongs are the weak point on the bottom of it) so be gentle. Presently it is being held together by giant rubber bands. Oh yeah.. most of the attachments are lost/misplaced because the 'holder' on the unit lets them fall out a lot. The belt is a pain in the butt to replace/comes off and you need a screwdriver (it has frequently just 'comes off')"},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum sucks great!","review":"This inexpensive vacuum by Hoover really has some great suction. The components are plastic which makes it very lightweight and easy to use ... but they are plastic .... even the hose which can make it a bit difficult at times because it's not very flexible plastic. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the stiffness in the hose but you can't buy a better machine for the price. I would recommend this to a friend and even if I had to replace it every year .... it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and ' VERY ' Affordable Vacuum","review":"This is the 3rd one of these vacuums I have purchased , not because they stop working or anything like that But because the first 2 still work very well and I have a 3 floor house and wanted one for each floor !! I am elderly and did not want to carry a vacuum up & down steps and these vacs are so affordable I could purchase one for each floor ! They are also very powerful and almost take off on their own to clean the floors ! Maybe they are not the best available but for me and my money they do the job very well ! My son has another well known brand of vac which costs 3x as much and does not clean any better than this Hoover and it is also more difficult for me to use than this Hoover is !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Best vacuum I have ever owned.

We received the vacuum cleaner via UPS three days ago in its original box, not double boxed. When we opened the box, we found a tool holder had been broken off so there was no place to contain the tool. There was not even any styrofoam nor any other packaging material to hold the product and its parts from rattling in the box! There is no way to replace the tool holder as it is part of the body of the vacuum, which appears to be made from cheap plastic. As to performance, however, the vacuum performed well. The suction is great and the vacuum cleaner is very easy to handle because of its lightness. I intend to contact the manufacturer and let them know they should improve on their packaging to avoid breakage on future shipments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for heavy-duty use!","review":"I have a family of seven and three dogs. Therefore, I need a vacuum that can perform. At first I was very happy with this vacuum. It was lightweight and picked up the dirt. After 4 months, I started smelling a burning smell and the vacuum stopped picking up dirt. I checked the belt and cleaned the rotating brush of hair. I put it back together and the vacuum just would not pick up any dirt. I am going to look for something heavy-duty. I got this vacuum cleaner for my mom and she is doing okay with it but they don't have the traffic I do going through the house. This vacuum is okay if you want something lightweight and have a small family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine on carpet, but not on hardwood","review":"This vacuum has a \\"bare floor\\" setting, but it does a terrible job on my hardwood floors. It just blows around the dirt. However, it works quite well on my rugs, with one caveat. It's marketed as a \\"wide path\\" but it seems to me that the outer edges don't have much suction. If you're buying this stictly for carpet, I would recommend it. You can't beat the price. Otherwise, look elsewhere.The first vacuum I received had a hole in the cord, and I have to say that Amazon's customer service was superb. They responded immediately, and within a few days, I had another vacuum, no hassles and no questions asked. You don't find that kind of service very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"deafening and disfunctional","review":"Bought this vacuum because of a writeup that said although its noisy it really sucks and also I have had three bad bagless experiences so was ready for an old fashioned vacuum that just works great.well the noise is deafening.so I tried to put up with that.but now after about six months its not sucking from the bottom only through the attachments although I have stripped it thoroughly and can find no blockage.not one I would recommend.unless you like real short term usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum I've Ever Owned!","review":"I move around alot - pretty much yearly - and end up selling most of my belongings and buying new when I get to my new destination. I've been doing that for 12 years. This is about my 10th vacuum and it is by far the WORST I've ever owned.On tile floors it spits debris right back out at you! I tried vacuuming up some spilled oats and it made it worse!On carpet it's not any better! I live in an apartment with new carpet. That means lots of carpet fuzz, right? This vacuum, as you use it in a room, will leave little hairball or fuzz balls in its path. No joke. I thought at first maybe the bag was full or that the spinning things on the bottom were jammed - so I cleaned everything and tried again. Same result every single time. It's just a pathetic piece of junk.If you don't really want your floors cleaned, then buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value for an upright","review":"I purchased this vacuum over two years ago and it is still running strong. I had to replace my expensive Hoover vacuum when it died. This one was less then a third of the price of my \\"top of the line\\" Hoover. The only differences I can see are: no headlight (that's fine, I don't use it in the dark), and the electrical cord is about 2 feet shorter. That's OK too because my house has many outlets. If you MUST have a longer cord, spend 3 or 4 bucks and get an extension cord. The suction is just as strong as the \\"high priced\\" model. I don't know the specs on this model but I wouldn't be surprised if it had the same motor as my old Hoover.

However, the product hasn't lived up to what I'd expected because it simply doesn't vacuum up all that's on the floor/carpet, and it is very difficult to get them entirely clean in just one or two pass overs.

Here's why.","review":"This vacuum cleaner looks and feels cheap. You can tell just by looking at the plastic housing that it's cheap. It's also very ugly, heavy and loud. It comes with three accessories that are basically worthless. Worse, the accessories don't snap onto the vacuum well, and they are constantly falling off during use. Also, this vacuum cleaner's got the absolute worst cord management that I have ever seen. And with all that, I still give this thing 4 stars because the one thing that it does well, it does EXTREMELY well and that is it picks up dirt from my carpet like a champ. It's as if they cut as many corners as they could to put all of their resources into making the motor on this thing a beast. When you turn it on, you can actually feel the vacuum cleaner pull a little bit. Yes, it is that strong. Do not waste hundreds elsewhere. Buy this piece of junk for $70-$80 and be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"The belt broke 3 times in one week and no I didnt get anything caught in it. I have a low carpet.

This one is a disaster. It is very poorly designed: doesn't lock in upright position, won't raise up over sills so I have to pick it up move into the bathroom or kitchen, very high clearance so it doesn't go under cabinets or tables with side rails, noisy, cord attaches very low so I have to bend over to scoop it out of the way. It may be wide but it is also unwieldy. My old one had none of these issues. If I had purchased it in a local store (lesson learned!), I would have taken it back, but by the time I figured out all of the problems, the box it came in was gone and the return time from Amazon had expired.

This machine almost seems like it self propels when going in the forward motion, you hardly have to push it. I wish the hose and power cord was a little longer, but it's not really a problem for me. A word of caution if you are using this on small scatter rugs, you will need to stand on the rug, otherwise the vacuum will eat your rug and the belt will bite the dust. After 8 months, I already have to replace the belt and I only use this machine vacuum once a week. I previously owned a Dirt Devil MVP for 16 years and never had that problem and never had to replace the belt on that machine in all those years. If you're considering ordering this machine, be sure to pick up extra belts because you will need them much sooner than you think.Overall, I really do like this vacuum cleaner and the price is reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"This piece of crap arrived with a broken belt. Now I have to order a belt to see if this product works - needless to say I'm not optimistic. I tried to go cheap since I have a small place, live alone, and so don't vacuum a lot. Big mistake. Buy quality. This product is not worth your money or your time. I'm extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this vacuum cleaner","review":"I bought this vacuum a few months ago on the advice of Consumer Reports. I hate it!

Incomplete!!!!","review":"This product came with no screws or nuts to hold the handle on. Amazon would take 30 days to replace and the manufactor sent the wrong screws and they had no nuts no knew when they would get any. So I still do NOT have a handle that attaches to the vaccum! Boy am I glad to have a new vaccum with no handle!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ill-made and dangerous - do not buy!!!","review":"I purchased this vacuum in February 2009. The belt broke on its third use. Replaced that. It has always seemed to spit out dirt. While vacuuming today, the cord somehow came in contact with the roller bar, and the brush roller stripped the insulation off, leaving the electrical wiring inside the cord exposed. Luckily, I unplugged the vacuum before examining the problem. If I had just touched the wires, I could have been electrocuted. This is a huge design flaw. The vacuum is going into the trash and the pictures are going to the Consumer Produce Safety Commission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover u5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum","review":"WE have been very pleased with the Hoover Tempo.

Didn't try to compare them in any way. Only interested in a cleaner that picked up well. And this one does just that. Yes, it does have some design flaws. I have to agree with the other reviewers that the cord placement is too low. Easy fix was to fasten it higher up on the handle with a piece of electrical tape. Seems to me those that made such a fuss about the sound were exaggerating a bit. And, I haven't had any belts break yet, but ordered extas just in case. I tend to wonder if those who had that problem didn't have the setting too low to the carpet expecting better pick up. I will say I miss the headlight my old cleaner had. All in all I think it's a great little machine for the money. Do I think it's going to last 35 years? Nope. But, by then I'll most likely be pushing daisies, not a vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a disposable vacuum - don't expect it to last","review":"We bought this vacuum from Amazon in September 2008 based on the many favorable reviews. We were initially very satisfied with its performance. However, after 15 months of normal household use and just after the warranty period expired, this vacuum cleaner started producing a grinding noise and clouds of acrid smoke. I took the vacuum apart and checked for any obstructions. Everything was clear and the roller and original belt were fine. I tested the motor again with no load and it immediately started smoking and grinding.An $80.00 vacuum that lasts only 15 months is an expensive proposition. If you decide to buy this model, understand that you are taking a gamble with your 80 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL product for the money!","review":"Thumps up for this very economical vacuum. It is not too heavy, the tools are easy to access, and even my 5 yr old can use it. The only thing I don't like is the extension hose is too short, BUT a longer hose can be purchased separately. We use it for carpets only."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst vaccum I have ever seen","review":"I bought this vaccum about a year ago because Consumer Reports rated it very high. Unfortunately this thing never worked well even once. It eats up my carpet but for some reason cannot even pick up visible dirt. The carpet it ate and the hair it picked up (to some degree) got tangeld up with the brush so there was this strong burning smell every time I tried to use it. After about 5 times of use the thing finally bit the dust. Absolutely the worst vaccum cleaner I have ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a great deal!!!","review":"We purchased this Hoover U5140-900 a few months ago.

When it does work, however, it does have good suction."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointed","review":"I ordered this vacuum after reading the reviews and also because I always thought Hoover was a good name product. The first time I received it , the product was broken already in the box and I had to send it back. When I saw how cheap the plastic casing of the vacuum was made and how the little blue clips were all that kept the cover on I was both angry and dissapointed. I had to have someone drive me to the ups store to return it. In the meantime, my daughter who was trying to help me got on the computer to print the return adress for me and not knowing what a piece of junk it was ordered me another......... I'm not going to return it again. I'm done. I will use it until it breaks and I'm sure that won't take long. Great Expectations from a product that used to be wonderful. I'm a child of the fifties and my mom and myself always swore by American made (NOT) well built appliances such as Hoover. IT's been a long time since anyone has gotton their money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good product at a reasonable price","review":"A surprisingly versatile product. Very powerful and easy to handle. Provides all the necessary accessories to do the job.

It works beautifully and actually has such powerful suction that we need to clean our area rugs differently because it tries to suck them up. I'm thinking of getting one for our church because the price is right, too. Unfortunately, after 6 months of use, it is breaking down, just like its predecessor. The cheap plastic construction soon allows the roller brush to impact parts of the plastic frame, creating a terrible racket and eventually destroying both belt and socket for the roller. There is a reason for the low price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum, Great Price!","review":"I needed to replace a, once again, broken vacuum. Read some reviews on line and was torn between the Hoover Tempo Widepath or the Hoover Platinum. Both had very good reviews but very different in price. With the Widepath being so cheap, I was a bit sceptical. I have been through 3 vacuums in 15 years and didn't want to keep wasting more money. So I decided on saving some cash and went for the Tempo Widepath. I'm so glad I did. What a Great Vacuum! The suction is amazing and my carpets look great. It's also not as heavy as other uprights. It has been the best vacuum I've owned so far and it didn't cost me a heafty price. Thanks everyone on your comments because it did help me with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleans well but too loud","review":"This Hoover works pretty good, cleans carpets really well. It kinda blows dust around when it's on the floor cleaning setting though and it's soooooooo loud. But overall, it's not bad. Works much better than my last vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum cleaner!","review":"I was expecting to pay $300 for a vacuum cleaner that would come close to my old Hoover Elite that finally gave up the ghost after some 15 years of faithful service. When I saw this ine for $60, I decided to take a chance.It is an amazing vacuum! No fancy features, but the on/off switch is where I can reach it, and the tool suction is AWESOME -- because it uses that same hose that draws from the main cleaner! Brilliant idea, better than my old one, lighter, and at a ridiculously low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"New vacuum","review":"My new widepath is lighter and so much easier to push around. So now I don't dread vacuuming. My old vacuum was so hard to push. I tried to see if this could be rectified to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Vacuum","review":"I am less than thrilled with my new vacuum, purchased to replace my 30 yr. old Hoover upright. This vacuum provides a powerful suction on plush carpeting. However, the vacuum is so cheaply made and has design flaws when compared to my original model. The hose design is shorter with a material that is far less flexible. The placement of the electrical cord is very poorly designed; resulting in my \\"vacuuming\\" the cord as it got stuck under the rotation teeth on my second day of use. This type of damage never occurred in all the years of vacuuming with my original Hoover upright. Needless to say I am most disappointed with my purchase and realize I should have picked a different model, although this vacuum was well rated in Consumer Reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy and difficult to use","review":"This vacuum is not good. It is very loud. It is very heavy. It is cumbersome to manuever. I haven't used many other vacuums, but this is NOT good for someone looking for a lightweight, quiet machine with good suck. Right now, I cannot figure out how to switch it from sucking from hose to sucking and rotating from underneath. It's not new to us either. I'm ready to throw it out of house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Powerful","review":"This vacuum is a great value. The suction is incredible both on carpeting and with the tools. It's super light and easy to push. Big dirty jobs get taken care of quickly. On the downside, the hose is short and inflexible, making it necessary to use both extender wands (even for close-by jobs) and the beater bar never stops when using the tools. Be careful when using the fabric nozzle on older or delicate fabrics because they may be damaged by the aggressive suction. The dusting tool is more gentle. All in all, once you get to know this vacuum, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum!","review":"We've had 2 or 3 bagless vacuums that have broken within 1-2 years after getting them. They've gotten clogged, etc. We ordered this vacuum instead and it works wonderfully! Much better than even the new bagless ones! Great buy and great deal for this wonderful vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots Of Vacuum for Small Price","review":"Got rid of my expensive, heavy Kirby and purchased this low priced, bag vacuum ($70). It has great suction & is lightweight which makes it easier to hold on the stairs. I like a bagged vacuum since it is cleaner and doesn't spread dust or junk into the air while I'm banging a bagless container on the side of my trash basket. Only drawback with this vacuum for me is the somewhat shorter attachment reach and the inability to turn off the brush rotation for wood floors. Great vacuum for the price and performance though & I would buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I've had this vacuum cleaner I got from Sears years ago and I didn't like all the dust that was coming out of the worn connection where the bag attached so I looked in Consumers Report and noticed the low price for this one and read the good reviews on Amazon. Thing showed up promptly, again a pleasure dealing with Amazon, and I vacuumed the carpet I've vacuumed a million times with the Sears and I could not believe how much the Sears had been missing and how fast the bag on the Hoover filled up. I ripped open the filled bag and there was years of [..] in it, skin cells, dust, cat stuff, all kinds of yukkie stuff that the Sears did not pick up. I don't have much experience with vacuums, but considering the double filter in this one, the nice attachments and how well it works and the dirt low price it's a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"After doing a lot of research on Consumer Reports and Amazon, I tried this vacuum to replace my old Hoover. This vacuum is one of the few that Consumer Reports rates well for under $100. As soon as I received it and tried it out...the pedal that releases the tilt broke the second time I stepped on it so the vacuum would no longer stay in the upright position on its own. I have tile and wood floors with several area rugs...I could constantly feel debris hitting my feet instead of getting sucked up into the vacuum on the hard floors, and the vacuum ate a couple of my area rugs. I am a loss as how this model has been rated so well be so many people.

It does not do well on bare floors, but I have very little bare floor and just use the wand. And the hose is too short. I had to buy the extra lenght hose. But I would still reccommend this vacuum. The suction is strong, its not heavy and is easy to handle. It's like self propelled and I swear, it would take off on its own if it could. Bags are cheap here on Amazon. I am very happy with it and I paid less than half of what I paid for my old Hoover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I really had some doubts that I would be happy with a fairly inexpensive vacuum as I have always bought traditionally nicer vacumms ($300 on up).

I would recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Tempo Widepath","review":"For the money, you can't beat the suction power of this vacuum. It has attachments that work well, but the vacuum itself feels cheaply made. It is cumbersome to wrap the cord around the notches because the vacuum hose is in the way. In spite of that, I would definitely recommend this item because it works so well. I've had other vacuums that were more expensive, but didn't work like this one. If I had it to do over, I would buy it again and again regardless of the \\"plastic\\" feel of the vacuum. At this price, it wouldn't matter if it broke because I would go out and buy a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"It's been a while since I had this vacuum cleaner. It broke long before it should have. I've been using Hoover vacuums for over 30 years and this is the first Hoover that I can say was just awful. It was very loud, too loud. Sure, it cleaned for a while, then just blew out. I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner. Spend a little more and get the more expensive Hoovers. You get what you pay for, and I was very disappointed in this Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I got this vacuum after having read reviews on both Amazon and Consumer Reports. Although I knew I would be getting a lower end item by paying less than $100, this product did not live up to the reputation at all. I find that it tips over easily when using the hose and attachements (even after I purchased a longer hose for this purpose) and when vacuuming on hard surfaces such as wood and tile the spinning brush just sprays debris. Because this is a lower end model, there is no adjustment to turn the brush on and off. This continues to happen no matter what height adjustment I use. The best use is for carpet and upholstery. I do not recommend it if you have any other surfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a 5 star to a no start","review":"I was eager to write a glowing review from the moment I used first used this vacuum. It had amazing suction power and self propelled like a dream. That was yesterday. Today, it will not turn on - no power.

Bag is easy to change as are all the filters. Hose could be longer for easier reaching ceiling with wands. When using wands the brush continues to rotate which in my opinion is not good if it is sitting on your carpet, but in actual use doesn't hurt the carpet. I keep the carpet setting at its highest level for best performance. If set too low it is harder on the carpet and the belt drive, and doesn't clean any better--maybe worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it love it love it","review":"I bought this vacuum after reading \\"consumer reports\\" recommendations.

I think peoples' expectations were too high for this price point. After living with the vacuum for months I can confidently recommend this as a solid product. It is heavy, but that is because it has a powerful motor. I never had the attachments fall off - they seem secure. The foot tilt lever doesn't seem that flimsy as long as you don't stomp on it or force it. It's ugly, but it is a utilitarian object.

The brush does not stop when in upright position, but for the price and for regular wall to wall carpet, it is excellent. It is also difficult to use on throw rugs that are not very heavy as the suction is so strong that it pulls the rug up. The attachments work well with strong suction. It is lightweight and does not require a lot of expensive filters. It is loud, but not as loud as others I have had. It uses bags, which I prefer to bagless. I would recommend it if you are aware of the drawbacks. You really can't beat the price for a good vacuum.You can also check out \\"Consumer Report\\" (Oct. 2007)for a review of this vacuum.

It just got rid of every single speck of dirt. Felt unbelievable. After use, it was easy to clean up and put away for another day's clean-up. I HIGHLY recommend this product, unless your house is piled up in dirt, and you need the sucking power of a tornado or something. This cleaner is plenty for most average requirements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum in a Convenient Size","review":"When my central vacuum cleaner became permanently disabled, I searched online, through Consumer Reports and in-store for an upright, clean-air filtration replacement. The Hoover U5140-900 Tempo was consistantly rated at the top and is clearly a bargain at this price. The base is wide enough for quicker cleaning but remains flexible; suction power is excellent and the unit is not overloaded with attachments that you would probably never use. I am partially disabled but have little discomfort using this vacuum due to its good design and lighter weight. I also do not have to go over and over areas to accomplish the task of cleaning-up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"we were looking for an inexpensive upright to replace our old hoover bagless that included a power brush head. so far this one is doing the job. the hose for the attachments is too short but if it were longer the unit wouldn't be as compact as it is. i'm wondering if hoover offers an extension hose accessory? anyway, the thing has powerful suction and works pretty good on bare floors. some big items (like hardened macaroni) might get shot around by the power brush and not picked up but let's face it, for the price you can't expect miracles. also, the plastic seems like it might be brittle but i'm hoping if we treat it gently and don't abuse it, it'll last a long time like our previous hoover. i'm happy with it so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover vac","review":"Worked well for first few months but after a year it wouldn't pick anything up. May be a mechanical problem, not sure. The motor works well after 4 yrs. The vacuum just fails to pick up loose debris and I often need to go over an area multiple times before it picks up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This machine came with sharp edges around the extension tube holders that lacerated my hand when I tried to pull out one of the extension rods in the normal fashion.When I contacted the company, they didn't want to know and wouldn't come to inspect. They wanted me to send the machine to them.Their customer service is also abysmal.The machine also began sparking around the on/off switch after about 6 months.The last time I used it, it ended up emitting smoke.Hoover used to be a good company but after this experience, I would not buy their brand again and suggest you don't either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!","review":"We've had two (dummy me) and they break down constantly. Carpet level control broke. On/off switch broke. Parts fall off. Heavy! Cord's too short! Hose is too short! Clogs often and has to be taken apart! BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"Good value for the money. I really do not understand the bad reviews at all! I bought two of these. Buy it without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product for the price","review":"This is a no-thrills vacuum cleaner that is perfect for some no-thrills cleaning! While it is made a bit 'cheaper' it does the trick and is very powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, get something better","review":"I bought this because it was rated well on amazon and consumer reports. Now that I have had it for a year I don't understand all the positive reviews. The tube crinkles up like others have reported, it has trouble picking up small pieces of paper on a hardwood floor, which indicates to me that it has weak suction. The front panel constantly falls off due to either poor design or poor QC, probably both. I think when it comes to vacuums you just have to bite the bullet and buy a decent one that will last. Just my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"I owned an earlier version of this vacuum cleaner that was good enough and durable enough for the money. So, when it gave up the ghost, I replaced it with what I assumed was the same model. As has been noted by other reviewers, this later version of the Widepath is indeed more cheaply made than its predecessor, and does not include the headlight that the earlier model had (but then, I never considered a headlight an absolute must for a vacuum cleaner). It worked very well for about a year. After that, it started to lose suction. Finally, I had the same experience mentioned by at least one other reviewer: the thing started smoking as I vacuumed, filling our three-bedroom apartment with a repulsive odor, requiring the opening of all the windows in our place to restore the air to breathable quality. I would only recommend this to someone who's planning on living in this country for about a year, and will no longer require a vacuum cleaner after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value","review":"Great for vacuuming carpeted floor. Hose and end attachments are sub-par. Great value for the money I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain...great sweeper","review":"Take away all the bells and whistles, give the basic sweeper what it needs to get the job done and you end up with this sweeper. Rated #5 best sweeper by Consumer Reports, it comes in at a price that is outstanding among the $200 and $300 vacuum cleaners. It isn't real quiet, it isn't laden with useless tools, it is simple and does a great job... it is light and easy to manipulate around, especially since I have arthritis and neuropathy. Can't beat the price, if I didn't already say that. I ordered it one day, regular shipping, got it the next day. Thanks, it came at a time when we had company coming, old vacuum broke, couldn't afford an expensive one, couldn't believe the quality bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"Have had this model for about half a year now. It works really well on carpets and suction strength is incredible. Glad I did not pay extra for a more expensive vacuum. Only two things that annoy me. The filter bags fill up very quickly so make sure you have some extras. Also the belt on it broke after only a few of weeks of use. They are very difficult to find in stores but luckily hoover sells them online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be....","review":"I purchased this vacuum after reading reviews posted here. Most were positive (good buy for the $$). Two major flaws with this vacuum: 1) hose for attachments WAY too short. Can not vacuum more than 2 feet from vacuum without tipping it over. Very annoying. 2) the carpet height adjustment either does not work on my vacuum, or is of poor design. No real adjustment happening. I will give the vacuum kudos for having good suction...since that is what a vacuum should do - right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy belt in bulk?","review":"Belt broke after ONE week usage. Vacuum is powerful but if I have to replace belt every week, I mind as well buy the $200 windtunnel. What's worse is Hoover customer service. When you call them, they make you feel that it is your fault. Then tells you belts do break down over usage time. But after only ONE WEEK??? Finally, they told me it will take 4-6 weeks for the replacement belt to arrive. Zero star for customer service and the belt. 5 stars for the rest of the vacuum. Disappointing to find out Hoover, an long-time surviving American company, treats customers like that. How about use a better rubber material??? Good thing Hoover doesn't make condoms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Purchased this vacuum and the belt broke on it's 3rd use. We have a small house, maybe 1000sq ft and we don't even vacuum the entire thing. This was really a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum for the price","review":"This vacuum works great, especially for the price. I am all for seaching for a good deal for a good product without spending a lot of money! I think everyone needs to practice this concept! I think it is crazy that you actually could pay up to 600.00 for a vacuum!!! Seriously?? That could be an all-inclusive weekend trip to Cozumel! LOLThe reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't work great on hard surfaces but does do great on carpet, which is where I really needed it most. All in all, I reccommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good vacuum","review":"You get alot of vacuum for the price you pay. The suction is very strong but be it would be nice if it did a better job along the edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Delivered ahead of schedule. Easy to assemble before first use. Has great suction power that makes it ideal for small homes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum, Bagged,","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner for my in-laws and the woman who cleans for them. I based my selection on weight, style, price and brand. They are very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems Great, Band Broke on First Use","review":"This seems like a great vacuum cleaner and a great price. It was doing a great job on our carpet, but three rooms into the very first use, the band broke. I was vacuuming a pretty thick area rug....but I couldn't believe the thing broke the first time I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad, but the belt istantly broke","review":"its suction power is OK, a bit cheap'looking. Once received it, I was excited to try it. However, after operating for exactly 15 minutes something got caught inside, the belt was broken, it got hot and burning smell was everywhere. Returned it the next day. I got \\"Hoover Elite Rewind Bagless Upright Vacuum\\" instead, about 20$ more expensive but much nice and expensive looking, suction power is great, rewind wire, bagless, air-circulation mark... I love the bagless one. Bottom line, DO NOT BUY, WASTE OF MONEY. Pay a bit more and get a better machine.Hoover 5507-900 Elite Auto-Rewind Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"Though i gave it 2 stars, there should be an option for defective...After vacuuming, when turning the switch off, there is an electrical spark right under the switch cover which is not normal, and seems unsafe to me, given also that the spark is of different strength each time, though not in direct exposure to the electricity because of the switch cover. I am taking it to the local Hoover repair place to have it looked at and hopefully fixed.Other than that, The vacuuming seems powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"We bought this Hoover vacuum after reading rave reviews in Consumer Reports. It was to replace a $140 vacuum we bought only 6 month ago (Eureka brand) The little Hoover out vacuums by far, suction is excellent. The only drawback is a very short hose. After using both bagged and bagless types, we will stick with bagged as they don't clog and the suction is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum","review":"I chose the Hoover U5140-900 vacuum because it had an excellent rating inConsumer's Report. My ONLY complaint is that it is heavy. I would loveto have a light-weight upright that cleans as well as this one does. Itis self-propelled which helps a lot. The on-board hose is easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed!","review":"I was very impressed with this vacuum. It is a great bargain. I have two cats, and this vacuum keeps my place very tidy.
