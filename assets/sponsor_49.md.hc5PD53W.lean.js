Not 2 days later the blade housing stripped and now is completly ineffective. The motor runs fine but is useless without a blade to be turned.

Good luck with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid.","review":"Review of the Back to Basics Smoothie Pro 700, which I own.The motor is too small. It overheats and creates a very poisonous-seeming smell. There are no standards for rating motors. \\"Peak Power\\" may be only the power the motor can draw for one second before burning.There is a hole in the base, where the plastic jar fits. Liquid can easily flow into that hole, creating a place for fungus and bacteria to breed. The liquid can apparently flow onto the motor area.The silver color is just silver-colored plastic.The blender blades screw into the plastic jar with threads that go the opposite direction that is standard. Counter-clockwise tightens, not loosens.At high speed the blender vibrates very loudly and violently. Sometimes the vibration causes the blender blade to unscrew itself from the jar. If that happens, the contents flows to the counter and the floor.

Too many times comedy directors have tried to put family values in an Adult themed shows. This show brought a level of college humor that was wholesome yet unrefined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Normally, I'm the first person to give a book the benefit of the doubt. Normally, I can ignore short-comings to enjoy a story. This book is one of the few I feel like flinging across a room. It deserves to be burned, it's so awful. I can't even enjoy the plot because there are always these stupid encounters between Spike and Vivian getting in the way. I expected a thriller, but all I've read so far has been something that needs to be made into a SPICE channel movie. Every other chapter is another frustrated encounter between Spike and Vivian. Is THAT supposed to hold my interest?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but somewhat dissappointed....","review":"That everytime Vivian and Spike got intimate it was always on the sly and they were always interrupted. I just wish there was whole chapter dedicated to them making love in a bed all night long. Other than that the book was very good, the storyline and the humor. I laugh a lot with Wazoo's character, I think she pretty much made the book. I can't wait for Ms Cameron's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad book","review":"This book MIGHT have been passable if it was about 250 pagesshorter. It seemed like the author had nothing to really doso she just filled the pages with nonsense and way toomany ridiculous characters. Although the book starts out witha murder, which I thought might prove intersting, I was wrong.200 pages later I couldn't care less who committed the murder,if Spike and Vivian ever figured out their attraction ormuch else about this bunch of nonsense. I'm truly amazedthat anyone is still publishing this writer in hardcover,thank god I only bought a paperback, next time I'll knownot to even bother with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This has to be the worst book I've ever read. The relationship between Spike and Vivian made no sense-between the miscommunications and bizarre dialog, I couldn't tell if they loved each other, hated each other, lusted after each other, or all of the above. The abundance of other non-sensical characters made me forget that this was actually a murder mystery. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a serious question for someone who finished this book","review":"This is my first experience with Ms Cameron. On page 17 of the paperback version, there is a murder. Does anything else ever actually happen in this book because I've read 150 more pages and since the murder, characters wander in and out but nothing much happens. If the rest of the book is simply characters wandering around, I really don't want to waste the time. I'm not sure what she's trying to accomplish unless padding to proper length was the goal of the middle of the book but seriously, does this book have a raison d'etre? If anyone can convince me, I'll finish it and reevaluate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted","review":"I have never written a review before in my life. However, I have found this book to be one of the worst books I have ever read so I decided to give it a review. I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this book. It does not even deserve a 1 star rating. I am halfway through the book and still don't know exactly what the author is trying to say. All the funny town names and secondary characters make the story line and plot difficult to keep up with. The author would have done better if she had gotten rid of the so called thriller plot line and just made the book a straight our romance story. The book could have been cut down to about 100 or so pages. I am so glad I bought the paperback and not the hardcover. As it is I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stilted NYPD disaster","review":"What a waste of time! I haven't read Stella Cameron books and I never will again.

Eno and Byrne have no doubt had a huge influence on modern electronica, trip hop, trance, etc., and \\"Bush of Ghosts\\" is just one example of how far ahead of their time they really were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"Let me start off by saying that this record is not for everyone. It's a very unique recording consisting of lots electronic ambience courtsey of Mr. Brian Eno and many unique and intriguing sounds collected from around the world. These sounds range from radio show hosts to evangelist speakers to Arabic singers. All of these sounds are mixed to create sound collages that are quite funky. I enjoyed this album a great deal but not at first. This album needed time to grow on me and it might need time for you, too, so if you're looking for instant satisfaction this might not be the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sure...","review":"All of the other reviewers on this site gave this album rave reviews, and it seems to be one of the classics that is still readily available in stores.

To much of my surprise this game looked like a mini version of NHL on the Genesis. Everything about this game is wonderful. The players look and move great and the rink looks really slick. All the normal console hockey features from the EA franchise are included in the game like penalties, injuries, checking, lunging goalies, season play and penalty shots. Overall I think this is the best sports game on the GameBoy. THQ did a great job converting this game to a system with very limited horsepower. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing hockey video games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controls need help","review":"I have consistently purchased EA's NHL games since the debut on Genesis. When the GBC version came out, I had hope that it would translate fairly well. Games on GBC tend to be very simple and easy which leads to plenty of fun. Unfortunately, they tried to do too much for this game. The controls are extremely slow, the gameplay is very choppy (turn offsides off), and there are some unwelcome bugs and chop in the graphics. This game could have been done better for the GBC."},{"rating":"1","title":"gamer","review":"Players do not collide with each other, they pass right through each other. The speed boost sometimes shoots players three quarters the length of the ice. The player's are tinier than they needed to be. This is gameboy, don't be real, be fun. The player acceleration and deceleration is way too slow as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad, not great either","review":"being used to the PS version, perhaps i was expecting a bit more. still, there is much room for improvement here. players are annoyingly stupid in this version. they jump the blueline *all* the time or just take a nap in the offensive zone causing many offsides calls. also, pulling the goalie seems to work infrequently at best (my shootout mode doesn't work at all, so maybe i should be happy.) having the check and speedup buttons combined can be very frustrating - you try to check your man and end up flying past him down the ice. that all said, it still can be a pretty fun game. just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Balanced","review":"I was truly looking for a balanced book that would give me the best arguments of both sides (or even additional sides if there are any.)However, the essays used for equality were not nearly the best available.

I got more confused because what Forta was telling me to do didn't match with the program.After tearing out my hair for awhile, I found the problem: I had HomeSite 4.5 and Forta was writing about 4.0 and his book didn't show the changes, including exactly what I was trying to solve.In short, I had wasted my money.So be careful of the 4 in that title.

THe album made me laugh the first couple times that I heard it, but then just was plain out not funny and very annoying. Clever, yet insanely vulger and repetive. Stop with the bafoon! It's so annoying! Among the few really good ones are all of the beatings of school teachers/staff. That's about it. I took away a star for every reason that this album sholdn't be bought. 1. The never ending vulgarity is sickening. 2. REPEDITIVE! 3. The amount of tracks on this album. In other words, barrow it from a friend or something because this album isn't worth even $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely vulgar, wears on you after awhile","review":"In person, or on screen, I think Adam Sandler is one of the funniest, most gifted situation comics.

I still haven't listened to the entire CD because I know the last tracks are just more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandler","review":"Basically, all I wanted off this disc were two or three songs.

Sandler's humor is deliberately sophomoric, which is what really makes it fun and enjoyable for those of us who are fans. The first time I listened to it, I happened to be drinking a glass of milk. When \\"Toll Booth Willie\\" came on, it caught me off-guard and yes, you guessed it, made me laugh uncontrollably while also making the milk come out of my nose.Due to the language, it's not for young kids; but it's still a very funny CD regardless. Of course, you do have to have a sense of humor that appreciates Sandler's style. If you do, then you will certainly not be dissapointed. I'm glad I have it in my CD collection, and I recommend it highly for a quick laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny but loses it's fun after a week","review":"I found this cd extremly funny but only when i listened with friends.

Adam Sandler's \\"comedy\\" album \\"They're All Gonna Laugh At You\\" is a great example of why comedy seems to be dead; it should be obvious, but the definition of comedy is not: cuss words and bodily functions with no flexibility, punch lines, or commentary whatsoever. Much in the same vein as Sandler's other attempts at comedy albums, with poor results. The \\"jokes\\" consist of pure immaturity, and not in the perfected comic manner. For teenagers looking for a quick giggle only."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're All Gonna Want Their Money Back","review":"Fortunately, I got this so-called \\"comedy\\" album used, so Ican't complain to much about the rip-off. Who is Sandler tryingto amuse here? As an adult, I found this series of bits tobe pointless and more offensive than funny. Also, should anyoneunder 16 be listening to this nonsense? I like Sandler inmost of his movies and on SNL. By trying for shock comedy,I think he loses a lot of his likability. Some say this isSandler's funniest album.

The only sketch I felt was worth listening to on this CD was \\"Tollbooth Willie\\", but it more than made up for the rest of the sketches, which had too much of a far out sense of humor for my tastes. Not having heard Adam Sandler before, I have never laughed so hard in all my life. I rushed out to buy the CD, only to be disappointed by the rest of the sketches. Still, Tollbooth Willie does really outdo them all, and is worth the entire CD. Crude language, extreme obscenity, no holds barred and you will laugh the kind of laugh where no sound comes out. Well worth listening to - do it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The colliest most raddist c.d. ever.","review":"The cool thing about this C.D. is that it is awsome. It's funny and cool.

On the whole it's a nicer, better product, but I got a rude awakening when the new DST changeover in March took place. Using atomic time, the device did not advance one hour and stayed an hour behind. Fine, I thought; until April I will turn off the (\\"optional\\") atomic time and set the clock ahead 1 hour manually. When I went to sleep, all seemed OK - but I've been an hour late for work twice already because, in the wee hours of the morning, atomic time \\"auto-magically\\" gets turned on again (despite my turning it off) and the clock goes back 1 hour. As a result the alarm goes off 1 hour late, and I'm late again for work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go somewhere else","review":"I bought 5 of these for myself and my kids and grandma. None of the 5 have worked correct. but alas - since they were Christmas gifts, the 30 day send back policy has gone by the wayside.Unless you like to jump out of bed at 7 in the morning when it is really still only 3am, go somewhere else. would be alot easier to buy electronic stuff from a local store where you can walk back in with it for a refund. Amazon is good for books, but think twice before getting something prone to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews on Amazon first!","review":"This item is a complete failure. My wife and I live in Colorado, so the atomic clock signal shouldn't be a problem. However, even when setting the right time zone, the clock still changes time randomly. Also, when I shut off the atomic clock feature, it still attempts to contact the atomic clock on occasion and literally crashes the clock, that is, all the lights flash green and the clock ceases to work. At this point, a hard reset is required where the clock must be powered down for several hours. I'm going back to my $5 digital clock from Wal-Mart. At least it actually tells time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sporadically jumps ahead / back in time","review":"Stay away from the HoMedics SoundSpa Premier (SS-5000). Yikes. Several times I've woken up in the morning and thought, \\"That time can't be right.\\" And sure enough it's either jumped ahead or behind by some weird time increment (like :47 min). One time I had to catch a flight and set the clock for 4am. It woke me up :45 minutes early (thankfully not late) because it just changed time on it's own. Since then I've turned off the Atomic part of the clock so it wouldn't send out signals that could cause it to self-adjust, but this morning it did it again and I missed a meeting. I'm through with this. Very untrustworthy. I'll have to get something else now or I'll never have another decent night's sleep as I'll be worried if I'm going to miss the right time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I bought two of these units, one for me and one for my daughter. After two years, mine died. As my daughter never wanted to use the other one, I have gotten it back and put it up. It works just fine, also. I agree that the nighttime light is too bright, but my wife and I have gotten used to it. It makes a good night light. My wife gets out early, and she loves having the outside temp easily available. The atomic time works well here in Georgia. I have a Sharper Image atomic time battery operated alarm clock that we take traveling. Side by side, they both agree on the time to the second. I hope you keep making them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light's too bright!!! Snooze button is hard to find!!!","review":"I've had this clock for a while now and I still don't like it for many reasons. The snooze button was so hard to find at the beginning. After I don't know how many months I was finally able to hit it in the right place. If you are sensitive to light forget about getting this clock. There is not one setting that has a tolerable amount of brightness. The low/high settings for the back light are super bright and even the projection light is super bright for both my husband and myself. And as for the atomic time setting the other day the clock set itself back one hour and I ended up waking up an hour late. I was late to work!!! All in all you're better off with a regular alarm clock. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I loved the features of this alarm clock, but I give up.The first time I bought this clock the remote temperature sensor did not work consistently. It would not always transmit the temperature, even if it was a foot away from the clock. I returned it.The second time I bought it, the projector for the time and temperature was missing parts of the digits, so you cannot actually read either time or temp. This when the clock was brand new.DO NOT BUY THIS LOW QUALITY PIECE OF JUNK"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"Nice idea if it really worked. First, I stopped being able to change the time on the alarm. (Yes, I did have the alarm selected). Press the hour and minute buttons, nothing happens. What good is an alarm clock that you can't set?Then it started changing the regular time, spontaneously and unpredictably. I wake up and it's supposed to be 8 AM and when I look at another clock, it's 7 AM. One day, it jumped 4 hours ahead. It said 11 and it was really 7AM. The minutes changed too. Now it's also stuck on Daylight Savings Time so I can't use the atomic clock setting because it's always an hour ahead, not that I have any use for it because I can't change the alarm times. The outdoor temp only appears once in a while, never if it's raining or damp out. The time display is also very bright,much too bright to sleep with. Need I go on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the long haul","review":"I like Homedics clock radio alarms for the nature sounds. Invariably, though, it conks out in a year or less. On this one, the time zone button started flipping out, so when it's really 10:30 the clock shows 11:30, or 9:30 (this creates havoc when I set my alarm - I think it's 6:30am but it's really 7:30am because the freakin' time zone has changed again). Homedics, get your act together!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE","review":"I can't read the projected time or temperature because it isn't bright enough.Also the projection can't be pointed FORWARD in front of the clock so you would have to look BEHIND you to see it. Kinda a pain when you are in bed. Also the clock face is really bright so it acts like a night light right next to the bed. This is not a positive for me. I would not have bought it if I knew this but I didn't buy from Amazon so can't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of @#$%","review":"Iam now on my third one of these useless things.The first one never read outdoor temperature correctly.The second one did nothing right out of the box,and now the backlight display just quit on the third.As if that's not bad enough, I was just told that I am over my original warranty of 1 year,and that doesn't transfer to the replacement units.Good Riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money for a cheap product","review":"First off, the worst thing about it is that the Buzzer is linked to the main volume. So if you want nice soft nature sounds to fall asleep to, you can forget about the alarm waking you up. Also, don't believe the pictures. The backlight for the clock is not a nice solid one like you see on the box. Its some screen with little holes in it with a light behind it. The whole thing feels cheap too. The Nature sounds do sound ok though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great feature set - if yours works!","review":"Loved the feature set, but I had two that ultimately died on me within 2 weeks (LEDs flashed and the digital display was stuck on 88:88).

Top it off that the soundeffects were disturbed by a horrible background buzz. One had to turn the sound up loud for the soundspa tracks to stand out over the noise. NOT relaxing! I have had bad luck with the three other HoMedics products I have received as gifts, including the hand massager, massage pad for office chair, and foot spa. Ok, so my wife and I are into cush, but hey, it is just not there in any of the HoMedics products. Don't buy ANYTHING from HoMedics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This clock would be a great item if it worked properly. I purchased this clock in Sept. and loved the features! The lowest setting on the radio and sounds was way too loud but I loved the other features and accepted the problem. It worked fine until November. The clock automatically goes back one hour every day so I have to keep checking the time. When it goes back one hour at night, of course the alarm goes off one hour LATER than it should. The atomic clock does not work anymore. HoMedics customer service recommended that I set the clock ahead two hours every day so that it would be correct time. But NO!, the clock goes back TWO hours so it is still wrong. Should I have to reset the clock everyday and always double check the time on a $49 item???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst alarm clock ever!","review":"The main reason I got this clock is for the automatic updating and the outside temp sensor. Ever since daylight savings time took effect a few months ago it hasn't been right. Will appear correct before bed then you go to wake up and it has changed through the night!! Arrr. Outside temp sensor doesn't work when it gets below about 40 degrees. If the sun shines on it, it will read 90 when its only 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atomic time feature very frustrating","review":"The atomic feature on this clock is very frustrating. And, no, it is not because of the time zone. The clock will be off by weird amounts. 43 minutes, 22 minutes, etc....I have tried to turn off the atomic feature, but to no avail.Right now I am searching for a new alarm clock because I have had it with this one. I would rather reset the clock if I lose power rather than have sporadic time problems.Too bad, because I really like the nature sounds. No noticeable loops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it's a waste","review":"A terrible product with a high price. The illuminate setting casts a way too bright glare from the LCD screen, great for a night light if your afraid of the dark. During the first day in use the nature sounds would suddenly turn on by itself and then the time would change to an incorrect time. I believe the Atomic Time feature caused this but after I switched this feature off it would turn back on again. I will be returning this garbage after only two days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it!","review":"There are two problems I have with this clock.The first one that bothered me was the fact that when you set a volume for the \\"white noise\\" feature at night, it uses that volume for the wake up alarm. Sorry, but I would like low volume at night for the white noise, but an increasing at least volume in the morning. This uses your night time setting for both. How stupid is that?Also, this clock did not reset for Daylight Saving Time, but is seems to set an hour ahead or behind all year long, at random.DO NOT COUNT ON THIS CLOCK IF YOU NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE ON TIME!Too bad. The indoor and outdoor temp feature seems to work, if you DO NOT CARE WHAT TIME IT IS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as happy as I thought I would be","review":"First, I love the nature sounds! They are realistic, soothing and with no noticable repeat. The ceiling projection is great also.I am disappointed that you cannot adjust the volume down below a certain level. It makes the radio too loud to use to fall asleep by.I also had problems with the time changing randomly. I solved that problem by turning off the atomic clock sensor, but that was part of the reason I bought this clock.I probably could have bought a different Homedics projection clock but this was the only one with dual alarms."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUALITY BAD DON'T BUY","review":"THE FIRST ONE WE BOUGHT THE PROJECTION TIME DID NOT WORK, & THERE WAS NO NUMBERS ON THE RADIO DIAL.

WENT BACK TO USING OUR OLD SONY."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had purchased a different item","review":"I have the same problem one reviewer mentioned -- the clock seems to reset itself by one hour, from time to time with no apparent reason. I didn't realize this until I got up one hour late one morning! And, as another reviewer mentioned, it's very bright. We turned the light off and use only the projection feature.We needed the two alarm feature, but it's not easy to set. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard, but we still seem to have problems with it. Sometimes we think it's on, but it's not. None of this is really a good situation if you need the alarm clock to wake you up at a certain time in the morning. We've started setting a travel alarm as a back-up.On the brighter side, the temperature feature is nice and the radio reception is fairly clear. Those aren't the most important things I am looking for in a clock radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Features but keeps the spouse awake","review":"This clock radio has nearly every feature I was hoping for. While all the features work as described, both the projection light and the basic light for the regular clock are way too bright. The regular clock light is adjustable, but even the lowest setting is too bright. The projection light is so bright that my spouse make me keep the it in the \\"on demand\\" mode. (I roll over, punch the snooze button to get a quick ceiling projection of the time/temp) However, with that much effort, I'll probably just go back to using my old clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons, buttons who has the buttons.","review":"This clock has the finest example of technology gone wild. First, I wanted a projection clock that gave me indoor tempature and projected on the ceiling along with the time. Not this projection clock=it was on the face of the clock. Second the projection arm was in the back of the clock, not along side where I could point the projection where I wanted it. This little baby has forward motion blocked by the body of the clock radio. Finally, the number of buttons that controlled the clock and the number of options for sweet sounds of nature was overwhelming. I tried to set an alarm and that failed for some reason=wrong button, moon not in proper alignment with the stars-who knows. Overall, this product was a bust and I returned it. However, I am still trying to get my shipping costs back since the problem was not mine since the marketing implied that it has a projection of the indoor tempeture, which it did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst clock ever","review":"Worst problem: changes time, even with the satellite update option turned off. A clock that makes you think it's an hour earlier that it really is can really screw up a person's life! I've tried numerous times to fix this issue, assuming that the clock is resetting itself but not to daylight savings time. I've turned off the satellite feature but the problem still occurs. For this reason, I threw it away rather than donate it. No one needs a clock like this.Other issues: the buttons are too tiny to use if you are actually going to use this as an alarm clock. The ceiling display did become more difficult to read over time. The outside thermometer never worked from day one. Tried numerous ways to fix this with no luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty clock with limited useful life","review":"At first I really liked this clock, it has a great range of nature sounds & you can control the volume of each.However, the backlight is crazy bright on either setting. I'm a light sleeper and would not recommend this alarm if you like to check the time at night. Even the alarm active light which is pretty small is bright, I had to turn it away from me at night.The temperature indoor setting worked, but the outdoor worked for a couple of monthes and then died...granted I live in Maine and the temps get pretty low, but still.The time setting buttons never worked very well, and now have lost all practical use. No matter how hard or frequently you push them, they won't change the time/alarm. I'm chucking this sucker after two years of unsatisfactory use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This clock is difficult to use.","review":"I never write reviews but I had to weigh in on this one. Yowza this clock is wonky. It's difficult to program. It sometimes resets itself - and, no, not on the hour as advertised. Mysteriously it will turn off. I had to plead with the projector to get it to work. The alarms go off randomly even though I had them set for morning (4 a.m.) they go off at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. at night. I love the idea of this clock. The rainforest sounds are great. However, the execution sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"Nice clock, but very poor design. The buttons to set the time are right in front and cannot be locked out, so if you pick up the clock, it will change the time. Setting the alarm is problematic also as it uses the same buttons and the timer for the alarm set ends too soon. The result is that you end up changing the clock time instead of the alarm time.I also experienced the clock randomly changing the time. These changes were usually several hours different than actual time, glad my wife has another clock that works. Did like the indoor/outdoor temp, but the projector was weak and really not worth it.I would not recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I purchased this at Big Lots.

She teaches things like sitting (when asked/told), stopping when prompted, in a very fun manner. It really gets kids moving too.

The model makes asking the questions about what has or has not been done and who should do it a whole lot easier. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to better understand what must be in place for people to perform well and how to enroll management in the process of making it happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great!!!","review":"This is a great book.

It could have had a few more pictures, and I was expecting detailed explanations on how to configure all features of a router.

But if you're just getting started, it will probably help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time and Money","review":"I have never been more disappointed with a computer and networking book than this one. I learned absolutely nothing. This book is oriented towards the total novice. If you have any experience at all with computers then this book is not for you. The book assumes there are only two operating systems: Windows 98SE and Windows XP. Windows 2000 is mentioned a couple of times in passing. This book is oriented to those who believe that Windows 98SE and Windows XP are the only operating systems available. There was no discussion of Macintosh, no discussion of Linux, no discussion of UNIX. If I'd had an opportunity to skim this book before purchasing it I would have left it on the shelf. The text was highly repetitive. All of the information in this book *should* have been included for free with the Linksys documentation. As it was, all of the information in the book *is* available for free with the Windows help and LInksys documentation. I feel scammed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linksys Networks: The Official Guide","review":"Incomplete and overly simplistic.

I have several computers on a wireless network with a wireless G router, all running Windows 2000 flawlessly. I need to add a couple more older computers with windows 98 on them and bought the cheaper wireless b cards for them. This book told me NOTHING on dealing with a windows 2000 operating system, and did not help in the least to fix my problems getting the other computers to work. If you have windows XP this is probably a good book, but then windows XPs interfaces are self explainatory anyway. In my opinion do not buy this book if you have windows 2000 or windows 98."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety Book - very good","review":"This book is excellent.

Those with casual interest need not apply.","review":"I played this game years ago because I was a fan of the comic books. It certainly did not stand the test of time. Only the most hardcore of Danger Girl fans should consider picking it up as it has little going for it. Clunky controls, barely passable graphics, and occasional adult humor do not a good game make.The cover artwork is great, though. J. Scott Campbell is an incredible artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating, Plain Frustrating!","review":"This entire game and gameplay is nearly worthless. The camera angles, control and character movement are all entirely awkward. Additionally, the game has only save points after you complete the level. Generally, that would be somewhat excusable as in Eidos' Fear Effect for its difficulty, but this game isn't even difficult per se: just that your characters are very clumsy and move like tanks. There are few things in this game that actually bring the game from receiving a negative (as in below 1 star and below 0 star rating). First, the cover art is absolutely spectacular and the art inside is absolutely great. Second, the soundtrack within the game is excellent. Lastly, the inclusion of the Danger Girls is great! However, do not buy this game for the gameplay! You will be disappointed and annoyed. Just buy it for the game manual for the art on top and within, and the beautiful CD design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor woman's Syphon Filter/Tomb Raider","review":"Another example of a great idea that was poorly executed.

Their music varies from a range of energetic and infectious ska to relativly light punk rock, and could be compared to the likes of less than jake (in the sense of lots of horns and catchy rythms) and catch 22 (with their fast lyrics and riff's). My top three songs on the album would have to be (although it is a close call) Rick loves jo, which has to be one of the most inspiring songs to skank to ever! Creep, dunno why i just love it, and Bradley.This is a brilliantly rounded punk and ska album well worth the purchase of any dedicated ska fan, or any person who enoys seeking the talent of relatively small bands.Do not let this opportunity to purchase what WILL be a long time favourite in anyones collection pass you by, i cannot stress how good this album is, all i can say is \\"keep dancing\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cities of the World series are CRAP!","review":"Venice is the second of this series that I have seen (the other being Santorini), both leaving me very unimpressed and I could not wait for this particular DVD to finish. While this DVD covers most of the main attractions of Venice, the videography is second rate and does not instil any excitement or romance that is otherwise associated with a visit to Venice. The commentary is monotonal, too fast, snd at times random images not relevant to the topic being discussed are viewed.If you are looking for a DVD on Venice I would recommend Miraculous Canals of Venice. It was much more informative and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Preaching and Not Enough Facts From the Author","review":"The book was an unbalanced read. The section about how Bobby Williams got the job was very interesting. However, the part of the book after Williams was fired was spinned. There is more to keeping a college head coaching job than wins and losses, and Williams had a losing record his last year. At no point were attendance or donations mentioned, which is key to a head coach's popularity. If he had interviewed the president and the athletic director and had more information about their perception of the job Williams had done, the book would have had more credibility. When there are firings, they are not always right. However, as in the case of Williams, there were incidents that triggered it. The book would have been better if it had fewer pages and focus more on Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"More enthusiasm than scholarship","review":"The author lumps several un-related spiritual paths incorrectly under the \\"Neo-Pagan\\" umbrella.\\"Neo-Pagan\\" refers to a group of revival-religions, and specifically does NOT include such religions as Hinduism & Budhism, which far pre-date Christianity.

It engages the reader with a rigorous theological discussion which is thought provoking yet mentally taxing. At times he lapses into hair-splitting minutae in examining theological issues, and the result is what the author himself admitted was a \\"sometimes tortuous argument\\". However, I would still recommend this one to anyone who wants to go right after the meat of Alan Watts' theology, or for those who wish read stuff from his earlier Christian stage as opposed to his later works, when he dealt almost exclusively with Eastern religion. Before you read this one, I would strongly suggest you read _Behold the Spirit_, which is more readable but just as profound as _The Supreme Identity_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very reflective and very easy to work with","review":"I was trying to use this in a small light box hoping that it would help distribute the light more evenly.

The writing style is not admirable, the vocabulary limited and some run-on story elements. But still I liked it.Even with that The Pretty Committee and Claire make a good story. I do not believe, however, that there is not one other, not exactly fashion foward, kid in school. There are always ALWAYS people who put green and yellow together. Its just human nature. Also, the nurse would never EVER if she valued her job lend out clothing from the lost and found. And um, who would wear it? I liked the second book better than the first.

Knowing how close to the break up of Uncle Tupelo this recording happened makes listening to it even more bitter sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highwater mark of country-rock.","review":"A lot's been said about Uncle Tupelo's influence on the country-rock, or \\"No Depression,\\" movement. The band's swan song, \\"Anodyne,\\" illustrates why they deserve the hype. It's by far the band's most accomplished and consistent album, despite the fact they were on the verge of breaking up. You'd be hard-pressed to find a band that could handle traditional country (\\"Acuff-Rose,\\" \\"Slate,\\" the title track) to blistering rock (\\"Chickamauga,\\" \\"The Long Cut\\"). It's a masterwork by one of the 1990s' most important bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worn the grooves off this one","review":"As a musician, this disc is truely outstanding. There's no bubblegum of pop, just plain good music. The best I can explain it is the old \\"high lonesome sound\\" of Bill Monroe, except Bill didn't record in the medium of distorted guitar. The fiddle work, the throatcatching vocals, the solo plucking. It's just airy enough, just dense enough. This, and \\"no depression\\", make a masterwork that these musicians have never topped in all their further incarnations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of the 90s alt-country movement","review":"Anodyne catches Uncle Tupelo at their zenith. At that moment when a band realizes their potential just before the wheels come off. Each of these songs have much too offer. \\"Acuff-Rose\\", \\"We've Been Had\\", the Doug Sahm cover \\"Give Back the Key to My Heart\\" are the highlights of a cd full of gems. Buy this record, turn it to 11, pour a glass of bourbon of your choice, and become a part of the greatest American alt-country band doing what they do best."},{"rating":"2","title":"did someone say \\"overrated\\"?","review":"don't get me wrong: this is a fairly impressive record, and \\"slate\\" is one of the greatest songs i've ever heard in my life, but overall it's turned out to be something of a letdown for me. i prefer the peter buck produced release that proceeded this one -- it sounds more raw, immediate, and honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warm up for Son Volt and Wilco","review":"After two masterpiece albums (\\"Still Feel Gone,\\" and \\"March 16-20, 1992\\"), Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy recorded their last album together. Present are the blueprints for the course they would (at least initially) follow after the break up of the band in Son Volt and Wilco, respectively. This is a good solid country rock album that lacks any truly stand out songs. The best track is \\"Give Back the Keys to My Heart,\\" which is a cover song. Overall, worth a listen (or two)."},{"rating":"1","title":"got to be kidding","review":"I read one user review of this that said \\" Give me back the keys to my heart\\" was a good song with good lyrics.

I feel a bit disrespectful to the author's late friend who this book is a kind of tribute too, but it is really laughable. Unsophisticated jokes (\\"I tried to take a picture of Melissa holding a can of \\"Bimbo\\" / \\"what are you trying to imply?\\" she asked?\\" - how old is this man?), a lot of unnecessary drug references, and cringy lines like Melissa's \\"the sea looks quiet after a kill\\",...This is such a shame as the book contains many very interesting bits of factual and historical information about South America.

What a got was an amateurishly produced video with annoying music that teaches 8 signs badly. There is a supposedly parents guide at the end where I thought perhaps they would teach me the signs I was looking for -- yes, 4 more signs -- poorly presented so they are nearly impossible to pick up! Here's what you might learn from this video: bear, flower, milk, cookie, book, dance; Here's what's not taught: water, hungry, sleepy, poopy -- plus add your own vast list. I was most upset that more attempt was not made to present these signs in \\"instructor\\" format for the parents' benefit, and one would expect to learn more than 12 signs.The comments of other buyer-reviewers were a big part of why I bought this video; with all those 5-star reviews I seriously question their relationship to the producers of this tape. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Do Better.","review":"This video is disappointing. Offering only 10 signs, anadorable girl of about 3 or 4 signs each of (only) 10 signs. After she quickly and imprecisely shows the sign several times, a puppet takes over and performs a slow, little skit that demonstrates the object of the sign in some way. He puts a ball through a hoop for the word \\"ball,\\" for instance. The actions of the puppet do not reinforce the sign, which isn't repeated, and only distracts the viewer from the sign the action illustrates.

This viedo shows poor versions of only a FEW signs, and while they SHOW and SAY the word, they only sign it once or twice, and poorly done. They verbally repeat the word many times, but fail to SHOW the sign as often! They waste a LOT of time showing kids (the producer's ?)doing things, with nothing but music with it.I would much prefer to reccomend \\"Talking Hands\\" or Joseph Garcia's kit \\"Sign with your Baby\\", or \\"Sign Me a Story\\", or even \\"Baby See and Sign\\" (not the best, though).While my 22 mo. daughter loved it, it was NOT doing much to teach her to SIGN, which is why I bought it. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a lower rating if I could","review":"A waste of money...puppets are cute for kids, but they don't sign very well...I could hardly make out the signs I was supposed to be learning. Children signing is great for kids to relate to, but it was really hard to figure out what the proper sign was supposed to be. I don't think my child learned anything from watching it. I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone unless of course you've got money to burn in which case I'll send you my copy for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...","review":"I think that this tape was okay.

Only 10 signs. I see it as a good \\"first exposure\\" video to interest the youngest of children in signing. I did find it hard to tell exactly what the child in it is trying to sign? I'd call this one \\"entertainment\\", with little substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to start!","review":"This is an excellent video to start off with if you are interested in teaching your toddler sign language. The only recommendation that I would have is to make the video a little bit longer. My son watches it over and over and over. It teaches a few basic signs with demonstrations and creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but alittle disappointing","review":"My daughter and I have learned some signing in our playgroup classes with children nursery songs. After a while I realized she was actually using the signs to describe what she was seeing or just to tell me what song she wanted to sing. I was hoping this video would also be put together in a fun, entertaining way to continue teaching my daughter and new infant. Unfortunately it was much too basic with only a few words taught and about 15 minutes long. This could have been drafted into a few paged of a softcover booklet and been used more of reference guide for the parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea, but cheap production. Rather disappointing","review":"I think signing with your infant is a great idea, but this tape didn't teach many signs and it isn't very well made. I think some of the other tapes out there are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT COVER, LAME CONTENT","review":"Impressive cover. Too bad that's it. The biggest dissapointment is there are only 10 signs TOTAL. Another bummer is that a child presents them and I can't tell what she is doing in about half the signs! Plus, it looks like a bad attempt at copying the puppetry and skits of the Baby Einstein series. Even the puppet is the same maker. I bet Disney's lawyers would eat this up!Do NOT be taken in by a pretty cover and calculated reviews! It cerntainly won't teach signing, but will teach my sons to pour objects over their heads and(or someone else's), just like every puppet skit in it. NOT a behavior I'd like to reinforce! It's low-budget, home-camera quality with a song that's so high-pitched I found myself clenching my teeth, certianly doesn't help. Spend your money elsewhere, I'm sorry I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this for your autistic child!!","review":"This program was done in a sort of \\"Baby Einstein\\" format. The great part is that the signs are done by very young children. Kids learn from copying other kids, and my daughter picked up these signs almost immediately. Parents should be there to reinforce the sign taught on tape with a live object. Example: when the word telephone is taught, show your kid a toy or real telephone. When hat is taught, bring out the dress up hats. I would give this video ten stars if I could. I only wish that there were more like it on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids love it","review":"My wife and I are very pleased with our purchase and have recommended the video to other friends and famiy members.

Tame by today's standards, this little known vehicle for Sean Connery is an intelligently plotted and tense little thriller. Connery plays the no-nonsense head of Norway's Security, called in when a group of British terrorists invade the home of the British Ambassador and hold him hostage, demanding release of imprisoned compatriates and safe passage out of Norway. These plans go awry however when the British government discovers the drop point and the terrorists are forced to make a change in plans. This change is orchestrated by a fellow terrorist, played with subdued relish by DEADWOOD's Ian McShane, who holds a commercial airline and its passengers hostage until the other group is released.As in most British films of the seventies, the pace is deliberate but there is a good amount of suspense generated, and Connery is effective in his role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"I have just finished reading \\"Spartans\\" and I must say that I enjoyed the book, it told me a lot about the Spartans that I did not know.

Paul Cartledge deserves our utmost praise for his compelling insight on one of history's most fascinating cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven, but worthwhile","review":"This book is really three books in one: a sociological study of Spartan life, a collection of biographies of prominent Spartans, and a standard chronological history of Sparta. The first two are excellent; the third is disjointed and rather poorly written. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Spartan institutions and how they evolved over time. This, I believe, is the best part of the book. Especially interesting is Cartledge's account of the place of Spartan women in the culture. The mini-biographies of personages such as Demaratus, Brasidas, Lysander, and Gorgo were also informative and engaging. Unfortunately, the chronological history bogs down, jumps around, and generally suffers from a lack of focus and continuity. All in all, however, this book is still well worth reading. My advice is simply to scan or skip entirely the portions that drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"High marks for expertise, low ones for writing ability","review":"This book reads like a graduate student's thesis. While it is quite informative, it is anything but a pleasure to read. When compared with Keegan's recent work on the Pelopenesian war (as it was paired when I purchased it) this failing becomes even more apparent. Whereas Keegan's prose engrosses the reader and facilitates the digestion of uncountable greek names, Cartledge's prose is choppy, repetitive and serves to motivate the reader to put down his book and look for something more pleasant to read. The use of the distnict biographical vignettes made this an incredibly choppy read.While the book claimed to assess the role of the idea of Sparta throughout history and its impact on our modern day society, it focused entirely on ancient history. While interesting, it wasn't what was promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Phalanx of Information","review":"Sometimes this book seemed as wide as Texas and just as dry. I love ancient Greek history, and in particular the peculiar culture of Sparta, but after so many pages I was just ready to fall on my sword from the boredom of pages interspersed with sporadic paragraphs of interest. Nothing shielded me from the weight of mind-numbing information that I desperately wanted to find interesting.Judging by all the five stars for this book, I can only conclude that I lack the intellectual depth for this, and I should cry in my helmet.For this book, I would do something a Spartan would never do--surrender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-linear structure","review":"I had very little knowledge of Ancient Greece when I began reading this book. Unfortunately, I am still ignorant afterward. I gamely read through the introduction and two chapters of the book before realizing that I was retaining very little new information. The author throws names and dates around without providing a clear structure for understanding them. For example, he may mention three different people in two different centuries within one sentence, but he fails to explain who those people are or why he is writing about them. I finally decided that the book was wasting my time and put it down into the \\"recycle\\" pile.What I expected was a succinctly written primer on the history of the Spartan people. What I received was a jumble of names and dates that resembles nothing more than a rambling discourse.

There is much to savor on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"toooooo much narration!","review":"I have enjoyed several Cities of the World travel DVDs distributed by Travel Video Store prior to this one and Egypt. While the photography remains quite good and the sites presented well balanced, in both these the narrator seems to think more is better. In both the narration is a rapid-fire sing-song delivery which to me and my wife quickly detracts from the enjoyment of the video. Reducing the narrative to one half or preferably one third of what is given would allow a more measured pleasant delivery and avoid the relentless drone with which the viewer is barraged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good Wrestling book.","review":"I bought this book recently for cheap on Ebay. I had heard it wasn't a very good read, but I like to judge things for myself. Well, what I heard was pretty accurate. Chyna mostly talks about her bad parents and how she got screwed over time and time again, jumping from one mistake to the next. She never really places any blame on herself for her bad fortune.Anyway, being a wrestling book, there is really little talk of wrestling. She talks more about competing in fitness contests than wrestling, but when she does talk wrestling its mostly about training with Killer Kowalski (she seems bitter toward him too), her \\"good housekeeping\\" match with Jeff Jarrett, and getting hired by the WWF because of Triple H and \\"Sean\\" Micheals.It just isn't a good read. She jumps around a LOT and instead of talking about more interesting things like almost working for the FBI and secret service, all she wants to do is go on bitter rants about how much she got screwed over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Wrestling Book.

She comes across as being dumb as a box of rocks. Bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost In The Machine","review":"When Mick Foley wrote about the ridiculous pitfalls of having a ghost writer initially ruin his life's story in the early stages of what became his self-penned, runaway best-seller, Have a Nice Day!, it should have been a warning for at least slightly more artistic control by others when their stories would be chronicled in the ongoing WWF/WWE series.In this autobiography of Joanie Laurer and her character, Chyna, it sometimes packs a punch, but is weighted down by writer Michael Angeli, who seems to feel that her story of a tragic childhood and struggles to claw to the top in the wrestling industry requires sophomoric jokes and ridiculous imagery.Sadly, what is a powerful story cannot ultimately rise from the crass overproduction; like so many storylines in the professional wrestling according to Vince McMahon. This is an outstanding example of the series at its most over-the-top, which means it is never had a ghost of a chance to be a successful autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Joanie. See her ego grow. Grow, ego, grow!","review":"After reading this highly cynical, extremely patronizing piece of self-worship, I can now see why \\"swelled head\\" was the most popular reason given for the \\"Wrestler\\" Formerly Known As Chyna parting ways with the World Wrestling Federation. Ms Laurer tries her best to build herself up as a tragic figure, but comes across more often than not as a bored brat with nothing but disrespect for anything and anyone feminine. If you want a solid wrestler autobiography, I would highly recommend either Mick Foley's \\"new classic\\" Have A Nice Day, or independent wrestler Mike Quackenbush's Headquarters. However, if you tend to see the glass as neither half-empty or half-full, but rather \\"Hey, why hasn't that b**** come by to refill my glass?\\" then If They Only Knew would be your cup of tea. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"After hearing so much hype about Chyna's book I finally got the chance to read it, & boy was I disasppointed. ... Where Mick Foley's book made you feel good about being a wrestling fan, Chyna's had the opposite effect on me. I wonder if she actually enjoys the sport herself as she comes across very bitter and resentful. Do we really need to hear on ever second page about how lousy her parents were? Ok, she had a rough life. So do lots of other people. But she seems to be very negative about everything. And I'm no prude but the language in this book was way too rough, especially as she has a lot of young kids who idolise her. I've read a lot of books by wrestlers and they are more upbeat and interesting to read than Chyna's. She seems to put down everyone who had a hand in her success and thinks she's god's gift to wrestling. Even Dynamite's book had a more positive message than this one. I felt like I had to go wash my hands after putting this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, beautiful, but ....","review":"I have always been a fan of Chyna the wrestler, and found her to be a talented and beautiful performer. Listening and reading unscripted interviews with Ms. Laurer has proved to me she's far more than just a pretty face or big muscles.Unfortunately, this \\"autobiography\\" does her no favors. She comes across as a petty, resentful woman, filled with contempt for other people. Yes, she's risen above a tough early start, and still has a lot of justified anger toward her parents and other people who've stepped on her, but she doesn't show how she's transcended it.The book itself is very poorly written, with too much unnecessary profanity and as many tangents as spokes on a bicycle wheel. It's also filled with comparsions and similies that the real Joanie Laurer would never use.I don't like ripping this book too much, because I feel for Ms. Laurer and like Chyna, but it's a bad book, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chyna","review":"This was an ok book, if you like to read about peoples lives.

It is still working fine, and I've had no trouble with it. It does not seem at all flimsy as some have reported. My one complaint is that the speakers do not stay in the helmet well.

After you do this about 10 times, it starts to short out and you have to duct tape it or replace it.If you have one of these, just be gentle and don't tug it out of your helmet by the wire. Instead, lift the earpiece out by the metal microphone stalk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"I instruct students in high speed racetrack events and have used the PMC-2 sets for years. With a dozen events a year, and multiple students in each event, these don't last very long without breaking. The unit gets banged up in the students car and typically lasts only a year or so. But the biggest problem is the wires to the headsets at the earpeice. I'll second the earlier review: tell your students not to pull them out by the wire - take off the helmet and let the headset fall out on it's own. Nady needs to make the wires more robust. I go thru about 2 sets of headsets a year due to this issue.There isn't a lot of choice in these units, the PMC-2 is by far the most cost effective solution on the market.Also, sidenote, if you are a student in this type of event and your instructor doesn't have one of these or something similar, you don't have a good instructor. The organizing group should make these a requirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor device","review":"I should have paid more attention to some of the other negative reviews (although I am happy this seems to work for some reviewers).

When explaining one model he starts talking about another models..from 30 years ago...and then he throws in comments about Ferrari's? He jumps from one time period to another. He is all over the place. The guy has ADD or something.I'm sure once you get all the different models down (from another book, of course) this book will give you lots of insight.

You can't go wrong with these oldies.If you can't find an appetizer among these pages you are in trouble. There is a type of soup for everyone. You won't have to go to Red Lobster for seafood, you'll find something here to your taste. Bored with meat? Cutting back on the carbs? Look for several vegetable dishes to substitute at suppertime or try one of the many salads that are listed.There are plenty of sauces, quickbreads, yeast breads and desserts for those of you with a sweet tooth.

This book has been written almost 5 years ago and some of the perspective are quite outdated since competition for admission is now even harder and Admission offices have changed some of their requirements. Second, this book has been written by someone who has never completed an MBA dossier. While reading it, I have missed a lot of insights that will probably make the difference in the application process. Anyway, good luck to all of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average book","review":"I bought \\"how to get into top MBA\\" before applying to HBS, Wharton, Columbia, Kellogg and Dartmouth.

I found excellent advice in the book and I consider it as the best review in the subject I have read (and beleive me I read a lot...).Finally, when I wrote my essays, I found extremely useful the last section of the book, where you could find several examples of essays from people from the most diverse backgrounds.I have been recently admitted in two fine MBA program in the U.S. and I think that this guide helped me to get started and to know better how to approach the essays. I think though, that the book is just a start and a support for the process. Don't think that the book is going to do the job for you!If you are serious about seeking an MBA and you would like to hear an opinion on the process from some other than your friends, you MUST buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent with few reservations","review":"This book is excellent. It helps you from square one. It gives you worksheets to help you get your plan of attack together. Very insightful and detailed. My copy is completely tatered! My only reservation about this book is it didn't cover enough of the schools and the essays chosen were from people who seemed to have exceptional experience - or maybe that's the point! Still, I don't work on my essays without referring to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent survey of Myth but placement of Atlantis Wrong.","review":"Hope writes knowingly on the nature of Atlantis and Atlanteans and ofthe world-wide myths that survived the Golden Age.

I figured 1. Cuban cigars were really the only \\"true good\\" cigars to be had, 2. The more money they cost the better they were going to be. Thanks to this book I found my self to be way off basis and on my 2nd bottle of scotch.. This explians a lot from history of the \\"seed\\" to how they are rolled. It explians the lingo of the cigar world and the types of filler and binders and the differant climate grown. It also helps with with what kind of tabacco taste due to the climate it is grown.If your new to the cigar world this book will open the door for you. It is a good start even though the brand names are not up to date.

These things are so unreliable that it feels like a bad joke. They might work ok for a few days in a row and then, out of the blue, they will simply stop working altogether or will begin to misbehave, for example, the mouse becomes unresponsive or the keyboard starts missing keypresses. Then you change batteries (which, btw, do not last very long), reset the system, and pray to the remote gods.... and, tough luck, they continue to not work properly. You give up and go do something else, come back, and if it is your lucky day, it will start working again. If you are unlucky (I am!), forget it and come back tomorrow.To compound the issue, their customer service is completely unresponsive.

The story encompasses the beauty of Angola coupled with the tragedy of its history and the complex relationship of the Portuguese on the land. It is superbly written.

They are both great books that tells you about every single move played.Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors contains up to date opening analysis within the games and is very good for showing how important tactical themes and attacks are developed from the beginning of the game. Using complete games showing how things happen from the start is the best way to learn to play all parts of the game - learning the greatest number of themes possible.This book uses a clear writing style allowing for easy comprehension for students of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre book by a convict","review":"First, I have read most of the unrevised version. It is an OK chess book. However, there are many better books available. Chernev's Logical Chess move by move and McDonald's Art of Planning in Chess are both clearly superior. Your time would be better served with these books.The main reason for this review is Snyder is a criminal who has been prosecuted and convicted of molesting children. He has a long, terrible history. Some players I know have told me some details. His criminal record is public. So he is not the type of author you should support. Especially as not one of his books are essential for any player.

You will learn just what the author knows you need to learn once completeting CHESS FOR JUNIORS (well, if you know the basics well, then you can skip CHESS FOR JUNIORS and jump right into this book).-->I might also suggest that you get WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS in this series, which provides an explanded opening system, intermediate level tactics and endgames and lots of information on how to improve and prepare for tournaments.ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just read it - it taught me alot","review":"I just finished reading UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS and after reading a dozon other books at the intermediate level and even Chernev's Logical Chess, I found UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS to be great.In fact I found the author's world class correspondence games to be better than some of the world champions games in the book. The author has a deep understanding of just how students think and knows how to explain things well.Why is the one of the top selling chess books? The quality and word of mouth does the job!Want to improve your tactics, middlegame and opening? No better book around. Though, the few endgames are excellent, it is very understandable that when you must comment on every move, the idea behind this book, you cannot have a lot of really long games (some reviewers need to figure this out)."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU WILL LEARN A LOT!!!!

The quality will not be found in any other book. If you are an adult, like myself who is considering get a book on chess for your kid who know show to play, but who wants to grow in chess, then look no further (if you are looking at the book yourself as an adult to grow in chess also look no further - JUNIORS! - well this is a book not just for kids).Of all the \\"COMMENT ON EVERY MOVE\\" books this is the best first one to start out with!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great games/Great Analysis/Great Instruction","review":"UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS is my favorite chess book.

It is done in a way that you can understand what is going on. I have read other books that are not as good as this one. It is true as pointed out by one reviewer that some of the games are played by the author, but these are great games and very instructive. I found UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS be better than LOGICAL CHESS, MOVE BY MOVE (which is a good book too) that also gives explanation of every move. There is a good reason why UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS is ranked as the number two best seller on amazon.com (only behind the same author's other book) - this is a fantastic book to learn from - at least from a 12 year old point of view!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twenty Quality Lessons using Games as the Format","review":"This is a wonderful book! Twenty games have been turned into lessons with all of the moves analyzed.

However, the games themselves are interesting.As I have read in some of the other reviews, and fully agree, there is an exceptional insight into covering the aspects of chess that an intermediate chess player needs to know.In \\"Chess For Juniors\\" the author provided two games forming the basis for the 24 more games found in \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons For Juniors\\" (following this book is \\"More Unbeatable Chess For Juniors\\").I also recommend this author's \\"Winning Chess Tournaments For Juniors\\" for an intermediate player.A great book that will help any intermediate player grasp many important concepts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book because..............","review":"This is why I like \\"UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS\\" because,One - It is easy to understand for a person in fifth grade,Two - It is lots and lots of stuff and things and is not short,Three - The person who wrote it knows how to teach and knows what he is talking about,Four - The games are interesting and the same things happen that happen in the games I play.Five - I can learn my openings good from it,Six - I can learn tactics and where the traps are,Seven - I haven't got it yet but there is a second book to continue from this one,Eight - and I like when it asks you to find the best move that make me think to learn.If you are a kid in elementary school, middle school, high school (or like my mom or dad who is not a super master) then get the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prompt arrival and good condition","review":"Book was in good shape and the book arrived in a timely manner.

It shows struggle, ignorance, foolishness and intelligence all in one film. With a long line of talented actors Spike Lee amazingly gets his message across in a beautiful yet unorthodox way. In fact the entire movie is unconventional but this is probably why it's so exciting and fun.If I were you I would definitely buy this movie. It is a little culturally bias in that it is not really geared for Caucasian people to understand.

Oddly enough, Alpha also slaps their watermarked logo onto the screen in the lower right hand or upper right hand corner from time to time....as if anyone would want to steal and re-sell these rotten transfers!As I said, this is Alpha's reputation. However, when I found this in a used store for a couple of bucks, I thought it was worth it to give it a shot. I had only seen the later revival series (early '70's?), and was really curious. It was a real throwback, as far as the content was concerned.

This happened a few times until now it won't sync up with the satellite at all and I can't manually set the clock because it loses my setting when it tries to sync up.On top of that, the projector lens broke the first day I got it, and the radio reception sucks, and sound quality is poor.

The one day we woke up to the coffee maker brewing and it startled us why the clock didn't go off. Then we saw that the clock was an hour before. So I reset it and took it off the atomic signal. That didn't work. At 1 AM it searches and corrects itself even if it is off the signal. For the past week and a half we have been using our cell phones as alarm clocks. If we wanted to use our cell phones, we wouldn't have bought this nice clock. I tried to write the comany and I got no responce. I saw in the book they want $10 if we send it back to them for \\"repair\\".

Rather than concentrating on HTML basics, style, and design. This book is a slapped together list of do's and dont's that might have been useful when the book was started, but have little use in the current designs.This makes age the number one problem of the book. It starts someone off on a path that the best websites have already ditched long ago.

It is the only reference book in our office library that is raggedy and dog earred.The only negative thing that can be said about this book is that if you are over 40 you'll need to pick up a nice fat magnifying glass when you order the book.

After the simplified explanation of what HTML actually is, the book progresses through HTML in an order that truly mirrors the path a new user would take. Chapter 3 starts with simple \\"Text Formatting\\", then chapters 3 and 4 deal with images - exactly order in which a first time page author would need to work. Page layout of the book makes it very easy to follow and understand the current topic. Every page has a brief explanation of the tag or attribute being discussed and pictures of both the HTML code as it would appear in a text editor and how the code would appear when displayed in a web page.This book does really keep to the basics, after writing a couple of pages you'll be ready for a more advanced reference, but HTML for the World Wide Web will make those first few pages painless and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

What a huge mistake! I wanted a printed reference for quick referral when coding HTML. This book is definitely NOT it. Ms. Castro is somewhat more generous to Mac owners with her information. My machine is an IBM running Windows 98. From my point of view Castro's books are poorly organized, poorly presented, misrepresented, and incomplete. I learned far more in far less time from free tutorials on the web. I recommend a trip to(where Que and SAMS computer books are electronically published and readable in their entirety for FREE).

Then individual HTML commands or tasks are illustrated one to a page. The steps fall down the outside of the page and colorful illustrations line the page's inside. All pages feature step-by-step instruction, tips, troubleshooting advice. A good book for novices and a reference for experienced users. The books strength is the visual approach it includes with screenshots and code examples. The book takes an easy, visual approach to teaching HTML, using pictures to guide you through the software and show you what to do.The book presumes no prior knowledge of HTML, making it the perfect introduction for beginners.

This is an especially good for beginners, but is also a great reference book for expert website designers."},{"rating":"1","title":"chapter one and allready lost","review":"I bought this book based upon the reviews from amazon, but I find it incredibly non-user friendly. Chapter one, under values you are refered to a figure under which is printed \\"You don't need to enclose one word values in quotation marks.\\" I didn't know what she was talking about until further down the page you get to a section on quotation marks. Two sections later when introducing another confusing topic she refers you to an explanation two chapters ahead! I don't read books like that. For something as esoteric as HTML you have to hold my hand. She introduces right from the start difficult concepts with no context for understanding them at all. I will suffer through this for another chapter, \\"starting your web page,\\" but I am so lost I am skimming the first chapter in hopes that it will make sense later. It is not an auspicious start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Really for the Novice - but Still Good","review":"I would not say this book was for the novice, but it is still a very good book to use when first learning HTML. It has excellent drawings and examples, and the instructions are simple and easy to use.There is only one thing I did not like in this book. Say you are a total 100% novice to HTML, and you begin studying this book. It begins with an introduction to web page authoring and HTML, but the drawback occurs when it refers to codes and example--but then says this will be covered on page \\"whatever.\\" In the meantime, the novice does not know what the author is talking about because he/she has not gotten to that page yet.Still it is a good book to begin learning HTML and should be added to your library on HTML and web authoring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and concise","review":"Found HTML 4: Visual Quickstart Guide to be an excellent source to brush up on my HTML basics.I wish I had bought it sooner.

This book covers all the basic parts of a basic to intermediate web pages/sites. Any book couldn't have done as well titling each chapter and is an easy reference. Each chapter concisely and clearly tells you everything you need to know and than shows an example of the code and the what the web page displays when published. This book helps a lot with multimedia. The book briefly gets into scripts and other extras which is why I gave it a 4. When you have mastered what you learn in this book you can use it as a reference and buy a book dealing with advanced options like scripts."},{"rating":"2","title":"CGI-Bin Information Is Confusing ! ! !","review":"Overall, I like the book, and I'm able to understand almost everything, except the CGI Bin Information. My web host supports CGI scripts, however, nomatter what I try or how I try, I still haven't been able to figure-out that part. Either I'm too stupid or that part of the book should be more clear.It doesn't explain how to set the directories in the CGI-bin in order for it to work, she (Elizabeth), just shows you how her server directories look...Ms. Castro, please, first show us how to set-up the cgi-bin directories. Otherwise, we don't know where to throw the scripts and what not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this in your library. Excellent!","review":"Far and away, the best of her series. This book does nothing short of an excellent job of explaining HTML at a source level. Like Castro's other books, each version has gotten better than the former. The first version was great for its time. This is no exception. This uses real-world examples from the start through the finish to explain how HTML and style sheets work. This book is useful for HTML programmers as well as CGI programmers needing an HTML reference. This one is in my personal and office libraries. I will need to buy another copy soon because everyone keeps asking me for mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"All books on this subject fall short.

Castro book to another inquirer (and sending an Amazon link to buy it) I thought I'd say a word here.This is the BEST HTML book out there. It has code pages / with screen shots. You see what you are to do and HOW TO DO IT. All it takes is one missplaced character and the form's select menu won't work. When you can see the code you can make it work and LEARN.

This book is a staple for anyone who wants to learn HTML, it makes it seem easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent at what it does...","review":"When a girl at work asked me what book she should get on HTML I had no hesitation in suggesting this fine book. It takes as its basis the assumption that the reader has basic computer skills, has used and understands the web, and can follow basic instructions. From there it builds chapter by chapter until the user has the skills to design a basic website from hand without needing to rely upon buggy WYSIWYG programs.The only downside is that it is starting to show its age. It talks about, and shows examples in Netscape 4 and IE 4, we are of course up to version 6 of both. Although it is still a valid book, I would suggest any new designer follow it up with some books on CSS/DHTML - such as the Visual Quickstart Guide to both - and also start to investigate XHTML, the next generation. The way designers are building sites is shifting rapidily and hopefully a newer version of this book will take that in to account.Still there is no better book to start with..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for begginers","review":"I bought this book from a referall by a co-worker.

I can maybe get in a whole 15 minutes of wearing these things before I have to start finding other ways to position them over my ears. They actually hurt to wear. They also make you look like you are wearing a couple of little donuts on your ears.

While some seasoned readers may complain that specific authors didn't make the final cut, for me the book offered a wide selection of styles and genres to pick from. Furthermore, the \\"See Also\\" dialogues give several jumping-off points once you've exhausted a specific author's entire bibliography. For people who live and breathe by the New York Times Book Review, this probably won't provide much additional information.

It's what you would expect from Salon: white, male heterosexuals need not apply. If you are white, it's best you be female; if you are male, it's best you be gay; if you write and want to be reviewed favorably in the 2nd edition, it's best you make clear your political sentiments (so Salon will know what to write about you). Harsh? Maybe. True? Undeniable.

It's one of those rare CD's that you don't have to keep skipping to the good songs because every song on it either has a great sound, story or both. I highly recommend this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More to Cherry than Meets the Eye","review":"From the very first time I heard the opening track (and first single) \\"Save Tonight,\\" I was hooked. Catchy acoustic guitar combined with a memorable chorus. I wanted to hear it over and over again; and yet I had to wait a year before the album arrived in America. I was fortunate enough to discover the talents of Eagle-Eye during a trip to Italy in 1997. Thank you Europe for another wonderful musical import! The vocals at times surely bring to mind Ben Harper, yet Cherry's music maintains a simple, yet defined style. His songs are a mix of forlorn love and troubled youth, yet in some way they all speak to the listener. Standouts are \\"Worried Eyes,\\" and the haunting, yet beautiful title track, composed by Cherry's father Don. Another favorite is \\"Permanent Tears,\\" whose guitar and piano evoke images of a soft ocean breeze at the close of a summer's day.Quick Picks: If you enjoy this, you may enjoy the following (and vice versa): Ben Harper, Vertical Horizon, Ben Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best CDs that I have!","review":"Eagle-Eye Cherry is a good artist.

His warmth and enthusiasm propel the reader from page to page, so that reading it literally felt like sailing through the material.

You don't even have to be a tremendous Hendrix fan. What you get is an eclectic set of interpretations of the songs of a very talented individual. Of course, it helps if you can play guitar, which I suspect is why the strongest tracks involve Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Vernon Reid (Living Colour). Even so, this collection goes a long way to proving just how far ahead of his time Jimi Hendrix was. Maybe that's why his music doesn't sound as dated as some others from that era, and maybe that's why this compilation of talent works so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, to those with open musical tastes","review":"This is NOT your typical tribute album. For this reason it is often times excels ( the Cure's cover, Jeff Beck/ Seal cover)and other times I didn't find it particularly interesting. But what this album does that most don't is allow a large array of musical styles to pay tribute to one of the most influential rock musicians ever. That's the beauty of Jimi's music, not only was he an excellent and creative guitarist, but he made great music and wrote timeless songs (check out two completely different covers of \\"Little Wing\\" by Stevie Ray Vaughn and Sting, respectively).To the typical purists and guitar nuts, this is NOT your album.To those who can appreciate varying types of music and appreciate that Hendrix' music can be interpreted and presented in so many different ways - this is a really nice effort and a nice tribute to a great musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good parts","review":"This disc has some good moments but my question is: Why did they let Slash destroy Hendrix's legacy. After hearing him butcher one of Jimi's tunes I can no longer listen to Hendrix. Slash's ear splitting playing has ruined it for me, and I used to really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible!","review":"The Cure? Doing Hendrix? Come on. Who's the genius who came up with the lineup for this one? Claptan, Beck, and Buddy Guy are great musicians and are a no brainer to be on a Hendrix Tribute. Then they throw in PM Dawn!! Blasphemy! The Spin Docters, wow, they are a terrible band to start out with. There are a few good tunes on this cd, but for the most part it is a waste of time and money and a terrible tribute to a legend.

BUYER BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but Very Goodie!","review":"I had forgotten about this one and someone made reference to Jimi Hendrix and rockers of the 70's during a radio spot - and I found this gem on Amazon. I owned it on cassette way about the time it came out in 1993 - and what a trip down Memory Lane! The Cure singing \\"Purple Rain\\", Buddy Guy's cover of \\"Red House\\", The Spin Doctors doing \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" - and of course - The Pretenders with \\"Bold As Love\\". What I loved most about this compliation is that you hear Jimi Hendrix's unique compositions and lyrics very clearly, with the added extra of what made these newer bands so special twenty years after Hendrix's passing. If you're a Hendrix fan, you're really going to love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, interesting, entertaining Tribute Album","review":"Stone Free / a tribute to Jimi Hendrix: While I have little interest in Tribute albums, I bought this one for the Eric Clapton performance I heard on the radio. To my surprise, this turned out to be a very entertaining album. It's far from perfect. Some of the performances are better than others (which is the nature of a various artist tribute album) but the good ones outnumber the bad by a good margin. I have come to like this album very much. This is a four star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"is it love or just confusion?","review":"This contains some very fine cuts. Jeff Beck , Slash, and Clapton do outstanding work on their cuts. Pretenders, PM dawn, give it their best ,not quite enough but the overall taste of the music is an advancement of the original cuts. It must have given the rappers quite a trip to do Jimi and it shows the truth behind Jimi as writer/artist , what he said then is still right on. Band of Gypsys backs Slash on I Don't. Buddy Miles must have been timetraveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety? Spice of Hendrix tribute...","review":"I'm a big fan of Hendrix, and so I was interested in hearing his work, and how it would be interpreted by such diverse artists as the Cure, Slash, Soundgarden/Pearl Jam, Clapton, and Ice-T's Body Count. I was extremely satisfied... the Cure, Ice-T, Slash and Paul Rodgers, Seal and Jeff Beck, and Buddy Guy had the highlights of the album, IMO. I'd buy the album for those five songs alone... not to say that the other songs are c**p... the only two I really skip are the ones by Belly and the Pretenders, and they aren't bad at all. Hendrix was all about expanding the boundaries of the guitar, and this album does well in that vein, allowing lots of different artists (Nile Rodgers working with Clapton? Seal working with Jeff Beck!?) to add their own flavor to pre-existing tunes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Experience Disappointments","review":"Clapton's version of Stone Free is actually better than the original (I know, blasphemy...), and Paul Rodgers comes out unscathed, but most of the rest of this album is, well, crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent Novelty Item","review":"I realize it is not popular to criticize anything related to the Church of Hendrix, but this collection of tunes ranges from clever engaged covers by the Cure and Living Color, to phoned-in, tepid playing by Clapton and Metheny. A few other cuts are OK, including \\"I Don't Live Today\\" with Slash and Paul Rodgers, but then we have Belly blathering through \\"Are You Experienced\\" and Jeff Beck sounding overcaffeinated on \\"Manic Depression.\\"One more thing: notice that the used price for this CD now starts at less than a dollar (it was around $1.99 when I first wrote this review). I would suggest you stay in this price range.

This indeed is an accurate statement, and should serve as a warning not to trust the contents. Not only are there two to three typos per page, but there are also substantial errors in many of the entries (too many to mention here).

I think it won't but you never know. Any ways, at first she just liked watching me play the xylophone, but now she bangs on it & loves this toy. If you like this one or are thinking about purchasing this toy I would also suggest the Alex Toys Drum set for the bath tub. She absolutely loves that one as well. All the Alex Toys are great.

It is easy to pick up the essentials in this lovely book. Now, many years later, I occasionaly ask beginning students what their favorite reference is on things like that, and more often than not, it is Katznelson. Thanks to Dover, it is on the shelf of most university bookstores, and priced under US$ 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential book for anyone studying Harmonic Analysis","review":"Katznelson's book considers harmonic analysis primarily on the circle group.

There's pages and pages of trips up and down Chandler Mountain, information about Snake Handling, e-mails back and forth to too-perfect daughter Haley, irrelevant visits from irrelevant charachers (for instance, all the stuff about Debbie and her new baby and a visit from a cop who is nice but who is completely ungermaine to the story), too many pointless nights spent with an afghan on the couch, and lots of flirting with a Sheriff who is doing absolutely nothing to solve this murder. The murderer isn't even introduced until way too late in the story and there are no clues, hints, etc. pointing his way until he actually IS introduced and even then, it's real vague. Too much fluff and not enough substance to keep this reader entertained. A disappointment from Anne George."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love among sisters!","review":"My sister told me about the Anne George series and am I ever glad that she did. Mouse and Aunt Sister coming out with another book is just what I needed to avoid another day of laundry and cleaning and grocery shopping.

The only drawback is that now I have to wait 'til July 2001 for the next series of chuckles. \\"Torch\\" will start you off laughing when you see Fred's reaction after his return flight home.

Reading about the Sisters and their latest adventures was like hooking up with best friends again. I laughed till I cried and finished it so quickly that I wonder what I'll do till Ms. George writes another book about Patricia Anne and Mary Alice.

I became interested in them initially, because I, too, had an Aunt Sister, but the lively plots and characters keep me coming back again and again.

I have attempted to apply the learning from many of those books with varying levels of success. Dr. Cousens puts everything together in this one book and provides complete and accurate information to work from. Much of it reads like a medical text but I found it easy to scan for information that is most useful. If you are already a vegetarian and want to go to a raw food diet, do not feel you have to do it by the book. You can introduce raw foods according to your inclination and schedule.

For some reason Amazon has this super cheap and it's a great deal. This juicer would be worth full price anyways. It's small, decently quiet, not too terrible to put together/take apart/clean, and moves at lower RPM so it doesn't destroy the nutrients. I don't juice tons of things so I can't say how it does with everything, and yes of course you have to pre cut stuff. It's just how it goes.

Also need to cut up larger items that do not fit down the chute. I use a walmart bag on the back of it to catch the pulp because then you just have to throw the bag away instead of clean up the pulp catcher. Just make sure there are no holes in the bag, otherwise there are carrot shreds where you never thought there would be any. If you want a large glass of something just put it on a phone book or two.

The story is much more appropriate for a feature story in Time magazine (10 pages with a few gory pictures) There was nothing morally, artistically or intellectually redeeming about this book. Left me empty and mad I spent time and money on this. The many typos in the book simply (i.e. too for to and he'll for hell) added to the annoyance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensily so Real","review":"I carried this book with me in the car, and read it at every stop sign ,I could not put it down, the fact that this really happened to a mother and her two daughters made my stomach churn, I have told all my friends to read it also.I do recommend anyone who likes thrillers to read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Suspenseful","review":"The author did an excellent job of making you feel like you were there with the victims.

Then again we also need a quick snack, or just want to eat candy. Ever thought about trying something different from another country ? Straight out of Japan, land of the rising sun, is a taffy candy known as Hi-Chew. Kind of like starburst, but more chewy and a powerful flavor(s). They come in many different flavors that you can't pass up. Highly recommended for those that want to try something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi-Chew Review","review":"I ordered Hi-chew online because I can never find it in stores, and if I do it is only Strawberry and Green Apple flavors. The \\"Taste of Japan\\" Hi-chew sampler pack I received was an excellent purchase. The description by PierMall Sweets was completely accurate and helpful in deciding to choose this item. Each package was exactly the size and amount stated. The sampler included a number of exotic flavors like Dragon-fruit and Blood Orange that I would not expect to find in a store. The total price was even below what each pack in the store would cost. The shipping was quick, 4 days BEFORE estimated delivery, and I was 100% satisfied with the seller, the shipping and presentation, and the flavors. I was most satisfied with the variety included. I will definately purchase from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"It's adorable, matches the decor and holds a couple of leashes.

The book focuses almost completely on the sport of bench rest shooting, with very little on anything else- such as accurate rifles for hunting, varminting and sniping. If you are a newby to benchrest then this is highly recommended- no mistake. If however, you are a dyed in the wool varminter, or use a tactical rifle for work, then you will not learn a huge amount.So- for the benchrester a lot of good stuff. Bench rests, the match and so on. There are ample photos, and lots of stories of matches. Lots of \\"folksy\\" stories as well. This is better suited for the beginner and intermediate shooter.For you varminters, tactical shooters and full bore match shooters, the chapters on wind shooting, are excellent, but there is little new in them.All in all, useful enough for most rifle shooters bookshelves, but not a \\"must have\\". If you are a benchrester- recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"For benchrest shooters only","review":"This book is definitly for benchrest shooters only. It does not live up to its name of the \\"Ultimate\\" because it only addresses one area. Many more stories than useful information. Would not recommend for the average recreational shooter or hunter."},{"rating":"1","title":"For competitive shooters only.","review":"If you really want to get into bench shooting then get this book. If you want to know about accurizing rifles, better shooting techniques and sighting then forget about it. I think the 'hunting' part was thrown in to get this book sold at Wal-Mart.For every item I found useful I had to wade through page after page of competitive bench jargon. For instance the chapter on shooting technique was mostly about selecting a rest and punching '0.xx' inch groups by moving the sandbag under the stock. Not to mention that every picture in this book is of some competitive shooter with a rifle and most seem to be from the 1980's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive book for the competition benchrest shooter.","review":"Glenn Newick wrote a complete and comprehensive work on the sport of competitive benchrest shooting. There are several chapters that will interest the average gun enthusiast, but in general it is a sport specific book. Overall it was worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical delightful, quirky Van Dyke Parks collection","review":"Catchy tunes, with sometimes weird lyrics that don't necessarily make that much sense other than fitting the beats in the songs, just like a lot of other VDP songs.

I especially like Movies Is Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Very Glad I Found This CD...","review":"This album has a sublime effect on the listener. I loved it from the very first play. It is full of references to California's rich cultural history and serves as somthing of a time capsule to an idylic version of the Golden State's formative years. If you want an album that will make you feel good and put a smile on your face this is the one. Some may find it a bit corny but I think it is WON-WON-WONDERFUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilson and Parks make magic again!!","review":"After deliberating this purchase, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. There are several really catchy songs on here that make this album worth a purchase - Orange Crate Art, Sail Away and Wings of a Dove. The others are average to mediocre but very listenable. The album seems to be an ode to California - it's weather, atmosphere, and history. Recommended for fans of the Wislon and Parks style of music - pleasant and timeless. You will play it again and again...Also, don't miss a GREAT performance of Wilson doing Orange Crate Art accompanied ONLY by Van Dyke on piano on the 'I Just Wasnn't Made For These Times' DVD - located at the very end of chapter 18. A much simpler live version of the song (w/o the layered background vocals) and probably the way it should have been done on this album. Great stuff!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"This is a terrible album, save your money for something better. Vocals are poor and the songs are forgetable. I was disappointed from the begining and can't understand how anybody can find anything of value in it. And I must add, that I am a big BB and Brian Wilson fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parks & Wilson Make Magic Again","review":"I've been a Brian Wilson fan for the past 25 years, so naturally I've followed VDP's career a little bit as well. Of the few past VDP albums I've heard, \\"JUMP!\\" was my favourite - that is until this one came along. I don't know how to describe the music - it has strong traces of jazz, calypso, pop, broadway, etc. It defies categorisation but, what the hell, it's sheer great music from someone who's better known as a lyricist than a tune-crafter. The arrangements are brilliant, the musicianship is excellent, the harmonies are immaculate (further demonstration that Brian doesn't need the other BB's) and Brian's lead vocals are spot-on. I think the CD is worth buying even if only for the title track.It's my most played album over the last 5 years. I pray for more Wilson-Parks collaborations in future. Whichever of them is writing the music, there seems to be magic when they work together. Popular music needs this kind of stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in mexico","review":"Dissapointed. i just bought a 2nd bosch bulldog. my first one bought 4 years ago through the orange store was made in germany. this one is made in mexico... i wonder if its going to last..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable tool for masonry work","review":"In the past I've used 1/2\\" hammerdrills and spline-drive rotary hammers, and this one fits perfectly in between. It blows holes into even solid slabs with ease, and user fatigue is minimal. It's considerably faster than a hammerdrill, and much lighter and quieter than a spline-drive.Overall, it's definitely a great investment and time saver if you've got to install lots of anchors or do light-to-moderate chipping. The chiseling function has a rather short stroke, but it makes it very easy to control the area of material being removed, which is really nice for doing more precise work. The volume level isn't too bad, but earplugs are definitely needed.It's another great Bosch product, this one has done a fair amount of work for me in the past month and is a pleasure to use.

The rock-star level of drugs, booze and sex (not to mention lack of writing ability) make me wonder what kinds of grades they received, and what kind of law firm would hire these guys. Fortunately for their clients (and their firm's malpractice carrier), most of the exploits described in the book smell of puffery and bravado, and I would suspect law students that knew them might have a different spin on the stories.If you're looking for a book that would make Dewey Nicks (of \\"Slackers\\" fame) proud, this is the book for you.

Thompson recommendation made me curious, though. And this book is about far, far more. Law school is just the setting; in the same way Star Wars is set in space, that setting influences much of the action, but the dramas are transcendent, and many. To name a few: lost love, friendship, and all the emotional swings connected with wealth turning to poverty, drug highs turning to drug lows; plus the scary confrontation with lost love and the search for some permanence in life. Perhaps most amazing is the cast of colorful and quirky characters (my own favorites were the genius/vixen Niccola and the wickedly brilliant \\"Kankoos\\"). Read 3/4 of it late into the night; went to work dying to know how it turned out; got home, and finished -- satisfied and inspired. Well (and at times beautifully) written.

As a prospective law student, I found it pretty much worthless. As far as the format is concerned, the split, alternating-chapter narrative is confusing because both of the authors are essentially the same egotistical straight guy. They talk about their bong hits and orgies, gambling and drinking problems, and portray themselves as apathetic and their fellow students as WASPs with golden parachutes, but I suspect they are pretty boring in real life, and worked much harder in law school than they let on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"A refreshing look at law school (especially the \\"upper echelon\\") and the creatures that populate it. I myself went to a \\"top\\" school and can testify to the sorts of shenanigans depicted here. It's a cliche that lawyers are alcoholics, so the drinking and drug use depicted here should not be surprising. Those who are \\"shocked\\" (shocked!) by the book's contents are naive.

If they aren't a major force to be reckoned with within the next three years, I'll have solid, concrete proof that this world is filled with morons. The beats, harmony, vocals, and sound in this cd are second to none. I was filled with a indescribable feeling of bliss and ecstacy when listening to this cd. I enter trance-like states whenever I dance to \\"Tonight\\" and \\"Smile\\", and it's quite the spectacle, lemme assure you. Of course, my love for this band may be due to the fact that I'm their official dancer, but I digress. Everything in the People Mover is excellent.

Unlike most dot to dot books, the page/puzzle size is 9.5 x 11 inches. The spaces between dots is sometimes very small which lends to a detailed image. Keep in mind, though, that young children may lack the fine motor skills to draw very straight short lines in order to make the best looking image.

This is OK, but for those of us who prefer the writer to fix her plot and characters herself, or who prefer not to read inspirational romances (which use faith-in-God as plot devices) at all, it seems like something is missing in the literary construction of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smorgasbord!!!","review":"A well-written romantic-suspense novel. Although, the love story most common in Ms. Sala's books took a bit of a back seat in this story it was still a page-turner. I found some points in it a little gruesome but it made the plot more realistic in a sense.Ms. Sala's characters are more believable. She presents the human nature at its best and worst as shown in Wes and Ally. Both have major physical and emotional flaws, but at the same time Ms. Sala shows that flaws could be surmounted with endurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"She didn't miss the mark!","review":"I am always pleased to see a new Sharon Sala novel, and this one is a winner. It's a realistic story of life in our perilous times and the cost our protectors pay. In our world of terrorism, sometimes only a special person and place can heal a wounded heart. When Wes Holden walks away from his tragedy, he didn't expect a spinster in the backwoods to be the key to returning to life. An interesting cast of charactors and a deadly danger keep the pace lively. I wish she had filled out the lesser charactors a little more, but this is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turning emotional read","review":"Romance, suspense, action and illegal activities all pulled together in this wonderfully written novel that will both capture your heart as well as keep you entertained until the very end. The villian is easily dislikable even though his identity is not a mystery. Still, it is an emotional roller coaster and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing - Sharon Sala","review":"I won't bore everyone outlining the plot of the story, other readers before me have outlined the basics, but I will say this the book is wonderful. Sala had me logged into the story by the first five pages. The characters was believable and the story didn't go off into some distant field. This isn't a story to pick up before bed and think you will sleep. The author has you rivited and wanting to read more. There are just a few authors I have found that has kept me reading and loosing track of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"That man can play.....","review":"Well, I have to say that this album is superb.

Most of the book was dedicated to 'natural' therapies, the dangers of chemicals in our enviorment, and cancer.I truly feel that there are very few women with endo who are going to benefit from this book. It is a giant list of DON'T's with very few do's.

I would rather decipher graffiti on a wall than to read this again. I went to the website listed in the book and saw all the books there are really soft porn or maybe hardcore porn since I didn't stay on long.I thought I'd read more about the Mineshaft club but I guess I didn't pay enough attention that it is actually submissive sex dreams.

WOW--it reminded me of how God told satan you could touch everything in Job's life but he could not take his life!

And when Speedway ended I jumped up and cheered in an empty room, unable to stop myself. It wasn't the Smiths. It didn't matter.The sound and the lyrics are strange, detached -- Morrissey tells the stories but doesn't live in them the way he did on Meat is Murder, for example -- and yet compelling. The professional outsider tells his stories with sympathy and intelligence and passion. We end with the most affecting moment of closeness anywhere in Morrissey's work: \\"In my own sick way/I've always stayed true to you.\\" I still listen to it, and it still makes me want to stand up and cheer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sanest days are mad","review":"Yet another excellent outing with Morrissey. This has to be one of his most soothing cds. This, however, is not to say that there aren't some great high energy tracks such as \\"Speedway\\". \\"Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself\\" is one of the best songs he has ever written and in \\"Lifeguard Sleeping, Girl Drowning\\" Morrissey experiments with his vocal delivery with smashingly creepy results. I know that all of his songs are very personal but I find this to be his most personal work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"prolly the best solo morissey album","review":"morissey's solo albums can't touch the impossibly high standards of the smiths's ouvre... and it would be foolish to expect that.this is a solid album from one of the greatest living songwriters. his voice is also in fine form... alternately cloy and sweet with aloof and hurt.listen to the sample of 'the more you ignore...'. it's a great pop song with a killer, simple guitar riff. a good introduction to the man's work.if you like britpop... buy it. if you think that morissey sullen and sulky... you should prolly stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid piece of work.","review":"This album has quite a few songs that are catchy and pleasant to listen to. The big hit \\"The more you ignore me, the closer I get\\", shows how obsession and attachment can get the better of you, especially if don't handle rejection gracefully. The theme of love and the persecution that can be experienced is delved into in songs like \\"I'm hated for loving\\". Also themes of how dreams can die hard (\\"Used to be a Sweet Boy\\"), idealism about friendships (\\"Hold on to your friends\\") and fessing up to truths that do not necessarily flatter you as in the song, \\"Speedway\\". This work comes across as very cathartic for Morrissey, but setting that aside, the music is good to listen to. Given it's length, \\"Vauxhall and I\\" is short but sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can never be as wonderful","review":"Every single song on this album is unique. You feel it deep inside every time you hear him whisper or whail. He really shows off his talent in his lyrics and makes you want to share his thoughts with the rest of the world. This album is the most beautiful of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Moz solo cd - (IMHO)","review":"This was considered Morrissey's \\"coming out\\" cd as there are numerous references to his allegedly being gay. For example, on Billy Budd he is professing much along these lines, however the song mirrors the book of the same title. Of course there is \\"I Am Hated For Loving\\" recounting abuse/attacks for not belonging and being \\"haunted for wanting.\\" Naysayers will say he just talking about being a misfit. I disagree.I believe the album classic and the entire song content is stellar. If anything, Lifeguard Sleeping Girl Drowning is not a fave of mine but many other love it, so their voice can count here. Also, lyrically he is considered at his best here.Highly recommended. A good place to start with a first Moz cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vauxhall and I","review":"Vauxhall and I being Morrissey's 1994 release and the 4 th studio album contained his first US hit single, \\"The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get\\". Other great tracks are Hold on to your friends and Now my heart is full. The booklet is quite spartan with a basic photo on the cover, not pictures or photos and just text. The photos seem to have been taken by friends since the quality is quite shoddy. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Mozzer","review":"The two-bass hit of \\"Your Arsenal\\"--produced by the late Mick Ronson--and \\"Vauxhall...\\"--produced by Steve Lillywhite--couldn't be more different sounding, but they're equally brilliant.Lillywhite is famous for his lush, folk-sounding producing style (Pogues, Smiths, Kirsty MacColl), but the magic he's brought to this album will make you forsake Daniel Lanois for good. \\"The Lazy Sunbathers\\", the soft-picking of \\"Hold Onto Your Friends\\", and Phil Spector-esque intro \\"Now My Heart Is Full\\" all blow you away not only with their delivery, but the fullness of the production.A big part of this is the exchange of rythym sections between albums, but in this case, the perfect decision. Quite possibly the best of the Morrissey solo albums, and as good as anything the Smiths ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastically identifiable","review":"Morrissey reaches the soul of feelings and experience of being gay and the everything from the day to day personal experiences,to family ties to relationships...and even loosing someone you love. The good and the bad of an alternatve lifestyle in this world. His voice is sexy, and masculine. Being of British decent myself, I love British pop and alternative and I can understand his point of view, not to mention areas of England he seems to be describing. I hope he will continue with his bold style of music which I know many others enjoy also."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh, woe is me","review":"In my humble opinion, this is the best self-pity music ever written.This album has helped me get through countless breakups, broken hearts, and bad days. It's not going to make you feel better about anything, nor is it going to inspire you to get up and save the world, but is perfect for when you just want to wallow in your misery. \\"I Am Hated for Loving\\" and \\"Used To Be A Sweet Boy\\" are the most beautifully sad songs on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORRISSEY ACCESSIBLE? THAT'S SOMETHING NEW.....","review":"As shocking as it may seem, Morrissey apparantly decided to aim his droll humor toward a commercially viable record, demonstrating the breadth of his musicality. Personally, I prefer a more distanced record from this artist but this album certainly works. The sonic quality is strong and the playing excellent. The acoustic guitar sounds are paricularly well recorded. Morrissey is in good voice, is both witty and clever, and delivers a CD that is highly listenable. It almost sounds like he actually tried to make a hit record. Before Morrissey's creative well seemingly ran dry, he could always be counted on to demonsrate good taste in songwriting, musicians and production. This is a pretty strong culmination of that. It's unfortunate his artiste side has dominated the later efforts (such as Maladjusted and the weaker b-side release Early Burglary Years) when he has the ability to create records like this.

Living in ATL, I have seen them several times live and they were great. They moved out to LA to try to take the band to the next level, changed the band's name (forget the name) and then broke up - maybe after putting out one more album under the new name. It's a shame when a great band like this, with their own sound, etc. has internal problems that causes it to disband. Anyway, this is a great album and I recommend it.

Purchased on recommendation of a [...] article on how eggs are getting harder to peel but this item is worthless. Basic idea is you first cool the eggs with ice water (which actually does help them peel better) then smush the bottom and nick the top and hope air will get between the egg and the whites. Well if it was easy to pull the whites from the shell they would be easy to peel. I got the yolks out of some eggs but the whites never separated from the shell.

I've always felt that the best Ambient music is almost more art than music, and with this album Aphex becomes a serene Jackson Pollock. As an Ambient artist myself, and someone who has listened to the likes of Eno, etc., I can easily say that this double-album set is the best collection of Ambient works I have ever heard. Strap on your headphones and be prepared to be taken to another world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not start here!","review":"I'll let the other reviewers talk about the merits of this release. I'm here to make one point:DO NOT MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST APHEX TWIN ALBUM!I did, and I almost didn't give him a second chance. I love it now (although I normally only play one of the discs each time), but at first it's EXTREMELY hard to stomach.As a first purchase, I recommend SAW 85-92 (if you want to relax but not fall asleep), RDJ (if you don't mind going from serious to weird, edgy to soothing), or Drukqs (for a butt-kicking with piano lulls). Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSIC TO DROWN IN...","review":"I often hear people get all theoretical on these tracks....from \\"I could do that\\" to \\"Huh?\\"What these tracks require is a leap of faith; approach with the open ears of a true believer and keep your mind out of it...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the youtube generation.","review":"This is the best ambient record ever made, I don't know anyone with a knowledge of music that would disagree. Beware though, the MP3 version is missing a track from disk 1 called \\"Hankie +\\" but it's not one of the best songs on the double album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is THE holy disc of ambient","review":"Move over, Brian Eno. I know that you are a great musician and I loved you book \\"Ocean of Sound\\", but you are NOT the father of ambient. Aphex Twin has taken all the vague definitions of ambient and crushed them. \\"SAW II\\" is truly the spirit of ambient. It is all around us, it is hard, it is kind, it is sweet, it is barbed, it is inside us and outside us, it is here and yet not here.Shortly, \\"SAW II\\" is a unique experience, much like Enlightenment - it will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aphex Twin's BEST","review":"Perhaps it is bold to proclaim this as the very best Aphex Twin release when the style of this artist ranges so greatly; From acid-jazz-techno, to distorted voice-samples blipping along an electric beat, to the slowed-down chapters of this very fine piece of musical history- Selected Ambient Works Vol. II.The alien contours of sound will leave the impression on you that not only have you never heard any electronic music like this before, but that it is also the spawn of a great musical genius.Richard D. James is at his best here, and it is recommended to any connaisseur of fine electronic music.However, the best track on the entire album does not appear on this CD release. If you are somehow able to find a copy of this on VINYL, you will also find the missing \\"untitled #19\\" otherwise known as \\"stone in focus.\\" A simple, beautiful, repeating melody.Not to be enjoyed simply as background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound of Everything","review":"This is not only Aphex' best work, it is also the culmination of Ambient music in the 90ies. Don't get me wrong: Aphex Twin and other artists of his kind produce wonderful music to this day. But nothing compares to the magic I felt when I first heard this. It has an otherworldly quality few recordings can match.Granted you have to have patience for musical structures that evolve only after minutes. They may sound simple at first but they are complex if you really listen to the overtones. And they are soothing in a way I can't really describe. You will find yourself looking out of the window when listening and thinking: You know, life isn't so bad after all..I actually hate me for saying such things, I'm not really the esoteric type. But if ambient means \\"surrounding\\" then this is it - this is how the world sounds if you subtract all other noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"da ambient ...","review":"aphex twin shows the most talent in ambient music today ambient works 2 is his best piece of work yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambient/electronic for those who don't know history","review":"I've been a huge fan of \\"electronica\\" since I heard the first synth on a pop record, say about 1968. Since then, I've availed myself of just about every bit of electronic music I could find.When this came out in 1994, I was underwhelmed, and listening to it right now I still am.This is bland, formulaic, and trite. Folks who think this is relevant have never heard Another Green World or maybe Music has the Right to Children or even something like Feed me Weird Things.I've never understood the cult around Mr. James, because to me he's not even in the top 10 much less number 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"unusual Aphex Twin","review":"I own a lot of Aphex Twin albums and I have to say that this is my least favourite. The first ambient works release is a classic, but I feel that this is over-rated and lacking. I just don't understand the hype over this. I don't even like to call it minimal or ambient. Maybe this CD is better fit for stoners.Update: It is starting to grow on me. I'd give it 4 stars now."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure genius? I don't think so.","review":"I find it surprising how many people consider this cd a work of genius. Yeah, it's quiet, and soft, and sometimes even slightly brooding, but it still sounds like an amateur noodling around with a sequencer program, a sampler, and a few synths.

What they got (as a joke? or a lesson?) was music in it's MOST basic and elemental state:the expression of emotions transmitted through space as sound.At times this record is perfect.DO NOT try to imagine anything or visualize anything while listening to this.Just LISTEN moment to moment and let the music make you feel.Accept it for what you hear and you will know that Richard James is an artist and perhaps so are you."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a classic...","review":"...this is the sound of a talented man making fun of you.. try the first selected ambient works or for good ambient listen to the first two orb albums or global communications \\"76:14\\".. bye"},{"rating":"1","title":"wack...","review":"this cd is nothing like his last ambient works cd... this is some psycodelic type chill room sh*t!... i was prety dissapointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleep, bop, drizzle","review":"I normally like electronic music but I find the CD boring and at times unnerving."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not music. It is noise.","review":"Listen to the first 5 seconds of every track, and you will have heard all these 2 CDs have to offer. Ambient...Aural? These are words used to take place of the real description of this album: Repetitive, boring, annoying. Another reviewer described this as the best album recorded by Aphex Twin, and something you could fall asleep to. If the former is true, then I shudder to imagine how bad the other Aphex Twin albums are. The ladder however is definently true...you could easily sleep to this music. Not because it has a wonderful aural presence or other nonsense, but because it's extremely boring and repetitive. If you can stand to listen to this for long enough, you WILL fall asleep. People who prefer music to these noises will stop playing these CDs long before they have a chance to doze off. The truly lucky people out there though, will never have to listen or spend money on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking at nature through synthetic eyes.","review":"RDJ is just amazing in the way he creates soundscapes that are both lucid and beautiful.

While the sound is very similar to them it has a quality to it that stirs up something deep within my being, I can't describe it and nothing else I've ever listened to has it. Brilliantly disturbing, incomprehensibly trippy, and divinely beautiful this album is the most powerful musical experience I've ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Odessey Beyond The Universe","review":"Not many albums have caused me to have vivid deams, Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2 has. This is an album of amazing scope and high musical creativity. When I bought it, I listen to it during in the day and was entranced. But I recommend listening to it when you go to sleep. the light beats and smooth synth made me feel as though I was floating in space. In my mind, the pulsating tones took me across the universe and back again. A vision of the outer reaches of the human imagination. A mind trip like none other!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beyond all conception of music","review":"This music is what nature would be saying to you if it had vocal chords. The trees, the grass, the air coming off of mountains. Some people felt this music was like death, and yes, it is haunting, even scary indeed.Throw away most preconcieved notions about reality, and all notions about traditional music, and you have the universe of Selected Ambient Works II. The sounds present on this CD can open Doors that can never be closed again. Beware!Also, it really helps to listen to this music on a really high quality stereo. Most people who have listened to this on a cheap stereo may not get all the nuances in the work.If you don't have a good stereo, get a portable CD player, a decent set of headphones, get in some warm bathwater, pour yourself a glass of red wine, shut the lights and escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aphex Twin classic","review":"Well Richard James takes a break from beats to lay down one of the most innovative ambient albums for years to come.Try to interpret his dreams, the Aphex Twin brings to us audience an adventure through time and space. The album is beautiful in so many ways. First of all, he manages to transfer raw emotions and make them into tracks that sound like something you feel. Secondly, as an Aphex Twin fan, he seems to constantly surprise his listeners by offering something new and different every time.However be warn, this album is unlike his other albums ... its without any sort of beat just pure atmospheric ambient sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is death","review":"saw2 was the first aphex twin I ever heard, I didn't really get it,5yearslater. I get it. I get it. I get it. although I am the only one of my friends who likes this album, i would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape for a couple of hours. I heard an interview with Mr. james and one of the comments sums it up best describing the album as ' the experience of death'. Bingo.

Adrena grows to feel better about herself under the care of Dr. Vivian Matthews, who lost her mom to sucide because of poor mental health. Vivian and Adrena grow a strong bond between one another. I liked the part at Howard's and Vivian's wedding, when Howard's sister tried to make a big scene, and she got taught by Max, vivian, and Adrena. I throught the book had some shocking things that took place, like Adrena's forms of revenge of people that did her wrong, but the book was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My emotions ran wild!","review":"I could not put this book down. This debut novel by Bernadette Y. Connor is excellent. Although the subject matter of child abuse is a hard pill to swallow, I found myself captivated with the characters of this novel. The main character Adrena Reynolds, had me crying with her as she recalls the horrific treatment she received as a 10 year old child. As she discovers new experiences that others would normally take for granted, I laughed, cheered and became prideful as if Adrena were my own.There is not a slow moment within the novel.

I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait unitl the next one","review":"From the very beginning the author captivates your attention with Adrena'a realness.

I enjoyed how the story came together and it was a believable view of how the Romans struggled with the concept of Christianity and how they may have conducted their investigations. Many would probably be uncomfortable with a story trying to discount the life of Jesus but that is part of Roman History. The author does a great job in putting together a likely version of how it may have happened. The surprise ending was a good touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first novel!","review":"Reading Corn Maiden is like taking a deep breath of air straight off the Pacific Ocean. This is strictly a woman's book, celebrating a woman's strength and independence.

The wing cracked, the rudder broke, propeller broke, and worst of all the speed control was non functional. This all from falling from about 3 feet off the ground. The construction of this plane is terrible. The wings and rudder are made of a flimsy foam. The fuselage is made of a thin plastic. I was not going to give up. So I made repairs to the wing and ordered a new speed control. After installing the speed control nothing worked properly. Money wasted there.

The main character's actions and thoughts make you slow down and wonder what you'd do. Also, not all the characters automatically do the right thing. Each of their actions has a consequence, whether good or bad, and they have to put up with those consequences, which is more realistic. There's no flashy deux ex machina, but God works through the characters in a way that's somehow more majestic than simply suspending laws of nature to make sure the good guy wins.

The movie does a good job of telling the story of the Ramones, warts and all. But at under two hours, some of the events in the band's 22 year history had to be glossed over.

Felt like you knew the members personally. Left you wanting more. Could have used more live tracks. Great though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for any Ramones Fan","review":"This movie is an absolute must own for any Ramones fan or fan of punk rock. It has tons of great concert footage and the most interviews and in depth look at the band I've ever found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Beautiful","review":"This book has many pictures and covers the material well. My only disappointment was that it was written to appeal to a slightly younger audience than I had hoped. However, I do not regret my purchase. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for king-single or slat bed","review":"We bought this bedrail in a box branded as \\"Compass\\" but once opened found that it had \\"First Years\\" logos all over it. We were hoping to use it for a King Single size bed, but it doesn't fit. I didn't find this out until well into the assembly/installation instructions. They could easily add some more holes to make it fit. I was ready to drill some extra holes myself but then found out it also isn't suitable for a slat bed, so back to the shop it went. If we had known it was \\"First Years\\" we could have found online reviews and known that it wasn't suitable. It would be nice if they had clearer information on the packaging about what types of beds it is and isn't suitable for.Assembly was painful, they could easily pre-assemble parts of it without significantly increasing the package size."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have an engineering degree, this bedrail is for you","review":"After a few hours of muddling through the directions, we decided to return this bedrail. If you have an engineering degree, assembly should be no problem for you. We're going to buy another one like the one we already have (which was a gift) that does not need to be assembled. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating isn't the beginning!!","review":"I have thrown this thing more than once trying to put it together! I have never had so much trouble with any of my daughter's other contraptions.

Yes, it is very difficult to get together because the fabric is so taut that you have little room to manuever. It was very easy to attach to the bed and adjust once it was up. I'm looking to buy another one for our shore house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tall enough!","review":"This only comes up 2 inches above the mattress! My daughter could easily roll over it and onto the floor. They fail to mention that it is only compatible with thin mattresses. If you have a decent mattress or pillow top, this product will not work.....it's just not tall enough and there is no way to adjust it for the height of the mattress. Waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Says on box that it works with platform beds...oh really?! Yeah it might install to a platform bed, but it doesnt tell you until you get to the VERY end of the instructions that it wont fold down for a platform bed! Add to that how hard they are to build and install and that if you want to actually make you kids bed youre out of luck! Lift the mattress and the thing falls off or you instead cant tuck in the fitted sheets or anything for that matter! what a terrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and depressing","review":"My title says it all.

Joan Woodbury is a dead ringer for the beautiful Brenda Starr. True a couple of the chapters were in poor shape, but that was explained on the CD box and inside the case. Since the strip has been discontinued, this serial live action serial of the great \\"BRENDA STARR REPORTER\\" is a wonderful rememberance. Sincerly, Bob \\"Ziggy\\" Anderson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Copy","review":"Although there are two chapters sans sound, the chapters menu allow me to skip them and let me continue on. But having watched many serials, the story lines usually have no continuity. So, with Brenda Starr, it's SSDD with nothing lost when I skip those chapters. Aside from that, both the video and sound quality of this disk are very good. I have no regret adding this to my library of movie seriala and hope that future purchasers are not swayed from adding this title to their collection because of the two soundless chapters. They still play well despite there's no audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is a hard to find movie! I bought this for my brother who absolutely loves Iron Maiden.

There's no tension or drama a la Metallica's \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" or Wilco's \\"I am Trying to Break Your Heart.\\" These guys seem to really enjoy their music, their lives, and each other. There is NOTHING old or tired about them, and that makes watching them for an hour and forty minutes pure fun.Writer/director Sam Dunn tells us at the beginning of the film that Maiden is his favorite band. He and Scot McFadyn have paid the band an immense tribute with this film. It is well-executed and enjoyable from start to finish.

This was my favorite period for Maiden the songs they wrote during this time especially, \\"Rime of the Ancien Mariner\\", was what I felt the best of thier carrier. I was somewhat disappointed with \\"The Dance Of Death\\" DVD. Not with the Maidens' performance, but with the camera work. It just jumped from Maiden to Maiden ever few seconds and was not enjoyable to watch. So with this new DVD adn from seeing the teaser here on Amazon, it looks like it's going to be a heck of a ride.

(The manual says you get WAY more pictures than that even from regular batteries.)I called HP, and they replaced it with another. That lasted for seven or eight months, then started killing batteries after one picture again. This is a serious problem and probably why they don't manufacture it anymore. At this point the camera's unusable, the second one to blow up on me. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Bacharach came in cracked case.","review":"I appreciated getting the CD so quickly. However, the packaging wasn't adequate.

My mother disposed of my LP without my permission and it is a joy to be able to hear this music again for this Bacharach fan. I am so glad that this CD was available on amazon.

Well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...a book about Canadian music","review":"This is definitely for provincial Canucks who are cheerleaders for our music scene. Face the facts, people---number one: nobody cares about Canadian music; number two: it sucks balls in comparison with the life-changing ear nectar that has come out of the US and UK.You really have to ask the writers of this book---why ever did you bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful collection","review":"This is an extraordinary book that finds its truths and lyricism in lives that seem to offer almost nothing. The stories are peopled by the clinically obese, retards, workers in dead-end jobs, the lonely, the handicapped: the smallest people alive. What's more, they're wise and self-aware enough to know who they are and how little they're owed. What saves them is love, or the possibility of it, of crumbs from love's table. Most of the stories deal with gay men or boys, but that should exclude no one from their power and, often, humour. I was touched and amused, and deeply impressed, by Banner's capacity to make the world he describes not only real but of value. I can't wait to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book about the 60's generation in Hollywood!","review":"I was able to purchase this book at the Denver Public Library yearly sale. One of the better written Hollywood memoirs you will ever read. As a recovering alcoholic and one who has pleasant memoirs of encounters with many individuals mentioned in the book, including Keenan Wynn, I recommend it to anyone who can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A inside spectator's view of Hollywood's goings-on.","review":"Ned(Neddy) Wynn, son to actor Keenan Wynn, puts an interesting spin on growing up with and near Hollywood's elite. The book covers his father's divorce from Eve Lynn Abbott and her eventual doomed marriage to actor Van Johnson. It is a very funny but, ultimately, tragic look at the life of a boy whose fortunes and misfortunes seemed to merely fall in his lap."},{"rating":"2","title":"and so horror was born...","review":"Commonly regarded as the first true masterpiece of the genre, The Avenging Conscience emerged from the cinematic vaults back in 1914.D.W. Griffith directed two other superb silent films--Birth of a Nation and Intolerance--both of which made AFI's top 100 movies of all time. They contain startling images that will leave a lasting impression.The Avenging Conscience is no less spectacular. The story is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart. A young man is driven to madness after committing murder.What's most amazing with this movie is the camera work. Ghosts floating through the room. Heavenly images superimposed in the clouds. Demons gathering in hell. There is a high level of surrealism and metaphors that make this film truly special. It all culminates into one creepy, ground-breaking piece of horror cinema. Highly recommended to silent film buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"not overly exciting","review":"and actually pretty boring in places. Some scenes go on way too long, and others are short and choppy. Sometimes you wonder what a particular scene is doing in the film at all (exotic dancers, bunnies????). Seems to always be a wind blowing across the sets, as drapes and papers are moving, the bird cage is constantly twirling. Falls far short of its billing as \\"The First Great American Horror Film.\\" Very disappointed in this one; does a disservice to Poe. If you want to see early psychological terror, check out the German Expressionism films of the early 1920s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear It and Sing It! : Exploring Modal Jazz","review":"Great vocal exeercises for jazz vocalists, can serve as warming exercises, great for intonation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and to the point","review":"This is a good book for beginners to learn the modes of the major scale.

Half the time, it takes 10-12 tries to get a DVD to \\"load,\\" meaning you have to open, close, wait; open, close, wait...There are also frequent skips and freeze-ups during playback. Apparently, it does not handle dual layer discs well at all.You get what you pay for. If you want headaches, buy this. If you want to watch DVD's spend another hundred dollars for a player that works!Another drawback: Apex apparently uses proprietary remote control codes, meaning you cannot program your cable or satellite remote's AUX function for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave as a gift.

Age range from 5-8. One boy & three girls. They do need umbrellas and these are pretty near perfect. The design for coloring in is easy. The markers very colorful. And the fin/shark topping all over cute. The best part is that each child can personalize theri umbrella. Different for everyone. And...something they will use again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to color. Fragile umbrella fabric.","review":"My daughters enjoyed coloring these. We had to be careful because the ink is of course permanent so expect to give supervision to small children the entire time they are coloring as this will stain anything it touches including your table. Use a piece of cardboard under the umbrella while coloring as the ink soaks through and stains the other side if you don't.My only complaint with this product is that the fabric was so thin. It tore through against the spines in two places the first time my kids took it out in the rain. Not as durable as I would have expected an umbrella built for kids to be. I had a little umbrella from when I was a girl that has stood up to 25 years of use, but these gave out in one day. That is a tragedy. Why don't manufacturers make things that will last anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so fun","review":"I got the umbrella and after a few weeks it broke and was it too bad to use.

The sound is much better than the \\"paper thin\\" standard-issue A&M discs, and, while representing Hiatt's peak period, \\"Greatest Hits\\" is by no means a complete pillage of the era, or of his lengthy catalog.

And his song \\"Before You Kill Us All\\" was just hilarious. I was surprised at the hilarity of it but at the same time it has a seriousness to it.This is definitely one country artist to add to your collection if you haven't already. And if you already have the artist's CDs then this is definitely an albulm to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't address cultural overlap.","review":"This book has several flaws. First, it perpetuates stereotypes about minority groups. Second, the authors seem to believe there is only one White culture. Third, the catch phrase \\"culturally different\\" is problematic. Different from what? White culture? There is no one White culture. Everything that White American culture is draws from other cultures; African, Asian and European. The premise of understanding cultural biases is good, however, the authors fail to present anything other than a superficial, stereotypical analysis of cultural biases in counseling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two authors who need counseling","review":"1. Being cited often is simply a perpetuation of several logical fallacies, the most egregious being argumentam ad populum.2. The work appears to be little better than a defective, biased polemic.3. I am white nordic. I guarantee you my cultural ancestry is not the same as white Italian or white Greek (like my wife).4. The only reason this book was cited so often is because for many years it was the only volume discussing the topic. Only-ness doesn't make it good.5. The 4-5 ethnicities in my wife's multi-cultural counseling class found the book to be extremely argumentative. The only benefit was arguing about which culture was most mis-represented.6. Good counselors are there to help not to impose their agendas on their clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"this book is blatantly racist against my white culture. I know that it is politically correct to denounce whites, but I'm not politically correct. I'm proud to be white, I'm proud of my heritage and I'm proud of my country. Being proud does not make me racist, just proud. Do you honestly think that if I moved to China or Japan or Mexico and demanded that those cultures rethink themselves to suit my sensitivities they would? They would laugh in my face. I can just imagine myself moving to Mexico and demanding that the Mexicans stop being Mexican and rewrite, rethink, redefine, and therefore, denounce their culture to make me feel comfortable. You think they would? If my dominant culture is so heinous, then why are we the country that so many come to live in. It would stand to reason that if my people are so oppressive, then people would try to get out!!I think we're pretty great. And I'm proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, some problems with it.","review":"This was required reading for a class I was taking in multicultural issues. It was very interesting but it was hard to read parts of it because of the nature of confronting our biases that the book addresses. I did have some issues with the way the book approached discussing the role of white people in society. It was almost as if the authors wanted me to feel bad about being white. Overall it was very informative and gave really good examples and implications for clinical use."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am not the kind of girl who should be in a place like this...","review":"Oh my goodness, all the things I could say about this - first, there's the cast. Patrick Wilson (Full Monty, Phantom), Gavin Creel (Thoroughly Modern Millie, Bounce), Sherie Rene Scott (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), and so many more greats. The setting is very 80's, but the music is timeless. The music is incredible, and the storyline can still be followed if you haven't seen the performance live. The themes discussed are universal - death, loneliness, choices, regrets, weakness. I highly recommend this album to those who are interested in Broadway music or the novel it is based on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Lights, Big City - The Upshot","review":"Let's call it; the material in this recording isn't great, but the performances will take your breath away. The laugh in the middle of \\"What a Perfect Feeling\\" between Patrick Wilson and Sherie Rene Scott (after she dazzles with \\"Kindness\\") is worth the purchase. And Christine Ebersole's \\"My Son\\" with her tricky, unusual vocal loops, will have you pressing repeat again and again. And Gavin Creel and his plea to his \\"Brother\\" soared through my car for weeks. Anne Marie Milazzo, as Jamie's mother, always has me up and dancing, \\"Happy Birthday Darling\\" - I mean, you need a song with a good tambourine beat, right? The other 23 songs are background color - but those 6 are priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best musical scores I've heard in a long time","review":"Not only does this recording feature an all-star Broadway cast - Patrick Wilson (The Full Monty, Oklahoma), Jesse L. Martin (Rent), Eden Espinosa (Wicked, Brooklyn, Rent), Sherie Renee Scott (Aida, Rent, The Last Five Years), just to name a few - but it preserves one of the best musical theatre scores in recent years. A contemporary rock score sung by some of Broadway's finest, BRIGHT LIGHTS offers a look at sex and drugs in 1984 without getting sappy or dated. This recording is a must for any fan of RENT, BARE, SPRING AWAKENING, or other rock-flavored musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story line & favorite songs","review":"This album has many really wonderful songs (and a few not so wonderful ones). It is a really passionate and inspiring story about a man with a cocaine problem grieving the death of his mother, broken hearted by his wife leaving him, and coping with the disappointments of his career. I am very glad I chose to purchase this album. It's a great addition to my vast music library of Broadway Show Tunes. Some of my favorite songs are: \\"I hate the French\\", \\"Kindness\\", & \\"Heart & Soul\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock Album","review":"I have only listened to this recording two times through, but I love it. The music and lyrics are so earnest [with the exception of Odeon, which I personally just don't like and garners this recording 4/5 stars] and the real star of this recording is Sherie Rene Scott, who is given beautiful music to showcase her phenomenal voice. Props to Gavin Creel and Christine Ebersole, as well. It's a great recording to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream cast, nightmare show","review":"All seems to be fair in love and rhymes in this show; some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard. The music? Okay, but can't make up for the soul-stricken lyrics. And what a waste of a great cast: Gavin Creel, Patrick Harris, Christine Ebersole. Why did they record this thing?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An example of studio to live evolution.","review":"A great live album, especially when you're able to hear Alan Wilder's reworkings of \\"Songs of Faith & Devotion.\\" His role as Depeche Mode's musical director definitely shines through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Moments","review":"Admittedly, purchased this item by accident. I ordered it through BMG years ago. I meant to order the studio version. I made myself listen, though. For someone who had previously disdained live album deviations from the relative perfection of studio production, this album opened my eyes. The wash of crowd response, especially to \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" and \\"I Feel You,\\" gave me shivers. I learned for the first time to appreciate a live album because of this \\"mistake.\\" The music does drag in places, but wherever the performance might lack, the production is still very well done. For these reasons, I give the overall album 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I'd say Depeche Mode's SOFAD Live is pretty much on par with its studio counterpart (with some minute exceptions; some for the better, but more for the worse). If you are racking your brain trying to decide which to buy, I advise the studio version, but I should point out that \\"I Feel You\\" and \\"Mercy in You\\" are slightly better and work better with the somewhat rougher recordings. Everything else's a different matter, though. The dodgey sound quality of the backing music to \\"In Your Room\\" and \\"Judas\\" does zero for either song and sound very bad compared to the polished studio versions. If you're a crazy DM completist, buy SOFAD Live, but it's not worth it.2.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Must-Have","review":"If there's any album in their entire catalog to be considered non-essential, this is a strong contender. It's not as though every track on the studio version of the album was a hit. Furthermore, die hard fans may be far more interested in some of the older material from previous tours. It can be argued that even though they were experimenting with a new sound, the public didn't care about it that much. If you make a list of what DM albums you want, place this at the bottom. It doesn't get any worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has the old Mode gone?","review":"Being a devout DM fan, I of course bought this album. My thinking was that 101 was outstanding, why shouldn't this be? I ordered it and waited for a long time. When it finally arrived at the door, I eagerly threw it into the stereo. I was greatly disappointed.So, lesson for all you other collectors out there: if you have to buy this, leave it until last. It sounds more like a warped recording than a great live concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I am a big fan of Depeche Mode but this album is unnecassary.

Bearing in mind that \\"SoFaD\\" was not exactly Depeche Mode's shining achievment, either in the songwriting or album performance department, you may find yourself asking, \\"what's the point?\\" You'd also be justified in asking said question, and the answer is, NONE.Given two stars becuase DM are a great live band, but \\"DM101\\" and \\"Devotional\\" will give you far more bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chutzpah","review":"Being an idle chap, I spend far too much time reading these reviews. A fav activity is to read some of the nonsense written about terrible albums. Why find out what someone thinks of Ok Computer, when I can find someone to praise steaming piles of doo-da like this?First of all, it's not a bad collection of songs. The album itself is rather good. But the idea of doing a copy of the original CD, 6 MONTHS after it was released blows my mind. The only possible rational is that things were getting a little tight around Maison Mode and they needed some extra dough to help out with their, ahem, medical expenses.Not that DM have ever been shy about cashing in. The 'In Your Room' single from this CD was one of the very first 3-Part CD singles. I remember seeing it in my local HMV in Brighton barely believing my eyes. Of course, now look on ebay and that same collection is now going for $20 (for each CD!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Album","review":"I haven't listened to this album since I got out of grad school ten years ago, but now that my iPod needs filling, I burned it onto my hard drive. Funny - the album art called up in Windoz Media player was wrong. Exploring the Web, I found out for the first time that DM released these songs twice, and I just happened to have bought the live version. Since I didn't know any better, I just enjoyed the music, which has the raw power of a live performance. I'd forgotten the sound, but I won't forget again. I sympathize with those who felt ripped off by the two releases, but if you didn't buy the first one, you should get the second one. And turn up the volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - no after warranty repair available","review":"I have a DCS-6620G and DCS-5300G. They both developed minor problems shortly after the 1 year warranty ran out. The DCS-6620G ethernet port failed and the DCS-5300G pan capability failed. I called DLink tech support and they told me that they will not repair these products or exchange them after the warranty, and that there are no authorized service centers. I escalated through 3 levels of tech support and then to US customer support and was given the same story and no way to get them repaired. The customer service lady stated that this was their policy on all products. They expect you to discard your $800 camera and buy another one. I recommend you don't buy any DLink product costing more that $100 - $200 as they are not very reliable and are disposable once they fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"I own the same watch but with the black dial, Purchased this one as a favor for a friend, You can read my review for the same watch in my other review.

But too many broad generalizations, no footnoting, and some facts are wrong (Marine Light Companies did go on Lexington/Concord March, Battle of Penobscot Bay had Marines, but main British units involved were the 72nd and 84th Foot). The book does have a pretty good bibliography.

The testimonials are completely ridiculous. It has almost no useful information. I honestly think that this publisher set out to publish a book that would just look good on amazon.com - like they just wanted to sucker people into buying a book that took almost no effort to write.

Very surprised at Amazon for listing this incorrectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable book","review":"I read this book many, many years ago but it has stuck in my memory like only a few others that have left a lasting impression. The main character is a timid and repressed small-town southern lawyer who wants to overcome his weaknesses and express himself as a real person for the first time in his life. He takes on a case defending a black youth accused of a crime, which puts him at odds with the local white community. His progress in coming out of his shell and asserting himself, and, ultimately, the limits on that progress are well described. The book is a good character study, not only of the lawyer but also of the make-up of small town life and the people who populated them at one point in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"Very good case, if not great. Offers great protection, does not interfere with any ipod function what so ever. I have tried many cases and skins,etc...I thought this would just be another case on my search for the best one. Well my journey stops here. This is the ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"If u like lint, Perfect... If Not, Pretty Good","review":"This Ipod case looked amazing on ISkins web site. When i got it, it had dust and lint on it in the unopened box. After you clean it and put it on a clean dresser, it will find lint and dust u've never seen before. It literally makes me think that lint brushes should be made of this material...Other than the lint \\"problem\\" (understatement), the case is amazing. Perfect protection/bulkiness compromise (not too bulky at all with superb protection). Maybe the lint doesn't show up as much on other colors than black but it'll definitely pick it up..Lastly, do not order this from Iskin's website. They take up to 4 weeks to ship. I ordered this with 2 day shipping from Apple.com and it actually came in one day. Call Apple.com and ask what colors are ready to ship immediately if u want this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evo3 OVERRATED","review":"I bought this case and placed it on ebay as soon as I tried it. Although it provides VERY good protection for the the iPod, unforunately there is absolutely nothing stylish about this case. It appears that very good quality materials were used (hence the 3 stars) but the design is very crude and industrial. The plastic cover attracts fingerprint VERY easily. Looking at it I felt I was looking at a piece of black brick. The ad picture looks much better than the actual case. I also felt that the belt clip (it doesnt really \\"clip\\", the width is set) does not help secure the case on very well especially if one would use it during workouts. The clip also felt very fragile.I was compelled to post a review on here because I really expected to like this case. I am looking for both functionality and good design. This case did not deliver. I am disappointed. I am giving the Microglove case a try. I will post a review on that one when I receive it in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all satisfied","review":"I'm honestly puzzled that anyone could be happy with this case. First of all, it is very difficult to insert the iPod into the iSkin, and the iSkin does not fit tightly over the plastic insert. I cannot get it to stay wrapped around the iPod, the edges keep peeling back. Secondly, there is no hole in the iSkin to access the hold button, which I would assume many iPod owners make frequent use of. On the whole, this seems to me a poorly designed and overpriced product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case","review":"The outer part was a 1 piece glove.

It has a hole in the thin silicone over the hold button, which tore the one and only time I used the hold switch. The flap for covering the plug at the bottom of the ipod has also begun tearing at both sides of its edges. Also, some dirt has managed to get in under the clickwheel and screen plastic, but it is minimal.I'll probably end up replacing the case with yet another evo3, however, since the case is fantastic otherwise. I even like the clip and use it regularly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lean clean protecting machine","review":"I have had several different brands of iPod cases before I finally sucked it up and ordered an iSkin, and I can say without a doubt that iSkins are far superior to their competitors. Like a rubber skin, it is durable and easy to hold. However, the polymers used in the skin makes it resistant to getting all of those fuzzy things stuck to it, which is a big plus for me since my iPod is carried in several different bags. The screen protector hasn't gotten a scratch yet (after 4 months) and neither has my iPod's screen. It does a remarkable job of staying clean. I had to clean it for the first time the other day (after 4 months). The case completely covers everything, but has no extra junk so it fits nicely in your hand. The headphone opening works great with my Sony MDR150 headphones. I highly recommend this case. I have had no problems with it whatsoever and it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ubeatable iPod skin.","review":"Simply the best! Looks, protection, skin-tight fit - i've tried others on my 3G & 4G iPods but this skin simply beats the competition. I first choose a black one for my black iPod but it was predictably opaque and looked heavy - impossible to tell what color iPod was underneath. so I opted for a semi-transparent version.Just a minor gripe - too bad this splendid iSkin isn't also available in fully-transparent mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"skip the rest & buy the best","review":"This is the best iPod cover that I have seen. After purchasing another cover based on a store salesperson's recommendation which left me with a scratched iPod face, I did some research and bought this. The case looks nice, fits well, completely protects the face from being scratched. Which is key with the video iPod. Why would you want to look at video through a scratched face? This case maybe more expensive than most but it really is worth it. My only complaint is that the shipping took way too long and they never sent me a shipping confirmation until the thing was sitting on my doorstep. So definitely SKIP the expedited delivery, it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool skin","review":"This skin worked great. I was skeptical the wheel would still work being covered and it did so just fine. Only thing is you loose that slick feel of the wheel when circling around so sometimes wasn't the smoothest navigating, but the ipod never failed to recognize and it was nicely protected as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"I did a lot of research on iPod cases before choosing this case. I initially looked at the metal cases thinking they'd be stronger, but most of the reviews noted that the internal fits weren't always good, and you ended up scratching the iPod with the case itself. In the case of the iSkin eVo3, the case is a rubberized sleeve that the iPod snugly fits into, and then the clear cover fits in above it. It's a little hard to get the cover to fit in the channels the first time, but with a little work it's in and you never have to touch it again. The only negative to the case is that the hold button is completely covered and you have to set it 'through' the casing, which is a little tough, but very easy to acclimate to. I highly recommend this case if you have a video iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cover and Very Flexible.....","review":"This is one of a kind.

Some nice songs such as Break the Chain, World of Mirrors, The Low Hum of Machines, and the remarkable Love Changes This. Very life-affirming music, though I am not entirely sure that the band had all that much to say beyond relatively obvious observations. As I implied, it's not a very challenging album, though I suspect that that wasn't the point, and would probably distract.

This was our first pass at fixing one of our Toto toilets which are 10 years old. We now realize that Toto has products specific to them and for a good reason!

And, listen, I was a fan, but I've got to give an honest review. This music is so sappy that it's embarrassing to listen to -- unless you're a 15yr old girl (and hey, maybe that's their market now). I couldn't even get through the entire CD twice! Where's the punch and anger that drove their 1st CD? I wasn't expecting grunge (we all know that that's dead), but these songs have absolutely zero edge. The writing is silly and rehashed, and is reminiscent of the late 80s post-glamrock ballad frenzy (ever heard of Tesla?).

They never fail to write lots of great songs about the rain. This song has at least two rain references, maybe more, but I don't feel like getting the CD to look. The two best songs are \\"It's Alright\\" (\\"long cold days or rain\\", that's what I'm talkin' about!) and \\"Sometimes\\", which has one of my favorite lines ever, \\"Block out that sunny day\\". I love that line, I almost go into cardiac arrest every time I hear it. I thought I was the only one who wanted that to happen. I still like this second behind the debut, because \\"Rain\\" is my all-time favorite song, but fans of the wet stuff have gotta have this too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Critic Review","review":"Hey, it's on Madonna's label, it must be important. HAPPY PILLS is an artistically schizophrenic record for Candlebox, who've previously been lumped squarely in the alt-rock category. The band moves from the Collective Soul-ish \\"10,000 Horses\\" to the thrashing Tool-style rhythms of the title tune to an almost Pearl Jam-esque power ballad (\\"Blinders\\") without stopping to catch a breath. That's not to say there are no connecting elements here, the brash guitars and raw, rock-god vocals that are the band's trademark are present throughout. It just seems as though Candlebox are trying to play on a wider sonic field on HAPPY PILLS. Fans shouldn't fret though; ultimately the old adage applies: once a Candlebox always a Candlebox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Then and 8 Years Later","review":"If you are considering this album feel reassured that your money will go to great music. If you loved the first C'box CD, then you will enjoy this one. There is considerable debate as to which is better. The first is more raw and powerful. This one is more diverse and professional. Martin's vocals don't get any better than this and probably won't with time. \\"A Stone's Throw Away\\" is one of the best blues rock songs ever recorded. The vocals and guitar work are unbelievable. While there are numerous top-notch songs like Happy Pills and 10,000 Horses, a sure fire hit was \\"Sometimes\\". It was idiosy not to have released this one. One day someone will cover it and make a mint. C'box recently re-formed. I hope they are able to bring to life some of these gems with their new tour. Buy the album and see them in concert.

Mirror is very adjustable (arm and mirror itself swivel as needed) and seems to stay where you put it. Vibration has very little effect on all but the bumpiest roads.Depending on your glasses, the mirror can be somewhat hard to figure out how to mount, but generally once you find out how you need to do it, it's no problem.

I could easily see his blinker going, so I waved him on ahead of me, and he purposely turned his head after doing so to acknowledged me and thanked me.

At this point the arm for the mirror extends forward only 1-1/4 inches. It will work on aviation style sunglasses but really who bicycles with this type of eyewear?The company, Bicycles Safety Inc., should have provided a longer arm, about 2 inches longer, which would have enabled the Third Eye Bicycle Mirror to work on both flat (by moving it further back along the temple) and curved sunglasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"No functional details","review":"Unfortunately this product does not come with any details on how to attach it to your sunglasses.

And of course the songs and poems all relate to seasons,animals and plants of the northern hemisphere. There are still useful bits of information for me but I have to pick and choose carefully. Some of the festivals refer more to the christian history rather than the celtic or pagan origins for example under the heading\\"Candlemas\\" there is no mention that it is the Celtic festival of First Light instead it refers only to \\"...the feast of the presentation of Christ in the Temple...\\"etc. As a non-christian this turns me off.

It does not toast both sides of the bread evenly no matter what setting. You have to turn the slice while you stand there and watch it! The size of the slots are too short for many of today's breads. Often times the bread needs to be pushed down after starting the toaster. The crumb tray is a joke. The stainless steel is hard to keep clean. It is so poorly constructed you can see the heating elements through cracks that also allow a lot of the heat to escape. However, it does defrost on the defrost setting & the heating element is very hot and red unlike other toasters. It does ok on bagels.

She doesn't know who to side with.This series is by far my avorite series I have ever read. I love how Lisi Harrison describes the characters and how she made them act. The suspense and how fun this book is really makes me want to read all of the other ones. You can't just stop after you read one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was basically a piece of trash. Unlikeable characters, superficial plots, the whole works. I'm not even sure why I continued to read these books. If you like hollow superficial characters who whine about how unpopular they are or how they're favorite Gucci bag isn't in stock and if you enjoy reading all about designer items then this book is for you. I'll admit the second book has a cliff hanger which is why I read the third but these girls are mean and they never learn. The only reason I'm giving this book two stars is because I think I'd be a total hypocrite if I only gave it one star because I bought the books. Like Gossip Girl and the A-List (which, I'll admit, I have not read) these books seem to be following a trend in superficialness. I enjoyed reading the details, but can you really base a whole book on details? I don't think so. If you really want to read something like this, go ahead, I'd be a hypocrite if I told you I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"ECH!","review":"HOly crap, this book, this entire SERIES is the worst one I have ever read.

This book is an interpersonal relationship fiction novel that shows teenage girls how to avoid fighting between Cliques. I believe that this novel has outdone both the other Clique novels. This book dives deep into the plot exposing the 5 girls true charectoristics and allow them to I would rate this book 4 out 5 stars because this is due to the way it shws how cliques really do act and how to avoid making fights with difficult groups of people. This book would be appropriate for anyone who has read and enjoyed any other books by Lisi Harrison and also for any teenage girls even though they may not be as popular or where as much designer clothes as other girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great.","review":"This book is so great, I hardly find it realistic but they are good none the less.

With sophmoric plot lines \\"Ehmahgod, they stole our box and won the fashion show?!\\". Grating, constant name dropping (yes we get it, you're cool because you drink starbucks and have a sick obsession with becoming famous with no talent, very chic.) I myself am just a few years older then these girls (14 on Sunday) and come from an upper-middle class neighborhood but I'm not anything like these kids, and neither are any of the other people I know. Lisi Harrison is living out a far-fetched uber-bitch teen dream that in the early novel was slightly refreshing with it's lack of retribution for the snobs but is now just annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Teen Novel Ever","review":"This book is a real page turner. I loved it. I read it every chance I had. The characters and plot are so realistic. I couldn't put it down. Best Book Ever!

Curtis Mayfield provided the soundtrack for my life. I follwed him through all the phases of his career, from his \\"Minstrel\\" phase, through his \\"Civil Rights\\" period, his social consciouness/radical period and finally his \\"love groove\\" phase. All of those periods are represented here save the \\"Superfly\\" soundtrack. Why no one tackled those tunes is unknown to me, probably publishing rights squabbles.Most of the works here are good if not great. Highlights for me are BB King's \\"The Woman's Got Soul\\", Aretha's, \\"The Making's of You\\", Phil Collin's haunting and soulful \\"Keep on Trying\\" and lastly Stevie Wonder's joyouns \\"I'm the one that Loves You\\". No slouches on this album. From Springsteen to Lenny Kravitz they're here and they represent.

This actually could have been a very good story, however, the way it was written was too...slow. The story was more focused on the mystery than the romance. In fact, we don't see much romance until 3/4 of the way through! Until that, all they do is have one kiss, and continue telling each other that they don't love each other anymore. But it's not even that they vehemently deny it, with tension and arguments that are heated with sexual tension and emotion, it's just...bland. It's not even sad. Camp can do, and has done, better than this. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as some of her other books","review":"I was sadly disappointed in this novel from Candace Camp. There was no sexual chemistry between the hero and heroine and it was pretty easy to tell early on who the villain was. ** of out ***** from this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok read, just not up to the previous books in this series","review":"Being a big fan of Candace Camp I was a bit disappointed in this novel following along with Reed of the \\"mad\\" Morelands. I believe Anna's character was a bit too forceful and yet on the complete opposite was Reed's character. While male 'feelings' are applausible, his heart on the sleeve and begging left me thinking what a wimp. I would have like the hero if he didn't grovel so much for any affection from Anna, did he have no pride? The story itself was interesting and given society's views on mental illness, believable. Looking forward to the next Moreland's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"I have read a few of Candace Camps novels and have never not finished one.

What a disappointment! There is nothing original in this compilation of re-hashed country songs. I was particularly looking forward to hearing the vocal stylings of Ms. Potter, since I had read reviews that praised her voice as silvery, pure, and full of feeling. Once again i was let down.

This unit works perfectly for the second. It's kinda bulky, though - I wish they made a physically smaller unit, as that would be more convenient for carrying on airplanes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"I was very puzzled. A number of hotels were not listed, nor were quite likely the majority of restaurants. In the former category I would offer the Raddison Admiral which I like mostly for its location.

My only concern is that it seems to a mix and match effort and put together manually. You have different kinds of condoms alright, though they are manufactured in different countries i.e. Thailand, India, etc. with different manufacturing dates. It almost makes you feel that someone collected all the unsold condoms from different drug stores, opened up the boxes and repackaged them! So the handling has me a little worried. Also, some of the varieties of condoms included did not seem to have enough lubrication and felt very dry. The highlight though are the rings. They are a lot of fun and my girlfriend and I had a blast with them! Overall good value for money with some small quirks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be buying again!","review":"This product comes with a great storage container.

The publisher likes short books where the reader does not need to think. Books about puppy dogs, kittens,Tex-Mex chile recipes and how wonderful it was growing up in the 1950s under segregation in south Texas.Believe me segregation was not the good old days.

His ear for dialog and dialect is staggering. His description of everything, I mean EVERYTHING, is unerring, uncannily so. His ability to set a (mostly) dark and somber mood is (literally) scary. But I don't know what the book was about. I guess it was about a lot of things. No matter to me: I just enjoyed reading it. I enjoyed the suspense, the symbolism, the gothic emotion, the rawness of it. I've read several McCarthy books.

He was hire by Saddam Hussein regime to make a big hit, big enough to startle the West.The story is quick-paced, you can read it without straining your brain or memory too much.

Recreated quotes reminisce made-for-grade school stories, yet hollow and stereotypical characters go on big-time drinking binges and grow 'harder than Chinese arithmetic' over the ladies. More disappointing is that one must read between the lines to discover what's most fascinating about 1940s/50s-era football - that the national champion was chosen BEFORE the bowl games (imagine THAT before BCS), that players played on both sides of the ball, that there were no designated field goal kickers, and heaps of other subtleties that have faded away as college football has 'grown.' Perhaps there was a rush to get this out while the 2000 Sooners team was STILL undefeated and national champions. It takes time to make a winner, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"I try to read every college football book that I can get my hands on.

This may well be the best of them all. Although the era chronicled in this story ended before my birth, I now feel like I know intimately many of these characters (and let's face it - many of them WERE characters) who before were merely names and faces I had seen in old photographs.I don't have time to read many books. This was well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great zinc for pyrolurics","review":"I had zinc prescribed because I have pyroluria.

Such items are all made in China these days, and the switches all break after a few years. Having replaced the fixture once (with another bad one made in China), I really didn't feel like buying another one and installing it - knowing that it would also break in short order.No problem. Screwed this thing into the socket and I now have a light again. And the switch at least feels like it's going to last a while. If it breaks, I can just unscrew it and screw in a new one. One of life's little hassles solved and the wife is pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and shipping speed","review":"Bought this piece to have a plug in my attic without having to rewire anything.

In my situation, I have a light fixture mounted (horizontally) above the door in the wall of a closet, not the ceiling. The switching device is designed so that any pull on the chain that is not coming directly down and out of its hole creates a lot of friction or stress on the mechanism. Wall-mounted fixtures create a \\"side pull\\" out of the hole of this product whenever you pull down on the chain to turn it on or off. It feels like the switch would work fine if it was hanging from the ceiling (vertically) because the chain moves more freely."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable, only for ceiling lamps","review":"The way the chain is connected makes it difficult to pull unless your lamp is hanging from the ceiling.I had a table lamp so after pulling the chain a few times it disconnected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"The chains pull out so I had to take them off and use the original button to turn.

I read the first 2 chapters and only skimmed the rest before deciding to return it. Even though it's a recent book, it covers in part technology that's 20 years old, so the title is misleading. On the new technology, it only skims the surface, not really going into details as any book on 802.x would for half the price. As far as how 802.x and 3G cellular networks and devices (UMTS, IMS) are going to co-exist and converge, it's silent.

No tests, no experiments, no psychological research other than Dr. Hartman's personal observations. The information in this book is useless and repetitive. You will be confined to a core motive, and will be stuck with all the flaws and strengths of that color.

While working with Taylor he continually blamed others for his mistakes and continually bad mouthed the people that worked for him. He treats those that sell his product with utmost disrepect and disdain and does not pay what he promises. He also does not honor his word or his money back guarantee. It is my opinion that a man who cannot run his own office should certainly not be teaching others to run theirs. I will never use Mr. Hatrman's product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total BS","review":"I'm with \\"Psychologist\\" (Utah) and also \\"Kailinn\\" (Detroit).

I have not read the work of Stephen Covey, as Psychologist reommends, but I can definitely and strongly recommend \\"The New Personality Self-Portrait\\" by Oldham and Morris instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this book is still in print","review":"A parlour game gone mad. Even the author disavowed much of this book when he wrote a (non-successful) sequel years later. Many charitable professionals feel this book was a misguided attempt at labeling, which in itself is a misguided (at best) way to limit oneself, and others. Some I've talked to think the four personality types the author describes may actually be based on how Mormons address their congregations(?). Regardless, I have found numerous people who loved this book and, for example, labeled themselves as \\"emotional.\\" They then excuse themselves for all manner of irrational, \\"emotional\\" behavior. One woman (sadly, a relative) had actually fallen into a serious psychosis based upon that label. I highly discourage reading this book. If you prefer popular psychology, please read one of Stephen Covey's books instead. You and yours will be happier for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Fun","review":"I was resistent to the whole idea at first.

I'm a big fan of hidden camera comedy but I've laughed harder at shows like Candid Camera or The Jamie Kennedy Experiment. The pranks you get in \\"meet the creeps\\" are done by guys who you would expect what they call \\"pranks\\" to be their normal behavior, so they weren't getting reactions out of people.You can tell the people they were playing pranks on were preassuming their behavior just based on how they look, so the reactions out of them were just lame, not outrageous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely cruel comedy","review":"Florentine has done it again. With a video followup of his hillarious Terrorizing Telemarketers CD series, the star voice of Comedy Central's Crank Yankers has dug just a little deeper into the depths of comedy with Meet the Creeps. Norton, Club Soda Kenny, Artie Lang and others team up to brutalize innocent people with hidden camera's. Don't be fooled though, this isn't Candid Camera, as the creators say \\"There are no happy endings\\" unless your one of the Creeps or a fan like myself. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves comedy taken to new limits. Well actually there were no limits here, I laughed from start to finish.

Some of the scenes are funny, but others veer off into pointless misanthropic exploits. The scene with the magazine stand was funny until the guy decided to yell about sex acts involving feces...then I just felt dirty. How is it funny to verbally and physically abuse a retarded person? It's not, but that's what they do in one of the scenes. Hidden camera stunts should be about having fun with people, but too many of these scenes are just no fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is two movies in one.

A good tourist guide equals superior maps. The idea of printing maps on silver backgrounds, as they are in this book, was ill advised to say the least. The maps are almost illegible in most lights and the print is so small that a magnifying glass is needed if you don't have near perfect eyesight. I collect travel guides, so I don't mind owning this good looking one, however, if you really need to actually travel in Tokyo I recommend \\"Lonely Planet Tokyo\\" and \\"Tokyo City Atlas: A Bilingual Guide\\". They are much more useful and traveler friendly. In a city as complicated as Tokyo, every little bit helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible guide!","review":"Arrived in Tokyo with this guidebook and quickly realized I would be better off without it. The printing I have (2001) is not only hard to read and follow, but there are multiple misprints and incorrect page references. The big selling point of the book is the ability to correlate hotels, restaurants, attractions and nightspots based on page references. Many of these were wrong. The references for Tokyo bay restaurants send you to the page with Ginza hotels! Spend more time seeing Tokyo and less time staring at this book. My copy is sitting in a trash can in Tokyo. I recommend any other guidebook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love the old songs","review":"I had forgotten Stevie Nicks' beautiful voice.

The additional 2 mixes of Landslide are very cool and very much worth the cost of the CD even if you are a FM/SN fan because they aren't available all on one album anywhere else.

This is possibly the best Sinatra performance ever captured, with Frank singing with a small, intimate sextet. He sings some brilliant, obscure songs (Moonlight In Vermont), but the sound quality is so poor that i cannot listen to this recording on my High Fidelity system. This CD has been relegated to 'car CD only' status for me.Please, someone give the masters to Rudy Van Gelder and let him work his magic. It's a disgrace that the Sinatra family hasn't remastered what is possibly Sinatra's finest performance ever recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SHOWMAN!","review":"The sound on this is better than on the Australian concert with Red Norvo which itself is worth getting as well. This offers a more intimate venue and Frank phrases in a more imaginative way on many numbers. He jokes about the onion soup and sleeping in the park when he has some problems with phlegm. My overall impression is what I would say is true of any live performance I have heard...Frank was simply a great showman who gave his all in every performance and never sold the audience short. When playing this back to back with a live Vic Damone CD, Frank's mastery of his material and indelible personality come through whereas Vic has a great set of pipes as Frank said,but he doesn't quite know what to do with them. When Vic uses dynamics he goes from a soft whisper to shouting which seems too obvious..and he doesn't know what to do with the lyric. I still like Vic, but more as a ballad singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used Watch Sent","review":"Purchased this watch for my husband for father's day. The watch turned out to be used.

There's so much variety on her CD that I listen to it all the time, it's got so many different flavors from dance to R&B, soul, pop, reggae, you name it. I love the way her voice sounds so emotionally-charged on each track, from sexy soulful ballads to powerful dance tracks, her voice moves you with emotion & energy.

Fortunately, the author has clearly documented not only the stories of survivors, but the atmospheric conditions that existed during the event and the struggles of attempting forensic meteorology. Considering how sparse the data is for an event so far in the past, I'm pleased that the author was able to accomplish this much. Events like this will happen again and, much to my disappointment, there is no way to determine if the Tri-State tornado was one single tornado track (which it appears to be) or a family of large, violent long-track tornadoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Dehumanizer'part two...","review":"This is a true follow up to the fruit of Black Sabbath's brief 1992 reunion.A change in direction for Dio,with more present-centered,issue-based lyrics,rather than the fantastic themes of the past.A different guitar player brought a fresh and vey aggressive sound,even if different from the fast and melodic chops of 'Dream Evil',but what really stands out here is Jeff Pilson's out-of-this-world bass work.Only for the open-minded Dio fan..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crush your Skull!","review":"Listen to \\"Jesus, Mary and the Holy Ghost.\\" This song shreds, and was even more incredible live.

This album makes the '90-something Sabbath reunion album Dehumanizer look inspired (and that's f*cking scary). This album is purile & putrid. Tracy G is one of those guitarists that thinks he's good but he isn't. His tone is irritating. His style is slop. His solos are vomit! Jesus, Mary & The Holy Ghost is the only saving grace of this entire album. Definitely a bargain-bin bummer.

Very heavy, very aggressive music. I loved Dehumanizer and I feel the same way about this disc. Unlike the production of most Dio albums (whcih are pretty dry compared to most metal albums), producer Mike Fraser buffs this album until it shines. Rhienhardt Mack gave that same quality to Dehumanizer. Standout tracks for me include the title track, Evilution, Give Her the Gun, and Bring Down the Rain. This CD is Dio at his skull-crushing best. He would later return to more melodic metal with Killing The Dragon and Magica (both excellent discs), but for me this disc has a little something extra and is a high point in the Dio canon. Others may disagree, so I'll chalk that up to \\"personal taste.\\" Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS ALBUM","review":"1 of RJD's under-rated albums IMO. i never hear metal fans even mention strange highways.

Maybe I'm a slower study than the others who reviewed this book, but learning seems quite inefficient. This is because grammar is not explained well (often times the explanations are incomplete, or the reader is told to just \\"study these examples\\") and the topics seem to bounce around. That's unfortunate, because Basque is so different from English. A more intuitive unfolding of grammar would help the reader a lot. I've learnt Greek and Japanese with greater ease, and I would guess that those languages are just as difficult for the native English speaker. Unfortunately, there's really not much of a choice for anyone who wants to learn Basque -- there's just nothing out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"More romance than suspense","review":"This book is more of a romance novel than a suspense.

I would have given it five stars, but we find the introduction by Billy Idol at the start of the last track, \\"I want to grow old with you,\\" which is dialog from the movie, to be distracting and it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just want to hear the song, which I mentioned was the absolute favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile read for Calvinists and Arminians alike","review":"Having been studying this field for a couple years, I found there to be a huge range of variations in both camps.

I recommend this to my friends there because it gives a clear, logically consistent explanation of their view, yet is concise.The average lay Calvinist only needs to read pages 21-33. The average lay Arminian should read 21-64.

There are the requisite number of chases, strange-looking people following them, adventures and misadventures for this book to join the others in the enjoyable Mrs. Pollifax series. The one thing that puzzles me is why Dorothy Gilman had her heroine marry Cyrus in one of the early books and then have him serve as background, always off on his own business when Emily does another assignment for the CIA.

This went away after a few weeks of daily use, though - I suppose that at this price point, the fit between components is not perfect, there is some flex and such, and the thing needs some use to settle in. Now mine seems to be settled in, and having stacked weights on it a few times with the same results makes me confident that it has enough accuracy and repeatability for its intended purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good scale","review":"It is an okay scale.

The beer can chicken, the tequila shrimp, the texas rub. There are excellent technique descriptions throughout the book that describe how to do various things correctly right down to making the proper grill marks on a steak.

But before you start gnawing on the pages of this opus to outdoor cooking, try a few of the recipes. You'll find, as I have, that not only are each of Chef Purviance's creative masterpieces relatively easy to prepare, but that they can be paired to create multi-course meals from appetizers to dessert. The range of toothsome delights in the Big Book not only includes every conceivable food group, but also reflects the culinary traditions of dozens of grill-crazy cultures.

In this novel Jaime B stays clear of his regular themes- homosexuality and bisexuality and relates a wonderful story of a writer who hires a maid who is an illiterate woman in her fifties. Julio Beltran, the protagonist is intrigued by her past and decides to help Mercedes find her mother who sold her when she was young girl. Intertwined in this main story, we get a sense of the class structure in Peru, social issues and Julio's personal strife which is a possible reflection of Jaime Bayly's plight with his own family.Y de repente an angel, is well written, intriguing and captivating. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy Jaime Bayly's writing style or to anyone who is looking for a novel with an interesting plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"Bayly leaves behind his traditional topics (homo-erotism, homosexuality, bisexuality) to bring a beautiful story in a well constructed novel. Once again, Bayly is somewhat autobiographical, and describes the life of a young writer and former journalist (Julian Beltran) who has differences with his parents. While living in his native Peru, Julian develops a deep relationship with his maid Mercedes, a relationship that leads to a journey into Mercedes's past and into Julian's own feelings. As usual, Bayly's characters are well delineated. The complexity of human nature is demonstrated. And the musicality of Bayly's writing is well shown.I would recommend this novel to everyone who enjoys a good novel (who doesn't?), especially all those who admire Bayly's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Libro de primaria","review":"Termine este libro porque no me gusta dejar un libro sin terminar por mas malo que sea.

I confirmed the problem by going back to some old shampoo I had in a swim bag and my hair was back to normal. I called their customer service and they sent me a coupon for a new bottle (tho it was only good for a month and I never got to use it).What I really want is the old formula back!

I've been using the new formula for about 1.5 months and the misses has commented on my hair feeling more coarse now (without me having voiced to her my displeasure from the new formula).In addition, as someone who has been Subscribed to this product, I feel like the change in formula warrants this product being listed as a totally new product and that my Subscription should not have purchased this item.That said, I love the pump that the new bottle comes with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History Made Personal","review":"This book makes history come alive.

The first half of the book can only be described as plodding. When the mystery finally came into play, there were really no clues presented only references to what progress was not being made. The ending was no surprise as it could pretty well be deduced about 2/3 of the way through. I would have given up on it about 1/3 of the way through, but I figured there must be something coming up that would be redeeming. The rest of the book was only a slight improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Mystery","review":"Anne Perry's first of the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series is a delightful period piece, not only for the mystery, but also for the depiction of late 19th century Victorian England and the strict caste system of the time.Characters are depicted very skillfully, so much so that when Grandmama is shipped off--finally!--to Susannah's care, I wanted to toss my kindle in the air and do a happy dance. Layer, by layer, the superficial personas of the time are stripped away to reveal the real people underneath. A bit too much wallowing in emotional angst at times, but not so much so that the book was ruined.The plot, such as it was, was more a psychological thriller than a police procedural, and very satisfactory as a cozy British mystery. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cater Street Hangman","review":"Slow to begin with but good! Very well done to provide the reader with the Victorian era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victorian mystery!","review":"The charm of this book is in it's setting. The charming part is that Victorian England is a main character in the book. I enjoyed this book because not only are you engaged in a good mystery but you also learn about everyday life during that time period. Overall I liked the book, the character's were well rounded and at time's the mystery takes a back seat to the character's development throughout the book. I would recommend this book to those who love mysteries, and those who like historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good example of 19th century life","review":"Over the years, I heard such good things about Anne Perry that I decided to sit down one afternoon and browse through her first book. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. She plays well with the atmosphere of the 19th century, also describing well the cast system that was existing at the time. Oh yeah, there's also a good mystery in there. Pitt is an interesting character that I'm sure will be well developped in the next books. A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Victorian Colombo","review":"I thought this book dragged at first, but then it picked up. I think I will enjoy the Charlotte and Pitt mysteries. Pitt reminded me of Columbo and I enjoyed that image in my mind while reading this.

I'm looking forward to reading her second novel in the Charlotte and Pitt series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather slow","review":"I found this book (in audio format) to be quite slow. More then halfway thru the book I wondered when the \\"mystery\\" part would kick in. The murders, police, and investigation were very much in the background, and rather than spend time on the mystery I was treated to tidbit after tedious tidbit about an upper middle class lady's life in Victorian England. I personally think the greatest mystery is why so many people find this book wonderful and fascinating. If you prefer gripping and gritty even in historical mysteries, this series is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but...","review":"This novel is semi-entertaining. It is set in Victorian England and \\"stars\\" Thomas Pitt and Charlotte Ellison (the soon-to-be Mrs. Pitt). The best thing about this book is Perry's attention to the historical setting, especially in regard to class structure. However the actual mystery is lacking, and I figured out who the murderer was quite early on in the novel.The most shocking thing about this novel actually has nothing to do with the story, but rather about the author. I was very surprised to learn (after reading several more of her works), that Anne Perry is actually a murderer herself (her real name is Juliet Hulme), and was convicted when she was 15 years old of killing her friend's mother. [...] or watch the movie Heavenly Creatures. Whether justified or not, this revelation has soured me toward future Perry novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"A Victorian mystery? Really? Neither Victorian nor a mystery, I fear. The representation of Victorian society is appallingly inept - inaccurate and exaggerated - and the mystery could have been unravelled by a not-very-bright child. Worst of all, though, is the incompetent attempt at characterisation. The women are so poorly written that they are only distinguishable by name, and the men are heavy-handed collections of mannerisms and stock attitudes. Inauthentic tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing so bad it was painful.","review":"The writing and storytelling in this book was so unoriginal, it read like a parody. This could have been an overacted, overdramatized skit on SNL. And if the style of writing wasn't bad enough, the villain was obvious well before reaching the halfway mark of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately overpriced by publisher","review":"I am often disappointed to find that I am not able to justify buying a novel I have very much enjoyed, like Anne Perry's mysteries, for my Kindle due to the unreasonably high prices that the publishers seem to want to inflict on the buying public. Perhaps they wish to discourage readers from using e-books, since the cost of the novels are sometimes even higher for the e-books than for the same material in a paperback. I have a library of close to a thousand books, mostly in paperback, which I eventually want to convert to the e-book versions, but I am not able to do this due to the costs. The publishers will need to get on the electronic media train, because it will, in time, either carry them into the future or run them down and crush them."},{"rating":"1","title":"creeps me out","review":"I had known about anne perry's homicidal activity before I ever read a book by her. Maybe that's why this book creeps me out so much. In a debate over nature vs. nurture, ms. perry clearly is on the side of nurture. She interminably bludgeons one with observations that OTHER people drive you to crime either by driving you crazy or bringing you up poorly. She may be a social critic but I really don't know if her depictions of morals and manners of her stories' times are even accurate! Perhaps she understands the criminal mind better than others do but she seems to leave little room for personal responsibility or the power of love. I wonder why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Back to the Beginning","review":"I had read many of the books in the Pitt series, but my library did not have this one. It was worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late to the party","review":"I have just recently discovered Anne Perry and Charlotte and Thomas Pitt..and boy am I delighted! I enjoy these books very much. I really enjoy how Ms. Perry introduces us to new characters. I live Aunt Vespasia, and am glad that Charlotte and Emily's relationship continues to grow despite their change in station. Irecommend these to mystery lovers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could'nt put it down","review":"This was a wonderful historical mystery, it is the beginning of Charlotte Ellison and Inspector Thomas Pitt's romance. A madman is garroting women at night on Cater Street. These women are a mixture of classes, both maids and young ladies of the family. When the Ellison's maid is murdered Inspector Pitt goes to their home to question the family and that is where he meets Charlotte. Things progress and each develops feelings that neither will admit until the final murder occurs. A well written storyline and great characters make this a great book.Thank Net Galley and Random House Publishing Group."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"I enjoy every anne perry novel and having sent sometime in England myself, enjoy the insight into victorian culture; the end was a surprise"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to the series","review":"I stumbled across a newer Anne Perry book recently, did some research and found this series about Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. I decided to start at the beginning with The Cater Street Hangman. The first 15-20% of the book is a bit slow, but after that, it really picks up. The murder mystery is very intriguing, as well as the time period the book is set in. I also love the character of Charlotte, who is not yet Mrs. Pitt in this book. I am looking forward to reading the next in the series, Callandar Square. I would definitely recommend this to fans of murder mysteries and historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte & Thomas meet for 1st time in the series","review":"Having read a few Anne Perry novels I decided to read the Pitt series in order. We are introoduced to Charlotte's Victorian family, their social circle. Their lives are contrasted to the subculture of working class & poor underclass. I look forward to reading subsequent novels in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"I have been waiting for these books to finally become available on Kindle, so was curious when I downloaded this to see if the series would be any good. I thought the beginning was a little hard to figure out who all the characters are, but as the book continued, I really liked it. I figured out who the killer was before it was revealed, but the story still kept my attention. It reads like a Sunday night PBS murder mystery show so if you like that pace, you will like this book. I'm reading the second book in the series now, but am not finding it quite as captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for First Time Readers","review":"I got this book for my nephew and ended up keeping it for myself. This is a lovely colourful book about an ugly little dog that is abandoned by her owner near a garbage heap. Eventually she finds her way to a circus after several near misses with the local dogcatcher and a nasty cat. It is the circus clown who takes Simp in, and she rewards his kindness by becoming part of his act, thus enabling him to keep his job at the circus. Cannonball Simp is a delightful story for young children. It is easy to read, has colourful bright pictures but most importantly of all it is a fun book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"my kids have never cared for this book","review":"Myself, I find the storyline not just unpleasant, but a little freaky. It's natural in children's animal stories that you put yourself in the place of the animal and anthropomorphize it. Okay, talk about a way to freak a kid out... you're an orphan and you get taken in by a clown? and shot out of a cannon? The happy-ending doesn't feel quite so happy. If anything, it makes you feel more insecure. It's not a feel-good book.The illustrations are unpleasant. About the only this I can say good is that the vocabulary is simple and the typeface is bold and quite easy to see for the early reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxation at its best!","review":"After years of stress from work, home and family, I received this DVD as a present.

My wife doesn't mind the extra little massage skills I picked up either. It has helped me in so many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a massage video for the viewer","review":"I am happy to say that I was presently surprised by this video. They actually made it so you can actually use it, enjoy it and follow along. It is NOT just a platform for the massage therapist (or the Dr. in this case)nor is it the usual poorly shot \\"massage class\\" that drive me crazy.It includes a lot of acupressure and meridian information during the massage which I know is backed by over 100 years of history but I am still in the converting stage - or I would have given it a perfect 5 stars.I would say this video is a best bet for anyone who embraces alternative medicine or chinese medicine, or anyone who is looking for a relaxing, feel good routine - it tends to rejuvinate me. Perfect for stress fiends like me. No experience is required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't even consider the others","review":"I was given this video as a gift. I would not put myself in the alternative medicine crowd, so I was at first a bit skeptical about the links to acupressure. However, this video is put together so well! It is not heavy on Chinese theory and very practical. I have now watched it at least 25 times. The first few times watching the video, I was just using the techniques and ignoring the theory references, later I became more curious and actually learned a fair bit.Amazon does not yeat have the other videos in the Holomedica series so I tried one from Amazon's most popular myMassageVideo. Big mistake! (Don't believe the reviews) The comparison of the two videos was like comparing a National Georgraphic special against a local cable access education program.

The second book is better, but this one could have been a complete miss for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Bad Round Robin","review":"This book was very, very silly. Terribly silly. Almost terrible. It reminds me of something that might result from an online round-robin with a bunch of giddy paranormal-romance authors. (readers of fan-fic will know what I mean.)The basic plot: an almost-immortal chick who is guardian of the cup of immortality. A TDH (tall dark and handsome) who is under a curse and must kill Our Heroine to save his own skin. And the skin of all the males in his family.There are dead characters, Satan, Satan's Son, a dragon who likes cyber-sex, and carb-free pretzels. All wrapped up in a plot which was hashed over waaaay too many times (I don't want to kill you but I must but boy I lust after you let's have sex).If you're looking for the lightest bit of fluff to while away a plane ride (I was), this is ok.

Karin's voice is truly unique - devious and sensual, sultry and ethereal. \\"Some kind of strange\\" is diverse, with intricate arrangements constantly ravaging the sonic space around the center where Karin's vocals firmly hold you with the promise of something yet to be revealed. There is a definite \\"middle eastern\\" influence, albeit with an \\"industrial\\" edge, and every song seems to be crafted to perfection, with each sound expertly placed.

I have to say that a \\"sensual\\" voice is not enough to make great music. The singer tries to much to sound sensual sometimes its almost ridiculous but anyway, the big problem with this album are the compositions. There is no melody, all the album sounds very monotony, just a voice with no direction around very basic sounding guitars and drums. Overall there is a total lack of musicality. I wouldn't even use the album as background music, the music is very predictable, boring, unremarkable. What a waste really. It's funny, even in the underground scene a band can be over advertised.

For others, like myself, it may be more insight on a spiritual journey. Wherever you are, Thomas Merton has no intention of handing out free tickets. He was, and still is a mystic. He offers suggestions, and he teaches. His words are guidance, and they give direction. Some will accept them and understand, others will not. If you pick up this book looking for answers to your questions you may only find more questions. Instead, just contemplate on the words he speaks. All books by and about him offer a glimpse of who he was, and what he was/is trying to convey. You'll get out of this book whatever you put into it, and nothing more.

Due to the AHAs, it also results in a smoother, clearer complexion.3. It has a very light, citrusy, non-offensive scent.4. A small amount is sufficient to clean the face, meaning that an 8.4 oz bottle for me lasts around 6 months. That makes it more economical than even the cheapest generic facial cleanser.5.

'Speed is the Key', 'A Day Called Zero', 'Dream TV', 'Delicious Demon', 'Leash Called Love' and 'I'm Hungry' aren't even on there. And those are my all-time favorite Sugarcubes songs!I strongly recommend that anyone interested in The Sugarcubes skip this lame compilation and instead get the original excellent Sugarcubes albums LIFE'S TOO GOOD, HERE TODAY TOMORROW NEXT WEEK, and STICK AROUND FOR JOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm terribly disappointed!","review":"I am in no way speaking of the songs on the disc themselves, and definitely not the fantastic band, but this collection was nothing short of a complete let-down.

They're still lying on the out-of-print 12 inch singles, that's where! This could have been such an awesome endeavor. I can't even see a completist wanting this! I bought this and The B-52's \\"Time Capsule\\" on the same day. Quite comparable bands, and (sadly) quite comparably uninspiring Best Of compilations.

It's a shame, really: the songs are well-written, great to dance to, and Bjork has one of the most beautiful voices in rock, even when she's screaming or out of tune. My problem is with that clown Einar Orn Benediktsson, the Icelandic equivalent of Fred Schneider, who contributes nothing to this band except the spouting of nonsensical interjections which detract from the songs. Why the group let this guy near the microphone is beyond me.THEREFORE, if you're a fan of Bjork's solo stuff, like me, be cautious when trying any Sugarcubes material. Of course, Einar doesn't taint every song they've done, but when he does, it can be a painful experience. Even this collection of their best songs can't help hide that fact. If they could find a way to erase his voice from the tracks, THEN I'd be interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Saver","review":"Using the Kata Insertrolley is a real back saver. I imagine it would also be great for photographers that suffer from arthritis, muscle, and joint pain as well. I use it to cart my gear around the city, which can get pretty heavy sometimes. Though I doubt it would be practical for trails / hiking and other such related activity. I had a back injury from a horseback riding accident that comes back to haunt me on occasion, so I have to be cautious about how much weight I carry in my camera bags, and that was restrictive. The Insertrolley was the answer!I use both Messenger and Backpack type camera bags with the Insertrolley, and they are both easily accessible while on the trolley.

This thing has a plastic joint when extended and I broke two of them (at the plastic joint) within a few months. Kata was good to me and replaced it once for free but I broke it again. I had a big well made piece of luggage in this same role that held up against my abuse for over two years, and these carts last me about two months.

At first I thought I was disappointed because it was a compilation of essays grouped together by subject ( I had read it was put together this way but expected something different), but I gave it a chance and read through some of them.... I can't put the book down. This book is an encouragement to continue the journey as \\"good parents\\", be it through the means it may. I found words of encouragement and beauty throughout the pages of this book. It is an older book with essays from years and years ago, but the message to parents and the hurdles faced by parents are the same.

I still have fond feelings for it. This book is responsible for sparking my interest - one might say obsession - with Joan of Arc. It's a great book. It takes the skeleton of basic historical facts and adds the flesh of a story. This book brings Joan to life and helps the reader to see her as more than a flat, one-dimensional character in history. It's anything but boring. If anything, I thought it ended too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I bought this as a present for someone interested in architecture, but proceeded to read it before it was wrapped!

For a laywoman like myself, enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"LA MER caught my attention","review":"I recently saw the film Mr. Bean's Holiday with Rowan Atkinson. In the film there are several brief musical references to Charles Trenet's version of La Mer (The Sea).

The CD contains La Mer and many other tunes recorded by Trenet from 1938 to 1946."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceitful Advertising","review":"The illustration leads you to believe you are ordering a dozen pencils.

I purchased a box of twelve.Upon the shipment's arrival, I promptly began preparing the pencils using a high-quality artist's pencil sharpener. Time after time and to my frustration, I found the pencil lead would only disintegrate in the sharpener, making it impossible to produce a proper 'point' to the pencil lead. I tried a number of other sharpeners, only to have the same effect.Clearly, the leads of this brand (or batch) of pencil are defective in either manufacture or design.

Nevertheless, \\"Dookie\\" is not their best album. On the closing tracks \\"In The End\\" and \\"F--- off and Die\\", Green Day proved that they could rock, and that of course would lead to their best album \\"Insomniac\\", which is a definite best buy.

I have read many of the reviews and decided to comment. Do not get it twisted. GREEN DAY IS NOT PUNK! If you are looking for a great punk album this is a bad choice. HOwever, Dookie is one of the most influential bands of the 90's. It paved the way for so many lesser and far more trivial acts like blink, New Found Glory, etc. It stills remains at the top of the genre it created. With radio gems like Longview, Basketcase, When I Come Around, and She how could you go wrong? This is definitly in my top 3 favorite albums of all time. If you are a bored, confused, angry, teen, (like most are). I would strongly advise purchasing this CD. It perfectly describes the teen angst we've all been through. Some say it's unoriginal.

Absolutely every single song on Dookie sounds EXACTLY the same. It took all my willpower to listen all the way through this darwin-awful album before giving it away. \\"When I Come Around\\" is an excellent song, but the rest is .... I hate to resort to insults, but it really is that bad. The people who gave it five, four, or even three stars must be stuck in 1994 when it was cool to like Green Day.

I do agree that the vocals are much richer and more crisp. This album is one of the best I've owned as far as music goes in general. Having a actual vinyl copy makes me appreciate it even more than I already did. Having listened to Dookie since it's release I have to say that I'm more then happy that I picked up this version of it.

There were no guitarsolo's on this album, so I think he just can't do it. Green Day plays very simple music, and you might like it, but I rather listen to music with better musicians.

You call these self-proclaimed stoner hacks legends?! Sorry to break to ya, kid, but legends these guys ain't. The reason why people say there's nary a bad song on the album is because it's just the same song every track, 14 times over. The guitar player is one of the worst my ears have ever had the displeasure of hearing. WHY can't he break up the monotony a bit by playing something besides the same repetitive notes every song? Oh, I know, because he can't. Anyway, it's very annoying, but forthright, proves he can't play well enough to make any of his own songs.

Apart from what others have said and I quote Sonic Youth when they said \\"Green Day is not punk\\" and I disagree, they embodied the enegery, the cathartic explosion of youthful angst filtered through simplicity yet a complexity thats highly misubderstood. I believe they WERE punk and maybe they still are, but Dookie to me meant a lot. As a musician they were highly influential to me, and is an inlfluence I'll never deny. Dookie is an amazing album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best of the best punk cds","review":"Green Day suddenly hit the world by surpise with this shockingly incredible punk/pop cd that made punk mainstream again, with bands like Rancid, The Offspring & Blink following in there footsteps to the mainstream. Great songs like Basket Case, When I Come Around, Longview & She hit radio stations and I'm really happy or these humble, down to earth punk rockers. Billie Joe Armstrong is a great lead singer and has that pefect ranting, punk voice. The guitars,drums,bass & lyrics are all great & blow away almost all the other in the punk scene. Go buy this, I almost never give 5's easily so I strongly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greendays best cd","review":"the problem with most punk bands today is that their music becomes too pop. They forget what they are in music for and become sellouts. This is the case with some bands like blink182 and Good Charolette who at first had a very punk tune but then they changed. Greenday has always stayed the same. The same type of music, the same meanings behind each of the songs. Thats what i like about them. this cd is my all time favorite greenday cd.

There are only several records that can never get played out. In my opinion, the best CDs are the ones that can be listened to from beginning to end without skipping any tracks.

Many an old man was forced to stop their gramaphone after hearing the shocking filth emanating from the needle. It contains the hit singles \\"Lights\\", \\"Lice\\", \\"Headlice\\", \\"Headlights\\", and of course the classic \\"My Brother Does The Noises For The Talkies\\". Unfortunately the album has dated poorly. For example, while it may have seemed funny and edgy to title your album after a childish slang term for faeces in 1929, by, say 1994 even a mentally normal 8 year old would find it pathetic.

Worst musical group of the 1990s, hands down. Even the Spice Girls and Hanson look like musical geniuses compared to these @sses!

Every time I heard a Green Day song, by the time it was over, my neck would hurt from all the head banging! Today whenever I hear a Green Day song, I don't bang my head like I did when I was a kid--all I do is laugh at myself ten years ago! This is an incredibly bad album, folks. So awful that it shouldn't even be played in the 21st century. Dookie is a dated piece of pop culture trash that belongs in the Museum of Pop Music Fads along with New Kids on the Block, Milli Vanilli, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer.

They think it is about spreading peace or some sissy stuff like that, and it is not, Anarchy is the opposite of peace, it is unadulterated freedom, real, true, freedom to do whatever you want. And punk music should be noisey and aggressive. This is one of those bands(the leader, in fact) that made people think this poppy crap is punk, and almost completely killed real punk rock. If it wasn't for bands like the Casualties, punk would truely be dead, but it isn't dead, and won't die. Punk is back and it's here to stay!

I even remember in first grade my friends would sing \\"Basket Case\\" and run aroung the playground. The songs on Dookie were Green Day's most unique lyrics. I still don't see how they can come out with a tune that just hits you right there in your heart, so whenever \\"Basket Case,\\" \\"Long View,\\" or When I come Around\\" would come on the radio you would scream out in joy, \\"YES!!!\\" So Dookie holds it's place as my favorite Green Day album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put....wow.","review":"I've been a fan for 6 years now.

But either way there is at least one song on this album you can relate with. To a lot of the band's friends when they made this album and signed to Reprise they \\"sold out\\". To me they were completely wrong in every way. Also I believe this is one of the most influencial albums of the early 90s.

The best 3manband around.This is whats called good music, not by opinion by fact, Greendays a type of band thats just non-hatable.SO if you just got into punk rock and are searching for the right band, well incase you havent heard, Green day are the PUNK-KINGS.

This is the CD that gave Green Day their fame and fortune. Its considered a classic by some. And you have to admit, even if you hate Green Day, this is one super catchy album.It starts off with Burnout, a super fast catchy song and it continues on that way for the rest of the CD pretty much. It includes Green Day classics like Longview and Basket Case which you must have heard religously on your local rock radio station at one time or another. One complaint is that all the songs sound the same. But despite this, its still worth your time.In closing, even though this disc is what basically fired off Green Day's career, it isn't their best. If you are looking for Green Day's best pick up Nimrod. But if you are just looking for a fun, catchy sing a long punk CD with great replay value, pick up Dookie. You won't be disapointed.

Every riff, every beat, and every melody is a re-hashed Descendents or ALL tune. You can't deny that Green Day's songs are infectious and catchy, that the musicians are all excellent, and that they sound very polished and professional. But it's hard to not sing other band's lyrics over their songs since they are so close. Compare \\"Basketcase\\" to the Descendents \\"Get the Time\\" and you'll see what I mean. However, this album is a great introduction to the melodic punk world, but a better introduction would be going to the source: the Descendents, ALL, the Buzzcocks, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, no hassles","review":"I received the cd within 3 days, I was impressed that they were so quick.

The chord progressions were all unoriginal, except for maybe one. The rest of the songs then copied off of this one original song to form one huge unoriginal blob of Dookie. A fake English accent, a bad lead guitar, an O.K. bass line. Who could like this band. It is pitiful. The strat sounds terrible under such distortion. Thus, I conclude a synonym for the title of this album woud describe it nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"Sure it was \\"Longview\\" and \\"Basket Case\\" that made this one a hit, but the band has a good sense of humor and melody that maintains itself throughout the CD.

Don't get me wrong its a great album but its far from what people say it is. There are songs on this album that annoy the hell out of me (ie. having a blast, In the End, and Safarass roots. But there are also songs that I adore, (ie. She, Basket Case, Pulling Teeth, and Coming Clean. But Green Day has such a talent for making catchy, fast paced songs, or slow mellow songs which yes, can be catchy. This is a great major label debut from Green day, yes it doesnt deserve 5 stars because it is hardly a masertpiece. Nevertheless it is still a great debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song with lots of cool extras!","review":"The title song is inspiring and even more impactful if you have read the book 'The Prayer of Jabez.\\" I have enjoyed the different screen savers that I installed from the CD.

I bought this book a couple months ago, and haven't been able to put it down. I became addicted, needing my daily dose every day till i finished it, because the information in it is SO fascinating.

Why someone has not written this book before I'll never know. Any one who has read any of the many laymens texts on particle physics has heard the words group,lie algebra,ect but they all stopped short there, probably for fear of scaring off the reader. Dr. Schumm has shown that these concepts can indeed be accessible to the general reader.The notion of the Lie group is clearly explained as is renomalization. And the real pearl comes with the explanation of the connection between group generators and gauge bosons. This just wets the appetite for another book pulling even more threads together.

Intresting characters, facinating creative licence on historical figures and the whole plot with Da'vinci and the Mona Lisa is great. His charactersation of Dr. Jung was very enjoyable. My only critisism is the author diverges into other minor characters without any reason and uses whole chapters to do this. I can see a few paragraphs but a chapter was to much. By relating a few facts or tid bits it would have made a much more facinating read. I was also left with a feeling that I did not really know the main character as much as I would have liked.

Sick pathetic criminal that really doesn't deserve to have her story told although the author did a good job painting Ellen Boehm as a fat, ugly, delusional loser.

Originally known as just Wrathchild, they added the America to their names when it was learned that a glam band from the UK was also using the name Wrathchild.

While there is nothing factually incorrect about this portion of the book - it is a compendium of knowledge spanning dozens of civilizations and cultures, I did not find it particularly interesting. I would compare it to reading a textbook, but it was written with too much of an intellectual bent to be accurately compared to such.The last quarter of the book, however, fell from a high-minded dicussion and description of the nature and purposes of cities into a standard neo-Luddite rant: Capitalism is bad. Cars are bad. Suburbs are bad. Things are getting worse, and someone (the government) must step in and enforce (my) order.If such is your philosophy, you may very well enjoy this book.

But even more importantly, he tells of how his story is our story. \\"...the same steel that secures your life against being destroyed secures your life also against being opened up and transformed by the Holy power that life itself comes from...\\" (From the book)In his wide-open honesty, Mr. Buechner lets the reader know that we are really all the same: we all have the joys and pains of life, and we all have the same access to the Holy Power that life ultimately comes from.I have been deeply touched by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reflective, honest book","review":"Perhaps the best thing about Rev. Buechner's book is that, in reading about his early journey toward finding Christ, it really will, as so many have noted, help you reflect on your journey. Buechner writes about how our lives are like novels, that they have a structure and a meaning, and indeed, they do, if we take the time to delve into them and try to process them. God, of course, is the Author of that meaning, and as Buechner finds meaning in his life, so too can we find meaning in ours. This is one I am sure I will read again and again.

The reason for her nickname Cam is because she has an excellent memory like a camera (hence the shortened nickname \\"Cam\\"), and uses this talent to solve mysteries.

The study was so good that I decided to order the book and i was blown away. Alistair Begg did an awesome job illustrating the life of Joseph. He identified so many biblical principals from one story that I never would have picked up on my own. Romans 8:28 is the theme of the book that through Joseph's darkest times of his life God still worked every aspect of it for His good. God's hand of protection and provesion was on Joseph's life even when it didn't appear that way. The book also offers lessons on forgiveness, trusting God, and leaving a legacy just to name a few.

Kuerti presents the sonata with breath taking technique in the opening and sweet soulful singing. The second movement will take one's breath away, and Kuerti's genius is revealed in his poetic reading of the profound third movement. Only in the final movement does he slightly stumble( the reason I must give him four stars), but if there is any doubt about his position as one of the greatest keyboard poets of this time it is answered in the Polonaise, Scherzo, and Ballade. The scherzo sings as only a few pianists can make it, and the ballade alone is worth the cost of the disc. Kuerti plays it as the master story teller, drawing one in slowly in order to reveal an amazing story. Excellent artistry from one of the day's finest Pianist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally large tarp for reasonably low price","review":"This is a nice large tarp for a low price. I've used it on several camping trips, and it performed exactly as I had hoped. What I love about this tarp is that it's big enough to completely cover my large 6-man tent, and still have enough room to create a covered sitting area in front of the tarp. Note: you'll need to provide your own rope, stakes, or poles. If it's a windy day, you'll need to stake it down quite securely, because the tarp's large size can really catch the wind and balloon up.One nice feature is that the tarp has tons of grommets spaced evenly around all 4 edges. It makes for very convenient tie-down, as there's always a grommet close to where you need one.At first the tarp's weight felt a bit flimsy and light, but over a summer of camping it hasn't developed any rips or tears, so it's not something I can complain about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large tarp, flimsy grommets","review":"I bought this tarp to spread over a large area to kill grass.

His book has all the makings of classic fantasy. A rugged hero to root for, an evil villain to boot, and a sassy Faerie sidekick to make us wonder how come our games didn't have pixies like her! The mountain scenes are well done, and even though some of the other interesting rooms were missed. You do get a feeling of Deja-Vu reading them after all of these years. A fun read, and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Dungeon Hack!","review":"Now this is AD&D at its finest! Magic, Melee, and mirth all rolled into one.I throughly enjoyed this book, though I would have liked to see to dungeon adventure be a little longer and names given to the other adventurers in the group, but this book was a great, quick read; perfect for the person that longs for a good game of AD&D.I won't give away any of the plot, but those of you that played White Plume Mountain many moons ago will enjoy the story line. The Justicar is the dogmatic dispenser of justice while Escalla provides the witty comic relief and Cinders provides the pyrotechnics.I look forward to the continuing adventures of the Justicar, Escalla, and Cinders in \\"Descent to the Depths of the Earth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, not terribly \\"pure\\" though","review":"I thought this book might be a \\"pure\\" telling of an adventure into White Plume Mountain, as in the original AD&D module. Winds up that no, this is 30 years later, AFTER whomever has defeated Keraptis in the module. Still, it incorporates many elements from the original module that leave one feeling nostaligic for the old adventuring days. The prominent use of anachronisms is pretty annoying, as is Escalla's use of terms like \\"J-man\\" and such when referring to Justicar - obviously incorporations of modern slang. That's great for Disney movies trying to hook the kiddies in, not so great for AD&D novels trying to hook the hardcore fantasy geeks like me in. Still, the flaws were few and the kudos are many. I really enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to reading more of the Greyhawk series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect example of fantasy: escapism","review":"Unlike most game-generated novels (end the horrible showcase the excellent Dragonlance saga became), this one does everything it should, and several things I didn't expect. The Justicar is an excellent example of a D&D protagonist taken too seriously (as most gamers tend to do), but is so well set off by the modernized faerie Escalla that the story wouldn't have worked any other way. The tongue-in-cheek game references add levity at the proper moments, and for those of us who played the module the book was based off of, the entire task of completing White Plume Mountain was more than enough to encourage reading. It is everything I require in a good work of fantasy, and has remarkable re-readability. The lack of overt sexual tension was a welcome relief, and when it finally surfaced in \\"Descent into the Depths of the Earth\\", it was so well done as to be wholly fitting. I recommend this book to anyone looking to relax for a couple of hours into a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing wrong with a fun book","review":"OK, enough of the reviews complaining that this book isn't \\"serious\\" AD&D fare. This book brings back memories of running this campaign years ago, and we used humor and had fun while we role-played. A refreshing, entertaining, and fun book. I've loaned my copy to my wife, daughter, and several students at school. They all enjoyed it, even the one student who said it contained more \\"corny\\" humor than he liked was grinning while he retold parts of it to his friends. The only complaint I have is that Mr. Kidd cannot write as fast as we can read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun summer read...but not great","review":"White Plum Mountain is a decent book. Perfect for those days in summer that you don't want to read something serious or challanging. The three main characters are well written in a shallow sort of way but enjoyable regardless. The Hellhound coat steals the show...and deserves to. Despite these criticisms this is the perfect fantasy to read while in the field or at the pool. Besides, it unlike Robert Jordan's books it fits into a BDU pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"showed a promising concept.","review":"The cover was enticing, the notes on the back showed a promising concept. But the book was a real let-down. The main character was so invinsible, that there was little suspense when he attacked or was attacked. He always won the fights. Even when he got hurt, he cured himself. The pixie was too hip. Her dialogue was almost Valley-girlish. And it was magic here, magic there, and spells, spells, spells. Mr. Kidd should have relaxed, sstopped worrying about his editor's deadline, and given some thoughtfullness to the characterizations, and depth. The hell hound might as well have been a regular magic wolf. It seems I do not share the other reviewers' enthusiasm. I cannot recommend White Plume Mountain over several other books. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgia and mush","review":"I was terribly excited to pick up a novelization of one of my favorite AD&D adventures from once upon a time. Aside from the nostalgia of being reminded of the excitement and fun you had when you originally played this adventure there is nothing notable about this book. The characters are flat and underdeveloped stock archetypes with no surprises at all for an experienced reader. The moody loner who is feared by the world and responds by withdrawing into his own little hostile mind. The quirky and troublesome female who is at first a burden to our hero, but who eventually shows him how to love. It's a sad comment on the quality of character development and storyline when you discover that a sentient fur coat is the most interesting element of the entire book.So, if you've been away from role-playing for a long while and would like to take a little nostalgic trip down memory lane this book will serve that purpose.

The nice man at tech support told me I'd have to ship it to the States (I'm in the UK on business for five months) to get it serviced. Great! Shortly after that conversation, the main fan started rattling. So now I have a heavy, very noisy laptop connected to a monitor. Desktop replacement indeed.Seriously, this thing can do what you want it to do: it's beefy. The Cool and Quiet Technology is interesting to see in operation. But it feels cheeply made.

I also think more could have been put into the characters, they were really not to my liking. The woman is kind of stupid - she has a dangerous job while being a single parent, she takes the \\"hero\\" back after he turned his back on her and was mean to her kid.

Conversations between Colby and Rodrigo and other men from previous books were confusing. Maybe if I had recently read those book I wouldn't have been so confused. DP seems to be using the same lines over and over throughout the book. And I am also wondering why all her characters are Indian now. Or at least it seems like it. And who Sarina felt she had to have her daughter live in the Hispanic section of town.The last several years I have had a hard time reading DP's books which I used to love.

The only reason I gave this book a 2 is because it was by Diana Plamer. I did not like the characters of this book. Colby, yes, was a jerk but I sort of suspected that; the main problem I had with this book was Sarina. Why did she have a high-risk job with her being a single mother, what mother in her right mind would take a job that could kill you with no one to look after your daughter.

All he wants is a new start. What he discovers, though, is that the past is never far behind. Colby is soon enmeshed in plans to trap a notorious drug trafficker, and it seems that Colby's ex-wife, Sarina Carrington - whom he so cruelly left after just one day of marriage - may be more involved than she's letting on. Not only that, but Sarina has a six-year-old dark-eyed daughter whose father is mysteriously absent - or is he?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't hardly finish it!!","review":"This is by far the worst Palmer book I've read. As one of the other reviewers said, the plot about the drug smuggling is too complicated. There was too much time spent on the drug smuggling and the secret that Sarina was keeping from Colby (which was apparent from the very beinging of the book.)There was no chemistry between the two characters and the book was predictable and bland. I suggest not even wasting your money on this book and looking for one of Palmers older books. Such as Once in Paris or Soldier of Fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol, same ol","review":"The hero is a jerk, and Sarina is an idiot.

And then he had the nerve to go complain because the child was sitting in the canteen! What a moron. The dialogue of the six-year-old leads me to believe that the author has never been around a young child.Palmer's story lines are interesting, but she really needs to work on toning down her male characters. They are hard to like. And she always puts a male in the picture who is in love with the female character who is everything the female should want. Why should she choose an abusive man over him? Amazon, please put in a zero or minus category for books such as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outsider is another winner!!","review":"I loved this book I couldn't put it down. It's the story about Colby Lane and the reunion with his exwife Sarina who has a daugther going on seven. Colby is first shock to have the little girl know so much about him & than to find her mother is his exwife Sarina. I love how Ms Palmer brings back characters from older books. It's like visiting old friends and catching up on their lives. It's a passionate, fantastic story that kept me turning the pages untill I got to the end.

Oh...and I have to add, the story is plain stupid!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"typical diana palmer but not as good","review":"This is a typical Diana Palmer book in that it has the innocent girl who is wronged by the tough guy who is just misunderstood. Ok, for some reason I keep reading Diana Palmer even when I am disappointed in her books time after time. Honestly, it is the male characters that typically annoy me, and this was no exception. However, I will say that Sabrina wasn't as weak-willed as some of the other heroines, but she wasn't great either. However, this is just my personal opinion. What annoyed me the most about the book was Colby's total attitude and behavior, especially from the past.The best character was by far Bernadette, without her this book wouldn't have been near as good. Anyway, if you like other Diana Palmer books, you will probably like this one. Also, if you like books with very strong alpha characters and a \\"softer, more 'traditional'\\" woman, you will probably like this book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable","review":"I had the entire story figured out by about page 10 and I'm not usually very good at guessing plots.

In fact, it's worse than that...it will probably scare you away. It's also very densely written and dry in some parts...so it could bore you away too!

The story arc and character development stop dead in favor of a series of \\"lessons\\" that the protagonist learns about American culture. The style of the storytelling also changes from a natural flow to one of pure exposition. Feroza ceases to be a fully realized character and transforms instantly into a MacGuffin being led around from scene to scene. One gets the impression that Sidhwa was trying to portray \\"typical\\" Americans; however, much like Anurag Mathur (\\"The Inscrutable Americans\\") and Anita Desai (\\"Fasting, Feasting\\") she fails miserably in creating convincing American characters and is clearly out of her depth in her superficial attempts to recreate American speech and manners.

But if you're still unsure, you have nothing to fear! Once again, the new testament comes to life through Paul's journey. The action, the passion, the love these first missionarie had for the world are fictionalized in these diaries and presented in such an awesome first hand view, you have to sit back in awe. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star only because the first book made me cry. This one didn't, although it was still moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Titus Diary reviewed","review":"This is an excellent read and undoubtedly brings the book of Acts to life in a whole new light. Gene Edwards is a great storyteller and has a technique to his writing that portrays his Biblical characters down-to-earth and authentic to the reader.Sometimes we like to put Biblical characters on a pedestal. This book offers a human side to the Apostle Paul, Silas, Luke and Timothy, which is very refreshing. One realizes that when it comes down to it we are all the same - spiritual beings incased in a temporary earthly body. The Titus Diary has a way of compelling the reader to look inward to the issues of the inner man. Taking the Christian to a deeper level of faith and leading to a journey of the spirit.After reading The Titus Diary, the travels of the disciples in the New Testament will have a new reality when read. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is on a spiritual journey to know God more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is crazy enough to be really good.","review":"This is a really creative and amazing CD that you will enjoy more every time you listen to it. The Pivot Foots have thier own unique style that seems to be a blend of bass-driven rock and fusion jazz.

Someone who is now forced to cook because of the disease. No more hamburger helper, pasta roni, or frozen dinners. Most of the recipes are very simple (my wife can do them) and fairly quick.If you were a seasoned cook you could probably come up with most of these recipes your self. You could take a gourmet cookbook and change things around and make a gf meal with it.

Instead, you get a worse than amateurish printing job: washed out, badly cropped, noticeably distorted, unaccountably repeated photos (first complete photo, then photo detail w/out sufficient resolution). In short: visually horrendous--and that's saying most of what matters in a photo book. On top of that the captions that accompany photos are poorly written, trivially informative, and not free of mistakes when it comes to Spanish (you'd expect some care in someone dealing with Mexican subject matter--I hate to think what the announced Spanish version is like).

But Agnes, a battered wife now widowed and working as a cook, rises above her pitiful circumstances to become - superwoman! With limited resources and amind extremely strict societal rules, she manages to ward off nasty advances, saves a street urchin, unravels a myriad of characters and their part in a theft of a valuable silver piece, and solves the mystery of three horrific murders.

A complete set of Waltzes and nearly all the Nocturnes, played by one of the greatest female English concert pianists of the post-war period. Lympany plays beautifully, with great conviction, and the sound quality is superb - warm, very realistic and much better than the age of the recordings (1958-60) might suggest. On the whole, I found this set very rewarding. Occasionally I found myself questioning her judgements about tempo: in particular, she plays some of the Nocturnes faster than I would like, but I guess that's largely a matter of individual taste. Personally I prefer the more introspective approach exemplified by Arrau or Barenboim (particularly in the early hours when this music is at its most enchanting). However, this is a minor quibble and most Chopin fans will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic information","review":"This book is not a substitute for a good entertainment attorney, but it raises consciousness about the number and nature of issues that need to be covered in contractual matters.

I have alot of knitting books and they always give requisite beginner instructions, and then go on to specific patterns using specific yarns - i.e., yarns available at the time of printing, not necessarily available when the book is purchased. What a wonderful surprise to find in this book clear instructions on many techniques I don't find in any other books. The pictures are clear and the language is understandable.

That said, I feel it picks up where a lot of knitting books end. For example, Katharina's explanation for sewing zippers is essential, especially her zipper double facing, which produces a professional result that renders a zipper practically invisible. Same thing with her instructions on knitting neckbands and collars; she covers almost every type of collar possible.I like Katharina's Germanic attention to detail and perfection.

I bought two sacks of these for practicing with friends. Instead of spending time picking up, I use a wilson pickup basket so no one has to spend so much time gathering balls in the court.

Instead of going nuts (ho ho!) and buying all sorts of different chemicals in the GABA metabolic chain (to supplement every piece of the necessary components), I decided to try this.It was an easy to stomach capsule. I could take 2 at a time if I foresaw a more challenging day ahead of me, and not fear any repercussions. It did not cause any odd side-effects or extra, different anxiety (as too much 5-HTP can).In a few words: it was moderately effective at helping abate the symptoms of my schizophrenia. More so, however, it helped stave off the effects of SAD. That was the more surprising result, but not an unwelcome one. It's a nice supplement to help take edge off of an anxious life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh---don t get it!","review":"Don't get any benefit from this product. Don't know why I purchased.

She dances to the songs, and claps and signs along now that she is a bit older. The first sign my daughter immitated independently was \\"more\\" and she was so thrilled that we understood her! This occurred around 7 months of age. \\"Milk\\" followed quickly, and now she uses many many signs to enhance her ability to communicate. My daughter is a normally developing (and hearing) 18 months old, and signing helps her to communicate when she doesn't yet have the words and/or when she wants to emphasize something (such as \\"PLEASE, I want the COOKIE\\"!)

Don't get me wrong, \\"Sreamadelica\\" is still a great CD, and there are some solid tracks on on \\"Vanishing Point\\" and \\"EXTRMNTR.\\" But I view those works as more uneven, with flashes of undeniable brilliance intermixed with headache-inducing nonsense.\\"Give Out But Don't Give Up,\\" while mellower and more soulful -- and therefore inherently different from the others--is most consistently great. I realize the comparisons are a bit of apples and oranges, and the band deserves credit for covering so much ground from one CD to the next. But this CD will find its way into your listening mix over and over. It is to Primal Scream what \\"Laser Guided Melodies\\" is to Spiritualized.

It is a nice size and fits children up to 100 pounds. I like the fact that it has a place under the seat where you can personalize the gift. There were many parts, but the detailed directions made it easy to put together. It took my husband about 1 hour.

She loved country music, and many of these songs played on the radio whenever she tuned into the country music stations. There is a wide selection of good songs to appeal to different moods such as \\"Daddy's Money\\" by Richochet and \\"She Lays it All On the Line\\" by George Strait for upbeat music.

It takes tremendous artistic sophistication to conjure up a whole world with a few simple shapes and colors.

Good children's books entertain not only children, but the adults who read to them. In a world with books by Maurice Sendak, Margaret Wise Brown, Roald Dahl, Shel Silverstein, Dr. Seuss, and more (including, when he's feeling a little more subtle, Kevin Henkes), it is unclear why anyone would pick this book.

I sympathized more with the characters in a Serbian Film, and I thought a Serbian Film was better paced and more sinister. As far as disturbing and controverisal...yes there is homosexual sex but that's barely of note as far as controversy; I've seen that in a mainstream drama and in the Spartacus series. The only thing I found notably unsettling was a very jarring decapitation scene, which was a video within the movie and did not involve any of the characters. I can't say anything very good about the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total perversion of research on diet-related diseases","review":"Instead of asking Ms. Smith, perhaps readers would be better suited to turn to the recommendations of the National Cancer Institute, National Cancer Society, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the World Health Organization, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, and countless university-based studies. A diet consisting only of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables is the best defense against diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer. The fiber in whole grain food escorts carcinogens and other toxins out of the body, while vitamins and minerals otherwise ensure proper functioning. In time, this latest version of the low-carbohydrate fad will look as ridiculous and baseless as every other fad diet. This book is just another example of commercial exploitation of people looking to be healthy without making any meaningful changes to their diets and lifestyles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad advice","review":"Um...........WHOLE grains do not cause obesity, REFINED grains do. WHOLE grains do not contribute to type II diabetes, REFINED flours and FAT do.If you really want to \\"Revitalize Your Health\\", read books by:Drs. Ornish, McDougal or Bernard, they have THOUSANDS of patients whom they have saved their lives and continue to do so through diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"\\"Going Against The Grain\\" is an interesting book. The thesis is that grains are causing many of the diseases of civilization and that humans - especially children should be eating far fewer than our current practice. Certainly avoiding grains should keep our carbohydrate consumption down which should reduce our Type 2 Diabetes epidemic. Ms. Smith makes a good case for avoiding grains altogether. But anyone who has any sort of digestive difficulties should definitely try an avoidance diet.Furthermore, the author give the reader the names of the tests we should ask our doctors for. If one is having trouble with any part of the digestive system, this might help.Although the book has few recipes, the ones it has sound great, and I can't wait to try them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very scientific","review":"I found this book to be somewhat vague and non-scientific. It's all stuff I've read before. The 'quizzes' to determine how sensitive you are to wheat or grains are too broad. There is some good info on tests and glutens, but the part about 'exorphins' is just plain silliness. Save your time and money, here's a summary: (i) avoid grains, esp wheat (ii) go organic where possible (iii) it's hard and people might think you're weird but go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"Each love letter from God lifts me up to a further knowingness that I am one with my Creator, and that there is no separation between God and any of his children.Caryl F.

The knowledge gained goes way beyond anything words can express. Reading the daily Heavenletter does start the day out right, as the other reviewers have mentioned. And it can take you where we all want to go, home, if you give the words a moment more. For God's words are more than language. You will find them waking something up inside yourself, something great and loving and powerful and intimately familiar -- by golly, it's You!I am That, Sam I AM!And I enthusiastically recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivated by Spiritual Inspiration","review":"For those that are motivated by words and symbols, there can be no greater a source than that which created all that is.

They look much like the cover of this book. Unfortunately, the only image I liked WAS the cover. Had I looked through this book in a bookstore I would not have purchased.

Through the author's writting, you can really see the path developing over the years. I truly learned many new things from this book. If you're interested in this subject, I very much recommend this book for it's information and for it's presentation. It gets a BRAVO from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent example of how fragile democracy really is","review":"Sheridan uses one community to explain how the Nazis (NSDAP) were able to gain power in an entire country within the democratic system. His exhaustive research of local archives shows how the NSDAP was able to set up an effiecient bureaucracy that simply outworked other parties and spread their message through 1000's of meetings. Extremists (from the right or left) don't always take power through military force - sometimes the open nature of democracies can be used to subvert them, as was the case in Germany in 1933. True, there are many other factors involved, but Sheridan's book provides clear examples that are often overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book...","review":"This book was required for my class, but I couldn't stand it.

The authors did a fine job of providing information about the major types of psychotherapy, and I found the text informative and well written. However, there are several completely different chapters with newer psychotherapy modalities presented in the newest edition that readers should be aware of. Furthermore, the newest edition does a much better job of providing current empirical evidence for supporting theoretical frameworks of most major forms of psychotherapy. If you are a student in psychology or a practicing clinical psychologist, I strongly advise you to buy the newest edition of this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"No great for full reviews","review":"This book is o.k. but no where near the indepth I thought it may have been and frankly a little disappointed for my professor who recommended it :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Current Psychotherapies/Corsini and Wedding/7th ed/2005/InfoTrac","review":"This is a very thorough overview of the most popular psychotherapies today.

However, my understanding of current psychotherapies is based on this book alone. My first Qtr of grad school/counseling/no psych background.

The author does not provide a clear researched critique of the economics and technologies.

If his enemy is the police, and he is a gangster, I recommend spitting on him for destroying his own community with violence and hatred (toward the very same women he pretends to stick up for).This guy has gone after not only BIG names but he's gone after well-respected names. I'm sorry Ray, but you can't release a bubble gum pop rap track like \\"Rock the Party\\" and then pretend that anyone else on earth is a sellout.This guy isn't a sellout because he can't be,not because he doesn't want to be, and with this latest pathetic holding on of his beef with Eminem, despite the idiocy of it, I imagine he's destroyed any chances of selling that one copy he used to hope he'd sell of his followup to the smash 50,000 copy brick seller \\"No one even remembers it.\\"Lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' good fun","review":"I got to see these guys live when the CD came out and it was a rockin' good time. There was some amazing talent on the stage. The vocals are a bit like Blues Traveler or Hootie and the Blowfish, to give a more current reference, but it could also sound at home on a classic rock station. It's hard to pin down but fun to listen to. There's a good mix of fast and slow, hard and soft, and backing it all is some great instrumentation. Half the time the bass player is playing electric, and half the time it's upright acoustic, and it is like nothing you'd see at the symphony!

I found the information to be rudimentary at best. Although it is written in his own words, he says nothing of the human history changing decision to drop the A-bomb on Japan during WWII. Nor does he discuss other important decisions that were put before him during his tenure as president. This book is something I would find in an elementary school library next to Green Eggs & Ham and other such \\"books.\\" I bought this book to understand more about the man who changed so many lives with his decisions during one of the most important times in recent human history and was severely disappointed. I wanted an autobiography, since historians that write books about people are often misinformed and uncredible.

Nope, no it wouldn't, because you'd be noticing how one track blends into the other into the other into the other. It's just too repetitive. Like this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Techno Tabla Bliss Inferno","review":"Well, Tabla is what we've got here, and lot's of it. This is very good. It's mostly beats, the other sounds, which are a blend of classic Indian and electronica, are the minimum. Some vocals are happening, and add to the good flavor that this disk provides. This is not like Talvin Sing's, \\"OK\\", really just Tabla beats. It does rock, though. But, personally, I like more sitar and instruments other than just percussion mainly. That's why I give it a 4. This is a recommendation for those into Indian Tabla percussion, along with some synthy sounds and electro beats. Not as heady as \\"Shri Durga\\", by DJ Cheb I Sabbah. Swami Veet Asmito, Osho Sannyasan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jungle/Drum and Bass with real drums!","review":"I like dancing to trance music and listening to classical Indian music and was not prepared to hear Drum and Bass with superb classical Indian musicians playing real instruments instead of typical D and B made by one guy with a synth and a sequencer or computer. I thought D and B was over with and didn't expect a new, quality performance. Hey, I love dub, but its not exactly thriving either. Fans of Acid Jazz / jungle / D&B should love this.

Some of her music is pastoral and gentle, but never banal, and when she chooses to she can swing your socks off. There are no weak tracks on this CD, but \\"Prisoner of War\\" is particulary arresting, with an invaluable contribution from Michael Brecker, and \\"Psychic Warrior\\" is as hot as piano jazz gets. Not only is this album worthwhile, it is also, being on the Naxos label, cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit informatin here and there","review":"The book has some useful information about J2EE here and there, but since this is a book serves a guidance for the SCEA exam, most of the contents are either too shallow or irrelevant for that purpose.

After reading chapter 1 and 2, I have to say this is one of the worst tech books I ever read. The materials are harshly composed, often without a consistent and clear framework on various topics (what an irony on a book about a framework). From time to time, I have the impression that the authors just pulled some paragraphs from various articles and piled them together. This gives me the further impression that the authors don't really understand those subjects well enough to distill the essentials out and present them in an organized manner. Unless you are already an expert in those subjects, you will find yourself confused by this book and walk away with more questions than before.Definitely not recommended for anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the other reviewers, this book is useless.","review":"It may have chapter titles that coincide with Sun's list of exam objectives, but the writing is so dull and incoherent, I do not see how anyone could successfully use this book to learn anything about the covered topics, much less prepare for the exam.Reading this book reminded me of someone trying to BS answers on an essay test: the text rambles, and it is often difficult to extract any meaning from it.Note that I did not have the included CD, so I cannot speak to any redeeming qualities of the practice exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"This book claims \\"100% coverage\\" in large font on the cover. Certainly, you shouldn't take that as \\"read this book and you're done\\".This book absolutely does not cover everything that's in the test. It lacks information on Java Server Faces, on Java Messaging Service (it has an entire chapter on JMS, but it lacks specifics that will be on the exam), on Web Services support in JEE, and so on. For those topics that it does cover, this book doesn't explain at introductory level.That means that this book is no good starter's guide to get introduced to all the relevant themes, nor is it good at providing you with all the details that you need on the topics covered. It gives you an idea of those topics covered by the exam, which is helpful to decide which other books you must read. And nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This book is amazing, and cover not only everything necessary for the SCEA, but more. Most of this \\"more\\" stuff, will not be usefull directly in your test but will help you very much understanding the necessary concepts.Again, the book is very good, but since it has so much information, it's easy to loose yourself among this sea of words and stories.I recommend go for other SCEA recommended books like the GoF Design Patterns, Sun Press By Mark Cade, Core J2EE patterns second edition before this one. Once you have a good knowledge to make the test, wrap it all up with this book. It will give you a perfect review of everything and call your attention about small things that no other literature will give to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite useful","review":"i am just in the middle way of reading this book, but what i have got till now is great.

It is more like an 11th hour paper one would write all night in college to barely make the deadline, than a well structured book that is written and rewritten to achieve its purpose. This is disturbing since the goal of reading it is to obtain a certification in software architecture, a discipline that demands quality execution to ensure success. The book is repeative across chapters, unstructured within any given chapter, poorly defines concepts and terms and generally frustrates the reader with obfuscated and needlessly complicated sentence structure. The content can be moderately useful if the reader has the patience to read and re-read passages when necessary. A heavily edited and refined second edition could succeed if the need to dwell on poorly written passages and definitions was totally eliminated. Proper grammar and spelling would be a nice touch too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"At the first glance, the book appeared to cover all of the certification objectives.

At most I would buy it sharing costs with some friends so that we all can read the pdf version.Finally, and just to make it clear, the CD does NOT contain 2 sample exams.

I agree with other reviewers, this is a poorly written book. A lot questions from the book are duplicated and have wrong answers. But I do think the mock exam is a bit of helpful. It is close to the real exam, but the real exam has much more scenario questions. It will help you control time and familar with the testing environment.

However, if you do have to read this book for a course, you should purchase it here because it is at a less costly price than a campus bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"dispensable","review":"I had been reading Platon, Cicero, Epicur, Marcus Antoninus, Seneca, Lucretius... for one year and then I chose Boethius to finish my \\"studies\\" in antique philosophy. His \\"Concolation of Philosophy\\" bored me like no other work before, since Boethius hardly does develop anything new (except the metaphysical studies about Predestination and Providence, which are already influenced by early Christianism). He more or less restricts himself to repeat mostly Platonic ideas, which are told to him by Lady Philosophy, who visits him in his prison in order to make him free of desperation.Some may feel consoled when they read this book. I didn't. I think the works of Cicero, Seneca and Marcus Antoninus are a much better help in case of depressiveness and desperation. For me, Boethius is just dispensable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for comprehensive learning experience!","review":"I teach addiction studies at a local university and find this book a great reference and hope to adopt it for one of my classes.

He had been learning about space in school and his interest was sparked. He really enjoyed this series. I also found the series fascinating. I have watched most of the series and plan to watch the rest when they are returned to us. (He lent them to his teacher.) The theories presented regarding distant starlight, the uniqueness of the sun as a star, and the improbability of finding life in outer space are thought provoking and Biblical. In my opinion, this series is appropriate for upper elementary through adult age groups. Although our son does not completely understand all the information presented, there are enough rocket and space pictures to keep him interested. He will grow into the rest of the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Review","review":"Phalen's book is a wonderful oral history which includes interviews with some of baseball's most colorful characters. Included are interviews with offbeat characters such as Jimmy Piersall, Jim Bouton and Dock Ellis.

The author clearly loves baseball and is able to communicate that love in this book. This will be thoroughly enjoyed by any fan of our national pastime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italian Army 1940-45 (v-1)","review":"Very good read with a ton of information and many great pictures and illustrations that help you understand the subject.

There is little of that in this book, and it may well be that not much more is known, but to me it was a disappointment. If you're solely interested in the history of this island - how it came to be formed, populated, what it's like there - then you will probably like this book. Also, though this may seem petty, the book is in an odd shape - quite large, and flimsy softcover - not easy to store on your library shelves (if you want to keep it, that is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Biography","review":"I have also read Remini's works on Jackson and Daniel Webster, this work on Clay may not have left me with the same impassioned feelings for those two men, but that is more a reflection on Clay's life than on Remini's work. Remini does a good job of bringing Clay to life, and left me with mostly positive feelings for the Great Compromiser. Although Clay's stubborn insistence that he was right to take the job of Secretary of State in 1825, still made me cringe (as I'm sure Remini did too) every time he brought it up. A fine use of primary sources, very readable and also scholarly, this is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remini is the greatest","review":"It is simple, Remini is the best historian of the Jacksonian Period. This study of Clay gives the reader a full account of his life, both in private and public.The reader gets the feeling of life in Washington of mid-19th century. His writing brings the subject to life and the reseaerch promises accuracy. His tremendous work on Andrew Jackson does nothing to bias him against Clay.

I know that my son would much rather people UNDERSTAND his dyslexia then laugh at it. Just because it isn't a disability that can be seen doesn't mean it isn't a real issue for a child. I caution teachers that may feel lead to read this in a classroom setting.

In particular, dyslexics don't normally make errors of speech as the vicar does - their problems are typically more with reading. The idea that a dyslexic would ever introduce himself to someone by using an orthographically-backwards rendition of his last name is ludicrous. Also, the error of completely reversing the pronunciation of a long word is particularly ridiculous. Swapping a couple of letters, sure, but turning \\"trespasses\\" into \\"sessapsert\\"? Come on! More insidious is the idea that dyslexia can be easily cured. The doctor suggests the vicar walk backwards!

These performances are of surprisingly good recording quality considering that four selections hail from the late 1940s and the other two from the mid-1930s. (There are actually two performances of the Concertino de Printemps featured here, one from 1933 and the other from 1949.) Because these are mono recordings, serious Milhaud fans will probably want to find other CDs in stereo.

You'll have a hard time making a vicious hell beast out of Bambie's Dad. Thankfully, George Bush has not yet succeeded at recalling the right to religious freedom. Ho-ya!

If you believe that you get what you pay for in this world, this book is not for you. It's just too light in useful information on TIG welding. It's totally outdated with photos of antiquated machines and it gives little information on the techniques of TIG welding. In essence it reads like an introduction to TIG welding with only 77 pages (many of which consist of test questions) dedicated to this subject. Even used at $34, it offers less insights than the free information you can find online. Yes, it's a good introduction to TIG, but no, it's not worth the cheapest price you will buy it for.

That isn't what's important. What IS important is that the book is charming and that my 4 year old LOVED it. Of course, I sang Ms. Bims' melody for her (a CD would be good for non-musicians) and then we listened to the movement of the concerto together.

Even though African American politicians focus on some other issue areas, the media erroneously portrays them to be one dimensional, i.e. only focusing on race issues. The authors use rich statistical data, and interviews to back up their argument. So far, this is one of only a few books that focus on African American congressional members and the role of media in framing them.

You are given a card for each letter with a picture of something starting with that letter on it. The board has the letters A-Z on it in order and you take and move your pawn to the letter and have to pick up the correct picture that starts with that letter to move on.

I skeptically picked up the CD for 5 bucks as a cutout from RalphAmerica. The Residents are infamous for rehashing material for profit, and expected this to be more of the same.

Also I love the video demonstration that allows you to slow down the demonstrator or make it reverse or repeat itself. Also, it tells you the written ASL translation and the literal translation. So if you want to ask: \\"What is your name?\\" The written ASL translation (as they will show) is \\"Your name what?\\" But you get an explanation as to why it's sign in that manner.

I would say this CD is a great tool for beginners as it will give you enough signs to carry on basic conversations and greetings w/ a deaf person.

I have had two punctured which were rapidly sealed by the green slime. I was able to add back the pressure with my portable pump and continue my rides. I have still not changed the tubes. The slime made a perfectly acceptable seal and has not leaked since. Even when I did get a puncture, if I didn't have a pump I could have still rode home, it just would have been a careful ride to make sure I didn't damage the rim as a result of low tire pressure (60-70 psi).

You risk tire blow-off as a result. At speed and under load.

On top of that I couldn't patch the hole because the slime prevented the patch from sticking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A puncture at mile 9 of a Century ride","review":"At mile 9 of the North Fork Century in Long Island New York I got a blow out on my front wheel. I didn't know that this had happened except that I saw all of the green goo shooting out of the hole. I stopped a couple of seconds later and within about a minute the hole had sealed. There was minimal loss of tire pressure. I was able to get to complete the ride that day and I was able to use the tire the following weekend. All without having to refill my tube. Amazing.All the tubes I buy now are Slime Lites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good tubes","review":"I like the slime tubes. They have worked well for me when I have had a puncture I've been able to ride for days without patching the hole or putting air in it. When you get a puncture you get loud hissing because the slime is spraying out of the tire. If you stop with the tire pointed down the hole will fill in with slime and you can continue riding. The only problems are the stem on the presta valve version unscrews to come apart (I'm guessing so the manufacturer can put the slime in)and as a result sometimes you get a leak and have to take it apart and clean the seal. The other thing is when using a presta to schraeder adapter, because it screws down tight, when unscrewing it I've had the stem loosen and pop off. A nice pop at 70 psi. Over all they've saved me a few times during my commute on wet or cold days and nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tube","review":"I rode with a nail in my tire and the gel inside this tube held the air in no problem for thenext 8 - 9 miles I had to ride to get home , As soon as I pulled the nail out , the hole was too bigfor the gel to block it and I could NOT repair the tube as gel always wants to get out so I couldnot get a clean surface to put in a patch ..I did buy another one as I like the product as it did not leave me on the side of the road with a flat tire ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver on promise.","review":"I bought these based on the promise that it would fill small holes (lots of thorns in Colorado = lots of pinhole size punctures, which can become very costly). Took them out, and less than five miles into the ride, I caught a thorn. After hand-pumping the tire twice, I finally got home. Hand-pumped again and it still went flat. No green goo like others had bragged about. Just a flat tire on a more costly tube. Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Very poor quality especially the valves. One of them is already broken and unable to fix. Also hard to inflete and the slime liquid easily splash out from the tube making a mess when inflating. Bad purchasing in my opinion. I already changed those tubes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless for road bikes.","review":"I've been dumb enough to try these 4 times and every time the result has been he same. With a normal flat tire you have to stop your ride and replace a tire. With a flat slime tire you have to stop you ride, replace a tire and clean sticky green ooze of your bike, your clothes and your hands. The tires I've used have been the 700 x 19-25 road tires. These require high pressure to prevent pinch flats but at 100+ psi the air pressure forces the slime out with an impressive velocity and there is no time for it to congeal and plug the opening. It just sprays everywhere and makes a mess. It is also very difficult to remove once it dries. Maybe it would be useful on a low pressure mountain bike tire but they are worthless on a road bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I tried these out 3 separate times. Twice I had flats that the slime could not seal (what's the point of them then?) and the other time the stem broke off. These are poor quality stems and just poor quality tubes in general. The slime is a mess too; it gets all over the inside of your tire, hands and pump. $3 tubes from a LBS are much more reliable and cheaper. These should be taken off the market (road bike model only)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presta screw bent","review":"First time i used this the screw bent, though i filled it at an odd angle.

It worked well so I figured they'd apply the same technology to the self-repairing bike tires. About ten minutes after inflating the tire and hanging my bike from a hook I heard a popping sound and green slime started leaking from the bike tire onto my floor. I called Slime. They sent me a replacement. That one I wasn't even able to fill up the entire way with air before it burst.This is a terrible product avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap manufacturing","review":"2 stars bestowed on this product is a stretch, but only because it did self-heal tiny puncture wounds a few times.Other than that, the rubber is paper-thin and could be punctured with just about anything on the road. Furthermore, they are not built to last. I slightly bent the valve stem on a 3-month slime tube, and it snapped right off the main rubber tubing. Slime itself might be a marvel product, but the tubes are cheaply made.Verdict: don't spend the extra money on slime tubes. I'm now getting tube liners and normal, less expensive tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"I got a set of these because I was getting a lot of punctures, now things are worse! I get as many (if not more) punctures but now I have to deal with the green snot too.

Now that I am a little older, I started to read his mature works. I never go so enthusiastic about reading a book. You get it all with Roald Dahl, humor, suspence, brutality, and horrific stories all end with a surprising twist that you will never suspect. The best reading in years. Highly Recommended. My favorite is The Great Switcheroo. He is definatly one of the greatest writers of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute entertainment","review":"I picked this book up in the airport as I had a long flight home... and was not prepared for how rapidly I was to be absorbed and completely amused-- the entire 5 hour flight flew by! Nearly every story made me want to tell someone about it. My personal favorite is the second to last: \\" The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar.\\" I continue to lend it out to my friends simply to prove that even for those who claim not to have time to read books anymore-- that reading can be much more entertaining and shocking than any television show slotted for the hour that you are willing to sacrifice for your busy schedule-- and can take only 10 minutes with no commercials. Roald Dahl has taken the short story to a new level. Nearly every story in there was completely engaging and most were shockingly ended as well. I recommend this to anyone. Buy it for someone who doesn't like to read: it'll change their mind-- buy two-- because you won't want to part with your copy once you start. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the sick children's tales, only for adults","review":"Growing up, Roald Dahl was my favorite author. My memories of his sick and twisted stories like Matilda and the Twits balanced with the beyond belief tales of Charlie and the Chocolate factory were far better than any TV program. Now as a teen, I'm glad to have discovered his numerous short stories. They are equally, if not more so, twisted, but they are certainly not children's stories. I highly recommend this collection, as well has his other works to anyone who is looking to read something out of the ordinary and will have you thinking for days, just about a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor-quality paperback insults Dahl's talent","review":"This paperback is one of the worst I've ever seen in terms of paper, print, and binding quality. One story was printed in two different type fonts, the paper throughout is tissue-thin, and the layout of the pages is cramped and boring. Not at all what a writer of Dahl's stature deserves. Go to an actual bookstore and look at a copy of this book to see what I mean.There are options: Instead of settling for this cheap anthology, you can find very good, secondhand hardback copies of Dahl's books on the Web that have quality paper, good binding, colorful jackets, and sharper type and clearer page layout. This book is shameless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The master of the short story","review":"When you mention the name 'Roald Dahl' to most most people they think of a children's book author. Now where he has indeed written some of the finest and enjoyable children's books of all time- those folks (and you know who you are...) are surely missing out if they have not read his short stories aimed towards the more mature reader.

When I first heard of him I thought he is a very bad and boring writer, but when I first read one of his books, 'James and the giant peach' I realised that I was mistaken.

The idenitity of the abductor is shocking, and you will feel gratified at the ending, but the whole thing rings hollow by the time you get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monopoly Here & Now Edition","review":"This game is super! I could play it all day. There are airports instead of railroads, cell phone and internet service are the utilities, and the monetary value is in millions! Avaliable for purchase are things like Disney World, Golden Gate Bridge, White House, Fenway Park, and, the new boardwalk, Times Square.All of the properties were selected by US citizens. Votes were cast regionally for a landmark to represent the area. The properties were placed around the board in order of percent of regional population that voted for it over other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Change","review":"Its a good change from the classic version.Pros:--Millions and Billions of dollars transacted , so it does improve calculations.-New and Modern places. (Times Square, White House , Hollywood)-Better Houses and Hotels-Innovative tokens.Cons:--Those who are used to the classical game might find the transition difficult but onces used to this , you will love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game poorly made","review":"Overall, this is a great game. Hasbro has successfully taken a classic and re-designed it into something modern and exciting. The reason I'm only giving it a 2-star rating is because Hasbro is doing a terrible job manufacturing it. The first one I bought had cards that looked like they were cut out by a monkey, and even the board wasn't glued together properly- part of the top was wrinkled and torn. I returned it and bought another. The second was missing several cards and part of the board was a different color than the rest. So you never know what you're going to get when you buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Updated Monopoly - not updated fun","review":"My family gathered to play this game and I expected it to put some new twits into a game we've played for years. While the properties, chance and community chest have been updated, we soon realized the dollar values were just a straight multiplier of the original game. There were no new surprises in this game. No new twist on the old classic. I'd advise everyone to stay with the original unless you really need a new game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Innovation","review":"The up-dated Monopoly had to come some time, and this made a great game still great to play. I am still a fan of the original, but I enjoy this version too.I have to agree with some comments about the money being harder to use, and that is true. However, I think it is a minor problem. The extra zeros on all the denominations make things a bit tough to work out, but this is something one gets used to when they play it a few times. The modern highrise buildings, (rather than houses and hotels), are a great little touch, allowing you to build \\"up\\" rather than across.The new locations are great, and the new up-dated pieces are fun. Being made of metal, they are very durable too. The board folds in quarters, which is pretty common these days, (rather than in half with some of the older designs).Overall, this is a great version of Monopoly and adds something to the experience. Although I would not abandon the original version for it, it is a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game, but awful box","review":"I don't know why they didn't make the board simply fold in half. The money holder and plastic hotel/pieces holder is really chintzy, and it's very hard to put everything away when you're done. This game isn't cheap, so they could have taken a bit of extra thought so the game could be put away more effectively. Otherwise a fun updated version of Monopoly that my kids can identify a lot more with, and the money amounts make a lot more sense. I could have done without the product placement in the game pieces though."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun for the whole family","review":"We played already a few times, and we are playing all together, which was not the case before.

I bought this version in the hopes of reviving my interest in the game. It was indeed worth the cost. Every time my children asked to play this game I was as interested as they were.This is a refreshing new edition. The properties are more meaningful, and the currency is updated. The rules remain the same, however, it looks and feels more relevant.I recommend this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Evil should have bought this!","review":"This is a standard monopoly game; and while every monopoly game has a theme or twist to it, I have found this version to be extremely educational. Not only do prices, interest, and income finally reflect the new milenimum, but also the player pieces and property names."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for the whole family!","review":"I got this game free with my purchase and thought I would give it away for a gift. My son asked to keep it, and I am so glad he did! We really had a great time playing! It seemed so much less \\"cluttered\\" as we played due to the way they designed the new game. My kids were even noting places and we had great conversations about the different locations that they had on the board.

It's straight to the point and right in your face.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW ENEGRY","review":"I haven't read anything this captivating in a long, long time. I was hooked from page one, and could not put this book down until i was finished.

This book is definitely a ride worth taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, even greater author","review":"The Neverenders is a great debut novel from Sonbert. Its a look into the seedy underworld of sex drugs and rock n roll. Trainspotting meets Fight club in all aspects of the book.

Looking forward to upcoming stuff from Sonbert"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid debut","review":"In short, this book is a solid debut that kept me intrigued until the end. The main character is pretty believable - which one of us hasn't just wanted to jet and leave all behind one day and get in mixed with the fast crowd? I liked the wittiness of the comments that sort of streamed out of the main character..agree with others who have said it's like a catcher in the rye meets fight club. There were some loose ties that I wish could have been explained better (like the ending..how did the guy get in there at the end??? I don't want to spoil it though by giving too much information!) but overall, really good read concerning that I've seen many a first time writers flop and fail to keep me engaged. Waiting for the next one to see if the momentum is just as good and the storyline is tighter...!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GenX Revived","review":"Every GenXer knows these characters -- their angst and frustration facing a pending adulthood that counters all they've based the purpose of their lives on and celebrates all they've learned to despise. Wish The Never Enders -- or anything, for that matter --could reconcile that emotion, but instead the book thrives on it and fuels it. Wanna feel like your 20 years old and alive again? Turn on some Pearl Jam and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"The Never Enders is dirty, gritty and like pouring alcohol on an open wound. But you love every second of it. I was completely immersed in the story from page one. I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster in which every twist and turn is both shocking and exhilarating. The book's dark and intense pace could easily translate over to the big screen. Although, I'm not sure I want this story realized by Hollywood because it felt so personal to me. Regardless, I highly recommend The Never Enders.

Some of the track pieces were defective, making it impossible to connect them. Some time after Christmas we returned the item for the $70 back, and picked up a new one for the now lower price of $35. This one had the exact same defect. The defect is in the metallic track rails, which have a narrow prong at one end that inserts into the rail of the next piece of track. On several of the pieces, the prong is about twice as thick as it ought to be, making it impossible to insert into the next piece. If you can get two of them at $35 each, you'll have enough non-defective pieces to make it useable, otherwise it's a complete waste of money and time, and a source of frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish music","review":"go buy something else (just make sure that its from century media records). this trash is not representative of the label. just look at the logo! it looks like some football thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, stimulating","review":"Even the seasoned and super-successful writer will find this chatty butsuperbly planned book refreshing, stimulating, and sometimes evenpositively corrective.

He captures sentiment without saccarine sentimentality, morbidity, or nihilism. There is pervasive hopefulness in these stories. He captures the commonalities at the center of human consciousness: hopes, dreams, fantansies, fears, and failings in each soul's notable combination of set ways, potential, and fate.

I no longer have my copies but plenty of other people got hooked on my copies. Just wish they would either put out a new one or make a movie. Since Mr. Perry is now in Hollywood. The story is just so great because of the original characters in it. The villians are the best to ever be created. the action is so well detailed you can see it take place on the page.

When so many authors like Donaldson and Jordan have stories that seem to drag on endlessly, Perry's crisp, action-packed writing delivers. More events happen in one chapter than I've read in entire novels.Morigu is a guilty pleasure; sure I've read a lot of so-called \\"classics,\\" but I love sneaking back every now and then to re-read Morigu.IF YOU'RE OUT THERE MR.

After two years of painful searching (longing really), I was able to purchase it. This is simply some of the best writing I have ever read. In some ways I am sad that I ever picked it up because other books seem boring in comparison. I've no found any other book that comes close to it. It is a grade above (so far). For twenty two years I have faithfully read this book a least once (sometimes twice) each year. It just never gets tired. It's the only book that I've read and can now open to ANY page and get totally taken up in the story. Even knowing what is going to happen doesn't deter the authors crisp, detailed, yet gut wrenching writing style, and raw emotions this book will pull out of you.

This is a MUST read for any fantasy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morigu: Dead and the Desecration","review":"I picked up the Desecration way back in 1986 when it first came out by pure luck, and I have to say THANK GOD.

For years I waited for the next book until finally The Dead appeared on the shelves(the whole store heard me cheer), and if possible was even better. Today it is Feb 2001 and all my friends have read the series with much the same praise that I have, but with the same complaint. Please Mr. Leahy finish the series.

Anne, Duchess of York, Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland, Elizabeth, Countess de Grammont, and Henrietta, Countess of Rochester are just a few of the women that are depicted in this book. Each held her own grace in society, but more so each had her own story, some of polished lives, others of dysfunction and scandal.I found this book an interesting read because I knew very little, or nothing, of the ladies.

She keeps calling Claudius a usurper. In fact she calls him THE Usurper. But isnt a usurper someone who takes the throne through force and has no right to it? That is a lot different from the last surviving adult male of the imperial family inheriting it when there isnt a will. The book is very cynical in this and other ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"An entertaining exercise in aprioricity","review":"While admirably accessible even to the lay reader, Barbara Levick's work has the unfortunate quality of total unrelatedness to fact. It is baffling how she attempts to justify some of the claims she makes here, aside from cryptic comments to the effect that Claudius 'would never have intended' or 'would be out of character' with regard to some putative intention. Perhaps Levick has access to the lost histories of Claudius, but if so, she should surely do them justice in her bibliography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I found this book to be poorly written. Levick seems to try to liven up the soporific narrative by inserting modern phrases and words that appear to be out of place. For example; it seems that there were a lot of \\"hooligans\\" in ancient Rome. As to the historical facts, they appear to be well researched but I think that their presentation in thematic chapters rather than in linear fashion is due to the narrative shortcomings of the author. Overall I found the book to be a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This book to find publisher's and agents was published in the year 2000.

Best known for his Big Band recordings and for his jazz / classical crossover compositions, this 1972 solo session demonstrates his ability as a mainstream pianist.The results are a little mixed. \\"King Porter Stomp\\" is rather four square and closer to ragtime than any Morton performance. Similarly, the Waller items are overfamiliar and at times rather rushed. However, the three Hines tracks are excellent - Bolling really captures Hines' early style. The highlight of the CD is a rather unlikely stride transformation of Horace Silver's funky \\"The Preacher\\", taken at a rocking medium tempo, and demonstrating Bolling's ability to build up the tension in a solo.An enjoyable disc for fans of mainstream jazz piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boss Audio Bv10.4 inch","review":"I hate it because it still doesn't work so they said I cannot return it, and I can't find a boss audio store near me to fix it.

I am a computer junkie and a scrabooking junkie and I just love how you can print out one sheet that has all the photos and clipart on it. Spend the money on the full-size pieces of photo paper instead of plain printing paper--it's worth it! The best part is how you can shrink or blow up the pictures--if you are scrabooking by hand you are stuck with one size photo. All of the photo edges and other photo options are great.

Interesting Story!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"True or False?","review":"This a very interesting book. However, it's authorship is not without dispute. It is my understanding that the family of Saint Exupéry believe that Denis de Rougement is the actual writer of the manuscript. However, even if this so, it may have well been dictated by Consuelo so I don't see an easy answer to that debate. At least one finds out Madame X's identify in the preface.I have read \\"Kingdom of the Rocks\\" by Consuelo and cannot state that I believe the authorship to be one way or the other; although if this is Consuelo's work, very heavy editing is obvious. The Antoine de Saint Exupéry presented in this book is definitely not the one shown in any other book I have read by, or about him and until a third party arises to confirm the circumstances and authorship of this book I would say \\"reader beware\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't put too much faith in the subtitle","review":"Consuelo de Saint-Exupery writes with a unique voice and offers a glimpse into the life of her husband, Antoine, and her own life in his shadow. It is not an autobiography of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, nor should one expect the presence of the Little Prince throughout the entirety of her account. There is a build-up and a myriad of experiences behind the \\"love story\\" and Consuelo does a fantastic job of documenting the significant events.It was very interesting to read her account of the time she spent alone, both during the time she was stationed in the desert and World War Two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy neo Bossa-Samba","review":"This is an awesome cd from Roberto Cohelo, the groovy sounds are awesome, it is part of a kind of neo-electro-bossa-samba movement in Brasil!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Video Material","review":"I really think the material on this is quite old and was obviously transfered from old VHS files trying to repackage as new material.The quality of the images were quite fuzzy and I do not think there was too much here that you could not find that was better on old videos.The quality was much better on the other series called the Seasoned Travelers which was shown on some PBS stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... it's good for beginners.","review":"This was probably a waste of my money.

My favorite tune is still \\"If You...\\", but enjoy all the cuts in repeated listenings. This week I found the tape had gone bad, so I'm purchasing the same now on CD. Just rent \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" if you wish to hear \\"If You...\\", as well as see a pretty good Jeff Daniels comedy (w/ J. Carey).

I'd never read any of Eisner's work, famous as he is, and I mostly thought of him as the creator of The Spirit, a comic book hero.This trilogy, though, is both an autobiography of sorts for Eisner and a biography of a street in New York City. The three books share an attention to detail combined with an epic sweep of history. Eisner explores religion, the meaning of life, aging, poverty, immigration, racial and ethnic relations, and the development of urban centers with a keenly observant -- if not objective -- eye.The black-and-white illustrations are perfect for the stories. The drawing has a raggedly realistic style that catches every piece of cracked plaster, every shadowed face, every trick of the light.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Get What I Ordered","review":"I ordered The Contract With God Trilogy, and instead received a book that only contained the one novel.

The graphics are fantastic and the sound has been much improved over the blips and bleeps of the last installment (HOD). Konami has really come close to perfection in its game design- the layout of the castle was obviously very well thought out, and there's hardly any backtracking or aimless wandering like the last 2 castlevanias.My only gripe, and it is a substantial one, is that the game in its entirety can be completed in under 8 hours. True, there's a hard mode that opens up after you beat the game once, and there's a second character that you can use, but these don't exactly justify the game's extremely short length. If you haven't played any of the past Castlevanias, this may be the best one to start with, as it is by far the most polished; there's just not much overall quantity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Castle to Rise Again","review":"So Castlevania has once again risen from the depths of darkness, its time to pick up your sword and take out the evil Lord Dracula once again.

Over the weeks following my purchase I changed my mind. While I was reading a Nintendo Power magazine they said that it is a challenging game that would take 20 hrs. to beat , but I beat it in less than 7 1/2 hrs. I also don't like this game because after you beat Dracula you can't continue playing, because I haven't discovered the whole map. Overall I think they should make Aria of Sorrow much harder to beat, and I think that you should think twice before buying this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed by the depth and length","review":"For a game boy game this is surprisingly lengthly and options rich.

While the book is well written and laid out, I was vey disappointed in the pictures. Very few photographs showed the actual pattern itself, leaving you to view a distant image and try and figure out what's in it. I'm sure at least one picture of only the pattern could be included, instead of several pictures of different colors. I'm sure the veterans out there find this invaluable, but for a beginner, this leaves alot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappointment....","review":"I was really looking forward to this edition of Gene's book but I found it lacking in many areas.

I have been pleasantly surprised by this product. It basically attaches to the sides of the violin (or smaller sized viola) and creates a lane that students have to bow within. For some of my students, we do a few warm-ups with it on and for other students, I have them use it for the entire lesson. Many of my students have commented that it really helps them feel what their arm should be doing on long bow strokes. I love this product and plan to use it in the fall for students in my orchestra class who are struggling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might scratch your violin","review":"The fittings where the bow-right attaches to the violin are hard plastic (not rubberized like I thought), which seems like it could scratch my violin pretty easily. I'm an adult learner, and thought that this might be able to help me learn to bow straight, but after trying it once, I'm really not comfortable putting it back on my violin. If you don't bow correctly, it's easy to smack into this and move it around a bit.If you have a cheaper violin that you're not worried about scratching, you might want to give this a try, but it was a waste of money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed","review":"I ordered this product to help me correct some poor bowing techniques.

The quality of paper is of a very good fine smooth grade. Unfortunately this appears to add to the weight that has to be supported by the thin cardboard cover and glued spine. Simply laying the book open mid-way through its 1074 pages proved to be too much of a strain with the result that the cover separated from the rest of the book at the spine. Additionally the pages have also split from the glued spine in a couple of places. I treat books with respect and am not a spine bender or a page flattener. I am also an occasional rather than a heavy user of this book. This is not the quality of binding that I would expect in a publication labelled as a 'shop manual'.

All are excellent GPS devices and have become essential in finding meeting locations and baseball fields where my son plays, especially when the directions provided by the other coach are flawed or sketchy. The 680 is larger and easier to see, but the best addition is the MSN traffic. We live around a large metropolitan area so it is helpful and has already allowed me to avoid certain roads because the Garmin indicates there is a high traffic volume. If you live in a remote area of the country it is not much value. All in all I would prefer this device over the smaller 350 and 360 because of the bigger screen.

First off the MSN free year was useless, it worked about once or twice. The other major issue I have is that it picks the absolute worst routes throughout the city of LA. Since when was zigzagging through hollywood, making multiple left turns faster than going straight down a road and making one left turn? I have it set on the fastest route possible, but honestly, it picks the slowest route more often than not. Also the freeway interchanges are often confusing, saying stuff like stay on the 110 North and then at the last minute it'll say take the 110 South, causing you to get into a near accident. The unit does eventually get you to your final destination, but don't count on it being a logical route."},{"rating":"2","title":"nuvi 680 is tops","review":"I agree with previous reviews. 680 easy to use. accurate.

At this point I see little use except for weather forecast.I used it on a trip to Boston and when we left it took us North with no problems at all. In fact it was a breeze. That is saying a lot because Boston traffic and streets are a real maze.I would buy the 660 if I had my experience now. It has blue tooth and travel functions just no MSN Direct. No loss.

Others would travel on miles of gravel roads even when a paved route was available. Changing the settings (route preferences) made no difference.

The 680 will lose the GPS signal when driving through the Fort Pitt tunnels (Pittsburgh, PA). The 350 does not. Bluetooth connects fine. If you live in a big city MSN works fine. I live 30 miles west of Pittsburgh, and cannot pick up the signal. The map shows I should.

After some internet research i realised this was a known problem where pressing the reset button sometimes fixed it. However in my case it didn't work.So I rang Samsung who were unable to help but referred me to a service centre - they quoted $60 just to look at it prior to a quote.So I have a broken samsung mp3 player to go with my broken samsung mobile.

The jack on the one we received was defective. When you plugged in the earbuds that came with the unit, you had to spin the plug in the jack to find the magic spot that made the connection -- but even then the connection did not hold. We tried another set of earbuds and high-quality headphones with the device, without success: The defect was clearly in the jack of the MP3 player. We requested a refund and the Amazon return procedure went off without a hitch -- so 5 stars for Amazon but only 1 for the Samsung YP-K3JAB (only because you cannot rate an item as zero stars!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software and Documantation Lacking","review":"I purchased this and it plays songs just fine.

I really like the size, battery life and GUI of the player. One thing you will want to decide is what firmware you want to run.USA firmware (standard):-Few sound sets such as vocal, bass boost, etc.-Organizes music like most Mp3 player by reading the ID3 tags and organizing in Artist, Genre, Album, etc.-No text viewerKorean firmware:-Lots of sound options along with custom bass boost and custom EQ settings.-You have to organize your music in folders, it doesn't organize by ID3 tags.-Text viewer-Plays .OGG music files.Right now I am running the Korean firmware because I enjoy the custom EQ and bass boost, but it is up to you.

Its awesome if you love to write and even if you don't. I has small sections of questions that you don't have to write too much down and the option of writing on the side like extra room if you need to take notes or just want to expand on your thoughts.

At times I felt I was bombarded with facts.- Flat, boring characters. With the exception of Lord Nelson and Emma Hamilton, none of the characters stood out. They were all one-dimensional and very forgettable.- Slow moving.

It was here where I read for the first time that four out of the five games in this bundle are supported for Windows 98 only. As in, they didn't \\"fix\\" any game to work on newer Windows versions. It literally is the same game from years ago.This is mentioned nowhere on the outside of the box, or in Amazon's description.

However, I have grown a liking to the original characters and the original plot. Although you join with Issac's group halfway through the game...it was still different. This sequal is definatly a lot \\"darker\\" than the first. Those of you who also enjoyed the cheeryness of the first one will not find that here. Although, this is an extremly good game, filled with lots of puzzels and item collecting. NOTE*** newcomers to the Golden Sun series will not understand the plot easily. it is recomended that you play the first on first and beat it.The Djinn however are still in this game, with even MORE to collect. You can even transfer your stats over from the first game to this one. There are great new puzzles, monsters, and of course, the Jupiter and Mars lighthouses.Great game. If your a fan of RPGs, or just like playing a fun game, the final instalment of the Golden Sun series isjust for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Gaming","review":"Man, this game really is complex. There are sidequests, 72 djinn to get and you start off the game with no idea on what to do next. There are combo summons, and the hardest boss of all the gameboy RPG's is included in the gameplay. Once you beat the lost age, it'll be almost impossible to find a game as good as it. There is a wide selection of GBA RPG's out there, and Golden Sun and Golden Sun 2 are some of the best. I reccomend both of them."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},O={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-06449ea8"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/49.md","filePath":"sponsor/49.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/49.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{R as __pageData,P as default};
