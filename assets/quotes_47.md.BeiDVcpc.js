I believe you will be very happy with this, I plan on giving them as baby gifts -- really awesome!!!LIKE:*low price*keeps baby in place (our baby can't sit unassisted yet but this held him in place)*folds up small (fits into my purse inside included storage bag)*machine washable/dryable*fits every chairDISLIKE:*wish they made an organic/eco-friendly version"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what it says!","review":"We used this highchair on a recent vacation. It allowed us to convert the high 'bar style' chair in our hotel into a usable chair for our 9 month old, meaning he could eat with us at the table. It seems very secure and he was happy to be in it. It has washed well. I also tried it out on a very open impossible looking chair in our home before we left... It worked well on that chair too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy portable chair","review":"What a great idea. We have used this seat a few times - we visit grandma's house and she doesn't have a high chair, so this works great. Very easy to put together and to adjust, and it's also very easy to clean - just throw it in the washer.One thing to watch for, though, is that there is no padding behind baby, so if the chair has a hard back and baby gets excited, they could hit their head. We remedied this by putting a thin pillow or blanket between the totseat and the chair.Still a highly recommended product. you can't beat its portability and convenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I thought this was a brilliant idea, but when I received the product, it was not great. The materia was mediocre, and the chair sagged a bit. I would not waste my money on this. I wish I spent a few more dollars and gotten the portable chair that hooked onto the table instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have for travel","review":"I bought this in anticipation of attending two college reunions in June with my 14 month old. Wasn't sure if there would be highchairs easily available. Although it is a little tedious setting this up on a chair whenever you go somewhere, it is a great portable high chair. It pretty much sits in the basket of our stroller for when we are out and about (we live in a city). It has been great at restaurants when all the high chairs are in use! The one other drawback to it is your kid is basically at eye level with the table, unlike in a high chair. We have a very tall toddler so it is not a huge deal but if you have a little peanut they might feel kind of distanced from the action.But a great travel item, for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! So practical!","review":"We bought this to use while traveling, and we are so pleased with it so far! This week we used it while in Germany and France, and it worked on every chair we tried, even a really tall outdoor chair. Our 11-month-old son sits securely and seems to really enjoy being able to kick up and hold his feet. It doesn't have a tray and he doesn't sit up high enough to use the table, but that was ok with us. Be aware, though: we had to pull the chair back a bit because he used his feet to push off and tip the chair (luckily I was there to catch the chair before it hit the floor!). I think I will buy this for friends as my new \\"default\\" baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if your tot likes to eat at the table","review":"I tried this totseat with my nearly 9 month old. It is a great harness if you need to keep them in place, but does not work with an average table and chair set. We like to offer puffs or mashed fruit at the table - this offers no place to put them. The baby sits on the regular seat and is, therefore, too low. I will be looking for something with a tray.

I highly recommend this seat if you are on the go and don't want to lug around anything big or heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nasty little book, which systematically distorts the facts","review":"This is a nasty little book. Budiansky's approach is thoroughly dishonest, and frankly, rather cheap. At times, it reads more like a religious tract than a body of serious scholarship.Budiansky has an axe to grind, and no amount of evidence is going to get in his way. His idea is neither original nor very convincing: humans are in some magical way unique from other animals. Again and again, evidence of non-humans thinking and behaving in ways that are obviously intelligent is either ignored or seriously misrepresented. It is true that it is possible to over-interpret behavioural experiments; however, what is needed is a more scientific approach, not a less scientific one. Moreover, the first step for anyone writing a book like this is to read the literature properly: this is something which Budiansky has clearly not done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in the past...","review":"The author's opinions reflect the mind-set of many ethologists. They are stuck in a world in which the only valid way to understand other animals is to attempt to reduce their behavior to a set of reflexes to different stimuli. Consequently, they are completely incapable of making sense of the animals' subjective experiences. The Scientific Method is very good as some things - for example, chemistry and physics - but understanding the subjective experiences of other creatures is not one of them.Given the lack of balance and insight in this book, it would be interesting to find out whether it was funded by some interest group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than its reviews would indicate!","review":"It's very sad that a lot of readers who have reviewed this book have been unable to get past their beliefs to give this book an honest review.

Perhaps it is because of these high expectations that I was so disappointed by Engineer of Dreams: Great Bridge Builders and the Spanning of America. In the end, Petroski seems much better at writing about engineering artifacts - pencils, paper clips, or, in this book, bridges - than the makers of those artifacts. Much of Petroski's \\"biography\\" here seemed nothing less than mere formula: you could almost see him filling in his computer template for \\"name, date and place of birth, school, mentor, etc.\\" each time a new engineer was introduced. Further, he did not even attempt to vary the template from person to person, so that the repetitive style becomes unmistakable. This book is worth reading insofar as it provides a history of the bridges themselves, and the limits of engineering technique and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mackinac Bridge is finally recogized","review":"Finally, FINALLY: a recognition of David Steinman's achievements. The Mackinac Bridge has been described as a \\"symphony of concrete and steel\\". If Steinman had not been an enginneer, he may have been a musician.Some structures clearly belong where they are placed. Just a few, though. Steinman had the eye for such places: Messina, for example. It was nice to see a chapter devoted to him, and the rest of the book was good, but otherwise documented."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great journey","review":"A wonderful journey into the playful and visionary mind of a very talented American young Woman.

Especially if you are a student of massage therapy. The blocky, often illegible graphics, along with extremely compacted information will confuse rather than help someone who is new to trigger point and myofascial therapy. The compact and highly technical information is only good if you have a really strong background in medical terminology. Students, I suggest looking for a different book.You will also find that the pages in this book easily fall out, and there are a LOT of mistakes in the review questions (they often give you the wrong answer in the answer key).

Dog Law, By Mary Randolph is now in it's third publication, and I highly recommend it to all dog owners.

I love weird stories by authors with off-beat senses of humour, and this book fits the bill. My favorite story of them all is the one where he invents an invisible friend to help him get out of field day, but his mom turns the tables on him by treating the best friend even better than she treats Andy.I'm an elementary school teacher, and WOULDN'T READ this to my class due to some of the situations presented. The most disturbing story was the one where Andy dressed up as a girl and went to a dance, where one of the boys tried to pick himi up. However, I will read it to my children at home because I know there won't be any complaints. It's a perfect book to pick up when you have 10-15 minutes to spend reading because you can easily finish each short story within that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fiirst chapter alone is worth the price of the book!","review":"Read this book to my son's 2nd grade class.

So you lose over 5\\" of space. So you buy this large cabinet but can't fit large items into any of the drawers!I like the fact that is has a large continuous and flat (as opposed to annoying legs) base and that there are rollers for the drawers (albeit plastic).Overall, if you want to store alot of stuff or large items like large power tools, etc. I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference","review":"This is a great reference, giving a good overview of most common test methods.

Jill Hennessry is very believable as Jackie Kennedy and when the President dies - her scenes will break your heart and take you right back to that dreadful moment in time. Lauren Holly is excellent as Ethel and fun to watch - Leslie Stefanson is surprisingly effective as Joan Kennedy,you can find yourself cheering for her and that surprised me. This movie is about these three remarkable women and that theme is carried out from the beginning to the end of the film. I have watched this movie several times since I purchased it and enjoyed it each time. If you are interested in the \\"Kennedys\\" - you will like this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idealized","review":"The screenplay to this production was written by someone wishing to portray the Kennedy women as strong & independent in their own rights. Given the recent releases of some of her old interviews in which Jackie stated that her opinions were pretty much given to her by JFK, and the shock expressed by Caroline's daughters in learning that their grandmother was the antithesis of a liberated woman, it is difficult to make that case with Jackie. Recalling Joan's bouts with alcoholism as a result of her marriage to Ted the words strong & independent do not fit so well. Perhaps Ethel was the exception, but I suspect she was very much the traditional housewife. With Joan, who was not so strong, & Jackie, who was anything but independent, we are being asked to empathize with people who were privileged and wealthy, and somehow relate to their stories. This is hard to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAMELOT","review":"Jill Hennsey played wonderul role protraying Jackie Kennedy. It gives the viewer a part in the movie itself as there is good drama, and role acting. I felt part of the film myself. Excellent.

It was a horrible day that afternoon, that we were dismiss from class early and sent home. The church bells rang out in morning. I will never forget that day. I enjoyed the movie very well.

The setting is like a stage play, but the reading of the script. The flow is as if you are a part of the drama in her life, cutting from scene to scene as if a memory process. It is not like your normal documentary. It gives life to a narration , but only uses six people.It's like watching a live production in the making.I feel that the video is more for an older audience with an interest in theater in order to fully intake the form Lorraine has chosen to present the story.

The packaging and deployment is a large area of the exam - this book doesn't come close to preparing you for that. This book is okay as a supplement, but you won't pass if this is all you read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate for the test","review":"I primarily studied for the exam by using this book. I felt I knew the material very well and was surprised to find the exam very different and considerably harder than the study questions (although I thankfully still passed). There were questions on the exam that the book hadn't even mentioned. The book covers most of the material on the exam and you should know the material in this book for the exam. Its weakness is that it is insufficiently deep is many areas. The Package and Deployment Wizard sections were particularly weak. I would definitely supplement this book with some other study materials such as the Transcender tests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not EXAM prep","review":"I am very new to VB but managed to pass the exam. I used both this book and the training kit from MSPress to prepare. I have to agree with many of the comments were people say that the material is not covered in sufficient depth. The questions in the exam are of a different nature and much tougher than the examples in the book. Packaging and deploying are not covered in any where near the depth needed for the test. For that matter the MSPress book wasn't much better. What really helped me was finally reading extensively in the VB programmers guide and MSDN. If this book was to be reviewed from the angle of learn the basics I would give it a higher rating. But as a tool for getting you through the exam it rates very low. You have to use other material."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"Please don't buy this book!... The author seems to have forgotten that he is writing a book to prepare the readers for the exams. The book covers the basics of Visual Basic and the questions that are provided don't even come close to the real exam. The book's contents are misleading -- the reader will think that the author will have covered the topic in depth. However, the author will just give you the basics of it. Furthermore, the main areas such as Package and Deployment and Visual Source Safe are barely covered.I used \\"MCSD in a nutshell\\" book from O'Reilly publications along with Transcender exams to clear the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get 50% of the real thing","review":"This book is OK for reading and learning the basics. The depth of Exam objectives cover by this book isn't enough. VSS is almost forgotten in this book. P&D was too far simplistic never got into the real exam questions scenarios. Use this one as a starter practice with transcender to get 20% more knowledge. The key to this exam is experience, actual programming scenarios. If you are new to VB, it might take you a while to get certified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismally Inadequate","review":"The cover of this book says \\"Everything You need to Prepare for - and Pass - Exam 70-176\\". It doesn't come close ! The book contains a large number of errors, but its worst failing is that it is far too simple. I got halfway through the book and in my frustration decided to check what else was on offer through Amazon. It wasn't a great surprise to see all the other poor reviews of this book, but I also fortunately read many recommendations for the New Riders book for VB 6. I bought it and can wholeheartedly recommend it (it covers both 70-175 and 70-176)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor coverage of exam material and poor review questions.","review":"1) Did not cover Visual SourceSafe or Visual Component Manager at all! 2) Coverage of the Package and Deployment Wizard was poor. 3) End of chapter review questions and exams on CD-ROM are more or less the same questions. The questions are not scenario-based like the ones on the test. I barely passed the test. I strongly believe that if I had not been using VB6 on the job I would have failed. I guess the publisher wanted to be the first to have a guide on the shelf. There are better books now; look into New Rider's $70 book covering both exams (175 and 176)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes, Mistakes, Mistakes and Missing Code too!","review":"I'm sorry but for a technical reference I expect acurate information. To follow example code to the letter only to find out it doesn't work may be a learning experience, but not one I want to pay for. Also there are references to code that should be on the CD-Rom but aren't. Lastly their web sight doesn't contain any fixes or known errors (at leat not as of 3/9/99). If I could give this less than 1 star I would, a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, comprehensive, needs more example questions.","review":"This book doesn't have any of the signs of being rushed out to be the first on the shelf (although it does have its share of mistakes). Screen-shots are spread throught the book, making it easy to follow examples with practice sitting at the computer. The book begins each topic from quite a basic standpoint (although some basic knowledge prior to beginning this book would be a definite advantage). Some areas of the exam syllabus aren't sufficiently covered (e.g. deployment, testing and Visual Source Safe), but others easily make up for this lack (e.g. ActiveX controls are covered very well). Example questions are generally too short, and it's a pity that more advantage wasn't taken of the enclosed CD (the questions in the book and on the CD are exactly the same)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book to Prepare For Exam 70-176","review":"This Book is very much useful for student doing MCSD or Preparing For Visual Basic Desktop Applications 70-176 Exam.

Basically, this book is adequate for brushing up on aspects of VB that you rarely or never use, but the text is not a good exam preparation tool. The book has too many errors that are not noted on the errata site and the review questions bear little resemblance to those on exam 70-176. The Transcender exam simulations that I purchased were a far more useful tool for exam preparation -- at least 1/3 of the questions on the actual exam were near duplicates of questions on the Transcender practice tests. I'm not completely disappointed that I bought this book because I did learn a few things that I can use in my job, but without another prep tool, I doubt that I'd have passed the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses The Mark","review":"This book definately misses the mark. It's a good reference manual at best for some basic things that you don't use often. The example questions are nothing like the exam, being more vb trivia questions than anything else.

If your an intermediate level or better vb'er look somewhere else, there is not enough here to get you through the test unless you have 3+ years of vb experience.To bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book","review":"The contents of this book is not enough, don't trust the questions in the book, they are as easy as ABC and can't reflect the difficulties of the exams.

The other didn't work because the batteries had leaked inside. I will store the batteries separately for the one good lamp that is left. Light is bright and diffused with the shade, but the handle is very flimsy. You have to hold it by the base. Will not buy again because they are too flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - save time and frustration and buy another product.","review":"I purchased one of these and, while well packaged, it did not work.

I think it will be really handy and a little more useful than a flashlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad waste of money","review":"These lamps are a tremendous disappointment and completely useless. Each lamp requires four D batteries (expensive!) which cannot be installed in lamp base. The contact plates for the batteries are spread out so that the batteries will not stay in place. There are no instructions within or outside the box, and no phone number or e-mail address for product support. Health problems and lack of transportation prevented me from returning them.

I ordered three of these little lamps to have on hand, and I'm glad I did. The power went out again last week, and I had plenty of light to read by without worrying about using dangerous candles or propane lanterns that give off carbon monoxide.Although they are primarily plastic construction, they are reasonably sturdy and quite inexpensive -- making them a good value. They each took 4 D batteries, but after several hours of use the lights were still as bright as when I first turned them on, so they seem to be fairly economical to operate. No more sitting in the dark when the power goes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the 3 ordered actually worked","review":"I was excited to break out my lamps that I had ordered last December when Hurricane Irene came through.

I am irate and of course I can't return them now.....I guess the moral of the story is don't wait until you actually need your emergency lamps, go into it assuming they won't work and test them. Terrible product. Not up to Amazon standards and should be discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorcy 41-1016 Indoor/Outdoor Table Lamp, Colors May Vary","review":"Might have been ok if the bottom of the lamp was inside the box. The bottom of the lamp holds the batteries in. Hmmm? Someone must have been having a bad day in the shipping dept. Oh, the other one having the bottom does work... the light is a low beam.

A curious side effect of this food has been a tremendous increase in his energy level and he no longer wakes up sore and no longer whines when he stretches. He also is a lot faster on the steps and doesn't hesitate like he has been doing for two years. He has been off his medication for the last month and still he just overall seems like he feels much better and I see no difference in his behavior with or without the medication.

Everyone can relate to a relationship that has ended. This book is so enlightening as it places many different letters from healthy and the not so healthy relationships in one place. This book is refreshing in the sense that you can see the bad points in your relationship and move on. Giving you a wide range of author's this book gives you a large canvas to view relationships and their demise from. Some letters are from famous ladies, and the others are not so famous. I think the value of this is walking away with the knowledge that life goes on without that particular person in your life. All in all a book that evokes sympathy, laughter, and a tear or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was a disappointment. It was nothing like the title would have you believe. If I wanted to read Jane Austen, I would have. I felt like I was just reading a mod podge of anything that could be found on the subject. The author was inspired by her own break up letter. Personally, I think if you have to rely on the F word over and over, you're not much of a writer and the organization (or lack thereof) of the book just underlined that fact. I wish I could get my money and my time back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"This book is simply a lot of fun to flip through. It's a neat way to see a different side of famous figures, ranging from Lady Mary Wortley Montagu to George Sand to Dorothy Sayers to Anne Boleyn, Mary Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Bronte... I was impressed with the sheer range of figures represented. It's an addictive read."},{"rating":"2","title":"cky oh yeah","review":"this is an amazing DVD and an amazing compilation of songs!The videos are awesome and the free DVD chopped and sliced is even better including nevva b-4 seen live concert footage!I'm goin 2 c CKY in Birmingham come December.

I know they didn't have a large budget(its obvious on some of them) but maybe they just should of released Chopped and Sliced instead, which is the better part of the album. Dont think I'm a hater, but this dvd was kindy poopy and so was Haggard, Bam and company need to make another great CKY for everyone to love again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works fine","review":"I received the item and all looked ok, seems to be a well made unit with all the required hardware for install. Took me a little over a hour to install it, though some of that time was cleaning/oiling the slides and other items once the door panel was removed.Once installed it works great, no complaints at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Swing","review":"I became a big band fan in 1937 and this is the best big band album I have ever experienced (to say heard would have under- rated it). All arrangements (J. Hill)are terrific. There are no vocals, no novelty songs--just straight ahead solid stimulating swing by a perfectly balanced big band. Thank you, Les, God bless your soul, for leaving us this one. Recorded in 1986--amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Swing - It Doesn't","review":"I've listened to a lot of Les Brown music but this album doesn't excite me. The personel lineup is impressive with Andy Martin, Jack Sperling, Matt Utal and other familiar Brown sidemen. I feel that the arrangements were somewhat weak and predictable. Solos and the album, in general, lacked energy and excitement.Brown has had much better albums such as \\"Dancer's Choice\\" and \\"Les Brown's in Town\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"underappreciated house track","review":"This is a wonderful house track. I played this for my friends who hate vocals in house music, and even they liked this one, because the music is just so great! The lyrics wrap well around the beats, making for a great little house number. The only mix worth listening to though is \\"Mark's E-Sa Mix\\". The rest of the are pretty droll. The CD gets 4 stars just for the \\"Mark's E-Sa Mix\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a picture book","review":"I should have read more reviews before buying this book. It was about 2 pages of writing and the rest pictures. All the pictures looked like they could have all been taken at one run, because you see the same guys over and over.

I'm a size 8, usually about 140 pounds, 5'4\\" with lots of muscle from years of track. This scale tells me I'm about 40% body fat...I can't believe this is right since there isn't a whole heck of a lot of places on me where you can pinch out fat. It's got a lot of bells and whistles, but I wish I had saved my money and gotten a regular scale to tell me my pounds; that's the only job this scale does that I trust to be correct!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for body fat","review":"This was a very disappointing purchase. I bought this scale to be able to measure and track body fat. Two out of 3 users can not receive any body fat numbers - it just displays an error. The third user gets a body fat number but it is obviously incorrect. It displays over 50% body fat...this is rated as an obese person...yet this person is fairly thin. I would not recommend purchase of this scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bathroom scale for under $100","review":"I bought this scale after going through lots of cheaper scales. This scale is everything I was looking for. It measures body fat, muscle mass, water weight, and total body mass up to 400 lbs. You can store info for several different people and track your changes. It has a huge platform, and it looks great. Buy this scale. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Features, OK Accuracy","review":"This scale includes the features we're most interested in: weight; muscle mass, body fat and body water %. We had to return the first one we bought since it had some marks from manufacturing on the digital readout panel - Amazon very promptly relaced it. It is important to moisten your feet before using it; otherwise the readouts are not accurate beyond basic weight measurement.Taylor needs to sync up their marketing and product information with their current products. Their website doesn't organize their scales by features nor do they offer comparison tables or other helpful information. So, it was only by digging that we were able to find out which scale to choose.At the end of the day, this Taylor 5598 is a good product with really nice features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful book.","review":"This book is enlightening on what's actually happening when you drink coffee or alcohol.

I didn't see an obvious way to switch between AV inputs on the display itself, having instead to use the supplied remote, but that's not a huge deal.

It came with an A/C monitor with 240 Volts and a plug that would only work in Europe.

Especially, from this seller, it was exactly as described and I couldn't believe how quickly I received it! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy read","review":"Salzman bases much of her argument on quantitative data. Her main conclusion is that the aristocracy only became predominantly Christian by the reign Theodosius, some sixty years after Constantine's death, primarily because it became a way to advance in society. It is certainly a plausible, and perhaps even likely case for a complicated subject. Worth the read for anyone interested in Roman history and religion, and Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good taste","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that the taste of this is very Crisco-y. The only reason I gave it two stars is for convenience. Yes, the Wilton class will mention as many of their products as possible (which is fine, they sponsor the class, but some products are NOT good). You just have to pick and choose which products are actually beneficial for you...and some you can buy in a different brand but the same basic product. As for this icing, I plan to make my own once I am done using the one jar for my class. Actually, you are supposed to make your own batch of icing for the second class session, so maybe it will taste a little better even made with Crisco. I'm going to switch to REAL buttercream with BUTTER after the class. You can also use the 40% or 50% off coupons in the paper or online to buy the meringue powder from one of the craft stores, which is a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilton Frosting","review":"The frosting did not taste very good, but it decorates well because it is stiff.

It has a waxy, stale, artifical flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and Not Needed","review":"This icing is average and unfortunately expensive. Wilton will insist that you bring this to your first class, ignore them and make it yourself. The Wilton recipe is all over the internet, is fairly cheap to make and is what you'll be making for your second class. This tastes fine, but is far too expensive for what you get.The only way I would get it again is if it were on sale because it does give you icing of the right consistency for your first cake decorating class, if you've never made icing before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pathetic","review":"This has to be something straight from the J.

If you are a HP fan, stay away from this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"a keeper","review":"Does a great job of relating to what the father is going through. Absolutely hysterical and very real. Had both my husband and I laughing every page. Churchwell's research into the role of the father through history and in many cultures provides insight not found in \\"what to expect\\" and the rest of that stack. His display of backbone with overbearing hospital staff during labor and delivery is inspiring without being rude. Our copy is getting well-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"I read several reviews of several books trying to find a decent book written about pregnancy from the man's point of view. There didn't seem to be much out there and the few books published had mixed reviews. If you are like me you don't necessarily need a step by step manual. What will happen will happen. Besides, there are other books for that (What to Expect) and a zillion blogs/web sites to help you along there. Instead, what this book provides is one man's perspective of his experience with pregnancy coupled with some fairly serious and well thought out theoretical content trying to explain WHY things are happening the way they are.My wife is reading every pregnancy \\"manual\\" under the Sun and she seemed impressed with the information I was able to contribute to our journey as a result of me reading this book. This tells me that there are at least some good tidbits in Pregnant Man you won't find elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!","review":"This book on aromatherapy and its effects is very informative as well as enjoyable. You'll learn so much about what different oils can be helpful for a variety of conditions. It also gives advice on massaging and health. WELL WORTH IT-especially for aromatherapy lovers who aren't sure how to get started with creating scents and mixing essential oils."},{"rating":"2","title":"More About Cancer, Less About Nutrition","review":"This movie was entertaining and inspiring but not what I expected. To be fair, I thought Kris would spend more time talking about the nutritional details of her healing strategy. She covered the basics, like the importance of eating clean & raw, but most of the time was spent discussing other options she explored before finding what worked. SHE is inspiring and so is HER story, but she also introduced us to a number of other cancer patients to talk about their journeys. That wasn't as interesting to me because they are going through standard treatments as opposed to incorporating diet and exercise. But again, this review reflects my personal interests.Bottom line: If you're primarily interested in watching a documentary about cancer, this is great. If your focus is nutrition, buy Crazy Sexy Diet instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Kriss Carr","review":"This has been another great tool to share with my community and my clients.I have lent it out to dozens of clients and bought it as gifts for others.The reviews have always been, as mine are - positively positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cancer","review":"This was a great flick about all the trials and tribulations of how Kris Carr, and others, fought their battles with cancer.

That did not happen in this case. I watched this film in hopes of being inspired and I was, by a few of the women, but not by the main subject. I realize that this sounds quite INsensitive, but I didn't see how this woman's experience was documentary-worthy. She never seemed to feel crummy other than emotionally, i.e., feeling sorry for herself, never had to deal with chemotherapy....yes, she had many tumors but at no point in the film did they pose much of a threat other than psychologically. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad she's okay and I understand how scary the situation must have been, but it just struck me as a very feeble example of an experience with cancer. Another woman in the film, I believe her name is Jackie, was on 17 medications. I don't recall the subject having had to take ANY drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was under the impression that this documentary was uplifting. It was too depressing.

In general they are well laid out, easy to read and understand, and comprehensive. While the best book on Illinois Workers' Compensation law is definitelyHow To Win A Worker's Compensation Claim In Illinois, this book is the best guide for California workers who have been injured and need advice.

Apparently, i didnt get a decent one either. The trap will not catch anything!I can barely get it to catch my own arm when i put my hand in and push the release pad myself -- much less a 6 oz squirrel. All it has done is provide a place for the critters to steal my bait and laugh at me. I have tried to adjust the release rods and catches to get it to work, and made it some what better, but still doesnt even come close to the reliability of my parents made in the USA Hav-a-Hart traps.Spend the extra dollars and get one that will work.

Well, after giving it a try- I love it and can totally tell the difference in taste. Like everyone else said- the magic is in the coffee filters and there is no more bitterness to your coffee!

When using the squares it seems as though an airlock occurs and the water ceases dripping. You do need a lot of time and patience. The coffee is not bitter. The package box does not have any padding in it and the one that Amazon uses is just a little bigger than it, so the first one arrived broken and the second is good.

The coffee is 100 percent better tasting ( I do splurge in the real Chemex filters) and even though my last coffee maker was a Keurig a friend gave me, this coffee tastes better and I can shop around for different coffees to try. I boil water while I grind beans, then I pour a bit over the coffee to let it bloom, then finish with more hot water. I am not very fond of hot hot coffee so the fact it cools is actually a plus for me. I usually let the filter sit on top, lifting it a bit while I pour my first cup, and then the filter plugsnthentop keeping the coffee warm for some time. I love it and won't go back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as good as it looks","review":"This device is lovely but its functional design does not come up to the standards of it's physical design. Long touted as the ultimate coffee maker, we decided to give it a try. It makes and incredibly clear cup of coffee. That's it strength. It's weaknesses are: The filter cone will not hold all the water neccessar to make the max capcaity of coffee the carafe is designed for; the paper filter will adhere to the glass cone and create a vaccumm that does not permit the liquid to flow through the filter thus making the brewing time in consistent; the filter will burp and splash coffee out of the cone making a mess; the coffee cools off dramatically in the coffee making process.'It is nice to compare coffee brewed in a automatic drip and this device.

According to [...], Tom Moulton's remixed versions appeared one year later, released in the States on the Salsoul Records Label. (That's the version offered here.) I prefer the unadulterated, original versions, but that's my opinion -- considering the song itself was a rush-release cover of the original by a group called Space -- curiously, all versions are available at Apple's online store (except the original 12\\" by Magic Fly -- the single version is included, though)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot.

Alphonzo is the main character who is raised by his God-fearing grandmother but easily influenced by his friends and what is going on in his community. It took some time, but Zo realizes that Big Momma (his grandmother) is not trying to tell him how to live his life, she's only his guide in life. This is a poignant tale and a true to life story of what goes on inside of many families raising boys to be men. It also shows a real side of Memphis from the rap music to famous landmarks and restaurants. CHAPTERS is a must see for everyone especially teenagers. Kudos to K-Cutta Productions!

And thanks to ATB, you'll get to spend plenty of time in both with this 2-CD product.I'm giving this a 1 simply because I think 1, not 2, is what ATB needs to start thinking about.

I actually won this CD online - autographed by ATB himself - and not even that was enough for me to keep it. Mediocre dance and chillout tunes is what this album is all about.

Please realize, I said \\"for me.\\" The author writes this quasi-poetry, and the words are so specific to her situation that they just take me right out of being able to connect. Although I feel a kindred spirit in her pain, I do not feel any relationship to her specific relationship with her husband. I think there are several books out there that could benefit others far more than this one. Personally, I felt like I wasted my money, and I don't know about other widows out there, but money wasted is not something I take lightly these days..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for the widowed","review":"This little book is a treasure trove. A quick read, too. It will touch the heart and soul of those who are grieving and make you realized you are not alone in your thoughts and feelings. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge help","review":"I found this book very helpful after loosing my husband. We were both young and his death came suddenly and by surprise. This book helped me put my feelings into words. All the things I was thinking and feeling about my loss were laid out in the pages of the book. It is a great book to help you through your mourning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at beginner's or intermediate dance dvd","review":"I have been dancing, pretty much my whole life and don't have two left feet by any stretch of the imagination, but this dvd is not for beginners or intermediate it is for the advanced. I have only used it once, I just got it today and am impressed that I will take some time to become an expert at it, so it will keep me challenged. I usually lose interest very quickly because I'm able to master the steps rather quickly that won't be the case here. Although, I like the dvd it did not do a good job of showing or breaking down the steps before heading straight into the routine. If you take some time to learn new dance routines, this dvd will leave you frustrated although even while only attempting to do the moves it gives you a very good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two left feet will not stop you?!","review":"This video states on the back that no dance experience is required and two left feet will not stop you ... WELL, I don't have two left feet and have been successful with dance videos on my cardio days but not this one. The moves are too complex and not called effectively enough to enable you to maintain a cardiovascular workout and follow along. I found myself subtituting jumping jacks and jump rope moves to maintain my heart rate when the choreography got too difficult. I still recommend The Firm Cardio Dance Slimdown for an easier to follow more effective workout. Don't always believe what you read on the back of those DVD sleeves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast pace, intense on the legs","review":"This is a very intense workout for the legs. There is pretty much no upper body workout in this one. It is fast pace, and at times felt like Tae Bo. There short bursts of cardio mixed in with strength training moves. The cardio bursts are shorter than the cardio segments in other Firm videos. I will be doing this video pretty often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be OK if you have a dance background, but...","review":"I really wanted a FIRM video just for cardio, but I had to continually rewind the DVD player just to try to do the moves in this workout. I could hardly get any cardio benefit because the moves were just too intricate and too fast to keep up with. I ended up jogging in place a lot. I finally took it out of the DVD player and put in Gilad's Split Routine Fat Burning workout for my cardio."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome purchase","review":"I am all about TaeBo but wanted to add something a little different to my workout program. So I bought this dvd and Cardio Overdrive (also by Alison Davis). Alison combines several dance styles that are fun and really make you work your body. The first time I tried the dvd I was so caught up in the moves that when the 45 minute workout was over I couldn't believe that much time had passed. But I was sweating and could feel I had a good workout. I'm a good dancer but some of the moves are a little confusing- don't let that discourage you. Alison instructs you to make the move your own so you don't have to do it exactly the same. Plus one of her workout assistants does the low impact version of the workout that you can follow. For me not conquering all the moves made me want to go back to the dvd to try again the next week, so it's a challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO HARD TO KEEP UP!","review":"WHEN I PURCHASED THE VIDEO I FIGURED IT WOULD BE A FUN WAY TO EXERCISE SINCE IT INCORPORATED DANCE MOVES INTO THE WORKOUT...UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS JUST TOO HARD FOR ME TO KEEP UP WITH THE MOVES...I SPENT MORE TIME TRYING TO LEARN THE MOVES THAN ACTUALLY EXERCISING."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good workout for the legs","review":"This DVD consists of isolated leg workouts (with or without light weights- no Transfirmer step needed) and cardio sessions.Each leg is equally worked out and the movements are not hard, but the cueing isnt the best so one may need to watch the movements before performing. I'm not a supporter of very fast movements (explosive perhaps) that ask the workout person to hop and perform knee movements since that is such a tender area. So use caution until you get used to the overall movement/concepts.These are unique movements/exercises that I havent seen elsewhere. I like this more for the time concentration and I feel that I get a decent workout in the 30-min than I might do on my own.Realize that this DVD is both leg exercises combined with cardio."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found myself smiling when I was working out. Super Fun!!","review":"This video is really the most fun workout ever. I absoulutely love it. It is not easy at first to get all the moves, but the fun is in learning and mastering the moves. It does take a couple of workouts to feel proficient in the moves, but even until then, you are getting a great cardio workout. Totally buy this and don't listen to the naysayers who just gave up too quickly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"I was so hoping that I would be able to pick up the dance moves and follow along with Alison and her girls. She is my favorite Firm instructor and I have always been able to follow the steps of her various Firm workouts. I could not keep up with the moves on Cardio dance fusion although I did enjoy watching and I liked the music in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be named \\"Cardio Dance Confusion\\"","review":"I have rhythm, coordination, and have been considered a pretty good dancer. So, why do I have 2 left feet with this video? Alison goes way too fast, and moves on to the next before you can get your bearing on the current. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"High intensity fun","review":"I am relatively new to the Firm, but so far this is my absolutely favorite video in the series. It did take me a few tries to get the moves down (they go by really fast the first few times), but now I can use the \\"pump up the music\\" feature (allowing the music to be louder than the instructions -- which is really nice after you learn it). While some of the moves are tricky, I personally find it so much FUN that even when I trip over my feet or am barely able to breathe (the third section involves lots of jumping), I can keep on going just because I enjoy it so much.I also really like how you can do a full 45 minute workout or choose from 3 different 25 minute workouts for those days when you have less time or are just too tired to do the whole 45 minutes.And the 10 workout results guarantee? Totally true. I've got a bit of tummy fat (understatement), but after 2 weeks of doing this, everything was noticeably less flabby. My clothes just fit so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible workout","review":"I had been doing Tracy Anderson's dance video and wanted another one to add in to the rotation. This one did not disappoint. It is challenging, but very fun. Sure, the steps may take a few times to get down, but that's what I like about it. You feel good about yourself when you figure it out and have a great time doing it! If you don't get them all in the beginning, just march in place until you can join back in. The workout is about 50 minutes of constant movement and you really work up a sweat! There is a 25 minute option as well. Recently, I've been doing this video on Tuesday and Thursday, then doing some Firm sculpting videos on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Along with a change in diet, I am definitely seeing results! If you want a fun, challenging, effective, cardio workout, get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I love to dance and this is just perfect workout! Don't really bother with doing the steps perfectly and you'll be just fine. Like Allison says, do it your way, just have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Some of the moves were hard at first, but I got a really good workout. I think there should be a little tutorial about the moves. That would make the video easier. Being that the Firm does not offer many pure cardio videos, I say this is a must have for Firm fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun new addition to the Firm videos","review":"I LOVE this workout. I am old Firm Believer and some of the newer releases have been very disappointing. Cardio Dance Fusion is very fast paced, excellently cued, and just a plain fun workout. Alison does a great job of getting you through the steps at tempo so after a playing or two, you have most of the moves down. I'm not a dancer nor am I terribly graceful, however by the third playing, I had the steps all down pretty well. At least well enough to really enjoy the dances. I have RA so I was concerned about my joints but no worries with this workout. Just plently of fun, sweat and calorie burning. I actually want to work out with this one! Don't let the express workout option fool you. They may be shorter, but you'll still have the heart rate way up there! If you're looking for an excuse to do cardio more often, this is it :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners, much too fast","review":"I am a beginner and I thought this video would be OK. I want to lose about 15 pounds. I was shocked to see that the instructor immediately jumped right into complicated footwork! No warm-up (stretching like you should to prevent injury), no breaking down the steps or going slowly! Only for very advanced dancers. Much, much too fast. Also, she wears black pants and black shoes so it is very difficult to see the way her feet are moving. White shoes would have made it much easier. I give this product ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a \\"killer\\" workout","review":"If you are VERY fit, this is a decent video for a rest-day type of workout. I am serious into fitness. I enjoy doing videos on my rest day. I read the reviews and was hoping for much more. I am writing this review in case others like me look into this video. With all due respect to other reviewers, if you are hard-core, this video is not difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dvd sucked","review":"DVD SUCKED.. didn't like it..it was too fast pace and didn't feel anything after working out. There should be an instructional section to show some of the moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this DVD","review":"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I feel like I wasted the precious 45 minutes I had set aside to really get a great workout. Most of the exercises had 8 counts total. That's barely enough to get proper form or allow a few seconds to follow the tape. I did not find it challenging. I have used other Firm tapes over the years and found this one did not measure up. I don't even recommend it for beginners because it switched too quickly to follow. I give it a thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good workout...","review":"but not one of Alison's best. The moves are a bit basic and the music is tiresome.It isn't a high calorie burner, but it does the job of keeping you fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun workout","review":"I love to do this workout. It is so much fun, even thought I am not a good dancer I can pretend I am in the privacy of my own home. The moves were a little hard to get at first, but you can modify at first if needed. After 2 times I feel I have gotten the moves down. I also work up a sweat during the workout. I also love Allison as the lead, and like everything she has done with the firm. She is my favorite instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great low impact workout","review":"I always find myself smiling when I do this workout- especially the latin section. I definately work up a sweat but, it isn't hard on my joints either.I love The Firm and I have many of their DVDs and this is one of my favorites. A great addition if you like to have cardio-only days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I'll admit that I was frustrated the first time I tried to do this workout but did work up a sweat while trying to keep up. The next day I was determined to learn this, so I just did each section over and over until I got it down, while taking breaks in between. I ended up having so much fun that I did the workout again later in the day. I now use this as a warm up almost every day doing only the fist two sections, which are club dance and salsa dance, and then move on to another firm workout. I love the music and admit this is one of my new favorite firms for the fun factor of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes for Zyxel but was disappointed - defective","review":"In reading the other reviews I took a gamble and gave this unit a try. I have used smaller 5 port gigabit Zyxel switches in the past and loved them but this unit disappointed and it was defective on day one. Out of the box the unit kept dropping connections at random on different ports. Ping test showed the connection would drop and them come back with no corrective action from me. Some users would work and others would be down and then they come back up and then others went down. Never even got to try the management features as I had to remove from network ASAP as business operations were severly affected. Replaced with a spare older Dlink unit that was in service for years and all the problems instantly went away.

The charger produces static on my FM radio when the phone is plugged it.2. The charger charges my iPhone very slowly. (Its hardly rapid.)3. The charger's iPhone plug adapter is a separate part from the charger. (The charger is 'universal'.) The adapter needs to be fiddled with to make a good connection between the charger's phone-side cable and the iPhone.

It is however usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"I'm not sure where some other reviewers are saying that they found a warning the tire will slip off. I wish I had seen that warning. I figured if I bought a wire bead tire that was the correct size and inflated it to what the tire was rated to, I would have no problems. Wrong. This tire consistently slipped off the wheel at any pressure above 60psi. I tried again and again to get it seated firmly, but even though I was pumping it to pressures below what it listed as the maximum, it came right off. I'll steer very clear of this company's products from now on, and I recommend you don't ignore this review looking for a good deal on a tire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tire","review":"I bought 2 of these tires a while back for an old 1976 official Olympic racer and I also bought new rims, I have no problem going all the way up to 90 psi but that's because it was on a new rim, even rims from the 80s I would exceed 80 psi.

The details on him are a bit simple, but work very well. He has absoloutly no trouble standing up (due to his massive feet).Grievous's action feature is a four arm lightsaber attack. Squeeze his legs, and he raises all of his arms, making him look rather intimidating. He has four lightsabers (2 green and 2 blue) that can be put in his hands seperatly, or they can be connected to make 2 double bladed sabers.He also comes with a grappling hook (why is it always a grappling hook?). I don't use it, but it seems to fire pretty well, and Grievious grips it fairly well.Overall, this is a pretty good Grievous figure thats suitible for younger kids, because this fearsome droid general is actually kind of cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll top table","review":"This is a compact table when folded up.

The battery stopped taking a full charge after about 6 months of normal use, it's not available at the Vivitar website or through any OEM battery suppliers and numerous queries to the supposed Tech Support area of Vivitar have elicited no response.

It's exasperating, sometimes.Second is the battery life: I wish that it was a little longer, and a little more consistent, but I also understand the impact of repeatedly turning the camera on and off. Regardless, I still wish that it was a little bit more constant in that regard.Aside from these two little buggers, this camera takes excellent photos, and is quite versatile.

The author lets his ship go into \\"new space\\" without suffering the \\"Gilligan's Island\\" syndrome of Voyager. However, he still retains enough links to the Federation so we are not completely starting off from scratch. The best feature of these stories are the dynamic characters, especially the new ones. While some of the crew are \\"ol' favourites\\", the new characters bring much to Star Trek, such as decisive action, as in the case of Captain Calhoun (no pathetic negotiating with terrorists), satircal wit (security officer Kebron) and most importantly sexual innunedo (Burgoyne 172). These are areas in which the \\"new Trek\\" (Voy and DS9) shows have been lacking as they wallow in their political correctness. Main beef is publisher's shady idea of breaking one book into 4.

That's more info than you need. Janeane Garofalo does an amazing job in this movie! This is the best I've ever seen her. Her performance is funny, whimsy, and dark all at the same time. She shows a vulnerubility here that I've never seen in her before and it fits her fine. The film has a mystery ending, one that leaves you wondering about the fate of one of the charachters without giving you many clues and this is one of the few imperfections in this movie.

Reading the back, I thought it was another fluff piece like the Truth About Cats and Dogs (which I liked, but good film it ain't). This one is for the thinking crowd -- Janeane's character uses big words and everything and at first apologizes for it (and then forgets to as her character develops). Although the ending is foreshadowed a bit, you can't help but feel hopeful for these main characters. Margaret Cho (as usual) is simply brilliant. Give her a scene and she wipes the floor with it. Her first scene in this move is a classic. Great writing, great acting, great directing. The lighting was too dark for me at times (hard to see the characters)and I still don't get the title of the film as it relates to the content - but this one is for people who don't want a film where everything is handed to them on a platter by a hamfisted waiter (director).

They are often mysterious in the way that the best poetry is mysterious. There are two stories, \\"Shipmates Down Under\\" and \\"In Spain, One Thousand and Three,\\" whose endings I found deeply moving in ways I still don't understand. Michael Byers writes beautifully. His sentences lightly carry a remarkable load of striking metaphors and real-life anomalies. More important, he doesn't judge his characters as most young writers do; he questions them, explores their motives and the claims they make about their lives. He gives them, and the reader, a bit of breathing room.These stories floored me. I can't wait to read the man's novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting much more after reading the raving reviews this book received.

That kept me engaged.And just often enough he steps out the history and into the environment around him, and those times are magical. He is sensitive to the world around him, and I can see, hear, smell and taste what he is experiencing in those times.This is certainly a different kind of book, to me, with its mix of history and current experience.

Who has this kind of detail for memories going back 25 years? I think there is a lot of fact here and a whole lot of made up BS, this guy is just too clever and full of himself. This is a low life con man and crook who made some money cheating the casinos, and now wants to tell his life story so somebody in Hollywood will make a movie out of it. The book reads as if it was written to be made into a movie, like was done with 'Catch Me If You Can'. Frank Abagnale was a kid when he did his crimes, he was a sympathetic character. Marcus pulls cons and delights in standing back and laughing at the victims. What kind of person does that? Not the kind Hollywood makes movies out of, apparently. He acts like he's some kind of American Hero, when he's just another crook who didn't get caught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Really, while \\"Richard Marcus\\" seems to be a very good story teller, in my opinion, this book is total b.s. The moves he talks about are incredible, and there are so many amazing coincidences throughout it, that it seems impossible that all of this happened the way he wrote it. I do have to say that I never gambled in the 70s, so, obviously many things have changed, but I find it hard to believe that his group continuously got away with the same scams over and over, and for the most part the gambling industry was none the wiser.If you want a good book on gambling, buy \\"Bringing Down the House,\\" by Ben Mezrich.

The chapters dedicated to Brown are useful and interesting because they not only make you familiar with an outstanding figure like Brown but - telling all of his long and succesful political career - they make you acquainted with all the California matters that in the long run will shape Reagan's politic view and will decice in Reagan's favour the 1966 campaign.Dallek refers lots of meaningful anecdotes and is able to make you understand the personality of all the characters involved in this story. This is a well written and excitingly told piece of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded expectations--a great read","review":"Not being a fan of the usual election campaign books, I took this up with low expectations. I just wanted to know something about Ronald Reagan's first campaign for governor. I also suspected that it would be something of a hatchet job on RR. To my pleasant surprise, Matthew Dallek has produced an engaging--even exciting--narrative that is very well balanced. Though he does tend to laud the \\"responsible liberalism\\" of Edmund \\"Pat\\" Brown, the Democratic incumbent that Reagan unseated, he also fairly portrays the new conservatism and \\"Creative Society\\" philosophy of Ronald Reagan and his supporters. I highly recommend this work as essential for understanding the beginnings of the Reagan Revolution. After this, a good read that bookends the subject is John Ehrman's 'The Eighties: America in the Age of Reagan.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Otaku's Review","review":"I cant agree with either side of the arguement on this one. There are some who say it is horrible, while others say it the the best thing they have seen in a while. As for me, i will give you my opinion. I have read the currently released volumes (1-9) and i like this series. The start of it is slow, very little story. But around the 5th volume, the story picks up. YOu get more plot twists in this one than a shojo manga (that is alot). The saveing grace is that unlike some \\"angry hero\\" types, Deshwitat (the vampire) has a reason to be that way. And haveing his girlfriend killed by his best friend is just the tip of the iceberg. I say if you have the money to spare, pick up this manga.

After reading this first volume, I can't wait to read the next volumes. The artwork is spectacular, with tons of action and humor thrown in. The storyline is somewhat confusing in the very beginning, but after you read a little more, it becomes very engrossing and interesting.

The cutting edge is dull and the paper tends to slip so there is never a clean even cut. This urks me to no avail, since have to resort to using scissors, what a waste of time. Another thing, since its a roll and not a sheet, the paper never seems to lay completely flat on the cookie sheet, resulting in aggravation on my behalf.

The subject of religion in the era between Hillel and Marcion has been of interest to me for many years. When I saw this book advertised I hoped it would give me new insights into this fascinating time. Halfway through the second chapter I could predict where the entire book was leading: to a poorly supported argument for becoming a vegetarian.So why did I give it two stars instead of one? The author did make some interesting points about Jesus' opposition to animal sacrifice. His argument that the Sadducees were threatened by Jesus' assault on their 'cash cow' were valid. However, to then attack Paul because he supported eating meat, and disguising it by rehashing some tired, overanalyzed differences between Paul and the disciples was lame.

It is far inferior in all other aspects. The range is claimed to be 30 feet. I get maybe 1 foot before static is unbearable. I might as well use the headset if I have to hold it next to my ear anyway!Also, this may be a quirk of the phone that I use (motorola v330), but when this headset is turned on, it immediately triggers the voice name function which I have to kill.

The set of 4 ear-bud-thingies I got with it are a great touch - one of them will fit everyone's ear.

My Jabra 250's battery started to fail so I purchased the Motorola HS850 as I now had the RAZR 3 phone, figuring purchasing a bluetooth headset from the phone's manufacturer would be a good thing.Well, the HS850 sound quality is awful. Everyone I spoke to using the HS850 headset indicated that they could barely hear me and that my voice sounded muffled. I tried about ten calls from three different geographic locations in Los Angeles, all places with great cell coverage, before I gave up. The HS850 just has unsatisfactory voice quality and insufficient volume for use in a car, the reason I need the headset.I purchased the latest Jabra BT 250v and it works great! In fact, it works better than my original Jabra 250. By the way, I get about ten months of life out of my Jabra before the battery no longer charges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jabra BT250V wasted money","review":"Purchased the Jabra BT250V bluetooth headset for an LG VX8300 cell phone. It's advertised as a 33 foot range, 2to3 foot is more like it. Anything more than 3 feet the audio is unusable. With cell phone on hip the distance is too much and audio is garbled. As soon as you take it out of the package and try it JoWow (Manufacturer)considers the unit used and they won't take it back for sanitation reasons, so I was told. I have not been able to get anyone from Amazon to return my e-mail or help resolve the problem either. The bottom line is the BT250V is a total piece of junk and it looks like I will take it on the chin for dealing with Amazon and JoWow. Never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"It's not necessarily always true that you get what you pay for. When it comes to the Jabra BT250v, you'd be better off buying the cheapest Plantronics, or any cheap Walmart headset. The Jabra BT250v has a horrible connection and static is a constant bother.

Forget about putting the phone in your pants pocket or on your hip (even on the same side of the body as the headset). After calling Jabra customer service and being assured that the unit should work as I was applying it, I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon. Of course, customer service isn't going to tell you that they have a mediocre design...

But I can't pickup any incoming calls. The button simply wouldn't work for that functionality. I tried it with few phones and it doesn't work. I already exchanged the jabra adapter once. Now I'm sick of exchanging it. I think jabra has bad quality control. Someone in the quality control shd be fired!

Jabra support says they have no spare parts or service and offered me a 20% discount on a new one. In other words, beware that this is a disposable product! I also have a BT-110, which uses a AAA cell that has much longer life and can be removed for recharge and/or replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe how bad it worked","review":"I'll start out by saying that I purchased this unit because I heard such great things about it, it received very high ratings, and my friend owned one and was relatively happy with it. I say that because it may just be my phone. I have a Treo 700p and it was awful with it. If the phone was six inches away from the unit, it only had a little static and a low grade hum. If I had it by my side (approximately three feet away), there was so much static that the person could no longer hear me. I have since used other Bluetooth headsets that my friends owned to see if it was my phone. They sounded fine. The one thing I do give this headset is that it fit great in my ear.

I took it back in 2 days and swaped it for a new one (thinking that one must have been defective)BUT...same deal so I took that one back as well. However, I was still thirsting for more.

It basically worked as long as there was a direct line of sight to the handset. Meaning that if I swung my arm between the Treo and the headset, I would get momentary static.The Treo 650 is very touchy with the bluetooth devices it works with, and only the Palm headset and the Sony headsets have consistent success with them.This headset would probably have been fine on another phone, but on my Treo, is was terrible.

I've had difficult hearing over-the-ear models, so Jabra's in-the-ear design was appealing to me. Even with the variety of earpieces however, I could not get the Jabra to fit me properly.

Love the vibrating feature since i often use it while driving and can't hear the phone at all.Some things to watch for: limited features, may not fit everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable for whom?","review":"I bought this based on the reviews saying how comfortable it is. The first thing you have to do it get it on your ear, which I found clumsy and irritating. I couldn't just quickly attach it to my ear. It was a pain to get on. Then, once on, the little gel earpiece, which will fall off multiple times as you try to get the thing on your ear, has to face the proper direction. Ach, it is not pleasant. Once on, the sound is really good. However, contrary to everything I've read, it was NOT comfortable, and I had to remove it after a 30 minutes or so. I wear glasses and have average sized ears. And don't get me started on the buttons.I went out and bought a Motorola 850 and it's been working just peachy. Easy on, easy off, and the sound is fine. Some people may not be turning the volume on the earpiece up _on the phone_, and hence the 'not loud enough' complaints. It doesn't feel as snug as the Jabra, but it's much more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you have gigantic ears!","review":"I wish I had never purchased this headset. Yes, the sound is good if you can manage to get it to stay on your ear. It's stupid design makes it hard for people with small ears to use at all.

I've lost tons of ear gels off of it also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recomend","review":"This is my first blue tooth ear piece and I don't like it at all.

Doesn't work if phone is not RIGHT on my body... and sometimes it starts to cause problems if it's on the opposite side of my body as the phone. Lot's of static at random times. I often end up turning it off and talking without a headset so people can hear me. I would not recommend this product. The positives are that it was inexpensive and it works sometimes.

My mistake! The static is outrageous on this thing - 60-70% of the time, even if I hold my phone 2 feet away (at which point, why even have a bluetooth?!??!) And if I turn up the volume to hear over the static, the listener gets serious feedback.This is ridiculous! I tried it with both my ATT Iphone AND my US Cellular Motorola Razor. Bad reception everytime = TERRIBLE static if I even move my arm between the phone and the headset; inaudible if I turn my head away. And yes, it IS on the same side of my body. MY GOSH - I even tried it with the phones TWO FEET AWAY from the headset - static. Very very disappointed. I had a Nokia BH900 - which I lost, so I thought I'd try this one. It's going to charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jabra BT250 v Bluetooth Revies","review":"This earpiece is probably one of the best on the market.

I would expect nothing less from them. I did discover a strange problem with one of my Sony tapes purchased about a year ago from a retail store. There is some kind of command hard-coded on the tape that repeats every few minutes and can not be erased. The command does not affect operation of the camera itself, but mutes the sound capture on my computer using Adobe Premier software and a Firewire connection to the camera. I sent that tape back to Sony as a warranty claim and am now waiting for their reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tapes brand new, but not packaged as advertised","review":"The tapes came very quickly, but rather then getting a 2-Pack as advertised, I got an envelope with two single tapes, not packaged for resale.

Time will tell...and editing if this product is worth the extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"We've been using these tapes on both a Canon HV20 and XHA1 and they are having a tendency to drop out several seconds right after we start recording and occasional drop frames later. At first we thought it was one of the cameras, or a head cleaning issue, but this is happening on two cameras, and two different models at that. We've missed some vitally important footage because of this. Though we don't have the problem on every tape, it happens frequently enough that we will not be using them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results","review":"Having just jumped back into shooting video after about 15 years, I'm finding the video quality recorded to be outstanding.

This book tells a story not only about one of the great airmen and inventors of the early days of aviation, but also the incredibly human tragedy caused by a man who lived in an impossible world of dreams and who walked out of his own life when that world collapsed around him.

I love the size, and when it works, it's perfect. However, it seems to go through the batteries quickly, and it requires two which cost $5 each at Radio Shack. It' cheaper to buy a new product than replace the batteries.Having said that, I'm buying a second because it is so convenient.

As others have mentioned, the interface is far from intuitive but I figured it out and was OK with it. The plastic casing also felt pretty cheap, but again, that was fine as long as it worked. Unfortunately, I have had it less than a year and the vibrating function already broke -- rendering the timer completely useless. I tried to take it apart to see if I might be able to fix it, but the screws are crap and I stripped one trying to get it open. I know you get what you pay for, and this is probably the cheapest timer out there, but I don't think it's even worth $12.95.

The pads contain vinegar, so when you open them and when the air comes in contact with the vigegar, the pads turn brown.

However, also on each spoon was stamped \\"18/8 stainless steel. Made in China\\" and the tag that was attached to the spoons said \\"Endurance Measuring Spoons\\" with a sticker over the tag that was printer printed and said RSVP Measuring Spoons.The spoons also have stamped ENDURANCE.Amazon was great with returns, and I'm returning them because I specifically wanted 18/10 measuring spoons and not 18/8. It would be better if Amazon changed the item description to ACCURATELY represent the product, as 18/8. As long as you don't mind them being 18/8, I would recommend them. For me, I only use 18/10 in the kitchen.Giving 2 stars because actually nice looking and durable spoons, just not represented accurately on the item description."},{"rating":"2","title":"RSVP Spice Measuring Spoons","review":"I chose these spoons for my sister's kitchen because of the stainless steel and unusual design. Now when I visit her I can measure cooking ingredients. No more guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to use","review":"Sturdy, pleasing to the eye, nest well to occupy little drawer space.Markings are acceptably readable; they don't really stand out as well as I'd prefer, but I can see the sizes without my reading glasses, and more easily than with other sets I have used.They do fit into spice jars, even the tablespoon size.An unexpected benefit results from the more vertical sides of the spoon (due to the narrow design), as compared to the rounded cup shape of most spoons. If you don't need a precise level with a flat blade, simply tapping the spoon against the side of the container will approximate a level top with greater ease than with other measuring spoons. With rounded spoons it is difficult to level by tapping, since the contents of the spoon will more easily slide up and over the rounded side. In general, measuring is easier and faster with this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was on the hunt for new measuring spoons and not finding anything that I wanted. I finally took my search online and right to Amazon and found this. They are perfect and I was so excited that my search was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy, but could be better","review":"Generally like these spoons because:1. Very durable, heavy-duty.2. Good shape for narrow jars.3. Dishwasher-safe. Have washed many times w/o any visible effect.4. Can be set down on counter when full if you need to (end of one bottle).Could be improved:1. Chain holding them together keeps separating.2. I'd prefer 1/2T to 3/4t (although you can, of course, just use 2 3/4 t.)3. These hold more than many standard measuring spoons, especially the T. This is generally OK with me because I like a heavy hand with spices, but with baking powder, not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for dry spices","review":"I have at least a dozen sets of measuring spoons. My daughters like to play with them and I wind up losing at least one out of every set and then I just buy a new set.After I bought these, I gave my daughters all the mismatched ones to keep. These are perfect. They are the only measuring spoons I've ever had that actually fit into the narrow opening of a spice jar. Yup, even the tablespoon. They're very sturdy and the little ball chain keeps them all together, even in the dishwasher. I've run them through at least 20-30 times and the chain has never come open, unlike the rings that some other sets are held together with. No more dumping out spices to properly measure them, and no more missing spoons.

I decided to splurge and spend a few more dollars on a higher quality set, and couldn't be happier. These spoons have some weight to them, but I think it'll help me in the long run to keep track of a long sliver of metal then a chunk of plastic. Their long shape is perfect for scooping right into narrow openings such as spice jars. They're a great set of spoons, let's hope I can avoid losing one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but not accurate!","review":"We have liked these narrow measuring spoons,and they do fit a need to go inside of splice jar lids. But we were recently baffled to realize that they are not anywhere close to accurate. The only one that is correct is the teaspoon measure, the others are off by 25-50%. It is a good design idea, and this should be an easy fix. I'd like to buy a pair that were actually correctly calibrated. The teaspoon police slipped up on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT 18/10 Stainless Steel!","review":"Says in very clear engraved print on the back \\"Endurance 18/8 Stainless CHINA\\".

What a rip-off!","review":"I love Scrabble! My husband and I play every week. So when we saw the Scrabble Onyx edition, looking sleek in black-and-silver, with a built-in turntable, we thought we'd treat ourselves with some gift cards we had received.What a rip-off. Shame on Scrabble for charging $50 for this dud. The turntable sticks and is ridiculously noisy. We'll end up putting the board, turntable and all, on top of the $5 plastic lazy susan we used with our classic Scrabble board. The silver paper on the board is not completely glued down, but bubbles up at the side. The timer only works sporadically: you have to tap it from time to time to get the sand flowing in the hourglass, so basically it's useless. The scorepad is probably the nicest part, and we won't even use it, because we already have a notebook dedicated for that purpose.So don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO Z's and ONE P!","review":"The board was very lightweight and felt flimsy on it's turntable.

I bought this and the deluxe turntable edition at the same time and wound up keeping this one and giving the other away as a present. The deluxe turntable edition screamed \\"cheap\\" in it's construction (despite the pricetag) and the letters weren't at all secure in their grids- overall really disappointing. However, I LOVE the look of the tiles and board on the Onyx edition, the roomy velvet pouch and the scorekeeping book.

It's pretty much the same thing with a different color scheme so it's almost insulting that they charge [so much] for this. Even though I got mine for half that I still think I paid way too much.On top of that, the quality of the board isn't that good. The silver overlay sticker was laid on slightly crooked and the base is noisy when turned and doesn't rotate smoothly. the first thing i saw when I opened it was a nick in the wood trim around the board, and overall the entire thing is much cheaper and flimsier than it's made out to be in the pictures and description.skip this and go with one of the cheaper models or spend your money on one of the deluxe wood ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Had Expected","review":"I bought this from a web site so I didn't have a chance to actually see it before I bought it.

But those collected in this book were sub-par compared to her other stories.Most of the better stories in this book are also in the much more extensive book _Louisa May Alcott Unmasked: Collected Thrillers_. The truly 'new' stories here are slower than her normal work, and they lack her trademark quality of oddness and unpredictability.Die-hard Alcott fans, this book is good. And it has stories which are *not* in the Unmasked book. For these reasons, I am purchasing it (I'm reading a library edition).But for those just venturing into this side of Alcott, don't start here. Start with one of the smaller collection books, or the Unmasked book. If you're more into the thriller novel genre, then read Alcott's _Long Fatal Love Chase_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bracelet","review":"This is a very pretty bracelet.It really catches the lights and shines like crazy.I'm not usually big on bracelets but this is one I really will wear.

The bracelet came completely tarnished and discolored. It doesn't even look silver, it's brown and rusty. The beads look a lot cheaper than what the picture shows.

It exposes incompetent, sneaky, greedy, dangerous, and downright illegal practices; It shows how things should be run for the health, safety, and well-being of mankind; how greed and power have corrupted some people and companies at the expense of innocent victims; and how Dr. Levine's integrity and outrage drove him to expose it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Ask the nurses who the good doctors are? Nurses like the doctors that are nice to them. The best doctors aren't always nice.Go to a Teaching hospital if you can? So a resident can do your procedure and round on you? I think not.Drug companies are out to rip us all off? Dr. Levine doesn't like drug companies because drugs like statins and ace inhibitors decrease his business.Asked to be transferred during your care? So a new doctor that hasn't been following you can start all over.Tell the ER doctor to call your Primary care doctor? So he can get whoever is on call for the group and knows nothing about you.

The music on this Soundtrack could work well with a visual backdrop which complements it's sporatic and sometimes irritating arrangements.

History will have to determine that one, because this recording transcends my interest, as well as (I would guess) the interests of most of all but her hardest-core fans. I was a huge fan of Debut, Post, Homogenic; liked Dancer and Vespertine; and was comfortable playing a couple of the songs on Medulla when no one else was listening. Unfortunately, I would recommend passing on this one. Björk was always weird, but interesting and fun. Now she's just weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeper Into the Abyss","review":"Listening to this, it's hard to believe that Bjork once wrote catchy, melodic, and unique pop music. Much like Medulla (2 out of 5), this album seems to be the result of Bjork tinkering with samples on her laptop. It is scattered, unfocused and pretty much unlistenable. If you miss the old Bjork (the one who wrote cool pop songs) you'd be better off getting these and giving DR9 a miss:'Supernature' by Goldfrapp (5 out of 5)'Likes...' by Dani Siciliano (4 1\\\\2 out of 5)'Ruby Blue' by Roisin Murphy (4 out of 5)'Wikked Lil' Grrrls' by Esthero (4 out of 5)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm a Bjork fan......but cannot recommend this CD to anyone.

This album sounds like the outtakes from Medulla which is better, but still nowhere near Vespertine which stands as my favorite album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the sound of Bjork trying to hard to be different","review":"In my review for Medulla I said that Bjork could record herself burping & farting and people/critics would call it genius, well guess what folks? She has basically done just that & sure enough most people are amazed. There is nothing innovative or interesting about this music, its just extremely tiring,repetitive,& boring. I havent seen this avant-garde film & maybe this score works well with it but as a stand-alone its a painful listen & this is coming from someone who listens to Merzbow. If you think this music is something new or unique you need to try listening to bands like Nurse with Wound,John Zorn,Faust,Can,Boredoms,Zeni Geva,etc. they've been doing this style of music for years & doing it right. Im just glad I burned this but I am upset that I wasted a blank disc on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutly horrible! (and I'm a big Bjork Fan)","review":"I love almost everything that Bjork does. Ive seen her get more and more eccentric over the years, but I normally enjoy what she comes up with as she evolves artisticlly. But this CD is too much. Its really, really bad. She only sings on like 3 songs- the rest are (what Im assuming) people grunting to bell chimes. I dont get what she's going for, and I dont understand why she and her record company decided to publish this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless Art","review":"I haven't seen the movie, but I'm not a big fan of pretentious high art that is entirely meaningless and expects the viewer/listener to insert their own meaning. Matthew Barney's influence on this Bjorkified waste and her previous \\"Manhattan Transfer in a mental institute\\" of an album, Medulla- has sunk her melodic ability and inventive nature into a trifling disaster.Like most avante garde music, many music snobs will unflappably rave about but, rarely will you catch them actually listening to it. Just like Medulla, this is music that most fans will force themselves to listen to and appreciate because... it's Bjork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait A Minute!!","review":"I am an avid music collector who will listen to Prince as well as Fred Frith, Madonna as well as Nina Hagen, Black Eyed Peas as well as Klaus Nomi. BUT..please do not give me this crap about not understanding avant garde music. If it looks like crap, smells like crap, sounds like crap - well, it probably is. Or at least do not call this a masterpiece!!! Vespertine is Bjork last true recording, in my opinion. Full of raw energy and brilliant imagery. But this? I don't think so. I need a visual when listening to this. Not good!! I believe if Bjork wants people to lay down cash for her work, she should do a little of both sides of herself. Like Coltrane, some music is for insiders only, which leave alot of us out..and we're not ALL trendoids!!I'll pass, thank you very much & I am not ashamed to say so!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She needs R.Kelly to get Her in Tune","review":"Bjork is One of the Most Overrated Acts that I have ever Heard.this Album reflects Her shortcomings.Boring Music&She Still sounds like a alley Cat Being hit over the Head with a Broom.when Bjork learns about Pitch&Tone she should Call R.Kelly up for some Music Lessons.Vocally she still is Straining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of all","review":"I am NOT a fan of that lady nor a fan of the other fellow. In my opinion, the film itself was boring and long. It tried to be original by being confussing, but that's nothing new; this type of ideas had already been drafted in the 1980's (also, the film borrowed many technical strategies from the great Standley Kubric and from other directors). Towards the beginning of the forth quarter of the movie some people in the movie theater started to leave the scene (I stayed because I like to suffer). In regard to the music, as I said, I am not a fan of that lady, but I tried to listen to the music in the film, looking for something original and genuine, only to find that she only recycles other stars' new age ideas. The downside is that there are many people out there that belive that this lady is an artist, when they could find true artists by just taking a walk around Central Park, in the subway, etc. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Specs Review","review":"Product specs are difficult to understand, I have ordered twice, first order was 3inches wide, 2nd order was only 2 inches wide.

The old board was kept on the counter top next to the sink and was used only on one side. The other side had rubber feet that kept the board off the counter, kept it from sliding and circulated air under the board. After leaving the new board on the counter for a couple of weeks, it warped and became moldy. So if your looking for a board to store in the cupbord,and clean and dry after every use, it's OK. Otherwise save your pennies and buy something with a little more heft.

After a few months, the finish was coming off, they looked terrible and they felt like sandpaper and soon after, they began to split and fall apart. My experience with cutting boards is they should last years not months.So yes, they don't cost much, which is why I did not give a one star rating, and maybe they just have uneven quality control, because a lot of the reviews are positive, but I think most people will be happier with a higher quality purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I enjoyed using the cuttingboards.

Instead I was afraid of cutting the board in half. Anyway... that's my review, I do not like it and I'm stuck with it.

This sometimes happens to wood that was not dried properly prior to cutting. Not a big deal as I can glue it. But the real disappointment was the quality of the finish. The boards are very rough finish, and lots of loose splinters hanging on from machining. The boards do not appear to have been fine sanded and have sharp corners with chipping. They are also dry as a bone and do not appear to have been oiled at all.Last week I found these same boards for sale in a major food store, and 5 of the 7 I looked at had cracks in the large board.Haven't used the boards yet as I'm not sure if I will keep them.

I needed to replace an old cutting board that had cupped badly and was developing some mold after many years of use. These are a bit thinner but so far they get the job done and the price was very right. I inspected them for potential weak spots and didn't see any. The was a small knot on the \\"meat\\" side near the edge of the largest that might collect debris, but since I used the ungrooved side by preference it wasn't an issue (and it wasn't in the cutting area in any case).

I checked and cleaned all hookups and it's something internal. When the channel cuts out you can tap the receiver with your finger and it comes back on for a period. Annoying!

It was a great receiver when I first got it. Just like a brand new car, it sounded great and looked great. Recently my front left and right speakers have been cutting out randomly, I thought it was my speaker wire or my audio connection so I had all that replaced with brand new ones. To my dismay, my sound was still being cut out at random times. The only way to fix this was to turn off and turn back on the receiver or crank the volume up and back down again. This is really unacceptable as my 10 year old Sony receiver has never once broken down on me. I would stay away from this AVR if I were you, if you own this and don't have any problems lucky you.

This is the last time I will buy any Pioneer product. This is the third Pioneer purchase I have made and their were all new! They all have FAILED within 2-3 years.

I was going insane trying to fix my setup. Checked all my connections, all my other devices, etc... It just turns out that the receiver is junk. Hate to toss it, but guess I will. Lasted about 3 years, which is pretty bad if you ask me. Seeing as I never used it in anything other than a 2 speaker configuration, I am probably going to buy the onkyo tx-8255 for $170.Update: After playing around with the settings on this receiver, I found the 7-speaker stereo mode. It appears to make it so that all the surround sound speakers act just like the front L and R. So if you are NOT using all of the speakers (I only have a 2 speaker set up) then you can move your speakers over to the surround sound speaker connectors. You may have to play with the settings a bit, but it seems to work for me. Looks like I won't have to buy a new receiver quite yet. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as they say..","review":"I bought the reciver as part of Black Friday Sale from Best Buy. I bought high quality Polk speakers to go with it but the problem I see is that the reciever volume needs to be set very high to hear anything from TV.

Be careful not to let the edge of the screen protector touch the sides of this. If it does, you will have a bubble you can't get rid of because the protector is slightly raised when up against it. I used this on two phones, and the second one came out better. Also, be sure there's no lint on the screen or dust floating around in the air when you put it on.

I am happy to have smaller boards right at hand (they are very easy to store) when I don't want or need to pull out my two foot or larger boards. They have a nice texture to them, which helps prevent slipping on the counter and helps to hold the items I am cutting. Easily wash up by hand, or even better, wash in the dishwasher. They do show cut marks when I use my sharpest or heaviest knives, but with a good washing, food is not trapped in the cuts.

However, in the set I received, the largest board was substantially defective: the color is irregular in places, and the thickness in inconsistent. The board is thicker near the edges than it is in the middle, which is a serious flaw since the knife needs to contact the board throughout the cut.I've owned several cutting boards, and never had one with a defect. It's an extremely simple product, and almost all types are flawless. To receive one with two separate, easily noticeable flaws is very disappointing. I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but poor quality...","review":"I agree with some earlier reviews: These boards have uneven thicknesses, and the cutting surface is not flat. This means the boards can wobble on the countertop. Farberware may be inexpensive, but it's no bargain. Spend the extra dollars on a KitchenAid cutting board, which is thick, perfectly flat, and has non-skid rubber grips. If you're on a budget, Ikea cutting boards are even cheaper than Farberware but still better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save Your Expensive Knives!

On trying to find a favorite passage (Darwin's revulsion at a parasitic wasp in Brazil and the inconsistency of such cruelty with any providential design of nature by a good God), I noticed that it was not there. I do not know what else is missing. I find it infuriating that this was not adequately noted on the cover of the book.

My 8-year-old son loved the book at first. It was gross and wacky enough to keep him interested for a while...When he got to the point about smoking, throwing the dog across the park and eating the pet fish, he started to wonder.In the end, he didn't finish it - not because of what I thought about it but because he felt (at 8!) that it wasn't appropriate.If you think South Park, Beavis & Butthead and the likes are appropriate for children, you probably won't have a problem with your child reading this book. You might even give it 5 stars.As far as I'm concerned, I feel there are better ways to get a child interested in reading.

It tells the story of the journey of searching and how the endeavor itself is never in vain. The beautiful interpretation of faith's seeking its own justification is simplified for those in question and makes even simpler, the purported complicated endeavor-making sense of finally, finding 'your answer' to it all. This is a library 'keeper'. A classic, not unlike 'The Alchemist'... yet less vague in the presenting of an important ideal for these times when doubt seems to be the catylist. This will infuse in the heart and mind of the viewer, the faith and energy to keep going, daily, no matter what your goal. This is time 'wisely spent' to rekindle hope and diffuse illusive answers.

There aren't enough good things you could say about it. The acting was inspiring, and the message beautiful.

Play it softly for background energy support while you meditate, do housework, or blast it for bellydancing or an energetic tribal stomp.

It just seems that Mattel may have this guy confused with spider-man's enemy \\"the Lizard\\". The Lizard is a mutant freak of science.

Expanding spiritual awareness is a blessing for individuals and communities alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Book","review":"This is a truly terrible book. The author seems to be trying to capitalize on his good name and seeking a wider audience for his spiritual messages by encapsulating them in the form of a novel. There is nothing wrong with the spiritual messages the author attempts to communicate in this book. There is very much wrong with the execution. The plot is muddled, the writing is disjointed, and the ending is disappointing to say the least.I would suggest that people wanting to hear Mr. Chopra's message get it from one of his more scholarly books rather than from this very poor popularization.This is one of the very few books I have ever read that I have thrown immediately into the trash after finishing it rather than putting it back on my shelf or passing it on to someone else.Save your money and pass this one up.Joe Leben"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a novel, not like his other books","review":"And I positively disliked it! It is a poorly written 'action' novel interrupted at 4 or 5 places by one page 'voice of the angel' sections which are the only parts that remotely resemble Deepak's previous writings. I magine that the 'novel' part was written by his co-author. I was repelled by this book, and ended up returning it to Amazon. Normally I am a big fan of his and own most of his previous books.Is this a new direction for Deepak? Is he trying to reach people who read junk novels? Or the 'angel' people? If so this is NOT good enough. Deepak, please stick to what you do best.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Chopra's other work","review":"If you want a glimpse into the insights of this gifted thinker and writer, this book isn't the place to begin. Like Chopra's previous fiction works, the effort to find the message is tedious. His scholarly works are more direct and much more rewarding. Try Chopra's \\"The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success\\", \\"The Way of the Wizard\\" or \\"Everyday Immortality\\" for new and exciting ways of looking at yourself and your place in the universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual sci-fi novel","review":"This is not like the Deepak Chopra books I'm used to. I knew it was fiction, so that wasn't a problem. It was quite a confusing book though, and it is most definitely not a book you can pick up and put down and read the next day with any continuity. There is a lot of time hopping and altered reality and, hence, can be very confusing. However, when I picked it up and read it non-stop, it did have some sense of continuity to it and I enjoyed it after all.Though deeply spiritual, it would be better listed as a science fiction story. If you expect it to be a sort of spiritual science fiction, then you will read and enjoy it far better. In the final analysis, I enjoyed it enough to borrow a copy of another book in this series - the Lords of Light - from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Drama","review":"Remembering that divine beings are available for counsel and comfort makes a profound awakening possible for the readers of this book.

The only thing I have found that is a minor issue is that some of the references do not match up. An example would be on page 32 table 3.3b references for what page to find the exercises on do not all match up. Sumo deadlift is not on page 178 but on page 180.

I would have liked a little more information on the founders of H-D; more detail on how they shaped the company policies and what had become of them.

Usually I love cheesy jokes; but the entire book is written like a script with the characters being over exaggerated and to put it frankly, lame. There are so many bad jokes that I couldn't pay attention. The practice tests they included were ridiculous! After I took the test I compared the questions and the real questions were much more complex and difficult!

Example: In one story the validity of a story of gold is shot down when an orange X is painted on the left bank of the river instead of the (geographically correct) right bank of the river. The mysteries relying on clues in the story as extremely easy, but very entertaining. Expect hours of brain-teasing when you read this book.

Great service, bad product. The screwdriver is so big and bulky that it's not really practical for working inside a computer case. The big heavy handle and bit coupling get in the way and it's hard to see small parts around it. The tweezers and chip puller are all metal, thus prone to ESD that can harm sensitive computer electronics. Would have been better to have anti-static plastic handles like most kits do. The groundiing bracelet must be the cheapest one made. The snap unsnaps with the slightest movement, breaking the ground connection. I wish I had chosen a kit that was maybe a bit more expensive, but at least usable.

In the new one, Laurie is blasted with high intensity lights, so much so that her face appears overexposed and white and her eyes a little too dramatic (guess that's the style today though). Musically I prefer the first one too.This DVD also suffers from interludes with the Nick Jr. moose where he does silly things to hype the crowd.

The first one I thought maybe my daughter had sctrached it, the second one I thought again, we had damaged it, but this time I put it in the player directly from the newly unwrapped box.... it doesnt work properly. It skips in the same places the previous ones did. Do I just have terrible luck or is there something wrong with the production of these dvds? I'm so disapointed.

Once its established if you have reached it, or if you are on your way, she moves on to how this can happen, and how much you are empowered to change this. Tips and ideas are given on how to reduce stress and how to help change or tailor your job in a direction that you have the most power.

Broken Lizard surely embraces these topics, but there is more to their work than just cheap jokes. it's different to see them do stand up, enjoyable to see them individually. and it's very strong and funny when they share the stage in storytelling or sketches. makes me wish i could have seen a live show.personally, while i laughed at their stage work, my favorite parts of this dvd are in the special features. seeing the mini-documentary of them on the road and backstage was a real treat. the chemistry and camaraderie is fun to watch. i hope they one day make a full-length documentary like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I thought it was good.

It had very little useful information, and NO information that cannot be found easily on-line or on Ebay itself. It was a waste of my time reading it. It was utterly repetitive and took forever to actually get to any sort of information or advice. There is hardly enough information in this book to fill a 10 page pamphlet...let alone a 300 page book!!! I'm just happy I got it from the library and didn't end up wasting my money as well as my time.I wish there was actually a book out there to help people who are not complete ebay beginners.

It has no index! Much of the book seems to be written down as narrated by the author. This means it is very readable, but the information on each topic is scattered in several sections throughout the book. Finding a topic for the first time (or trying to recall where it was) is frustrating and time-cosuming.

When it connects -- as in the vivid anecdotes illustrating the way Stalinism corrupted the personal lives of all Hungary's inhabitants during the early 1950s -- it can be very powerful. However, I found that too much of the book was dedicated to ruminative digressions describing, in minutest detail, the inner workings of the protagonist's mind. At first, these were interesting, but after a while they became tiresome. A Book of Memories has its significant rewards, but they require a big chunk of reading time to wade through the chaff. For me, it was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and not very rewarding read.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, which was hailed as being like Proust, like Mann, Joyce, etc. I didn't find the depth of any of these authors in this novel; it was confusing and difficult to read. Maybe this is because I don't understand enough about the last three decades behind the Iron Curtain. But the book did not illumine them! To me, it just seemed to go endless and boringly into the characters' sexual pecularities. This sounds as if the book would at least be sexy, but it was not. There was a lot of material that I felt could have been interesting -- the whole plot line about one narrator and his father, who was involved in the repressive regime, for instance. But the way it was presented, I just grew more and more confused and bored. I much prefer other Hungarian literature I have read, such as Moricz's BE FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH and anything by Kozstolanyi, but these books tend to be harder to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIVEL","review":"I cannot believe I wasted my time reading this long, overly dramatic, boring, pretentious drivel that strove much too hard to be art and ended up as good kindling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child and I have been looking for another copy of it.

If so, you may have noticed that a fairly recent upgrade of the Reader disabled your installation of the writer. Hmmm... now why would that happen?

Watching this movie a week ago made me realize that some comics shouldn't be made into movies. The cast mainly full of unknowns excepet for Lauren Holly.

In fact, the new boyfriend tells the mom that he loves the fact that she just lets the boy \\"be who he is,\\" and she snorts in response \\"the teacher thinks he has some sort of disorder.\\" In the end, the new boyfriend builds a maze for the child (the boy is obsessed with mazes), and the sense is, now everything's going to be okay. If only it were that easy in real life. \\"Just accept him as he is\\" is not a great moral for a story about a little boy with Asperger's. \\"Love him and accept him, but get him some help\\" would be a much better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderboy","review":"Abruptly, Ro finds her life uprooted when her husband moves the family to the countryside. Immediately, she is faced with a plethora of problems, from faulty cars, vermin, and other majorly minor catastrophes, not the least of which is her family life. Her son, Tod, is at the best of times, a challenge thanks to developmental problems. Her marriage is steadily going downhill, but there is nothing she can put her finger on, and Ro herself is constantly overshadowed by a sense of inadequacy. * Not until nearly the end of the book do we get a clue about why these things might be happening. However, this book suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is written in the present tense, which is a very distracting format for the reader. Second, it falls into the category of pwp- plot, what plot? The rambling style is peppered with slang that is not familiar to most American readers and often seems rather pointless. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of info","review":"...but poorly written. It's very interesting in a historical sense. For instance, Table 9 shows composite Mersenne's numbers up to n=251, most of them with question marks when a factor wasn't known to be composite or prime, and C when it was known to be composite but the factors weren't known. For instance, 2^101-1 was known to have at least 4 prime factors, but no factors were known. At the time (1964-1966), ENIAC was being used to compute such things. Yesterday, on my lowly Pentium 4, using Mathematica's built-in functions, I factored all the numbers completely in less than 45 minutes of computation time. One of them (2^251-1) took 34 minutes and 7 seconds and another took 5 minutes 10 seconds -- all the rest were very fast.

The authors have a way of being concise in their descriptions and explanations, which is nice because there's hardly any fluff to weed through as with some textbooks, but they still manage to deliver solid key information regarding pathophysiology.

Maybe Not","review":"Starting with the 1st French efforts to trade in North America, the authors argue that our self-image as peace-loving people who only fight when left no alternative, is often at odds with the facts. Second recurring theme is how military victories can produce unforeseen problems. Among the founding fathers, even those best disposed to the Indians, who wanted treaty-settlements instead of wars, assumed that they would either assimilate or move west. The War with Mexico and Spanish-American War are examples of US aggression that few would dispute. A very intriguing chapter describes Washington DC's 1930 Greco-Roman monuments as efforts to condition isolationist Americans to possibility of World War.Sound crazy? Think of the movies Shane, High Noon, and Sgt. York-- always the peace-loving hero is pushed into a [satisfying] explosion of righteous violence.

I would say that if you plan to buy a China made Sheraton that you be ready to put another $100-200 into it to make it playable. That or try to find a used Korean made one in good condition.

Being still somewhat new to classical music, I listen to associates for new ideas. Kurt Masur was recommended to me as a very good conductor and interpreter. With this in mind, when I bought this CD I hoped to be wowed. I wasn't. First let me just say boo to \\"La Valse\\". The ending just doesn't ignite like it's supposed to. Instead of the caustic ending I have grown to love I hear a bland ending without the Byronic element. Same with Bolero.

This system deletes calls on all the other handsets and the same goes for the Phone book. I tried to deregister the handset but the system will not allow you to do that even though the instruction booklet says you can. The system cannot be used in a family enviornment. Everyone can see the calls until a handset deletes a call and then the call is gone for everyone.

I spent 60 and had to wait 3 days. I WON !!Anyway this phone system is great. It does it all, and coupled with a magic jack internet telephone hookup, I've got the best home phone system that I've ever had, almost for free. 20 dollars a YEAR vs 60 dollars a month. The Panasonic phone is clear as a bell, and the signal goes through walls flawlessly. I've had it 6 weeks and it is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointed","review":"Just bought the KX-TG1034S and will take it back tomorrow. After carefully reading all reviews I thought this would be the best cordless phone to purchase. I have had a Uniden TRU phone for several years and enjoyed the clarity of voice and no interference.This new phone was a problem with the first call I've made. There is a constant background noise before the call even connected. It only got worse once I started talking. I've tried everything, moved the base all over my small home; lowered the volume (that made it better - but I couldn't hear without straining) without success. Too bad because I like the way the handset feels and the larger buttons are great. Wished it would have worked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Short Range","review":"The good reviews outweighing the bad, we thought this ideal for us. Being of senior years \\"bells and whistles are not what we need\\", but the idea of having four separate phones on one jack was appealing. The two placed upstairs worked well but the two downstairs were useless. Much interference and then the call was dropped. The long range boast is, for us at least, totally incorrect. Very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"I'm not just going to throw these phones away, I'm going to give myself the satisfaction of smashing them to pieces before I do. This thing drops calls left and right, even if I'm standing next to the base. At any given time I can pick one of these units and it's not getting a signal. Don't buy this under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed with this telephone system. The reception is not very good and fades in and out while in use. The range is no where near what the product description claims. The menu for reviewing caller ID or retrieving messages is not intuitive. When you call the answering machine remotely to retrieve calls, the first option it gives you is to review all messages instead of just reviewing the new messages. You need to click through a few menues to get to just the new messages.I replaced an older Panasonic cordless phone system with the new system and I regret that I did it. I would not recommend this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice for home cordless phones","review":"Like many of us, I recently chose to get my telephone service as part of a cable,internet,phone package. It was an additional charge to hook up to the existing home telephone wiring so I decided on the Pana Kx-TG1034S. I disabled the answering machine since I have voice mail (very easy to do) hook the base unit to the cable modem and - the phones work perfectly. No additional setttings needed - all handsets are pre-programmed to work together. Really easy to transfer calls between units - and excellent voice quality. The displays are easy to read and battery life seems great. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had one phone out of 4 that just wouldn't work","review":"I bought these phones because my brother had the same ones and loved them. They seemed to work fine for a few days, then one of the handsets just died. Customer service for Panasonic is pretty awful, and emails take 4 days to get a response. After doing much troubleshooting, I was told I would have to return the unit to Panasonic and they would send me a refurbished one. This phone is only 10 days old...why would I return it for a reburished one. Customer service phone was no better, and finally I hung up. Too bad because these phones seemed to work great, except that the volume doesn't go too high, and also it was impossible to change the ringer tone, even though it was supposed to be changeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic phones are great","review":"These phones are great and meet all expectations. I use the phones in a voice over IP network and I have good voice quality and there are no problems. I do wish that Panasonic had published the recharging power demand that each phone requires. All 4 phones are on charge and I am concerned about the phantom load this represents. I will have to measure it my self in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of features but still learning","review":"Purchased this for a Xmas gift for relative. They love the set and no longer have any interference with their computer network. No more cross-over talking, etc. The features are numerous however and they have not been able to conquer all the programming available. One drawback, unless we can find out how to change it, is the ans. message plays on all the phones, along with the message being left by the caller. I guess this is so you can monitor the call, but don't know how to turn it off yet. If this can be changed then I'd change it to a 5 star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless phones","review":"Good set of phones w/ answering system.Great range and clarity through out the house, detached garage, & outside property."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good!!","review":"I have had the product only for 2 weeks, I love the sound quality.

Overall the phone is decent- but because of the short range it is the worst phone I have ever had!! The phone will just shut off and start beeping during a call indicating that you are too far away from the base. This even happens when I am in the same room as the base. If being cut off in the middle of a conversation is OK with you for no apparent reason- then this is the phone you should have!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UNHAPPY","review":"Like several others, I Have Vonage & bought this because I needed the additional handsets. The range is short causing the handsets to drop calls or not even ring SOMETIMES. It's not consistent in terms of in (or out of) range. I've had this system for 2 months and originally got good performance using the speakerphones. Now 80% of the time, I have to take the call off speaker because the person on the other end hears very digitized sounds and cannot make out my words. I'll contact Panasonic to see what they can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short range and call cut offs","review":"I was very excited to try this 6.0 phone. I have an old house with thick walls and wireless set up throughout so the fact that this phone ran on a different frequency was a plus. I was disappointed to find that the range was not as good as my 5.8 set and even worse was that in the middle of a phone call the hand set would start beeping and suddenly disconnect - despite a quick sprint to the kitchen where the base was located. Granted this never happened in the kitchen itself but did happen as close as the living room 20 feet away. Kinda of eliminates the versatility of having a cordless phone. I returned it after 29 days and am back to my 5.8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic KX-TG1034S Dect 6.0 Cordless Telephone","review":"Product was easy to set up & get functioning.

Range is still less than desired, the only significant drawback in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I purchased this phone to replace an older Panasonic phone system that was wearing out and I am very sorry to say it is not worth buying, in fact I am going to cut my losses, throw it away and try another product. The range is terrible, I have several of the handsets around my home and one is in direct open line of vision from the base and won't receive a signal. The only way any of the handsets will work is to pick up when the phone rings and get as close to the base as you can to get a signal. Forget about trying to go outside with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal, good phones...","review":"With kids and a dog we've gone through a number of of these multiple handset phones over the years. This model looks very similar to the prior model, a little taller and different battery terminal so they're not compatible. It comes very compact box for all that's inside. We don't use the answering machine part so i can't comment on that. Entering the phonebook numbers was pretty easy. Copy the numbers into the other handsets was only a matter of a couple keystrokes so that was a big timesaver. Battery life seems fine so far. Range seems similar to the older line. Very happy with it overall so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic KX-TGA101S Telephone","review":"This Telephone fits our inter-net phone system perfectly with it's base phone and three extensions in other rooms.

The new Panasonic plugged in and started right up very easily. Trouble-free! I don't know how they could make it any easier to set up!

The battery life is indeed outstanding, but the range is perhaps only very slightly better than my 5.8 GHz uniden. I find the uniden design much more pleasant too, easier to figure out how to operate the phone - much more intuitive.All in all, I would say that if battery life is a huge priority for you, go for this.

This phone works particularly good with VoIP technology. Some how it knows when I have a message on my VoIP system even though I have disabled the answering machine.The range is great and sound quality is the best I've ever experienced on a cordless phone.My only complaint is that scrolling through and deleting the caller ID numbers is cumbersome. This is why I didn't give it 5 stars. My old Panasonic phone was a breeze to read and delete.

I would have given no stars, but the rating system does not allow for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple, Easy, Reliable Panasonic Cordless-Good Value","review":"If you seek a very nice, simple to set up, easy to purchase and most of all very reliable cordless phone I can strongly recommend this one. It has more than enough features for 95% of everyone needing a cordless phone. Having four seperate headsets is very important for someone like me who is getting older. I have one in the bedroom, basement, kitchen and living room. The battery lasts seemingly forever; the reception is crystal clear and strong, and it has a classy design. The DECT format is brilliant and is better than any other cordless phone I have owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappearing sound","review":"I selected this phone because I needed a 4 unit telephone system and it had good reviews.From the moment I started using it, after a few minutes into a call, my voice would disappear from the earpiece. The person on the other end could hear me well, but I could not hear myself, which caused me to raise my voice.I returned it for an exchange hoping that it was a fluke with the set I recieved. I was wrong. I am returning the second set and going to Costco or Target for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic has never disappointed me","review":"The sound clarity is excellent.

They require only one connection at the base station; the rest can be spread around the house. However, not too far. One room in our house cannot get consistent signal, but that is not a major hurdle.Please note the quality control on the phones is not good; one phone didn't work and had to be replaced.

It works, but I have to press three keys...b) I wish the volume could go a little louder. I'm not hearing impaired at all, but the volume of the call is lower than I would like.

Now I am really disgusted. Immediately, two of the four handsets had sound problems to callers on the other end, who said I sounded like I was in a barrel or under-water. I put one in the garage and couldn't walk out the door without losing the call. The finish on the buttons started wearing off in two weeks; now all handsets look like junk. I can't hear callers using the one in my basement; I have to go upstairs to get a different handset. I wanted to use the answering machine but can't because it competes with the voice mail system. I wanted a system that gives me a visual signal when I come home that someone called. I couldn't make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Range","review":"I was very excited to get this phone when I switched to VOIP (Vonage). Since VOIP only gives you one jack, I wanted a phone with long range that wouldn't interfere with my wireless network. I've had this phone for three months and am very disappointed. The phone works great within 50' of the base, but has big problems beyond that. I installed the base in my home office, but had no reception in my BR at the other end of the house. My house is a 2000 square feet ranch with the kitchen in the middle. I ran a phone wire from my VOIP modem to my kitchen to have the base in a central location. Even from here I cannot get good reception in my BR which is now only 52 feet away. There are two rooms in between, one bedroom and one bathroom. I made sure that no appliances are obstructing the signal. I wish the base had an external antenna to extend the range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cordless phone on the Market","review":"Panasonic did their research and finally made a phone that works great and is made for the everyday consumer.No tiny buttons. Great sound and easy to use. I suspect this cordless will be the largest selling phone on the market shortly. I got this phone one day after it came out and it was so good, I bought 2 more extention phones directly from Pansonic, Amazon didn't have them yet. The price for this phone is also the best for all the features.Forget the other brands, I tried Uniden and GE and returned them both for various reasons. The GE 6.0 had a very poor ring sound and a button that turned the phone off was next to your cheek, which turned off the phone all the time.

Whoever picks up the phone first, great, the second person that picks up another phone, after about 1 - 2 minutes, the second phone just starts beeping and you can no longer hear any conversation. Then you have to turn the phone off, and back on again, and you can talk for another minute or two, then more constant beeping. Turn it off again. The batteries are good, fully charged, and the base, is about 20 feet away, no further than the other phone that's in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear sound and reliable performance, although not \\"sexy\\" looking","review":"I originally purchased a set of V-tech phones that oozed hi-tech and sexy, with color image display and a futuristic shape. I returned after realizing that for all their sex appeal, the base couldn't be wall-mounted. After looking at the positive reviews and confirmation that this unit is, indeed, wall-mountable, I jumped in. Know in advance - it's not a flashy phone. The display is black and white and very basic and the keys are, well, boring. But I've grown to love it as a reliable, well-perfoming phone. I really don't have anything bad to say about it.

The buttons are roomy and distinct. The menu structure is reasonably clear and concise, and the functions execute well. For simple family use around a 3,500sf house , it works just fine.

No real marketing challenge is as simple as presented here, unless one's marketing job begin and ends with powerpoint slides. Be careful about taking the material too seriosuly.What is amusing, though, the \\"Amazon plan\\" the authors hatched. Hacked 5-start reviews were supposed to generate demand. Ah, but the negative reviews weren't part of that plan so one of the authors even wrote an op-ed rebutal, disallowing negative comments.Therein may be the most profound marketing lesson.

Example: the \\"drag race\\" tells how Microsoft sold word processing software in the 80s. Are you working for Microsoft and need advice? Do you think the market might have changed since then? Duuhhh.Second, it is painfully obvious the authors salted the board here with positive reviews. I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote them under pen names. One of the authors posted a whine about being outed on these phony reviews, probably embarassed.Third, if you are an entrepreneur seeking venture funding and pitch to the fund where these author's work, skim this book to preview the \\"expertise\\" they will be offering.

Sadly, none are true.

I think the former is the case. Successful marketing is very difficutl and Microsoft is a poor incumbator for good marketing.I also found the book hard to read.

As a historial insight book, a what happened book, I'd give it five stars even. But the five plays idea was invented for the book, hardly the guiding model that made them and Microsoft successful and that now will be useful for everybody. Most annoying, the idea that Microsoft could teach anybody about marketing is ridiculous. They don't even have customer service. You can not call them when their products don't work.

Same old bits, only Acrobat was updated...Along comes CS3, full Universal for all Intel ac users...If you didn't buy this CS2.3 upgrade, you pay $150 extra to get CS3. Well, ok...Problem is that I own Studio 8 and CS2 Premium. BIG BIG B-I-G MONEY purchases... And I have to pay $150.00 MORe because I wasn't suckered by CS2.3?Don't get me wrong, Dreamweaver is great (better as 8 then MX) and the rest of the software is great too... I just feel like I'd like some notice that I spent so damn much money and feel shafted...Don't previous Macromedia owners rate something???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Tomlin's Early Years","review":"It's delightful to hear how Chris Tomlin started out and how he has matured in his music.

The main kid is Andy and it is about his life and all the things that were bad about it. This book is so funny that they give it a rating- G for GOOFBALL.It even his its own test to see if you will like it and ever time no matter what your score is, it tell you that \\"you will love this book.\\" The best story is Bursting. Andy is in a supermarket and can not find a bathroom at all.This is a good book and I think that you will like this book because all the stories are so fun. The other story I like is one of the best in this book Andy is in a baby carriage and go down a hill in a diaper and he is 12 years out.I give these book two thumbs up and a laugh.You should read all Andy Griffiths books they are so funny.By: Allen"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"This video is about 10 minutes long with no new exercises for pregnant women.

I previously used a regular trimmer and would balance precariously on a ladder to try to trim the top. This seemed like the perfect solution.Unfortunately it is not. It weighs a ton -- seriously, at least 40 pounds...so you are completely worn out by the time you are halfway through the job. Defeats the whole purpose of the system if you cannot lift it to do the job!I have returned mine -- and guess I'll have to eat half the cost (as I attempted to use it). Don't make my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a refund? Zero stars.","review":"I bought this along with the \\"Mantis E-System Electric Power Head\\". At first I was all excited to take care of business and show my overgrown hedge a thing or two. After a few sessions out there, the thing busted. I took it to a local dealer who took a week to replace a ball bearing or something, and then charged me 75 bucks. Apparently the warranty doesn't mean jack if you don't buy locally. Well, then I got another couple hours out of this thing before it broke again. All I can say is that if you have a hedge with anything more than a couple millimeters in diameter (mine is a laurel) use something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK with HP printers","review":"I bought this paper because it said it was compatible with HP inkjet printers. IT'S NOT! The black ink never dries to the paper and smears everywhere. I emailed the company about this problem and this is the response I got:\\"We believe to know the reason although we don't own a 1610 printer to prove.Your printer has dye based Vivera inks for Cyan, Magenta and Yellow and pigmented ink for Black. Our inkjet media you have is still the previous version of the Smooth Pearl Product which didn't perform well with the Vivera pigmented inks (in your case the Black). We launched this summer a new improved Smooth Pearl Paper that is now also compatible to the Vivera pigmented inks. Thus we propose that you switch to the new version IGSPP11.\\"They didn't even give me a coupon for the new paper...I doubt it even works.

After tracing it down to a bad fuse (even though visually it looked fine)we found out that most stereo shops around here quit using the AGU fuses for this very reason, they get hot and with the vibration from the car the soldering inside the fuse fails. We went to the mini ANL type holder and fuse. Despite this, the rest of the kit was complete and served its purpose just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 2 channel kit","review":"Everything you need for a two channel installation.

It really is worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bang for the buck","review":"This package comes with almost everything you'll need to get your stereo up and running. It comes with everything except enough wiring to rewire your entire car (most people don't don't this) and only one RCA cable. All the wiring is very high quality as well as the connections (battery, RCA, amp, etc) and the fuse. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the power cable is only 10 feet long and if you need to run the amp from your trunk, you'll be hard pressed to run the wiring that far without a splice (and splicing a 4 guage wire is pretty tricky stuff). Other than that, absolutely great product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"4ga wires are copper clad aluminum and have ZERO tenacity.

The power wire is sturdy, the rcas are long and well built, the remote wire is a remote wire, and the grounds were nice. My favorite part is the heat shield that comes with the kit. It helps protect your power wire in your engine bay. The connectors suck and you might as well go to autozone and get some real ones or you will regret it.

The connectors are pointless to me as there are much better quality ones out there. Makes me think that the entire kit is probably not suitable for super high-end installations, but it seems sufficient for my 2 Kenwood amps."},{"rating":"1","title":"RCA needle broken!","review":"I just wanted to give me input on this product by DB LINK. First and foremost the quality of the power cables are very nice. However, I noticed the inside needle of the blue RCA jack had completely broken off the amp. This is very sad considering this had just been installed in my vehicle yesterday and was working fine for about 15 mins. I would be glad to raise the rating on this item if the company provides a replacement RCA and also promises on developing a stronger cable for future customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"been waiting 2 months for it","review":"Never got it, been on back order for 2 months now. Could have at least offered a comparable replacement. Customer was no help. Still waiting to install my amp. thanks a lot!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit n miss","review":"I purchased this kit over other brands in hopes of getting higher quality. The quality of the wire itself is great and if that's all you're looking for then this kit fine. The accessories are lacking in quantity and quality. For example there are no screws and only one size of small and mostly useless zip ties. Also the fuse in my kit was completely shattered. The fuse ships inside the fuse holder an there was no physical signs of damage to the packaging or the fuse holder but the fuse itself was shattered and couldn't be used. I attempted to get a hold of DB Link by phone and email but got no response. Any response would've been appreciated. These fuses are less than $3 but when you can't even turn on your system after spending all day installing it, kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I will not be purchasing any DB Link products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality non-copper wire","review":"I bought this and quickly returned it without opening the box after inspecting the cabling. The RCAs an accessories were clearly junk and the main power wire was poorer conducting Aluminum or Aluminum allow material (vs pure copper wire or even CCA-Copper Clad Aluminum. Now, don't get me wrong, if the user is putting a mid-line or cheaper system together and doesn't need the superior conductivity and less heat transfer that by all means get this kit. But for someone investing close to (or above 1k) of mobile audio, this should be avoiding. The wire didn't even appear to be 'true' 4 gauge, more like 6. The difference between aluminum products over copper is about 155+ watts and a much hire risk of fire due to the excessive heat properties. For those people who really care, please buy Rockford Fosgate, JL Audio, or even Streetwires amp kits and don't go cheap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kit especially for the price.","review":"Great kit comes with everything you need to wire up your amp. I used this kit to wire up my 600 watt RMS amp and it is really working great couldnt be happier with the outcome. Really cheap in a good way I would have spent this on just the RCA cables or wires at Best Buy. I highly recomend this kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sized cables","review":"I was kinda suprised by the size of these cables for the price. Not cheap or deceptive. There was a tiny crack in my fuse holder, but it didn't affect anything. I just didn't want to tighten it down too hard and make it crack more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"Kit has everything you need including the gold connectors. I only wish they gave about a foot more length... Its plenty gage for what you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kit for the price","review":"I've installed several of these types of wire kits for sub amp installation over the years and all were pretty much the same. This kit has good quality wire and connectors, maybe a little better than another brand I've used. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that the 100A fuse holder was a little cheap made but it appears to be adequate and seems to work ok. Good product and good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything worked well, EXCEPT....","review":"Spent most of the afternoon installing this kit for an amplifier in the trunk of a Dodge Neon. Routed all the cables, connected everything, and had problems with the Right side RCA cable that came with this kit. I double and triple checked all my connections and found out that the Red (right side) cable was not giving a signal from my head unit to the amp. If I switched the colors, (hooking up red to white, and white to red), then my right side speaker would work, and not the left. Anyways, a faulty RCA cable. Had to remove the cable, go to Radio Shack and buy another long RCA cable and it worked flawlessly. I can't return this product since most of it worked, but very disappointed and hated to waste my time with this poor quality cable. Needless to say, I'm staying away from db Link garbage in the future. Buyers beware!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Wiring kit","review":"Kit was just right, wires were perfect size for the amp input's not to big and not to small. they went in just fine, with still delievering huge power. if your running around 1500 watts this deff is a great kit. came with everything i needed and was easy to hook up"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected.","review":"bought kit, has everything you need. but its cheap stuff, fuse holder stripped barely screwed tight, power cable is 4 gauge but thin copper horrible conductivity. for the price i would get something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for what you need","review":"Got this kit in order to wire up my mtx subs to my amp.

Even the 8AWG kits at Walmart are more expensive and have a lesser quality. This kit comes with all the wires you need (power, ground, remote, rca, speaker wires), plus zip ties, the 4AWG fuseable link, gold plated connectors for all the wires, and even a rubber grommet for the hole you will have to drill in your firewall. (I had to drill a 1/2 inch hole)Pros:Very thick! Not only is the wire thick, the insulation is too.Everything is long enough for my car.Extremely easy to setup.Con:Not really a big issue, but the power cable wasn't really as long as I wanted it to be, I have a Taurus and it barley can reach the trunk, maybe has at most 10 inches of slack."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time user","review":"I think an old review criticized the packaging.

That would not be me.I had a computer geek friend come in and double check the choices I made. Turns out, everything I did was fine. No problem, but I did not know that as I was going through the steps; I felt confused and worried I wasn't doing the right thing.I have been using the Zonet for 3 weeks now, and not had any problems with the computer or router.

Had to spend money on a better filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't have the power","review":"The filter works quietly but, alas, just doesn't have the power to properly filter the water. I took a water sample to local pool shop and used the proper chemicals to keep a good chlorine balance. All dirt will sink to the bottom and because the input is a good foot from the ground, there is no way the water can possibly be cleaned. My pool was in mostly shade but still had a tremendous amount of algae once the hot days of summer came and once that sets in, it's very difficult to get rid of. Ended up draining the pool and refilling twice over the summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of materials","review":"i bought the pool and it came with this pump, and it's worthless. i had to keep flushing the pump and cleaning the filter every couple of hours. also, half the time, the pump/filter didn't even work. the pool is not able to be kept clean because this thing is so crappy. do not buy this pump/filter, or the pool it comes with, it's a waste...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic waste of plastic","review":"This pump is virtually worthless. I may as well use an aquarium pump because the flow rate is so minimal.

I thoroughly drained the pump before winter storage so the pump either needs to be stored upside down in addition to draining or never freeze.

So, that means we are all having the same problem.Buy a different brand pump, BUYER BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there isn't a zero star rating for this...","review":"This filter pump came with my Easy Set pool and it is horribly underpowered. After two weeks of constant running and flushing of the filter every 3 hours AND 2 bottles of mineral remover, the water in the pool was still murky red. If there is ANY iron in your water at all, this filter pump will not be powerful enough to remove it. I don't know if it is the small size of the pump or the tiny filter inside, but it does not keep up with any size pool. This filter pump should be discontinued. I replaced it with the Intex 1000p: 1000 gal/hr pump and the filter is twice the size and after two days of running, the water is now crystal clear... Get the Intex pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"invest your money in a better pump","review":"This pump stopped working within one week after we bought the pool.

Actor turned singers never turn out well, but who knew that this guy could sing!The music has a country/rock twist and is reminiscent of early 90's classic country, Little Texas keeps coming to mind. He has a very unique voice and it comes out in the music.This is the first cd I've bought in five years and I do not regret it. It's great, if you like country you won't be dissapointed. Congratualtions to him for making the transition sucessfully!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"On John Corbett's website, they say it best \\"listen to the music first\\".This is not just another CD from an actor turned singer. Dont judge it before you take a listen! Once you do, you will no doubt love it as much as I do. The man is talented, and you can hear in his voice the passion he has for singing, and when you check him out live you can see the passion he has for performing.Although I do love all the tracks, a few that really stand out are Good To Go, Bottle of Whiskey, Revival, Wichita and Simple Man.So wether you are a fan of John Corbett the actor or not (and yes, I am), I know you will be a fan of John Corbett the singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris in the morning sings!","review":"I am not a big country fan, but I found a lot to like in this CD from John Corbett, whom I remember as Chris in the Morning on KBAR from the TV show Northern Exposure. The upbeat tempos and interesting lyrics make it you want to sing along. I especially like the sentiment in \\"Good to Go\\" which is a new twist on a phrase everyone uses today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good debut album","review":"At first, I was skeptical that John Corbett would be a talented musician. However, he doesn't let you down on his debut cd. His voice is rich and not too refined. You can feel the passion in the music and it's a very well done album. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You cant blame him but..........","review":"Well. They try to be gritty, blue jean, blue collar type countrified rock. They are less than OK. John is a good looking fellow, and might make an exciting front man if the music was anything to speak of. I saw them playing an 'Emeril Live' gig on the Food Network. Unless you live in Antarctica, chances are there are most likely dozens of bands playing and living within 10 miles of you that are ten times better. So go and support your local band. All things considered (aka TV appearance) its garbage. I mean really, if Corbett was not a semi-well regarded actor (which I think he is actually an excellent actor), they could not even have made Emeril. They can hold a tune, but so can the fifty thousand other bands that play local bars and clubs near you. Nothing special. And look at the album cover, so pretentious. Yuk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"I too am a long-time fan of John Corbett. Loved him as Chris on Northern Exposure, loved him as Aidan on Sex & the City, and as Ian in Greek Wedding. Probably because he always plays a hunky sweet guy who's not stuck on himself and reminds me of my 20 year old son Evan, who's a sweetheart too. My first reaction to the cd was...just ok, but it began to really grow on me, especially after I watched the video of \\"Good to Go\\". John you're still a hottie and you have a great voice which always makes me think of all the good hearted guys you've played on the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT JOB JOHN!!!

I love his voice, so soothing and soft and songs are original, have melody and pleasant to listen.

Every time I spot them on my parents' bookshelf, I have to pull one out and flip through the pages.The stories are charming but hardly arbitrary. Another reviewer mentioned the lessons in the books aren't \\"preachy\\", which is true. But the best part is the illustrations. They are so detailed, whimsical and beautiful. I remember wishing I could visit Angelina's world and when I revisit the pictures now, they're still just as beautiful.These are essential to any children's book library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Cute Cute","review":"That's exactly what this book is. Cute. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful, and the story is enjoyable. Angelina and Alice are both mice. One day they meet each other and become friends because they both like the same things. When other kids (mice) at school begin making fun of Angelina, Alice joins in. Angelina is left with no friends, and no partner in gym. I won't tell you what happens in the end. You'll have to find out for yourself.I recommend this book to children and adults alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a band!

For one all the videos are on here [even the uncensored ones], all of the videos on this disc are digitally remastered in 5.1 sound. I also enjoyed the interview with Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee, I think more music video collections should include a retrosepect interview or documentary on either the band or them. I really enjoy collecting DVDs, I espically enjoy collecting music video collections. I have been a Motley Crue fan for a long time and besides there music I love there videos too and I'm glad it was released on a new format and all together. I'm dissapointed that the haven't released there 1983 US festival performance, I have seen bits and pieces of there performance there and it is fantastic and it is [to me] DVD worthy.

There is simply no other way to put it. The fact that Nikki Sixx can medically die on stage, get revived and then continue to play and finish the show, that's true Rock n' Roll!!!This collection of music videos is a must have for any fan of the Crue. From their early hits, to their newer classics, really nothing is left out! Plus, the uncensored version of \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" appears here as well!!!Get this while you can, and I also recommend the \\"Carnival of Sins\\" DVD as well, to get a sense of where Motley Crue is going next!

I don't like how the disc \\"freezes\\" for a couple of seconds while loading in the 'Damn Video' section, and the Enslaved video was a big disappointment for sound and video quality. They didn't include the All In The Name Of... live video as well. But other than that it's great. I didn't experience any sound problems which I've heard others complain about. For the reasons I have listed, it didn't quite earn 5 stars though."},{"rating":"2","title":"SACD Version","review":"A few of the reviews have stated a concern about the recording balance of the orchestra. I can't speak to the CD: I have the SACD version (from England), and the sound is very immediate and well-balanced, and the orchestra and Hough play quite well together. The opening of the Second Concerto is quite dark, and the tempi in the 3d quite fast. I didn't envy the horns. An amazing recording all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I purchased this set!","review":"Were these recording supposed to be a race against time? Was Mr. Hough in a hurry to get home? Where was the beauty and romantic quality that I find in Rachmaninov's compositions? Did someone shoot a starting pistol? I recommend listening to Yefim Bronfman with Esa-Pekka Salonen (my all time favorite) and the Philharmonia. Nos. 2 and 3. I want to get 1 and 4 if available. Take a breath Mr. Hough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bum Rhapsody--I got duped!","review":"Rhapsody:I have to agree with David DeLucia: \\"From the 18th on he pretty much leads the field.\\" However, from the intro to XVII, it's rather boring music making that does not make a whole lot of musical sense and really doesn't convey the message of a rhapsody--it doesn't really convey any message other than, \\"I can play all the notes.\\"I had reservations about acquiring this cd set because it seemed odd to me that Hough would perform these works and, even worse, record them. He extended himself beyond his normal scope--he should not take on music beyond the style of Saint-Saens (exception maybe the Liebermann Concerti) where Hough has arguably few peers. I liken this to the idea of Perahia playing Rachmaninov, Arenky, Shostakovich, Medtner, Prokofiev, or to a middleclass boxer jumping up to the heavyweight division. It just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong, Hough is the Middleweight champ!!Mr. A offers solid alternatives to this set.Piano Concerto #3 review TBA"},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"I heard the Paganini Rhapsody from this album, and frankly, I was NOT impressed. From what I heard of Hough's and Litton's cooperative style in the Rhapsody, I can't imagine that the concertos would be much better, and I strongly advocate not buying this. To his credit, he hit most of the notes. It was mainly the interpretation, the misguided rubato etc. that put me off, but it put me far enough off that I would never recommend this album. Having said that, I do own Earl Wild's set, with Previn conducting, so I expect a lot when I hear these amazing works, among my all-time favorites for piano and orchestra. Regardless: it just wasn't that good, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audacious","review":"Hough offers highly individual and audacious performances here with rare moments of beauty throughout. He is not afraid to take risks; his technique is fluid, his ideas are clearly articulated throughout, and his sense of architecture and control of climaxes immaculate - always in control but with an incredible freedom. I get the sense that underneath the non-chalante stage presence that Hough exudes and the stunning virtuoso playing offered, he is a real thinker. Hough knows exactly how to \\"bring off\\" these pieces, so to speak. I've also played these concertos and as a pianist listening, I can clearly *hear* that Hough has considered the possibilities of every nuance within the larger framework of the pieces, and then on top of this, has applied a beautiful varnish to the whole thing (this being the characteristically brisk tempos, flexible rubatos etc.). Also, can I add that the Dallas Symphony Orchestra plays superbly and are in top form. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the book disappointing. The story line was just not there. The style seemed to be a rewrite of a Rick Bass story years ago but didn't come up to Bass's quality.

Poor transfer, missing scenes, disappointment. When I saw the movie on television in '73 or '74 (as a teenager) it was probably one of the most moving films I'd ever seen.

My fifteen year old VHS tape of the movie is much clearer and sharper than this DVD. In addition, I noticed a couple of scenes are missing. One is a bit of the opening that was taken from \\"Memphis Belle\\" (no great loss.) The other is the flashback scene in which the blind commando recalls the rescue mission during which he lost his sight.The movie, loosely based on two different WWII incidents, is terrific.

This entry is set along the Welsh border, and Hugh,the Earl of Chester, has a Welsh prince in his dungeon to ensure the peace.The Welsh, however, seem to be on the war path again, as a Welsh arrow kills the Earl's prize hawk, and a second arrow kills his favorite huntsman.Protagonist Ralph Delchard, a Norman lord assigned to settle land disputes on behalf of the King, arrives to sort out some alleged land-grabbing, and finds himself in the middle of a simmering border war. As usual, the supporting characters -- an assortment of clerics and noblemen -- lend the novel plenty of twists and turns.

He's a historian of the Blues, acoustic and electric and it shows. He can accurately replicate just about any historic Blues figure you can name. He's equally adept at the guitar and the harmonica and a joy to listen to.This recording is a fine sampling of what John can do. You get to hear some originals and some covers, mostly acoustic with some electric thrown in for good measure. Not a bad song in the bunch. There is definitely something for everyone on this album.I'd definitely recommend this CD as a welcome addition to any collection of Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Physics is for chumps.

The book is confusing in its style and difficult to follow when trying to learn a particular section. The books approach to physics seems to be more of a \\"feel good\\" and neither quantitative nor qualitative and lacks substance. This book simply does not take a serious nor professional approach to physics. The \\"got it\\" sections appear, for the most part, useless. They do not make any points, review any parts of the chapter nor do they provide any further enlightenment of the subject. The questions are a mixed bag. Some are vague, some ok, but most are too verbose and do not reinforce the main points. The best parts of the book are the appendices and the tables. I'm sure Dr Wolfson is more then competent, but if you're serious about physics, go with Young or Knight."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting subject that reads like a boring professor","review":"While the historical aspects of this book are interesting, the author expects you to know too much about the bible and religious philosphy and stresses signifigance without bothering to explain those aspects. It's almost as if the author is writing to impress his contemporaries and the vernacular is very onanistic. It's almost insulting. Imagine that you are in a very boring class, catching snippits of interesting info if can remain awake.

He never talked about the war. I vaguely knew he was in it but that was it. I have been searching the National Archives for information on his unit because it never seems to get mentioned anywhere. He was part of the 2nd Separate Engineering Battalion that rebuilt the main airfield, cleared a path up off the beach and collected dead bodies and body parts.

This is a well put together book and I really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Photographic Insight into Iwo Jima","review":"I have read several books on the Battle of Iwo Jima, but most texts have very few photos of this monumental event in World War II, and the same ones are often seen from book to book. This book brings many, many images to light that have been gathering dust in governmental and military archives for six decades. In the first 10 pages alone, I had only seen maybe one of the images before. This type of photographic record should be published for every major American campaign of the Second World War. Now, I just wonder how many Iwo Jima photos that were not used in the book will sit unseen for another 60 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stark, spare, haunting, beautiful","review":"Hammel's text is spare but precise, and tightly interwoven with the photographs. It is difficult to exaggerate the quality of the photographs in this volume, which is beautifully produced and bound. The large format and glossy paper do justice to the photos. The extreme resolution and fine detail of the black & white photographs are breathtaking and haunting; use of a magnifying glass reveals the faces and expressions of men wholly consumed in, and being consumed by, their fearsome tasks. This is a work of beauty and awesome respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure it's compatible with your operating system","review":"I have a lot of respect for D-Link products, but this particular one (model DSB-P36) can throw you a curve.

As it turns out, the drivers were pre-installed in XP, so all I had to do was plug the cable in, and it self-detected perfectly. I've tried lots of USB-to-legacy cables in the past that didn't work for some reason or another, but was pleasantly surprised that this one worked right out of the box - especially since the printers I use require bi-directional parallel cables, which usually don't work with other cables.As an aside, I've gone through 4 other USB-to-parallel cables from different OEM manufacturers before finding this one.

Law even sarcastically concludes the chapter by saying this dialogue is only a dream, the real God would probably respond differently.Good idea for a book, ruined by the authors distorted logic.

No 3D effects on that at all. As far as the DVD itself is concerned, it has all you need to enjoy this roller-coaster of a movie. Up front, this movie is pure dreck. Every point in the plot is worthless. Thin and silly. But, just like one of my other favorite movies 'SPEED' with our Matrix-man Keanu Reeves, this movie is flat-out fast-paced and fun. The 3D effects were completely unnecessary, but also a nice novelty. The ending went completely against the grain of the typical action flick. Putting the 'Grandfather' (Richardo Montalban) up against the 'Bad guy' ( Sylvester Stallone). This movie is seriously short. 1 hour and 12 minutes + credits. That's it. But, it's a wild ride that you will likely watch many times over.

It seams to be be parodying the matrix by having 'the guy,' it takes place in a cumputer room, one thing I found in common is the line 'there is no spoon,' the movie feels like 'there is no plot.'

Yeah, you might get a kick out of the 3-D part....ONCE!!! But it's not even worth the money to rent it.

As usual, Sylvester Stallone worked hard. For a 1- to 3- minute show time, Sylvester perhaps worked more than 9 days to get all parts of the 4 roles filmed into his portion.Again, a great show.

Alexa Vega(the other half of the Spy Kids) doesn't show up until the last half hour of the movie and Antonio Banderas and the rest of the Spy Kids cast from other movies don't show up until the last 10 minutes!

The middle part is a workout with weights but includes a good number of lunges. As I already have bone issues and knee problems, I do not want to jump nor do lunges. The final section is some stretching and balance exercises. I will not be using this DVD. I thought this would be a good sometimes-alternative to a DVD I already use consistently, \\"Skeletal Fitness\\" by Mirabai Holland.

Some of the songs have quite lengthy introductions that can have even the most devoted Beatles fan without liner notes in hand skipping forward to find out exactly what song they are listening to. I especially loved Norwegian Wood (I almost like it more than the real deal!). I have long been a fan of cello choirs, and for those who can't get enough cello this will be like a trip to heaven! If you like this CD, also try out the London Viola Sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This is a great CD that fully lived up to my expectations, and maybe even exceeded them. A lot of fun for fans of the Beatles and/or classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"I purchased this cd on the recommendation of the reviews already written. I beg to differ. I have heard better arrangements of Beatles tunes on elevators. The arrangements wavered between trite and downright maudlin. The tempos were dirge-like. The album was a complete bore.I know an 85 year old concert cellist who plays with verve, respect for the music, life, excitement and conviction, all attributes not to be found among these cellists, at least not on this album. I suppose if one wanted a cd for background music in one's restaurant this might be worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Victory For Fans of Pat Boone","review":"Remember when you were a kid and you'd find some great music, something so cool you couldn't play it enough?

I am 5 '3 125 lbs and my arms are not that big around, I don't even think these would fit my 11 yr old brother.

Besides, the old boy has been dead for 60 years and can't complain. Hell, alot of hias children are dead and his grandchildren are old. But I digress .... ERB's tale was of (then) modern humans finding a land that was prehistoric and a strange power over evolution. You have the survivors of a U-Boat attack talking over the sub and ending up in Caprona.

After putting the the Hitachi M12V in a Bench Dog 40-001 ProTop Contractor Portable Router Table(awesome, from amazon) to make raised panels, I was ready to throw the whole thing away because it took 10 minutes to change the bit, and adjustment was pain.The Router Raizer arrived a couple of days later. After 45 minutes of assembly, I am stunned at how well it works. The control is smooth and exact. The Hitachi M12V lists for $400+, amazon had it for $160. It is so powerful that I can cut at 3.5\\" raised panel in one pass, and the Router Raizer means I can adjust as needed in seconds.Get the Xtreme Xtension (not sold by Amazon, but made by Router Techologies). This makes changing bits a breeze because it stays in the router and uses an allen wrench."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent addition to a plunge router!","review":"I have to say, when I ordered the Router Raizer I thoght I was just ordering a cheap alternative to a lift. After installing and using it, I say who needs a $300 lift when you can have the same functionality for 1/3 the cost. And you can still use your router out of the table. Pair it with a Hitachi M12V, and you've got a router with lift for less than the cost of just the lift. The installation is a little involved, but the directions are superb. It took me just a little over an hour to install.One recommendation if you get the Hitachi M12V and Router Raizer for table use: get out your jigsaw and cut the template guide tabs off. If you don't, you won't be able to run over a 2\\" diameter bit.

I have about 300 cookbooks but in the past few days, especially when cooking for Thanksgiving, I've reached for The Gourmet Cookbook rather than search through all the others for something in particular. The introduction to each recipe is engaging and informative. I made the All-Occasion Yellow Cake twice in the past two days because it took a very few minutes to make and my sons went crazy for it.

Oh no - I've wasted all that money.Oh no! No I didn't waste anything except the time it took me to finally get to this cookbook. The gold/yellow type that is in the book did not phase me. I had no problems reading it. Years of searching for the best recipes paid off for the authors.

Mmm...great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I had been eagerly awaiting the publication of \\"The Gourmet Cookbook\\" edited by Ruth Reichl. I was so disappointed when I opened the book and discovered that all the recipe titles were in yellow. They are close to impossible to see. Yellow is one of the most difficult colors for the eye to read -- printers and publication staff are usually very well versed in this basic information. I wrote Houghton and Mifflin the publishers urging them to change the recipe title color on their next printing of this book. Tomorrow my copy is going back to the bookstore. I now am hoping the next printing is readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheddar-cheesey typeface the essence of stupidity","review":"Amen to all of those readers who found the yellow typeface for the recipe titles unreadable.

Whoever is responsible deserves to be dipped like a crouton into hot sulphur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected...","review":"I bought this book with big aspirations of another \\"Joy of Cooking\\" with a little upscale to it. While I must say the design of the book is fabulous (I am a graphic designer and truly love the cookbook's design), the recipes leave much to pine for. I don't like that most of the ingredients are nothing I normally keep in the house and I am not likely to use often enough to warrant purchasing them. I have yet to actually cook a meal from it for this reason and I have owned the book for over a year. I will stick to \\"Joy of Cooking\\" for it is much more of a tool in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cookbook","review":"As a professional chef, i would have to say that overall this book comes in very well represented.

When I opened it at the front desk and saw the pale yellow type for the recipes, I could not believe that any design/publishing house could do such a thing. As an artist and being in the ad business, it is totally unthinkable that the publishers would allow this to go to press.As many other reviewers have said, I am just adding to their dissatisfactions, and the size of the book does not make it easy to put on your kitchen counter to read/cook by.I have to say the lobster Newburgh with eggs and cream and NO flour is a classic, which gives it accolades!It was a truly heroic effort but missed it's mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"In what is otherwise a fine book, the choice of the pale yellow color, on white paper, for the names of the recipes, creates a very difficult page to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Their Tarte Tatin recipe calls for a total of 65+ minutes cooking time.

I've had the book for nearly 3 years, and when I want a recipe and check this cookbook, 6 times out of 7 it does not have a recipe for what I want to make. Further, when I do find and use a recipe from this book, there is inevitably something off with the recipe. I just made the \\"Snowballs\\" macaroon recipe from page 675, which promises about 30 cookies. The dough did not behave as described, the size per cookie was insufficient for the chocolate filling, and I ended up with 9 medium size cookies, not 30. They taste fine, but nothing special. The recipe for filling for the puffed apple pancakes on page 649 is cloyingly sweet, and so on.

That said, not only is the yellow typeface very annoying and hard to read, but it's full of lousy and inexcusable page turns.

This is a huge waste of my money, AND it hurts my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource","review":"This is a wonderful cookbook resource that I know I'll be turning to many times over the years. I like the fact that before I make the recipes I can always check www.epicurious.com to see what other people think of the same recipes. It's great!

Nearly unreadable","review":"A cookbook should be a joy - easy to use, legible, and a delight to browse through. Of course, the recipes should make it worth your effort.After spending 20 minutes with the Gourmet Cookbook, I'm returning it. It's not that the recipes are bad, it's that the book is too difficult for me to read easily in normal light.All the recipe titles are printed in rather pale yellow. I'm sure this is stylish but it is NOT legible, especially when I'm just browsing through the book. I've worked in publishing and design, and I simply can't imagine how this pale yellow scheme got through all the reviewers without notice.If you must have the recipes, buy this book by all means. But if you suspect that the publishers may have placed their sense of style over reading clarity, look elsewhere. For me, this in NOT a joy to browse, so I suspect that if I kept it, I'd miss many of the the fine recipes.

Now, the first big volume to appear in twenty years and no pictures! A big step backwards. It should be published in two volumes if need be to include pictures.Then there is the serious problem of the yellow recipe titles. That editing mistake is beyond comprehension.Lastly, it is hard to believe that the crab cake recipe on page 335 is the best Gourmet ever printed, it's certainly not the best I've ever made!

I often check out cookbooks from the library and it is hard to find ones that offer recipes that are consistently 5-star. After making about ten recipes and only disliking one, I went ahead and purchased this gem. It contains a little of everything, from your standard pesto to truffles to instructions on how to spatch-cock a Cornish hen. The additional instructions, explanations and history lessons are invaluable in helping out with the planning process that goes into making a meal. And to boot this book can be had for only $10.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation of wonderful recipes","review":"Yet another thought on the yellow titles... In artificial light, there's no denying they \\"disappear\\"; in natural light, there's really no problem. In any case, I chose to buy the book now, rather than wait for the subsequent edition I've heard will one day be available. I decided to simply trace the titles of recipes in pencil as I try them, making my usual brief commentary to one side regarding any changes I might have made and whether we liked the recipe or not. I have many cookbooks and have created binders full of recipes I've culled from magazines. To know which recipes I've tried and liked is a very helpful thing. This cookbook is too good not to own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Bad Typeface","review":"Ditto the other reviews about the yellow titles of the recipes--very difficult to read in normal light--and I don't have any eyesight problems. Wonder why no one picked this up before publishing. Really creates a big negative about an otherwise great, comprehensive book.

But on those occasions when I want something spectacular, why re-invent the wheel?I appreciate the clear directions in this book.

A decade in the making and more than 1,000 recipes ...thousands of hours testing and retesting...and then, one can't read the titles in the book as they are printed in yellow! Didn't the editors at Houghton Mifflin think about this OBVIOUS problem? For $40, one should be able to read a book! Perhaps Houghton Mifflin will reprint the book in another more readable color - until then, I will not purchase this probably otherwise wonderful book. I had planned on giving it as Christmas and wedding gifts - what a shame! A better choice at $35 is the Best Recipes Cookbook from the editors of Cook's Illustrated - very readable and with additional diagrams and tools to help everyone from the inexperienced cook to the professional chef. I had been anxiously waiting for the Gourmet book - only to be seriously disappointed because it is unbrowsable and unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK not to have photos but I want to see the recipes","review":"I was so looking forward to this cookbook and expected it to be one that I'd buy in quantity as holiday gifts. Unfortunately the yellow typeface color is virtually unreadable when used for its intended purpose -- following a recipe in kitchen lighting. Am sure the recipes are grand but my copy is going back to the seller to be replaced when the publisher reprints it with a different color of ink. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blind tasting","review":"Have just returned my copy of Gourmet Cookbook to the bookshhop.

I love the fact that you will find simple classics mixed with modern recipes. The recipes are in the collection because they are tried, true, and delicious. I have already made a few dishes and they have all been wonderful. I highly reccomend this book - it is an instant classic that will be an integral part of anyone's cookbook collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The go to book","review":"I have at the least 500 cookbooks and this is the cookbook I use the mostit is easy to understand, it has a good variety of receipes and you don't have to go to a gourmet food store for the ingredients, for the most part you probably have the ingredients in your pantry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who was the graphic artist for this?","review":"Yellow headlines? Please. Any graphic artist with even a minimal amount of training knows to stay away from small-size, bright yellow text. The recipe headings can't be read easily in any light, which makes this a difficult book to browse.As for the recipes, I haven't cooked from the book yet but it looks pretty comprehensive.I am going to sell my copy and wait until the publishing house comes to its senses and releases a copy that is actually readable. The designer probably thought the yellow text was edgy and creative, but it's not. It's not functional, and it's a serious detraction from a great cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ilegible yellow recipe captions; recipes complicated","review":"Someone who is passionate about yellow, but did not care if the essential recipe captioning is legible, selected and used faint yellow print throughout the book on all the recipe captions. So the captions are virtually unreadable. Gourmet publishers should recall and exchange the yellow-print books for adequate, black print books without charge. It also lacks the illustrations or photography that other books use as guides to demonstrate preparation. Further, the recipes are generally very complicated, multi-step ones. The explanations are not well-organized, are paragraphed poorly and hard to follow. I find the recipe selections rather odd and unconventional. They simply should not have tried to do this project with such a lack of expertise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gourmt Cookbook:More than 1000 recipes","review":"Wonderful service.

I have yet to make anything from this book that turned out, which is wierd because I can make the stuff from Gourmet Magazine with no problems!

An idealist at heart, Sentilles went into Teach For America for all the right reasons, and when it became clear that TFA had no intentions of providing her with the resources she needed to succeed, she stayed and fought the system right alongside her kids. In a place where many people would have set themselves apart and focused on the differences, Sentilles relentlessly tried to bridge the gap between herself and her kids and provide them with the tools they would need to succeed in the world beyond school - love, support, compassion, humor, and kindness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of Ivy League White Folks Saving Us Poor Black Folks","review":"I am a product of the Compton school system, and I have taught here for the last 15 years.

We refer to TFA in my teacher lounge as \\"teach for a while,\\" as most of these folks use Compton as the launching point for their graduate school applications.

I especially loved making \\"bouquets\\" of cookies as gifts for a club party we attended.Two things: 1. After inserting the stick into the cookie, I topped each with an extra marble sized dollop of cookie dough for added strength; and 2. You will want to be sure and allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan so that they have time to firm-up before removing....for this reason, you may choose to buy more than one pan to speed up baking as it does take time to wait for these to cool first (I placed mine in the fridge quicken the process)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I had high hopes for these knee highs being they are a Spanx product.

My informants tell me these were commonly called 'trouser' roles, for obvious reasons. If nothing else, it shows that the device of gender switching is a lot older than 'Victor, Victoria' of 'Bosum Buddies'.My problem is that very few of these arias are terribly familiar. Needless to say, Ms. Larmore doe them great justice with her magnificent voice. It's just that I would still rather listen to a mezzo do French chansoms or Schubert Lieder than obscure Meyerbeer or Gluck Arias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless to me","review":"I bought this filter because my monitor faces a big open window. On a sunny day it is very difficult to see anything because of so much glare reflected off the screen from outside.Apperenlty it is not designed to stop THAT type of glare but just glare ORIGINATING from the screen. If you have outside glare it is actually worse because it has an almost mirrored effect making it impossible to see the screen behind.If you are in a room where outside glare is not a problem then this will probably be OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"This glare-filter didn't work for me because I was trying to reduce glare from a large window behind me, not glare from the screen itself.

Whiting is crammed with immensely helpful tips, both practical and spiritual, to help busy women make the most of their time. It's also packaged in a highly attractive format that can be scanned quickly for the helpful suggestions Whiting offers and is concise enough to absorb quickly. What makes it so attractive, in addition to the simple, logical layout, is that the text is interspersed with pictures and backgrounds that are restful to the eye. Even better, it's just the right size to tuck into your purse to read when you're stuck somewhere and have a few minutes to spare.Time and its companion book The Home are the first two books of the Secrets of Success for Women Series. They are indeed SOS whether you are a working or stay-at-home mom, wife, or single professional.

So I bought the 10\\". I've owned it for a few months now and have used it extensively. It has plenty of power - all but the largest forstner bits in all but the hardest wood cut smoothly and cleanly with this press. My only real compaint is the difficulty of adjusting the angle of the table - it requires a wrench and is fairly rough. However, the depth-stop adjustment is smooth and elegant, the table height adjustment is adequate, and the speed changes (via belt changes) are quite simple once you've got the hang of it. Workmanship of the tool is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor motor","review":"I have this drill press and have used it twice without incident. On the third time the motor burned up in smoke. As it's now out of warranty, I will have to eat the cost of a new motor at $130. I will likely buy a different machine.

The older one, like older sisters everywhere, is very protective of her younger sister. She doesn't jump rope, or go to school, or sew a button without making sure her sister is safe. And her sister lets her, until one day she's tired of having cookies and lemonade managed for her, and tired of being told how to do things and when.So she leaves. She leaves her house, and her block, and goes right to an empty field where she lies down and thinks about things for a while.And when her worried big sister comes out the door, the little one stays still and doesn't answer, and doesn't answer, until her older sister sits right down and cries.At this point the little sister does just the right thing, which she's learned from her older sister. And as they go home, we're told that they now protected each other, and I cry.It's just a very sweet story, one I really recommend for any sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - these are abbreviated versions of the songs","review":"As far as the record goes, the performances are wonderful.

In my opinion Neher was a much more pleasant singer than Lenya. Sad to say, she'd end up in a Stalinist Death Camp a few years later after fleeing from the Nazis to the USSR. The digital remastering seems to be nice, again judging from the samples (my grandmother had the original record and it was very noisy and not clear at all.)

Just peel, stick, and roll over it with a rolling pin or a heavy can and/or jar... like a can of unopened soda. You can pick up the puzzle right away, although the directions suggest that you let it lie flat for an hour.Others on here have given this a poor review because the puzzle has to be flipped over.

They are nothing more than a piece of thin plastic - the same cheap piece of plastic used to hang merchandise in stores.

There is far, far more to this beautiful game than mere number-crunching. Try poetry, drama, romance, myth, legend, simple competitive excitement. This book seems to miss the other 80-plus percent of the game and those other 80-plus percent of the readers and fans. And even for those who would rather sit in front of their computers than in the outfield bleachers, the author's measure of hitting greatness is at best the most narrow possible measure - the standard but highly unrevealing category of batting averages. There is much ado about nothing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batting average as the sole measurement of hitting ability?","review":"This book spends a great deal of time making (very reasonable) adjustments to the batting averages of baseball players. That's fine, but the problem is that batting average is a terrible measurement of offensive ability. It's less important than on-base percentage (OBP), and it's less important than slugging percentage (SLG) and thus, by implication, any reasonable measurement that combines OBP and SLG.What a waste of time to go inte such depths when only looking into a terrible predictor of offensive ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"Mr. Schell's book on baseball will disappoint nearly all ordinary baseball fans. It is loaded with statistical analysis that is nonintuitive and produces very counterintuitive results. For Mr. Schell, it seems that the facts must be made to fit the theory rather than the other way round. To be sure, some of the ways that are used to judge hitting prowess are not merely innovative but highly illuminating. But we don't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The idea that Tony Gwynn is the best hitter of all time and that Babe Ruth is far down in the standings is going a bit too far.Mr. Schell has a more more recent book that will seem more sensible to most fans. It gives weight to slugging ability or so-called power hitting and restores Ruth to a high place in the pecking order and drops Gwynn to a spot we can believe in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare view of Rez Women","review":"Book is an excellent look at the lives of a variety of women who have their reservation in common.

But this time something is missing. There are the feeling that all musicians and choir are in a hurry to end the music and go quickly home to sip a beer. There are no interaction with the work, they do not understand Handel and do not care. To perform Handel well you must understand the work and love it, or at least like it. Here they are indiferent.

She continues to muddy up what could be enjoyable detective mysteries with her liberal politics. It's okay to have opinions, but the first rule of authorship is to not use your work of fiction to showcase your personal politics and certainly not shove them down the reader's throat. I just don't enjoy reading page after page of her bashing Christianity, Republican government, organized law enforcement agencies, and the so-called upper class. Okay, we all know where you stand on the issues, Ms. Peretsky, and while some readers will certainly agree with you, I think it beyond wreckless to slant your stories to such a degree that you are without doubt alienating half your readers - some, like me, to the point they've decided it's just no longer worth it to have to pick through your personal prejudices to get to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is my first Paretsky novel.

Fortunately it was borrowed so the only thing I spent poorly was time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!!!","review":"Kathleen Turner's V.I. was so hard to take that I swore to never pick up a Paretsky book. A couple of weeks ago, desperate for something to read, I picked up this book at a friend's house and couldn't put it down. It was great! Although some of the characters were a little hard to take (Mrs. Graham, Rene Bayards), I absolutely loved V.I. and especially how Paretsky allowed us to look into her mind and see her faults! I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have!","review":"For those fellow fans of Paretsky, I have waited a long time for her to submit another novel featuring Vic. This is one you won't want to put down.

Is it to be revealed in the next book that V.I. is afflicted with the same disease that killed her mother at a young age?

Unfortunately, this book was a big disappointment. Rather than racing through the pages, I find myself slogging along, trying to keep track of too many characters with similar names and annoying personalities. My guess is that if this book was Paretsky's first, it would have ended up in the rejection pile. The author obviously is upset about events after 9/11 which have led to many individuals of Middle Eastern background being detained as possible terrorists. She tries to link these current events with the blacklisting of the 1950s, but back then, no one was crashing planes into skyscrapers.

I have enjoyed her previous novels; loved the protagonist, and now she has gone and screwed up her mystery and tried to mix in a big dose of left wing political commentary. What a bummer!

I will never pick up another Sara Peretsky novel.

That's how tiresome this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado about nothing","review":"At least I can't cry about the money I spent, since I do use the library almost exclusively. To say this book was too long and too boring would be to simplify things. And how does a character become such a big part of the story when he wasn't even there? I am referring to lost lover Morrell. If V.I. makes a profit in her crazy investigative career it's a miracle. Massage's and motels for a few hours rest, 3 traffic tickets for overparking because she couldn't get back to her car in time, just a few examples. What was the big coverup anyway to justify 3 murders.

Warshawski. This book disappoints with an extremely convoluted plot involving too many characters. There's very little fun in reading Blacklist. V.I. lacks much of her sharper wit shown in earlier adventures and Blacklist reads as a poor summary of the low points in 20th Century social history. I only finished reading it because I hoped to find some of the pleasure I felt in previous V.I. novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Although I usually enjoy the VI Warshawski series of books by Sara Paretsky there is only one word to describe this epistle...TEDIOUS! Getting through the middle 200 pages of this book could be compared with walking the entire length of the State of Illinois in four feet of snow.The only redeeming message hidden within the pages of this book is the comparison of two eras in our lives. The days of McCarthy and the black listing of many Americans and the corrupt Big Brother atmosphere perpetuated and condoned by the Bush Administration. Never in history have Americans had more to fear from their own government and the terrorists therein, than those from the outside who challenge our civil liberties and freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"time for Paretsky to fade away?","review":"Oh, what a dreary series this has become.

Did an editor actually get paid to work on this project??? On page one, the main character is exploring the grounds of an estate, and it is midnight. On page eleven, she walks immediately into a house and is served tea because it's suddenly afternoon, with no time elapsed! The snafus start there and just keep dragging the believablity level down to the basement. Unreadable and inexcusable.

The political/historical commentary about the blacklisting in the 1950's was especially tedious. And, the final resolution was rather unbelievable. Overall, the novel would have been more enjoyable in a shorter, cleaner version."},{"rating":"2","title":"V. I. is not Miss Marple","review":"This is another great V.I. Warshawski book. She does a great job in evoking Chicago and the current political environment. My main critique would center on number of characters and the complexities of their ancient histories which makes it a bit of a challenge in terms of keeping the cast of characters straight. In addition to the main plot, the subtext of the story comprises a compelling weaving of various histories... of African Americans, leftists and gays... and the challenges they have faced in various times in our recent history. The juxtaposition of the current \\"Patriot Act\\" environment with the MacArthy era is an effective way of demonstrating the perils of an unencumbered police state and judiciary. While some may prefer more 'timeless' Miss Marple type mysteries where there is little reference to the current sociopolitical context, weaving current challenges into the story makes it even more interesting, and in some ways, educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a long drawn out story","review":"I listened to the audiobook unabridged version. It was over 15 hours long. What a long drawn out story. The subplot of the \\"Egyptian boy\\" served no purpose other than give the writer an opportunity to give her feelings of the Patriot Act. It is troubling legislation and I am fearful of the abuse that can happen. I think she is a skillful writer who could have gotten more thoughtful attention to the Patriot Act with less rhetoric.I had to force myself to listen to the last quarter of the book to find out \\"who dun it\\" because at around chapter 35, I no longer cared. There were a lot of characters. I had to make notes to remember who was who. I just can't understand why this book was so wordy-the characters were not that complex (just too many), and didn't require added insight. This is my second V.I. Warshawski novel, and probably my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"This will be the last Paretsky book that I purchase. I had to force myself to finish it because I can't admit defeat. This was so full of left-wing politics that that the reader has no sympathy for any of the characters. I really didn't care what happened. The last few chapters, after she had expended most of her political venom, the reading was much easier and more enjoyable. There's enough political rhetoric on TV these days without having to endure it while reading a book for pleasure. If I had wanted a political fiction I would have read Bill Clinton's bio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the politics.","review":"If I want to read a bunch of liberal drivel, I will buy a political book.

While the story was alright, it could have been vastly expanded on. This historical romance novel is based on a female that gets abducted by pirates and 'taken' by their captain. Taken over and over and over again. That's right folks, this book is basically all about sex. The masked captain of the pirate ship beds the helpless female many, many times over without much of anything for dialog, and she falls helplessly in love with him. How romantic.This book was written alright, but the plot left much to be desire...WITHOUT desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, good quality","review":"This shirt looks nice, washes well and lays well.

The start was slow but optimistically I looked forward to something satisfying - I slogged through this disappointment until the bitter end. The one star I gave it (my first inclination was no stars for the pitiful plot and tedious narrative but that was not an option...) was only for some of the character development which was interesting at times. What a waste of a tree (well, with 768 pages, many trees)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing.","review":"I gave up after reading a hundred pages or so. I'm a huge fan of James Dickey. I'd waited for so long for a second book from him and was so disappointed by this. The plot was vague and boring, and it didn't have that wonderful prose which Dickey used in Deliverance.The one positive I could say about this book is his idea of portraying the blind and sighted versions simultaneously. It didn't work in this. But the 'idea' is to be admired. He always seems to find some way to push the established boundaries of writing.(He pushes the boundaries again in the last of his novels, 'To The White Sea'. He has no dialogue at all for ninety odd percent of the book. Very successfully, too.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happened!","review":"This was probably the worst book I have ever read. I thought something would \\"happen\\", but other than philosophical meanderings of the war and the meaning of life, it was a complete waste of time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ox buries himself in '80s shlock-rock","review":"The whole appeal of John Entwistle's work was his darkly-humoured writing, thunderous bass, and distinctive yet very capable vocals. None of this are easily found in The Rock, recorded in the mid-80s. It is chock-full of musical cliches from the era, both musically and lyrically (stock guitar riffs and synthesizers, trite lyrics).It's really an Entwistle album in name only, as he wrote only 4 of the original 10 songs, defers lead vocals to Henry Small, and shows none of the musical complexity of his Who or '70s solo work. It does rock a bit, though, in a mindless way. And the review above is right, 'Love Doesn't Last' is the best song on the album.If you want a better sample of some of his later work, get the 'Left For Live' set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad 80s? No Thanks","review":"Except for Zakk Starkey on drums, there is no reason to buy this album. The vocals are a bad Paul Rodgers copy and the songs are a cross between Mr. Mister and the Outfield, minus the commerical success. The late Mr. Entwistle should be comended for trying to form another group after the Who \\"broke up,\\" but this was really a stiffing of his personality for the sake of pop music that didn't go anywhere. The album really doesn't hold up well and there's only one song up to the standards of older Entwistle compositions. Hell, when I saw the Rock on tour in '87, they could barely make it through the set. Even John had enough and left the stage half way through the set. Buy another Entwistle album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tagalog learning aide I own","review":"I like this DVD better than any other material I have, CDs, computer applications, and Learn Tagalog 3: Advanced.

From Texas just keep on rockin!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comeback.","review":"This probably was really a surprise for the fans most of whom by that time buried April Wine in the same tomb where the remains of Blue Oyster Cult and Golden Earring were gathering dust for a decade. This is an album with a very convincing drive and real heavy metal feel to it - songs like \\"Here's Lookin' At You Kid\\" and \\"Better Slow Down\\" are excellent fast hard-rock numbers crushing your eardrums relentlessly and both with great tunes! \\"That's Love\\", \\"Givin' It Takin' It\\", \\"Strange Kind of Love\\", \\"Luv Your Stuff\\" are other highlights with very good guitar work and rhythm. Of course, filler is more than evident here but at least it doesn't overshadow the good half of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A balanced viewpoint","review":"Sonder gives a balanced view of the controversy between these two camps. His background information is clear, compelling and easy to follow. A thin book, only 112 pages, it focuses on defining what each side believes. I learned, for instance, what the three basic tenets of Fundmentalism are, how religious contemporaries viewed Darwin (not as virulently as one might now think) and why Evolutionist make no efforts to counter the claims made by Creationist. It is easy to read; a high school student would have not trouble with it. Its photos are basic black-and-white, which somewhat dates and detracts from the book. Overall, I came away with the feeling that most Americans are a lot closer to each other in the belief of how life developed on earth and that only the radical wings of both camps are so very far apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its an O.K. album","review":"Beats are ridin but lyrics have no substance, lameFab Five:1 We Can Smoke2 To be Played3 My Life4 Got Everything5 This is How we Do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Money Heavyweights","review":"Big Tymers back and they still doing it big.

I've owned Panasonic phones before, and this one is a major step backwards for the company. Not only was the noise level in the receiver very high, but clients also complained they had trouble hearing me. The so called \\"Voice Enhancer\\" actually makes the sound worse in that it seems to amplify and distort the already poor sound quality. Design also suffers due the way the phone sits in the cradle, there's no way to use a belt clip. There's a place on the phone to attach a lanyard, but the idea of carrying my phone around on a lanyard or wrist strap seems beyond silly. It's amazing that of all the electronic devices in our lives, telephones are the ones that seem to get worse with every generation.

Unfortunately, the kite handle was dropped and the kite continued flying upwards and straight until the handle snagged at the top of a tree.

The economic necessity for parents to work most of the day, either in or outside the home, is not a function of modern western society, as is presumed by the authors. This being the case, to claim that active face-to face play with an unoccupied adult for most of a baby or toddlers waking hours is an irreducible need, appears somewhat bizarre.

It is humorous, informative, maintains an agreeable pace, and does not burden the reader with a nuisance ideological overflow. The breadth of knowledge and use of quality sources is impressive (Tuchman, Schama...), but the highlight is the subtle and sometimes not so subtle one and two line zingers.What is most impressive is Horne's marvelous command of flow and detail while still maintaining cogence in the grand sweep of French history. One of the most enjoyable books I have read in a long time, the momentum is established on the first page and never falters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a decent history","review":"If you want a readable and simple history of France this is a good book, but it is not a great book and there are entire pieces of it that could have been left out. The first problem is that most of the book up untill the 16th century, or up until Louis XIV, is basically weak, it is weak on writing and comprehension and story-telling. It is just not very interesting and cobbled together, collected facts. There is absolutely no sense of pre 800 A.D France. The period after Louis XIV however is well written with a full understanding of the currents in French politics, culture and military affairs.Therefore this is a good read, a very general history and one that someone should buy who knows very little of French history. If you are remotely familiar with the outlines of French history you may be disappointed.Seth J.

He gives one short paragraph to France's oldest hero, Charlemagne. As time goes on myth and fact become lost. However, Horne dismisses Charlmagne as an eccentric unimportant absentee ruler who makes no impact on the history of France! An amazing assumption. This should be an historical novel. Horne also has another strange footnote on the same page from Huxley, where he agrees that the French are Germans gone Latin.

The seller should be tasting and testing the batch before buying it. She did not apologize at all. The garbanzo bean sprouts I bought tasted fine so I think it's this batch of peas.

Poison is great, obviously, and the remix is half decent, but the real gem are the b-sides.Scienide is my favorite Prodigy B-side of all time, and one of my favorite Prodigy tracks of all time as well. It is THAT GOOD. It's the closest thing to trance you'll ever hear The Prodigy produce, but its still got that damn hard sound.

Further, most of the advice is given in the form of critiquing the essays of others, which is a somewhat tedious way to get the message.I think that the Montauk book does a better job of addressing the positioning/marketing issues, and Montauk has is a more robust treatment of the rest of the application process. Save your money and skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers all the bases","review":"I thought this book was very helpful in its advice on preparing for the application process, brainstorming ideas etc. I would have benefitted from more help about the essays- need more details. Although they give examples of good essays, they are all from people with exceptional experience and some special ethnic or unique background- need some from a regular MBA applicant who needs some help.

Every facet of the liner's history from its origins to the wreck exploration is covered. Each chapter includes pictures of everything connected to the ship. Anyone with any interest in Titanic at all should have a copy.I did think the authors could have done better with their chapter on the sinking itself though. As it is they wrote little text and tell the story through picture captions! It is as if a book on the Kennedy assassination covered details of the flight to Dallas and then said little about the shooting itself.

I'm very pleased with it's performance. It worked great and is very easy to use. The safety trigger on the handle is a pain, but you get used to it. Just remember to oil it on a regular interval and it will continue to deliver for you. Pnumatic compared to manual is like comparing a motorcycle to a bicycle. The price was also very reasonable through Amazon considering no tax, free shipping and a $50 off coupon on tools over $300."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but...","review":"water vapor from the compressor mixed with the oil applied to the air feed caused the two problems. The piston which drives the nails became fouled with the water-oil mix and would not retract fully and prevented the next nail to feed properly. I first tried more oil, but that caused the unit to spray excess oil from the top of the unit (causing a light oil mist on anything in the area of the floor). I think I fixed the problem by cleaning the unit (it had about 200 sq ft total at this time) and adding an inline filter to the compressor. Other than that, I am very happy with my unit and \\"field stripping\\" it is not difficult..."},{"rating":"2","title":"real workhorse","review":"Have had no trouble with this nailer; it is best, however, to load a fresh clip of nails before completely running out, as often the last nail will fall out or not drive correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than renting!","review":"The nailer performed well. The cost was about the same as renting a pneumatic nailer (for the amount of time I needed it) and I get to keep the nailer. I didn't experience the jamming on the last nail that others have. Mine just ejected the nail and I added more. Overall, a very nice tool for the non-professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Issues","review":"This cleat nailer has a number of issues...After laying down about 500 sf of flooring the nailer failed... but since it wasn't used much during the warranty period it wasn't covered. When we opened the top there were a number of broken pieces. We sent it out for repair to a recommended repair facility... it only took 5 weeks to get the parts... there was a small list. $125 later... I just finish installing about 60 sf and it failed again. It will be a while before I take it to the shop again as I replaced it with a Bostich. The second issue has to do with what happens when it runs out of cleats. Rather than just using the last one and then doing nothing... it inevitably embeds the last cleat into the side or top of the board you are trying to fasten. I hate to think how many floor boards I ruined. The nailer looks nice... but it isn't up to Porter Cables usual high standards... don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome nailer","review":"I bought my nailer to install 3/4\\" solid maple hardwood. So far it has been flawless. As described in other reviews the last nail of a strip falls harmlessly out. No jams, little cracking of tongues unless you nail too close to an end. This is the one... After I hit the sweet spot for air pressure (a little over ninety) I have had no trouble except for when I was'nt paying attention and put a cleat through the top of a board (my bad):) I reccomend it very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, product, but don't run it out of nails","review":"So far, this has proven to be well worth every penny. It works flawlessly every time, with one exception: make sure you never try to fire the last nail. If it doesn't fall out, it will fire in an unexpected way. I wasn't paying attention to the nail stock, and it fired the last nail just under the finished face of the wood, ruining it. What a pain it was to have to dig out that piece of wood and replace it. I am much more careful now! The foot has a thick teflon (or similar material) layer attached so it never scratches the wood, and even the alignment blade seems to be pretty forgiving when you miss the edge and drag it over a bit of the surface of the wood.Overall, this is a great product, and I would recommend it to anyone installing wood flooring, although I wish it came with a case..."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time flooring","review":"I bought the Porter Cable nailer based on the reputation of their tools and reviews. It performed very well, easy to use and drove the cleats effortlessly. I put down 5/8 bamboo over about 225 sq feet, on top of 3/4 T&G; underlayment. The only times it did not drive perfectly were if I did not tap the button firmly and keep the trigger down. On one occasion I let it run out of cleats, and the last cleat tried to go in upside down. Not good, fortunately it was a short piece that I could pry out and discard.THe bamboo flooring is somwhat brittle compared to similar oak, and I was concerned with splitting. Some of the cleats did show cracking, but the cleat design holds firmly and I was able to use fewer cleats than I expected.I can't say yet how well it holds up in production use, but for a serious DIY project with hardwood flooring this tool will do very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I purchased this nailer to install a 3/4\\" prefinished hardwood floor.

I laid about 450 square feet of 3/4\\" floor and had zero problems. Other reviews mentioned concerns with the last nail firing erratically...Several times I fired the last nail with no problem, other times, the last nail just dropped out before I had the chance to nail it. A carrying case would be nice, but, if you're not using it on a regular basis, it's just as easy to store it in the box it comes in. Overall, I am completely satisfied with the product and would definitely recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews made the difference","review":"This nailer has worked awesome so far! I am working with 1/2\\" Engineered Brazillian Cherry 3 1/2\\" wide and was able to use this nailer after the first row was face-nailed.

Yeah, they thud alright, but I think they sound more like if you punch someone in the gut and listen to the sound they make when they cough afterwards. This is not Chicago at their best.

It more resembles high-school marching band than a major American symphony. The opening brass motive is completely run over. It's one of the best phrases in music liturature and it was killed by the third note! The other movements all resemble themselves in tempi. No thought was put into dramatic or emotional consideration. Way to kill a great piece. I'd feel too guilty to sell my copy to some unsuspecting soul, I think I'd rather burn it.

I've used it so much that some of the keys are blank from the wear.

The only complaint I have is that it is easy to hit the power, sleep, and wakeup buttons when using the ten-key pad. But instead of removing the key cap (as suggested by another user), I modified the power settings in Windows to ask me what to do when these keys are hit, so when I do accidently hit one, a popup asks me what to do and I can hit \\"cancel\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but watch for liquids","review":"I loved this keyboard, until I accidentally spilled a liquid into in early one morning.

The only negitive is its size (it's huge).The only complaints I have with this keyboard is that I wish it was spill resistant and the letters wear off.

Also included was a do-it-yourself fitness evaluation which any new mom would find depressing. A post pregnancy mile and a half clocked jog to determine a fitness level? I don't think so.

IT IS FROM SOME COVER BAND CALLED 'INSECURE'.* There are no interviews with the band.* There are no video clips.* It is only 45 minutes long.* The second disc contains music by 'Insecure'.The only footage of The Cure is three live tracks from 'The Top' and a variety of still photos.The only positive is the book.

The picture quality is only average now for most newer webcams, but it works as expected. The sound quality is only so-so depending on how far away from the camera you are when talking to it. Sometimes it is worth using a separate microphone, espeically if you are going to be walking around.There are some additional features of the camera which I find annoying and don't use. Face-tracking is relatively good but sometimes it doesn't work at all. All the 'cute' little backgrounds that the camera allows you to use are useless as far as I am concerned.Overall, if you need a basic camera for skype this is more than enough for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two decent web cameras","review":"These cameras worked well, I used them both on Vista and Windows Sever 2003.

Free-flowing beer, sunshine, hot girls with Playboy umm... physiques playing on the beach. Cruising the strip. Safe sex hadn't been invented yet. There aren't any tedious social issues or pretentious drama to drag things down and get in the way of the nonstop fun. Just a hilarious skirmish with a neurotic stepfather and his henchman. There's just enough nudity to make you feel like you got your money's worth, although all of the girls are super fine to look at with or without clothes. Everyone in this film seems to be having so much fun you forget they're acting. Heck, you feel like you're right there with them. '38 Special's \\"Caught Up in You\\" goes perfectly with a wacky hotel mixup that no young man should EVER have to endure.

This movie was, quite frankly, the funniest I've ever seen.Comedic value aside, Pamela's Prayer has a moral point to make - and it's not the one you're expecting. The film's obsession with saving one's first kiss for marriage is handled so poorly that it actually appears to oppose the values it intends to support. Further, the ridiculousness of its argument against pre-marital kissing can be analogically applied to premarital sex. After viewing this movie, the only conclusion I had reached was that Christianity's view on premarital sex was just as ridiculous as this movie's view on kissing.

I have changed the batteries in mine maybe 3 times in 9 months and adore the fact that the mobile itself is removable, although the music box stays. I agree that the remote isn't very practical but I just don't use it - simple as that. I would recommend this sturdy mobile to everyone. My baby boy loved the mobile and still enjoys the music. If he is figity at all in his crib I play the music and he relaxes once again. It is expensive but can be used as long as you have the crib since the music box stays put.

I only used the mobile at most once ever 2-3 days so this is not from overuse and a change of batteries made no difference.I also think the remote is a JOKE. As other users have stated, you must manually push a button on the base of the mobile (IN THE CRIB) that enables the remote to work. If you don't use the remote within 15 minutes of pushing the button it turns itself off and you must go push the button on the mobile to make it work.

The music is nice, if not a little loud (I tucked the speaker behind the crib bumper to dull the sound). We've never used the remote control because you have to be so close to the crib, it defeats the purpose. But, I would still recommend this mobile over all other mobiles. It's WELL worth the money.

At 3 months slept 8 hours straight and learned to fall asleep on his own. The remote never worked further than three feet away and does not turn the unit on unless you have it on standby. Few weeks into it we had to give it a push to get it to move and now its just stationary.

But one day, when he turned 2 months old, I heard him talking and cooing on the monitor. I went to check on him and lo and behold he was mesmerized by this mobile. Now I can take a shower, catch up on bills, eat a meal or just relax for 30 minutes or longer. One thing I do recommend though is to make sure to move the mobile to the side of the crib if you are trying to put your baby to sleep. My son is so stimulated by it he refuses to close his eyes when it's in his field of vision. If getting a few minutes to yourself matters to you, you will buy this mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but . . .","review":"Like most, my little girl loves this mobile! Ever since she's been a month old, she's enjoyed it and still does. Either in her bouncer, swing or on the floor this mobile makes her smile and squeal with delight. The brightly colored animals keep her attention and she concentrates on the swirls under the \\"umbrellas\\".The remote is definitely worth the extra money (we were lucky, we received as a gift). I can be in the kitchen and restart the mobile in the family room.Here's were the but comes in - since we use it throughout the day, the batteries need to be replaced. It's a hassle taking the mobile apart because it needs to be unscrewed. Also the connection of the arm to the machine is not as good as it was a month ago. It still works great but you have to make sure it's in the right position."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Mobile ROCKS!","review":"This is one of the best products we registered for (at the advice of a friend). My son is now 4 months old and still loves it! The lenght of the music is long enought for a weary new mom to get a quick shower, or for a sleepy baby to fall asleep. Its developlental, and stimulating, why giving the clasical music a chance to calm the baby. Needless to say , I LOVE IT :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have!","review":"My son loved this mobile...and it was the only that we found that was made in bright colors (which is what babies see first) and moved toward his face so he could see it at a young age. It was not difficult to put together correctly and it did not fall on my child. As far as using batteries...big deal, that is a small price to pay for a toy that is developmentally appropriate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"A remote mobile--great idea! I love the way the colorful characters dance, and the music is soothing. However, the unit does not sit well on the crib. The arm moves with the weight of the unit so it is not over the mattress. My husband \\"rigged\\" it so it would sit properly, but you should not have to. This is our 2nd Tiny Love mobile; the first I thought was a lemon and returned it. When we turn the new mobile on, the arm falls off, usually hitting the baby. I have sent my complaint to Tiny Love. Hopefully this doesn't happen to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 4 minutes","review":"Wow, what a great looking mobile. My wife and I thought the price a bit high but decided to take a chance. What a mistake!!! The mobile stopped turning before the first song ended.

Do not buy this ...!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment.","review":"This mobile came highly recommended and we were so happy with it for 7 weeks. Then the mobile stopped spinning. I called Tiny Love and was told by their customer service representative that my complaint was a common one and that they would send me a replacement piece. The replacement piece never arrived. This product quickly went from being my favorite baby gift to something I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It would be great if Tiny Love could solve the spinning problem because it's such a good idea and my son loved it while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replaced arm twice and still makes noise","review":"I bought this product and within two weeks there was a loud noise coming from the speaker. The company sent me a replacement for the arm and it helped. Then a loud noise came from the motor on top of the arm and the company sent me another arm. Now there is another noise coming from the motor. It's toleratable, so I'm not going to bother calling the company. Too bad because it is visually great and my baby likes it. It's just annoying to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment!!!","review":"I can not express how disapointed I am in this mobile. We got it for our 3 month old son for Christmas and he loved it. The first reason I bought it was so I could turn it on from the hall without him seeing me. Well that was disappointment #1 because you have to turn the remote on from the base. The next disapointment came 3 weeks after Christmas when it just stopped working. There are now 2 new brands of these mobiles out and I would highly recommend checking into them before you purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Mobile!","review":"My husband purchased this mobile so I wouldnt have to wind up the mobile that matches my babys nursery every minute. My baby absolutely loved this mobile, and it gave me some time to get a few things done. I have been fortunate that the mobile hasnt stopped working. My problem is, I put my baby down in the crib, turned the mobile on, and went downstairs to get some breakfast. When I came back upstairs she was screaming bloody murder. To my suprise, the clip on peice (with the animals) fell on her face! I am completely outraged and dissapointed with this product. How safe can it be if you leave the room for a minute and peices are falling off of it onto your baby?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great till it breaks","review":"My baby loves this mobile.

Before she began sleeping in her crib last week (at 10 weeks-old), we would lie her in the crib with the mobile moving above her and watch her smile and laugh at it -- she really seemed to enjoy it. After doing this only twice, the motor just died. We replaced the batteries, but nothing would make it work again. So, before her first night of sleeping in the crib, the mobile was already broken!! She does continue to look at the colors and shapes but, needless to say, we are extremely disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO STIMULATING!","review":"In my opinion mobiles are supposed to be entertaining, but in a mellow way. They're supposed to RELAX a baby and help her go to sleep. This mobile is soooo busy w/ its multitude of animals and colors and music and motion that it makes my baby HYPER and overstimulated. NOT good for helping a baby go to sleep AT ALL. However, it is good for 10 or 15 minutes of entertainment while you catch a quick shower or get something quick done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mobile","review":"First of all, I am a picky mom. I research everything before I buy it, and this mobile was a clear choice for me. After listening to the music on several mobiles, the tiny love mobiles were by far the least \\"mechanical\\" sounding. The classical music is refreshing and 15 minutes each composer is great! It's turning pattern is fascinating, and the constant motion of the beads is very fun for an infant(yes, they do make a noise while they slide, but so what).So, why buy this one instead of the previous versions? The colors and animals are still fun and bright, but a much better match to most nursery decor. The remote is a great addition, and I think it is very handy. Other than that, I think any tiny love mobile is a smart purchase.I'm adding that my first one broke too, but I had absolutely wonderful customer service, and got a new one easily! It works like a charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stimulating to look at, but...","review":"I LOVED this mobile from the box, but out of the box, it just didn't work as I had hoped:1.) Our crib is slightly curved on the ends, so it was a challenge findng a safe place for it to mount without damaging the crib.2.) As the next review says, there are two volumes: loud and medium. I had to put masking tape over to speaker to make it bearable for a sleepy baby.3.) When it is spinning, there are little squares that slide down the mobile. Cute concept, but they make an awful racket that isn't even rhythmic.4.) Like the review below, ours stopped spinning after a very short time in use. I didn't really mind, though because it stopped the scrapping noise of the little squares and let me just play the music.In concept, this is a beautiful toy, and broken or not, my daughter still loves to look at the spirals and the toys. We have many Tiny Love toys and she enjoys them all, but this particular one has some bugs to work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problems","review":"We also have a Morigeau-Lepine crib. I wish I read the other review before I registered for the regular version of this mobile. The only side it can be attached to is the one that goes up and down. Also, the sliding shapes seem to make a lot of noise, but I hear that's part of the entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Mobile for our Newborn!","review":"This mobile may be an eye-sore for your color-schemed decorated room, but it's worth every penny and obnoxiousness. We have gone through about 3 mobiles and our 2-month-old baby girl would not lie by herself in her crib without crying. Once we turn this mobile on, she has lasted for as long as 30-40 minutes!!! Our only complaint is that it should not stop. As soon as it does, we can hear her starting to get fussy again. They really should let the parents decide when toys should turn off (or at least have that option). The remote is a nice touch so that she does not see us in the room. However, she is so busy looking at the mobile that she does not notice us. This mobile is a life saver. We just wish it were a little more attractive...."},{"rating":"2","title":"BY FAR - The Best Mobile on the Market!!","review":"Although it didn't match the decor in my newborn son's nursery, my husband loved the \\"remote\\" idea so I gave in and we purchased this mobile. Well, the remote has proved useless, but this is probably one of the best baby purchases we've ever made. I would have paid 4X the money. As a newborn, my son was mesmorized by the bright colors and music. He would lay in his crib for 1/2 an hour just gooing and ga-ing. As he got older and could reach the animals, we removed the mobile and left the music box attached to his crib. Now at 18 mos. he can turn it on himself. When I put him in for a nap or for the night, he crawls over and turns it on, then crawls back into the corner of his crib and falls right to sleep. It's truly amazing!!! Because I can't bear to take the music box out of his crib, i'll be purchasing another one for the next baby due in May!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"watch for falling parts","review":"my child loves this mobile, but the mobile unit will just randomly become unattached and fall on my baby -- i would be very leary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it, my daughter did not...","review":"I thought it was great, but my 4 mo old would not even look at it. Developmentally, it is a great concept, but she didn't seem to care. Put her in front of her plain, but not all that \\"developmentally correct\\" Pooh mobile, and she is facinated! Go figure. Guess the developmental experts forgot to ask her opinion! I would say wait to buy it until your baby is here and try it out. If they don't like it you can try with another one. Babies can be very picky and it is pretty expensive.One positive...the music lasts for 15 min. Most mobiles wind and quit running quickly. This one goes on for a while, so if your baby likes it, it will last for a good amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"After 4 uses the motor quit working.

Well, I am coming back to this product specifically because I am really disappointed with how short of a lifespan this product has.

I am convinced that I should have bought something cheaper that might actually WORK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Faulty Mobile","review":"My baby loves this mobile. I loved the colors and all the movement as well. I spent a lot of time looking for just the right mobile before I finally decided on this one. The other day I put my daughter in her crib and started up the mobile when nothing would soothe her and I needed a break. Wow! The mobile really did the trick. She was transfixed and calm . . . until it stopped moving. The music continued to play but all the motion stopped. This was only the fourth time I had turned the mobile on.

I fell in love with it and purchased one on my own. When we brought our son home, we would him under the mobile for \\"activity time.\\" The mobile angles down so that it brought objects in and out of his line of vision. He would stare at the mobile and really engage for the full 15 minutes the music played. It was amazing! As he grew, he would stare at the mobile until he fell asleep (about half way through the cycle). He's too big for the mobile now, but we still have the music box attached to the crib. He learned how to turn it on and off by himself and tries to sing along to the classical music! So cute!I did have the mobile stop working once - the arm attachment stopped functioning.

SO, I took it back to the store and exchanged for a brand new one. Guess what: NO SPIN!!!!!!!!!! I'm so disappointed. I won't be trying a third as I really believe that would be ridiculous.

The colors are fabulous and there's so much to see as it goes around. At first, it may have been a little too stimulating, but now it works like a charm for naps. She smiles at them and \\"talks\\" to them/it then falls asleep when the music ends. It used to be one of the only things that would distract her and make her smile when crying or when I needed to get dressed etc. As w/all mobiles, I'll have to take it down when she can grab it. She loves to see it and grab it when we hold her up to it. The remote may not be too useful, but a couple of times it was helpful. No problems attaching it to the crib.

It has durable stainless steel blades which uniformly chop veggies, nuts and even cooked meats in seconds. You can chop onions without a single tear. It also has a flexible cup which doubles as a chopping bowl. It's handier than a food processor and much easier to clean. It simply pops apart and you can rinse it clean in minutes.

Then I went to amazon and ordered one more for less than 20 dollars. In three months, that one broke too. Both incidents were normal; of course, I do understand that if I hit this hard, it will break. The construction of these headphones, I feel is flimsy.

I have absolutely zero complaints about their audio performance. Can you get a better-sounding headphone at this price point? Probably. But these sound perfectly OK in my opinion.However, these are perhaps the most painful headphones I have had the displeasure to wear. I wear glasses and find that the earcups press my ears into the earpieces. After an hour or so, my ears feel abused.

Bass response was mediocre, not as powerful as my $10 earbuds surprisingly enough. The mids and highs seemed fine. However, these headphones were extremely tight and uncomfortable. I thought it would be good that they are tight and thus would keep a lot of sound out (which they do, but at a cost). After maybe 30 minutes to an hour my ears were aching a lot, so much that I had to take off the headphones and rest my ears for a while. With glasses it is even worse.

Koss rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 days old and BROKEN","review":"These might be nice headphones, can't really tell, THEY ARE BROKEN. there is a little dainty stirrup shaped brittle plastic piece that holds the \\"reversible\\" earpiece to the headband. This piece is not sturdy enough for adults and I'm sure children would snap this earpiece/earphone off. It is under pressure when the headphones are worn, and this is the weakest link when it should be the sturdiest! I am tired of repairing headphones, I would not advise these headphones to anyone who wanted to use them more than a couple days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst headphones I've ever purchased","review":"Like another reviewer said, these are pathetic if the music has ANY bass to it.

I brought them home and plugged them in with high hopes, and was sorely disappointed.The moment they touched my ears I knew it was trouble. Only buy these headphones if you like pain to go along with your music. The ear-cup foam is very hard and the headband is far too tight. Extremely uncomfortable.As for the sound - they are worse than the set that came \\"free\\" with my portable CD player. Weak bass, muddy vocals, no highs.These are Poser headphones. They look vaguely like the high end studio headphones used by sound engineers, but the similarity ends there.Not Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"muy malos","review":"la verdad ami no me gustaron estos audifonos. son mejores los sennheiser.la voz no esta tan clarita conparados con los sennheiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the price","review":"These are cheap, and the sound quality matches the price.

Not as comfortable (their major drawback), but with much better sound, and less background noise gets in. I'd definitely advise avoiding the Sonys in this price range.

They worked ok for two weeks then all of a sudden there was no sound coming from the right side. Another thing that is a big negative is that they are so dam big and ugly. If you go out in public with these you look like a out of date dork. Sony has gotten down hill lately with these breaking and a portable cd player i had that broke down in a couple of months. I remeber when sony used to make the best electronics. They were the ones that invented the walkman. There walkmans from the 90s and before were so great i still have one that i got 10 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"Love the quality of the sound I got with this speakers.I love to hear house music and the sound quality is more important to me then high pitch sound.I don't know the technical talk about the headphones but this pair is a good purchase for th money I payed.One thing, the earphone is a bit tight around your head. I had to break the headphones in. This is a minor thing I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy Sound","review":"These are the muddiest sounding headsets I've ever owned. It helpsto add treble to your EQ settings, but that's not a perfect solution,either. It sounds like you've stuffed your ears full of cottonbefore you put them on. Everything else seems fine. Tough cord andconnections, nice fit, but I bought them so I could discriminatesounds. Everything blends together into mush. I'll have to go backand replace these with something else. If all you like is bass, getthem. The lows are bass, the highs are bass, the mids are bass. It'sa bassy mess. I paid $21."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third pair is the last for me.","review":"These headphones are pretty good as far as sound goes - not precise, but balanced. But they don't fold at all, and the earcups are held in place by a flimsy plastic peg in the design, which breaks quite easy, as does the headband. I've had three, then, and all pairs have just broken in normal transit. I'm upgrading to Sennheiser HD 280 Pros or Grados, which have much more robust construction. The cheapness of these guys just doesn't offset the fact that I need a few pair every year or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"break easily","review":"These headphones have really good sound for being so cheap and small, but they break very easily.

I have used them enough that the ear cushions are starting to wear out, but they are still my favorite pair of headphones. They have great bass and sound quality for headphones. You do not need to turn up very high to hear the full range of sounds in your music."},{"rating":"2","title":"About to order my fourth pair!","review":"These are the best headphones for the price. The sound quality is excellent. They can be a little snug which can lead to snapping the plastic of the headband (your new best friend is duct tape) trying to create a little breathing room. But since these are a bit more fitted, they are not going to fall off, slide down or remove themselves from your head with even the most vigorous head-banging. I have a small head so I can wear them for several hours without a break comfortably.I've gone through several pairs because I continually roll over the extra-long cord with my office chair which eventually shorts out the signal. This time, I accidentally bent the connector to that it no longer seats properly in my computer audio port causing it to lose sound quality. That said, the wear and tear on these headphones is entirely my fault. I've been using these headphones exclusively since 2000.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...for the price","review":"These headphones are very good for the price you pay for them. I'm a very loud listener, I've had a pair for around 2.5 years, and they still sound like when I bought them. The long chord is great for computer listening, but can be cumbersome with portable devices. One of the few problems I have with these phones is that they do feel tight after a long listening session, but after leaving them on a stack of books for a couple of days it's gotten much better. Overall, a very good product from my experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I love the headphones and I think they're awesome!They're comfortable, they were priced great and they came on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones that really work","review":"I bought these for my children and they work great!

Bass and mids are terribly muddy and offer no dynamics at all. The trebel is harsh and slighly rolled off.In my opinion unless you want to use the headband for a project these are not worth what it cost to package them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - may cause tinnitus","review":"I bought these to listen to my new Sansa Clip and, yes, they sounded pretty decent, quite bassy and laid back but after listening to them for only a few minutes, I noticed my ears started ringing.

The volume WITH the headphones is LOWER than without them. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but bad material","review":"To start off, there was nothing wrong with these headphones in terms of sound quality, comfort, or price. To some, that's all that matters.What did irk me about these, was the fact that I only got 4 days of use out of them before the cups became detached from the headset, rendering them all but unusable without using liberal amount of glue, tape, and general fixing.I realize that for a cheap pair of headphones I shouldn't be expecting much, but can't I at least get a few months out of a product without it breaking almost entirely?Would not recommend to future customers on that basis. If you're ok with that, then go right ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set for everyday use","review":"Pros: Great Sound, great price, solid construction, long cable, receiver adapterCons: Can get uncomfortable for people who wear glasses.Bought these after reading the reviews. Have been using them for a couple of months. The sound quality is really good. These do sit a little tight over the ears and can be uncomfortable if you wear glasses if worn for a long time. Beats every pair of earphones I ever owned. And since the construction is really solid I don't have to worry about pulling out any wires. Use them exclusively except when I go to the gym. Best value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"These things sucked!","review":"In the past, I have always trusted Sony products. I've had these headphones less than a month and the left side has completely quit working! Since I trusted this brand, I got rid of the packaging, so now I have no way to return them. I guess I'm stuck with them. Next time I'll go straight to the store, that way if something goes wrong it will be a lot easier to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE SOUND","review":"I picked these up to replace my old Sony headphones that I've been using for years because they're starting to fall apart. What a mistake. Beside the fact that they aren't very comfortable, the sound is atrocious. I listened to several different songs to see if maybe it was just the music and not the headphones but to my dismay every song was completely drowned out by bass. Loud, loud, bass. Every song listened to through these headphones is a ton of bass with a faint vocal in the background. Needless to say they are going back to the store and I'll just stick with my old Sonys until they completely stop working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good comfortable headset, but little noise cancellation","review":"I bought this product as an inexpensive headset to wear on airplanes. While it is certainly worth the price, it doesn't do much for airplane noise. It muffles and over-rides noise but limited noise cancellation if you are not playing music. But it was what I expected for the price and did help some. The fact that the product was comfortable was a plus. This is a fair choice if you can't afford the much costlier headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad choice","review":"They are heavy. The sound is lousy.

I sit half my days with these earphones on; they cut the sound significantly. Very comfortable.

Cracked the arm and I'm not sure how much longer they will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for what they are...","review":"To start off, these do sound pretty good. They are not very comfortable, just like every on the ear design. One of the earcups on mine fell off at the hinge, snd I cant get it to stay on anymore, so they are unusable now. I dissected and was a little disappointed to find out that they had the exact same speakers as the set of the cheap sets of headphones that came with walkmans way back in the 90's. The speaker is even set in the oblong shaped plastic piece that is used in the walkman headphones. They basically just put bigger earcups over the walkman headphones, making them more uncomfortable and raising the price.Instead, I would get a set that is big enough to go around the ears for comfort reasons. Something like the Sennheiser HD-202's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than any stupid earbuds.","review":"The headphones have a wonderful sound.

I'd put them in there a long time ago because I couldn't stand the fit. I couldn't really remember the sound, and having upgraded my equipment significantly since then decided to regress a bit and see what they were like again.Really bad. The fit was still terrible. They aren't \\"over-ear\\" at all. They sit on top of the ear and press on it. Glasses make the problems much worse. And they have no sound. No bass, plus those annoying overtones that always show up in cheap headphones and make them sound muddy.I quickly took them off and put my Sennheiser HD 600s back on to sooth my brain. One of the best headphones ever made, and now suprisingly affordable due to the release of the slightly upgraded 650s. Oh, and they're beyond comfortable as well. Huge earpads that don't even touch the ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound, Bad comfort, a little spendy.","review":"If your a gamer DO NOT BUY THESE!

I will say these are by no means audiophile quality, but they are rugged, as i said I've had them over 10 years. I use them when I mow, as well as all other portable applications.

I just went to my local big box electronic store and bought the pair of headphones that looked most similar to my Dynexs, and let me tell you I am impressed.I bought these for about 25 dollars, and they are very nice. Lovely clear sound, though you do have to turn the volume up quite a bit to get the full effect. I've found treble to be represented fairly well, with base coming in just short of it. I don't listen to too much base-heavy music, so this does not concern me.Now, I have a small head and small ears, so the tightness that bothers other users is actually a plus for me. No more headphone slippage! However, the cord is a little thick and bulky, thus detracting from the portability of the headphones.All in all, an excellent pair of headphones for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"These headphones are great.

I must say I was impressed right of the bat the sound is great and not much distortion at normal volume , but raise high and you can hear it get muddy, especially with hip hop beats.

If you are looking for more comfortable headphones that are still durable with great sound quality, and you don't care about price, I would suggest the Bose QuietComfort 15.

Worth getting them if you want hi-fi or they look good to you. Though, I think the HD-202 and the UR15C headphones better. If you're really picky about comfort, I get one of the two I just said.P.S.

The Sennheisers are more expensive but they are wireless so I thought I might get an advantage out of wired. I am no audophile, but I was hoping for an improvement.To my taste these are too tight, and the sound is not particularly good. Maybe I just prefer Sennheisers but of my headphones I rate them as follows:1. HD201 -- much better Sound **** Comfort **** Portability **2. HDR120 Sound *** Comfort *** Portability N/A Range ****2. PX100 Sound *** Comfort **** Portability ****3. MDR-V150 Sound ** Comfort ** Portability **My 12 year old thinks the Sony's are fine and they may be a good cheap headphone for kids.The HDR201's were recommended on many sites, and I thank those reviewers for their advice they are my favorite headphones so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable but muddy","review":"Bought these to replace a pair of old Koss headphones that I use mainly for home recording. These things may look similar, and fit well, but that's it; the only reason they're even getting two stars is that if you have enough time, you can probably find a setting on whatever EQ you're using that sounds passable, but for recording they are horrible. Overall, a very muddy sound, seemingly centered on the upper end of the bass frequencies, and little to no treble at all.These really wreak havok with pretty much any genre of music you use them with; perhaps I have an overly sensitive ear as a musician, but I shouldn't have to eq twice (once while using these as a monitor and then once to correct for them during mixdown). You get what you pay for where accurate sound reproduction is concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound Low Price","review":"Sony always provide good sound quality and these cans do a great job of that.

However, they have almost no treble and the mid-range is questionable. Sony should not be selling these as \\"monitors.\\" They don't come even close. They also squeeze the user's head. My head is on the smaller side, however they give me a headache within a minute of putting them on."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought these on the basis of the reviews, the price and the need to cut down on sound in a mildly noisy workspace.

And they aren't very comfortable either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Headphones!","review":"These headphones Are pretty stellar for the money. I spent a lot of time trying to find an everyday headphone to replace the horrible little ear buds that come standard with so many mp3 devices.The sound quality is really good, and you can't beat simple black for style. My only complaint would be that they fit rather tight on your ears/head - not a deal breaker for me though. The cord is also very very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Hurt the Ears","review":"These have to be the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever owned. They pinch your ears so after a half hour or so you have to take them off. The sound is ok nothing special. I really tried but I just can't use this style of headphone. Might be good for a business who needs cheap headphones on short applications but other than that I can't see who else could really use these. The price is good but in all honesty they are far too uncomfortable to be practical. I'm gonna try out some seinheisser 555's even though they cost a little more I think comfort and sound are worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a week","review":"The headphones were nice. The cord was longer than I needed, but not too bad. The sound in one of the headphones broke in a week. Amazon doesn't accept returns without the original packaging, which I didn't have. It shipped in one of those plastic containers that you have to use scissors to open. I contacted Sony which is what you have to do when their product has a defect like this. It cost an additional $6.00 to mail them the item to be repaired or replaced. The quality was nice and they were enjoyable to use.

Everything I wanted from gamer headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight, muddy sound","review":"I bought these headphones as a replacement for a pair of Sony MDR-XD100s that broke. I found them to be an uncomfortably tight fit on my thoroughly average-sized cranium. Worse, the sound is quite muddy and indistinct. These headphones aren't unusable, but I wish I'd just coughed up the extra $5 for the MDR-XD200s."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF SONY'S BETTER PRODUCTS","review":"With Sony you usually get no more than what you pay for. These headphones don't cost much and they aren't worth much, either. Overall flimsy plastic construction, not sensitive (loud) enough, so-so frequency response. I paid about the same price for a set of JVC headphones that are much better in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad at all","review":"For what I paid I am pretty happy with this product. Decent sound. Pretty light and comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for my purposes.","review":"I just wanted to listen to sound on my computer without disrupting my roommate.

I have had no problem does just what it says it will do. Music quality is nice and crisp I can really hear all the notes.

One reviewer blamed the bad reviews on people not understanding \\"the specs\\" and full spectrum sound, but the problem is the headphones do not live up to the specs they claim and there is no full spectrum sound coming from these headphones. If you don't mind listening to flat listless music then you may not regret buying this item. They may be OK for listening to news reports or book readings but if you are looking for music to sound they way it was meant to when it was produced you had better look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Headphones","review":"The headphones were very poorly made and broke within one use. A small plastic tab holds the earcups in place, which broke. We returned both sets for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but there are far better options, even at $20","review":"This is a decent pair of headphones, but are not nearly as good as some people think. In terms of sound quality, for me, they are unbearable. They have terrible reproduction of just about every frequency, as well as having that terrible closed in soundstage common to cheap closed headphones. Comfort is just as terrible. I defy you to wear these with glasses and not get a headache every single time. Overall, they are not worth the money or even the time it takes to ship them to your house. They sell simply because the brand Sony is well known for being associated with quality products. Quite frankly, if I owned Sony, I would be embarrassed to have my company's name on this product. Do yourself a favor and buy a pair of Sennheiser HD 201s instead. Those are not particularly jaw dropping either, but can be found at lower prices than these and have far better sound quality and comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome headphones","review":"I am hearing impaired have been looking for headphones with great sound. These are perfect!!! Reasonable price, fantastic sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning in a sea of bass","review":"I've only played around with cheaper headphones, the highest end thing I've ever tried being my pair of Koss PortaPros, but even I can tell that the Sony MDR-V150 is a POS. From the lowest of lows to the highest of highs, everything manages to sound indistinct and vaguely bassy.That would be fine and all, but there are many many headphones in lower and higher price ranges that sound better. Even my cheap-o $3 JVC Marshmallows are far clearer than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Build Quality.","review":"I bought this headset on the thanksgiving day. The noise cancellation and sound quality were decent . The main problem for me was from the second week i had build quality problems. The earphone on the left started to come out of the main support frame. Now after two months the 3.5 mm plug pointer came out when unplugged from my system.

I have used earbuds on up to $300 headphones. These are the worst pair I have ever used next to a $3.00 pair I once bought at Walgreens. The design is good, they even look cool, but the sound from these headphones is terrible. In fact, I don't even consider it sound, it's more like noise.

For those sounds, these are great. For listenable music, not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy Waters","review":"I couldn't be more disappointed with these headphones... Plenty of bass and good volume (sensitivity) but NO clarity. Where's the treble and mid-range? Can barely understand lyrics. Maybe I got a bad set, but man-oh-man are these muddy sounding.

I am so happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic Fair sound save up spend about $100","review":"I got these as a X'mas gift to replace a failed set of Apple ear buds I'd tell you a lot about the quality of the sound but as of the second week I owned them the cheap plastic supporting the can on the left side failed so the ear piece now will not stay where it belongs. If I constantly hold it ( Like the announcer Gary Owens from Laugh in days ) then it worksI was suckered in by the cost but you truly get what you pay for. read Ken Rockwell's blog on headphones then spend about $100. I'll leave it at thatlater"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they broke","review":"I was very pleased with these headphones initially - they are comfortable and have great sound for the price. However, after less than a year of ownership and light use, the right earcup broke. The part that prevents it from bending out to the side no longer works, so the headphones won't sit on my head properly. The right one wants to turn so that it is horizontal rather than up against my head. I haven't found an easy way to fix them. Unfortunately, I am now shopping for headphones again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily broken","review":"I received Sony MDR-V150 headphones as a gift, and the sound quality is fantastic. So why don't I like them? Because they're designed to be useless & unrepairable when a small plastic tab is broken off. I did not abuse them, and must have applied a little too much pressure in a certain way so as to break the tiny plastic tab. The next time I went to use them, the left earpiece would not stay in place, rendering them useless. I'm so very disappointed that SONY would design something so easily broken, and unrepairable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly uncomfortable on ears !","review":"Pros :Sound quality is good.Cheaper to buy.Cons :Highly uncomfortable on ears.

Well this is another pair to throw in my headphone drawer. They sound like twenty five dollar headphone! better than some not as good as others. The thing that sets them apart from others in the price range is after you wear them for a short period of time, twenty five minutes or so your ears get unbearably hot,which is annoying and uncomfortable. I gave them a shot and now they are exiled to my file drawer with the other disappointments like the Sennheiser HD 20's and the Skullcandy lowrider camo. (Skullcandy in ear headphones are great sounding). Invest your money in something else other than these sauna cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for the price","review":"I've owned one of these headphones for a number of years, using them with my computer and ipod. They have a great sound range and are comfortable to wear, though the adjusters could easily be obnoxious if you have long hair (which I don't, so this has never bothered me). Really the only thing I don't like about these is that the portion of the cord after the split, leading up to the headphones, has an obnoxious tendency to curl up and get tangled on itself.After several years of use, my pair died; now only the right side actually emits any sound. Even still, I'm planning on buying another set because of the headphones I've used I have yet to find one that matches the balance between comfort, sound quality, and price as these."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't use them anymore","review":"I get headache after using these headphones for more than half an hour so I won't use them anymore.Sound quality is good.

The first 3 days I used them I got a terrible headache and jaw pain from the pressure, which eventually went away. During the second week of use, I noticed the pinna of my ears to be very tender and wearing the headphones is very painful. If I could do it over again, I would not buy theses headphones and save myself the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Tight and not the best sound","review":"I found the Sony MDR-V150 Headphones to be too tight for my head, and I believe many other reviewers share the same view as me. After 15-20 minutes of use, I had to remove them because of the growing pressure against my ears. I ended up with a splitting headache after I used these headphones. And what's more, the sound quality isn't that great either.And I'm not comparing these with in-ear iPod headphones. I'm comparing the Sony ones with on-ear headphones of other make. For example, I previously owned one made by Panasonic, and the sound quality was superb and it was very comfortable to have over your ears. Even the Bose on-ear regular headphones are comfortable and provide good quality sound, although those are a lot more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for iphones","review":"I tried headphone after headphone and had about given up on finding a pair I liked for my iPhone (1g), then I tried these and was amazed. I head nuances of music I had not heard with any of the other headphones (both over the head and earbud). They also have more volume range than the others, allowing lower listening levels without maxing out the volume control. I know some have complained about the fit, but they feel very comfortable to me. Give them a try and see what you think. You may be surprised like I was.

The sound quality is decent, but sounds like there is a slight echo. My Sony \\"MDR-G57G S2 Sports Street Style' headphones produce a much clearer sound than the MDR-V150. These headphones are also very uncomfortable. They feel cheaply made and are made for smaller heads.

Really?","review":"I read the reviews for these headphones, entirely expecting that when I got them, they'd be too tight and uncomfortable to wear - and they were FINE. I'm not sure why there are so many reviews claiming that these headphones are incredibly tight and that they have to be removed after a certain period of time to prevent discomfort - and I never found this to be the case. They fit perfectly, if not slightly loose. I guess that it simply depends on the size of your head, haha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphones I've ever had","review":"I got these about 3 years ago and they still sound and feel fantastic. I don't think they'd ever blow out; I usually have them blasting since I use them while skateboarding. I have long hair and with some other headphones I had problems with hair being pulled out but not with these. Also, I have never really had a problem with the thickness of the cord. I actually like it because it is easier to untangle, but it is a little too long. I usually stuff my pocket with the cord so it stays out of my way.The only problem, which isn't too bad, is that when wearing them for long periods of time like traveling my ears become sore and I have to take a short break. They may be too tight, but it sure doesn't feel like it until you have been wearing them for a few hours.I always suggest these headphones to people. I got them in a store for $20 and they have better sound than some much more expensive headphones I've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad But Hurts My Ear","review":"These headphones are not bad. I loved them at first but then I realized that you can't wear these headphones with glasses because it will start pinching your head until it gives you a headache. So now everytime I use these headphones I just take off my glasses. Overall I think its neat and there isnt a large amount of sound leak. there is one thing that I dislike about this headphone is that if you wear them for too long it will hurt your ears. I dont know why that happens but it just does. But I still use them because I love the sound that comes out of it. I never had headphones like these and I'm very pleased with Sony now. I wish I had an answer for why my ears hurt. That is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent For Price","review":"These headphones produce excellent sound quality for the price. I was a little concerned about buying these headphones because of all the reviews that complained about them being too tight. However, for me they are a perfect fit, they don't hurt at all and I even have earrings. I used these headphones with my two keyboards,(Kurzweil K2661, and Yamaha P90), and I was amazed at the quality of the sound! These headphones definitely exceeded my expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad for $20","review":"I am on my second pair of Sony MDF-V150's. The first pair lasted about two years, most of which it spent in a backpack. I'm using this new pair for DJ'ing and not much else, so I beleive they'll last a bit longer.Sound quality is good, but on a Sony CD/MP3 player, they aren't as loud as some Philips or TDK headphones I own. On the mixer, loudness isn't an issue, and these phones will surely last longer and deliver more sound quality than other entry-level DJ headphones.I readily recommend these headphones to any beginning DJ and to anyone looknig for a pair of decent hadphoens that won't cost a ton. If you are thinking about getting a \\"DJ in a box\\"-type package with headphones that will die in a few months, I suggest that you either build your own system and use these phones, or upgrade ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice sound, good value, a bit tight...","review":"in a nutshell, for the money you can't beat it. i have had mine for 5 years now. they work great. they sound very good - the bass comes thru surprisingly...as others have said it is a bit tight though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life Span","review":"After about 4 months of use (8 hours per week), the right sound channel failed to work.Prior to the failure, I did enjoy the sound quality.Expected the headphones to last longer tha 4 month."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones","review":"these headphones are worth the money! very comfortable to use and the sound system is great as well...money well spent!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good... But Bad","review":"While the sound quality is quite good for the price, the lack of comfort is a huge drawback.

There are definitely better head phones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for the money","review":"I'd been looking for headphones that weren't ear buds and that didn't look like Princess Leia's ear buns, and these fit the bill. The price was terrific, too. I used them on a long flight and they were perfect. The fit was great and I could hear everything quite well. Unfortunately, due to the confines of an airline seat, I accidentally snapped off the connector mid-flight and I had to use the airline headphones. I could really tell how good these headphones were then. The difference between crappy airline headphones and these was astounding. I'm going to buy another pair just to make sure I have them available whenever I need them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pair of Headphones","review":"Great sound quality. That wasn't what scared me, I knew these would be good in that respect. I wanted to have a pair of head phones that were comfortable, so I could wear them for a long period of time.

I have no discomfort, in fact before thinking I should write this review, i forgot I had them on.

I compared them to the Sony MDR7502's, which were easily worth the extra $20. At the right volume for working in a cafe, the middle range of freq was garbled and unsettling.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but the quality difference in sound and build is shocking. The old V150s were rich in bass and built like tanks. The new ones are very hard and plastic-like. They were also really tight on the head/ears (not in a good way). These are getting sent back. I guess I'm back on the hunt for a good pair of headphones. For the price, I suppose they are not terrible, but I'm comparing it with its old self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love 'em!","review":"I got these almost 4 years ago and I still have them. They work great. There is now a little wear on the headphones, but after 4 years, that is expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better that I thought","review":"Ok, I hate anything Sony. I have never forgiven them for starting DRM in the first place. I remember how they did it surreptiously. Real sneaky like with nobody knowing. But I bought these way before DRM. I prety much hated them. That is before I bought a XONAR sound card and plugged these in to see what these things sound like with it. Ok, so they rock. That don't mean I'm not still boycotting Sony, but they do rock. You will experience some clipping if you listen to your music at extreme volume levels with headphones like I do. But then again, I don't recommend you do what I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"plasticy, not sturdy construction","review":"I bought this sony headphones V150 and other similarly priced sony headphone based on my daughter's experience with sony MDR V6 headphone. I will not comment or give my opinion on quality of the sound reproduction as it differs from one person to other person's liking. So, I will talk about the construction quality. This one has bad,bad plastic construction quality. The small plastic piece that holds two pieces, one plastic piece that slides in/out for the length adjustment inside the over head piece breaks very easy. When one try to take off headphone from over ear piece pulling away from ear than the small plastic piece/retainer snap/breaks. Now, this head phone is useless unless you hold those two pieces with some clip. Believe me. with small tension of pulling ear piece to remove headphone away does break this plastic retainer. Because of this I bought Panasonic RP-HTX7 Stereo Headphones. Panasonic one has metal slider piece so never have to worry bout breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm very happy with these head phones.","review":"I agree with some of the reviews that they can be a bit tight but the ear cups are cushioned well and cancels out a lot of surrounding noise.

They have small plastic pieces to hold the cups in place which snap under normal wear-and-tear. I tried to fix them, but couldn't get them to fit right for more than an hour. Now I have to buy a new group of headphones - and it's not going to be these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent sound, very uncomfortable fit","review":"I always wanted to like these headphones, but they just hurt my head and ears too much. I have a pair of Koss Porta Pros that I love, but they don't seal out any outside noise.

First I noticed that if I left them on my ears for too long my ears would begin to hurt. They also don't block out outside noise very well, so that if there is music going on from a television in the background it can sometimes interfere with whatever I happen to be listening to. Most annoying of all though is that the plug for the headphones doesn't fit into my computer correctly so that sometimes if thee plug gets jiggled around or so much as even touch it the sound will mess up getting staticy and losing a track, and I have to fiddle around with the plug for a few minutes to get the sound back on track and after a while doing this get's very annoying.Overall I think these are very poor quality headphones, and that is very dissapointing.But I have to admit they do work and if you don't intend on using them for an extended period they'll get the job done, just don't count on quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"Comfort wise, this is a zero.

Decent for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"I was not expecting these to be great headphones, and they aren't. The sound quality is not that great. There is some scratchiness for certain melodies and notes. For example, Jason Mraz doesn't sound too good. The Black Eyed Peas, however, sound fine. The earcups are not very comfortable, and ear fatigue occurs in less than an hour. That said, the sound quality is better than the tin-like sound that comes out of the laptop speakers. The cups seal decently and this helps minimize exterior noises. The cord plug is plenty long, which is an improvement over my old ipod earbuds. My main impetus for purchasing these was to get an alternative to the earbuds, and they manage that fairly well. If you can find a $20-something model with good reviews, that might be a better purchase. These are what they are. I'm still undecided on whether it was a good purchase or not. Also, I haven't used the larger adaptor plug, so I can't comment on how well that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"plug connection weak and stopped working","review":"After several months of use, the plug stopped working and had a loose connection, so that only one side would work sometimes.They also don't cancel out room noise very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"I love these Headphones for the price you can't get any other headphones with the sound quality of these!Comfort: When i first got them they were tight but after using them awhile they loosen up.Sound Quality: Has the best sound quality compared to other products in its price range.Ease of Use: Uhh plug in and go. lolConstruction quality: The plastic is top quality, earphones pivot to accommodate your ears sticking out a bit.Other Thoughts: Best value for your money, you wont regret this purchase.

I use them for my job and leave them at my desk for daily use. Once they broke (the plastic surrounding the pin broke and one of the earphones fell out) I knew I had to replace them. I was happy to see that they are still available and snagged up another pair. The cord is nice and long so you can stand or move around in your chair with them on. I don't use them on the go so I'm sure thats why they lasted so long. So if you are planning on using them for work, they will last a long time.If you are looking for a cheap quality pair of headphones, look no further. I do prefer the to hear through them if you have them low, which is good for the office. I never turn it up half the way it could go, they are loud. For the comments of them being so tight they hurt. Yes they are snug at first. If you have a bigger head, don't worry, they break in and fit perfect after a few uses.Highly recommend :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but breaks after a bit...","review":"Great headphones, the best I've had in a long while.

I replaced them after two months and am never going back. They really are glorified Walkman headphones, and compared to the Koss KSC-75's with which I replaced them, they sound awfully muddy and unrefined. Portability was poor too, and my head would start to feel clamped after only an hour or two of listening.

Unfortunately, the audio quality was awful. Right out of the box, they sounded incredibly muddy/muffled/dull compared to my well-worn V100s. I went back and forth for a few minutes, between the new headphones and my old ones - the audio source wasn't the problem. Plus the cord was a bit thin/flimsy and too short for me, and the ear pieces felt like they didn't have enough padding.I'm not an audiophile, and I wasn't expecting a lot from headphones at this price, but I just couldn't use these. They were back in the box after about 15 minutes of use and returned to the big box store a few days later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic bracket","review":"The cheap plastic side bracket breaks easily and Sony doesn't provide a replacement, rendering these useless.

Not great; if you intend to listen to CDs of classical music then these are definitely not for you. Fine for mp3 quality recordings.Unfortunately, the headphones are very uncomfortable due to their inflexibility. I put up with it for a few months, never being able to wear them for more than a half hour or so before I had to give my head a break from the compression. At that point the piece that stabilizes one of the earcups broke from normal handling, and now they are essentially worthless. The earpiece won't stay flat against my head anymore.Sony offers no electronic support and their only phone support is not toll-free, inexcusable for such a huge company.

I bought these after testing a few headphones like the Sony's and finding that the sound quality was just fantastic. It works excellent with anything from rock to electropop to hip-hop and back again. I was not looking for a earcup to fully cover my ear and so the noise-cancelling could be better but for the most part its perfect.

I knew at the outset that the plastic portions would be more fragile, so I took care in how I packaged them when taking them anywhere. They still broke in about 6 weeks--perhaps I shouldn't have expected much based on the price. Seriously, don't expect portability. So, if you're not planning on putting them in a bag or taking them anywhere, and only plan to use them at a desk, they're fine for the money.

Perhaps Amazon was not aware of this, but this is a huge misrepresentation. I did not expect to purchase a sexually explicit and sexually bizarre movie. Most Christians try to stay away from watching this type of movie, however, the title is extremly misleading. If I wanted to purchase a sexually explicit movie, I would have purchased one, however, I resent being tricked into purchasing one because the title is Christian in nature. Besides this, the movie is totally depressing after you get past the trashy sex part. What a piece of garbage! Little to nothing to do with the Rapture as a Christian knows it.

Rogers gave a good performance, but the writing was non-Christian and seemed to be somebody's bad dream written into a screenplay.

Mimi Rogers' Mona Lisa demeanor is perfectly cast portraying a woman who lives by the \\"If it feels good, do it\\" philiosophy, yet agonizes over her spiritual emptiness. While that is not an original idea for a movie protaganist,(\\"Looking For Mr. Goodbar\\", anyone?)what ensues following her \\"conversion\\" has little or no precedence in film history.It is nearly impossible to discuss this aspect without turning it into a \\"spoiler\\". Suffice it to say that, if you're famililar with the \\"controversial\\" ending to 1999's \\"Magnolia\\", the final scenes in \\"Rapture\\" appear to have the same polarizing effect on viewers.

But in the process, it ends up taking no position at all about the veracity of religious claims, such as God's existence or the possibility of a Rapture. Mimi Rogers was stiff, but good as the sexpot-turned-fundamentalist. While other viewers were moved by the ending, it left me empty. I screamed, \\"Is that it?\\" Honestly, I didn't find very many clear-headed individuals in the film. Everyone's either walking sex-machines or babbling Bible-thumpers.

It does not really deserve an \\"R\\" rating, but Mimi gives some full frontal nudity in her sex scenes and I don't think it was in the least gratuitous.

Sound quality is okay with no interference to the wireless connection. With interference to the wireless connection, sound quality becomes choppy.

Its like you have to buy the system,put it in your environment,and see if it meets your expectations"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I have used","review":"I have tried a number of wireless speakers and this one does very well. While none I have tried match the quality of wired speakers, this one beats my expectations. The sound quality is good at normal to loud levels. At extremely loud levels it is a little distorted but I rarely play it that loud. I have the speaker about 125 feet from my source and it there is rarely interference. At distances greater it seems to \\"pop\\" every once and a while. Overall, I would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your system will sound like a distant 100-watt FM station...","review":"I really want to like these speakers -- their overall design is terrific and they look very sharp, they don't take up much space, they can be taken outdoors.That said, they are terribly prone to interference, static and the usual host of ills that plague all wireless speakers to date.These particular speakers can make your favorite CDs sound like they're being broadcast from a very weak, faraway FM station -- slushy and with varying amounts of static.Until a superior wireless speaker is manufactured, you're betting off living with the limitations of speaker cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes too much noise to live with","review":"My wife bought me a Sony Wireless Speaker System as a birthday gift. Actually I helped her select the gift because after all it was for me!. I read some reviews posted on Amazon about this Sony system and most of them said it was 'excellent.' As soon as I tried it myself, however, I knew I had to disagree with them. Sony Wireless Speaker System, if better than others on the market, still makes too much noise to live with even when the speaker is only a couple of feet away from the transmitter, let alone when they are farther apart. I'm returning it today. Hope my experience prevent many other potential buyers from wasting their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much hiss, dropouts, failed frequently","review":"I don't know if a good wireless speaker even exists. Despite being very pricey originally (almost $300) the quality was really mediocre, poorer than FM stereo. If you are looking for high fidelity, wireless is not going to please you, especially not these. A hiss/hum was always present, even at one foot away. When I went outside with the speaker reception was horrible. With just fifteen feet-line of sight, the speakers (i bought two) constantly would emit pops. At about a year the receiver would die and require the plug be pulled beofre it would work again. Eventually it would die faster until the reciever would work for less than 10 minutes, then went out entirely.A wireless set would still be nice, I miss it, but I don't believe Sony is any better than others. Sony also puts only 90-day warranty on a lot of equipment now. Even THEY don't have any confidence in their manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless Speakers needs wires","review":"This speaker is reported to go many feet from source.

I wouldn't buy this unless you have a direct line of site from the base unit to the speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.","review":"First the good news: the actual writing isn't bad, in terms of technical competence. The characters were mostly handled well, both in terms of dialogue and interaction; Major Kira was a bit too hostile, but that was fairly standard for this early in the series, and Odo displayed a variety of intelligence that I don't expect to see from him, but otherwise the book was well enough written to make two separate fairly uninteresting plots passably readable.But that's the bad news: the story behind the writing just wasn't interesting; it's a bad sign when the poker tournament at Quark's is more interesting than the obligatory station crisis.This book was actually written as a collaborative effort between Dean Wesley Smith and his wife, Kristine Katheryn Rush. (Sandy Schofield is the pseudonym they chose for the collaboration.) If you are familiar with (and fond of) the individual work of either of these writers, you might want to try this one. But I can't say that I was overly impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well played","review":"A very entertaining book that gives room for all key characters of Deep Space Nine. Quark's pokergame gathers players from other Star Trek series as well, too bad commander Riker wasn't there. I believe this was a Star Trek debut from the writer, and i must say i am waiting for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"The Big Game is one of the better early Star Trek: Deep Space Nine novels. The poker game is the more interesting part of it, and features players from previous series. Continuity is also here, and the nod to Commander Riker was nice. The Quark-Odo interaction is good, and it's enjoyable. However, the plot with the energy creatures was fairly uninteresting, which led to it getting 4 and not 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"my husband and I ordered this ring for our wedding bands.

A cheap $... pair of headphones can be purchased at any electronics store which will produce a bit better sound quality (but no microphone.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good speakers, bad microphone","review":"Good solid speakers with the quality you could expect from a low cost Yamaha product. The sound is even better if you plug them into the base of your external powered speakers or system. The microphone, on the other hand, is of a very bad quality.

The Capitol material is good, but some songs suffer from overproduction - particularly those from the \\"Pretty Baby\\" and \\"Cha Cha de Amor\\" sessions. The inclusion of the entire \\"Bells Are Ringing\\" soundtrack is questionable, since Dino doesn't perform on all the film recordings. Apart from those criticisms, \\"Return to Me\\" is an ideal collection for Dean Martin completists.

At first, only the PDA worked, eventually I got the digital camera card reader to work, and sometimes the burner would work. The scanner never did. I could not reach Linksys customer service on the phone, and their web site was down every time I tried for support. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I returned it to Amazon (thank you Amazon for your terrific return policy) and subsequently bought an almost identical Belkin hub, which worked great the first time I plugged it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good choice","review":"This hub/router was a snap to setup and get working with my Win 2K.

After several reboots I was able to get one device working at a time, however it's pointless having a USB hub unless you can connect more than one thing to it!Needless to say I have repackaged it and sent it back.

I bought 3 batteries (like $1.95 each), yet paid $15. in shipping. The envelope came showing it really cost $2.19. The sellers comments on the Sellers Review page explains that Amazon sets the shipping rates, and that the seller reduced the cost of the batteries to compensate. Wow. If that's true.... thanks a bunch Amazon!!! Several customers complained about this, and the Seller responded each time with the above explanation.Anyway.... it's still worth it (even if Amazon is screwing us), since one battery at Radio Shack was going to cost me about $17.00 (and that did not include shipping).

Respecting and trusting in the name, several years ago he purchased the multi-purpose articulated ladder. He was very disappointed when he found out that, to open and close it, each lock must be released individually to go through one motion, until the ladder is fully extended. It is so awkward to open and close that it is analogous to wrestling an alligator. As a result, the ladder has not been used, and has become a dust collector. The comparable ladder, called \\"The Little Giant\\" by Wing Enterprises, Inc., is far superior. He uses \\"The Little Giant\\" on a daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Porsche Bible","review":"As a Porsche owner and enthusiast, we fall into two camps when it comes to our cars: 1.

It's the kind of album that sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement. That's what this band was good at. How did they become the Grateful Dead of indie rock? The mind boggles.

It is, in fact, their first record, and it is obviously so. This came out before the Car 7\\", which I remember hearing on the radio when I was, like, 9. You have to take into consideration the whole hair-band backlash that went on in the Northwest, particularly Seattle, at the time...we're talking like 93-ish. This record is a really stripped-down, kind of folkish grunge. In retrospect, it's kind of funny that it took bands like Modest Mouse and Death Cab For Cutie sooooooooo long to rip these dudes off. Unlike all other BTS, yet still pure brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"It all began with this.","review":"This CD is the first cd I bought by BTS many many years ago. I loved and love it. They have changed, however this still holds a great deal of quality. Very lo-fi. On a personal note there are a mere few songs that can bring me to tears. \\"Hazy\\" on this album is one of them. After riffs etc with those I've care deeply for, ie those who are more than friends, I have had occasion where I played this and \\"Hazy\\" brought be to a pure raw sobbing. HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an acquired taste - give it time","review":"Built to Spill ROCKS! These are creeper hooks.

It creeps up on you, then you are so hooked you can't get it out of your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Park City is tone deaf","review":"After Treepeople, then BTS, then Halo Benders, it seems shockingly clear that Doug has talent. This first album by BTS changed the sound of rock the world over. I attended their first show, having just returned to Seattle and never having heard Treepeople, and I was floored. This is the only BTS album I'll never, ever grow tired of, because it's a bit less polished than his others, and it better reflects the transition between the angry Treepeople sound and the sweet lament of BTS's later work. Go buy it, then buy God Don't Make No Junk (the first Halo Benders album), and then go back and buy K Records re-release of Guilt Regret And Embarassment (Treepeople). If you're lucky, you'll be able to find a Toxic Shock release of this Treepeople album, as it has about three times as many tracks as the K release."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll grow on you","review":"This is my fourth Built to Spill album, and it has really grown on me. I bought it a few weeks ago and was not too sure what to think of it at first. Now I love it. It is not an easy album to listen to, but many of the songs are brilliant with some great hooks and creative musicianship.This album is most definitely alternative.

It kind of felt like someone was trying to tear my ears off after two hours or so. When headphones become this uncomfortable, they become very noticeable.

This is a fairly common issue with songs so long, but I mention it because a few of my favorite parts (particularly on Duel of the Fates) were excluded. Secondly, make sure before buying this music that you can handle very large chords. I've found myself needing to modify some chords because they are simply too wide for me.

However, I wish the the beginning of the tour had started off a little smoother. Now, about Rhea and Marcus ..... this was a thrilling relationship from the start. Nevertheless, if Marcus admitted his feelings for Rhea sooner this would have turned out to be the most exciting and blissful union, I ever read about.Trinidad was truly a romantic setting for Marcus and Rhea , but I truly think that the Author should have thrown them together more often and also allowed them to visit other places on the Island,and even get a taste of the interesting Night Life,(Night Heat).

All in all, this book is very awkward to read and makes it difficult to care for the couple with their constant talk about how it is their duty to associate with us mere mortals who look up to them.

The lover in question is a former flyer in the WW II British airforce, who cannot seem to understand that the war is over and he is not a hero, and her older, weak-willed husband allows the two of them to walk all over him.

This went on for so long that I genuinely thought that there wasn't going to be any dialogue, just a succession of flashbacks with that terrible music laid over the top.Finally, the music abated and led into an hour and a half of complete misery with iceberg slow, laborious cinematography. This would include in the main part the Rachel Weisz being filmed sitting or standing in a drab 1950's bedsit, usually smoking and looking thoughtfully into space/out the window.

Hester is not someone you sympathize with, you want to smack her. Freddie is just as bad, and both are immature prats. The pacing is off as well, the payout of their sexual tension comes too soon, and the use of flashbacks is confusing and jars an already awkward movie.Watch if if you want to see Tom and Rachael naked.

Rachel Weisz is exquisite, as always... as she plays this vulnerable role to the hilt, and her co-stars Tom Hiddleston and Simon Russell Beale are nothing short of the perfect counterparts. All of them offer up flawless performances - each fueling the others further and taking their characters deeper and deeper as the story gets more involved.

It is a waste of time I ended up buying another video called \\"Bounce back Fast\\" and the lady who made that video was very thorough and instructional so I would go for that one instead of this one. You can exercise with the other video if you like, but do not waste your time with this video like I did because all it is, is some physical therapist showing you clients sitting up to show you how to find the bulge."},{"rating":"1","title":"diastasis recti","review":"Well produced.

Katharine has come a long way from IDOL,.....oh brother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SMASH is a smash!","review":"I loved SMASH on NBC last spring, and I was so happy to see it available at the bargain price of $14.99 on Instant Video. The digital format is high quality video as well as audio, and allows you to cue up to any number if you don't want to watch the whole episode. Very nice escapist fun to relax to after work. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Instant Video","review":"I was very excited to see that Amazon had Smash for sale as Instant Video, until I discovered that it won't play on either of my Samsung Smart TVs. Apparently the TVs are too new. Amazon is definitely losing business from me until they get this updated. The odd thing is, they are almost 2 years behind on updating their service. Amazon says Instant Video will not play on 2011 or 2012 Samsung TVs... Hmmm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of faux reality shows.","review":"I suppose people that like \\"Glee\\" may like this show. I how every am not a fan at all.

Maybe this is why I don't watch regular TV or cable anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to watching Smash, so I was doubly disappointed in not liking it. The writing and situations seemed forced to me, like they were either trying too hard or not enough. I also didn't feel anything for the actors themselves. Overall, a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashingly boring","review":"Not sure what the hype is about. It's only 1 show in (so far). The first episode was beyond boring. I tried watching the whole thing but the characters seemed very cliched and unoriginal. No one really grabbed my attention. The singing is good, but the somewhere over the rainbow has been heard again and again with katherine mcphee singing it -- again nothing new or original about her rendition. The story line (thus far) seemed contrived and unnatural. Will I be watching another episode? Probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"must!must!must!","review":"This is a must!!!Love the show so glad we can get it for your own house!!! Don't hesitate just order!!!

Mr. Spielberg And Company Have Crafted A Unique Drama.","review":"Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.When I saw the promo for this show, I though, \\"A TV version of the film Chicago,\\" but as I continued watching, I saw that it's more than that. It's Singin' In The Rain meets All About Eve coupled with a unique prespective on show business. Plus, it stars Debra Messing, Katherine McPhee (who is extradorinarily beautiful and has a lovely voice), Jack Davenport (Commadore Norrington in the Pirates Of The Carribean movies) and Academy Award winner Angelica Huston. Besides, Mr. Spielberg himself is behind this drama (he's an executive producer) and THAT, my friends, sealed the deal for me. Anything that has Mr. Spielberg has his name on (with the exception of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Super 8 and the Transformers films, having had to sit through the abominable first installment) I'm willing to give a shot. I recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I look forward to watching this show every week. The music is amazing, the acting (mostly) great, and I don't care how much you try to twist this show to compare it to Glee but it's on a completely different level. The DVD is cool but I'm holding out for the Blu Ray.

The sights are very accurate, when using the appropriate care and expertise.4. The needle glides easily into position and remains relatively steady.Cons:1.

It is the scale etched into the plastic that made me reject the Suunto compass. If you zoom in on the image you will find a 1 : 25000 scale. However, most USGS topo maps are 1 : 24000 scale. I want to avoid taking a grid reader with me when I go hiking (always take a topo map).

The size allows me to reduce the number of trips I have to make to our compost pile. I sometimes don't empty the container for 3 days and it has never emitted an odor. In addition, it's light weight, making it easy to carry even when filled to the brim. Once emptied, I give it a quick rinse and it's ready to go. The only thing I would have preferred is a choice of colors, but that's not a major issue since everything else about the product is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine at First...","review":"Had it for two years and loved it at first. Now, despite constant filter changes, scrubbing with bleach and air/sun dryouts, IT STINKS. Literally, the plastic has absorbed odors which are impossible to eradicate.

NOT worth $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak lid tabs","review":"I don't know how the other purchasers did it but I broke one of the lid tabs on the first attempt to put the lid on the bucket. It didn't even bend the slightest bit, it just broke! I realize that this is not that expensive compared to other kitchen compost bins for sale here, and honestly it is not that different from the tuperware we were already using for kitchen scraps, but come on...I was able to make a quick-fix and I guess that will work until we get a better compost bin. However, I do see several open spaces that would allow fruit flies to get in. I will use it for a week and let you know how it works for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise!","review":"I got much more than I had anticipated as I read these stories of inhabitants and former inhabitants of Mystic Ridge.

I have been working with Feng Shui and did not venture into Vastu Shastra because of it's complexity.

It is sometimes very funny, sometimes very arousing, and manages to show that intragenerational misunderstandings can be as profound as intergenerational and interethnic ones.

For a free book it was okay. I liked the Josie Bates character but had a problem with the writer's not drilling down to give me a better development. The pace to me was too slow. I overlooked the editing problems but couldn't overlook the basics of scene to scene consistency. There were a lot of instances where scenes were lacking emotion and scenes overplayed. There were scenes that didn't need to be there at all and left me wondering why the writer bothered. But it was a free book and not a bad read just had problems for me that were unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable So Far","review":"I'm only about halfway through this book so far, but I'm very much enjoying it. The writing style is excellent, the story is solid. I will post more when I finish, but all in all, I would absolutely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legal Thriller","review":"I'm usually not big on legal thrillers, but this one held my attention. I loved the court room scenes. I liked the idea of the lead character, Josie, dealing with her issues of being abandoned by her mother. I loved the emotional struggle within the book and how when she goes into the court room, she has to push through her personal problems and get the job done. I feel that this was very realistic and it was an original and good plot.The descriptions were good. The reason I'm giving it four stars is that I felt some of the dialogue didn't flow well. I do feel that I was right in the book with how things were described.I'm a sucker for characters who have a tortured past. I love the emotions and things written out, and this author did a great job of that. I will definitely read more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Great read! the book had me hooked from first page to last...that Linda is a piece of work, that's all I'll say about that chick. I felt immediately sorry for poor Hannah, but was angry with her at the same time when the truth began to unfurl. Kip was such a b*tch,ugh he got on my nerves, weak self! Josie was a great attorney and she did a great job on the case while having to face and deal with her own personal demons surrounding the entire circumstance. Loved Archer's strong character and the relationship he had with Josie. Only had a couple quirks with the book itself and one was the formatting not breaking as it should between the chapter, the other was the \\"stereotypical\\" portrayl of the one black character Miggy, hence why I gave it four stars instead of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"just pathetic","review":"This over hyped drama relies on Court procedure and legal practice to support the basic premise, and the author is dead wrong on multiple occasions... from the opening scene to the end. (I will not give away the ending but there is no clever plot twist- it is absurd). The book's story line is so implausible as to be an embarrassment to those that gave it 4-5 stars... the story telling is long winded and I could barely finish. There are so many cheap plot contrivances that the intellectual level of the book is probably for high school level readers. I cringed at the absurdity of the author more than once. That she would brag that he husband is a judge is all the more reason for disdain. Even TV shows get the legal procedure more accurate than this author does. Do not read her other books if they are set in a courtroom or involve a criminal trial. Hogwash is too kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well played out plot.","review":"The author keeps you engaged with the story from the first paragraph.

Captivating from the start, it remained interesting to the end. I would definitely read more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Legal Thriller","review":"What I didn't like:The protagonist is so driven to save her client that she drives everyone else away. There are not a lot of likeable people in this book. I wish the hero had been more likeable.What I liked:The story is gripping, especially once the trial starts. There's enough action to keep the story moving at just the right pace. The plot unfolds nicely and the characters are well-developed. The climax is a real page-turner and the ending is satisfying.I'm glad I read this book. I really like the genre and there don't seem to be a lot of books like this around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"It was a good story for a holiday read. This was the first time I had ready anything written by this author and I would read others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostile Witness","review":"The Hostile Witness is a surprising legal thriller. The story is fast paced and easy to read. The plot is well thought out. And far from being boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"Character development was important and believable. Definitely a page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing until the end!","review":"Rebecca Forster does a great job keeping the reader on edge. About halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down. She does a great job keeping the suspense up throughout, adding drama along the way. Although the plot is not terribly complicated, she does an excellent job keeping you guessing.The story takes place between San Diego and Santa Monica involving a cast of characters that she brings to life. The story involves the trial of a juvenile who allegedly set fire to a home where someone dies (her step-grandfather) and the good lawyer, Josie Baylor-Bates, sets out to find the truth even when others want the truth buried. She also addresses other issues such as domestic abuse, child abuse, and child abandonment but doesn't overly dwell on the topics.I would read another Forster novel. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys police or law procedurals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostile Witness","review":"Quick read. Story line gets the reader involved early in the book. Interesting characters, especially liked the main character. Surprise ending. Will read other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written murder mystery","review":"Well written, and she kept me in suspense. This is my first Rebecca Forster novel and I'm glad to have discovered her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thriller--on the edge of my seat","review":"I generally don't review books and I have been reading mostly the free downloads from the Kindle. This was also a free download but I was pleasantly surprised that I couldn't put it down. The book reminded me a bit of the character in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", with her issues, piercings and roughness. Although I don't think the trial is really realistic, it still made for entertaining reading, wondering who really did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostile Witness","review":"The story is good. Sometimes the dialogue gets a bit much, especially when characters argue. They go on and on and keep saying the same things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostile","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book so much I couldn't wait to find everything I could by this author! It flows perfectly without a doubt! I would recoment this book to anyone that loves legal thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostile Witness","review":"The story line as well as the characters kept me interested. I am a psychiatric nurse and the girl with the obsessive compulsive traits and the cutting behavior was done well. It gave the reader some insight into to why these personality changes occured. The book made the reader hate the mother which I think means they did a good character development. I enjoyed it and have started the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not great...","review":"I can't put my finger on what holds this back from being great, I'll likely read more of this series, and maybe even more of this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"Great read lots of twists and turns really enjoyed this story. Would recamend to all my friends. Thriller to be read by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read!","review":"This kept me entertained from start to finish and the ending left me dazed! Amazing story line and fantastic characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Though I really enjoyed this book, it started out slow and took me sometime get into it. I must admit, that I was disappointed at how Josie was described as a strong woman that could hold her own, but yet she seemed to shrink away from Linda and couldn't stand up to her or even protect herself in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced legal mystery","review":"In the genre of Scott Turow (but not quite at his level), this is a fun read with good suspense about the outcome. Very believable and likable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"Once I picked this book up I could NOT set it down. I finished it in two days and that's only because I work 8 hours a day. If you are one for legal thrillers, this is an awesome book. I loved the characters, ecspecially Josie. I could picture her in my head throughout the whole trial and I just wanted to get up and yell \\"YOU GO GIRL!\\".I chose this book based on good reviews and, honeslty, because it was free (now knowing how good it was I would have definitley been willing to pay for it). I have spent &15 and $20 on books that didn't even compare to this. I really enjoyed this book and already purchased the next in the series, Silent Witness. Can't wait to see what else Rebecca Forster has!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far.....MOVIE WORTHY","review":"Ok, truth be told, I am only 43% along in this book, but it is excellent! Well written, great story line, can't wait to finish! Will update upon completion.Finished the book now - still think it would make an excellent movie. I enjoyed the book. Like other commenter(s), never heard of this author before but, I as well, enjoyed this one so much I have ordered the rest of the series too. Also, didn't care for the ending either, but great read overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Had Such ATime Finishing A Book","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book! Has to be the most disjointed, poorly orginized books I have ever read!! After this experience, I dont ever plan on reading anything written by Rebecca Forster again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hostile Witness Review","review":"Very good read. I didnt know what was coming next, suspense was high. I recommend this to anyone that enjoy short, simple, thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Hostile Witness was a good book. It kept me interested all the way through. The ending could have been better, but it wasn't horrible, and I think reading the book was worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"three words, a waste of time, the bottom number on my book list, and I would not recommend this to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"i was not even able to finish the book. it was horrid. bland writing. im glad this book was free."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],H={key:0},N={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",R,[(a(!0),i(y,null,p(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),f(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-9a15f8bc"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/47.md","filePath":"quotes/47.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/47.md"},L=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
