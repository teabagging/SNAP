The book by Smith and Guillen portrays the police who chased the killer for so many years, and also explains some of the mistakes they made, partly because they had never had to deal with a situation of this magnitude before. It is a very interesting book. However, I did find lots of typos in the copy I had, which was paperback. The person who checked for errors did not do a good job. No book should be released with typos in it today. Some of the victims' names were misspelled. For instance, Shawnda Leea Summers' first name was spelled Shawanda.

Reading the articles makes me question if any of the writers have ever been entrepreneurs themselves.Each issue also contains an article with \\"tips\\" from the \\"Esquire Guy,\\" which is usually full of tripe targeted towards cubicle dwellers. As an entrepreneur, I find these articles offensive to those who have shunned the 9-5.The other characteristic I find useless about this magazine is the persistent stream of topical articles about guys who have developed some random smartphone app. These apps are never practical to business owners and the articles are snoozers.I honestly wish this magazine would improve and publish more useful information since it has become one of the de-facto representatives of entrepreneurs to the outside world."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW.....","review":"It took a very long time for the 1st issue to come.

Sorting through hundreds of recipes on web sites to find one really good recipe had become tedious and frustrating. Additionally, even great general cookbooks only contain a few solid recipes for fish. So I was very pleased to find this book. My wife and I have cooked five recipes so far and they have ranged from really good to \\"off the charts\\". The gourmet recipes usually combine Asian elements with something European and they usually include a unique sauce and an interesting side dish. Preparations are involved but you do not need to be a master chef to do a good job with the content. It does take some diligence to track down some of the ingredients and you will want access to plenty of fresh fish.

I keep the Ipaq in the style sleeve that it came with, and this slides nicely into the case. It is very well-protected and has survived a drop or two and some rain exposure. The belt loop is secure and won't mess up your belt. Another plus is that the flap will not let the stylus fall out, even if your ipaq has \\"loose stylus syndrome\\". Facing the Ipaq towards yourself rather than out lets you use the angle and the grooves of the speaker to quickly pull it out of the case. It is possible with practice to have the Ipaq drawn and ready to use within fractions of a second. On the downside, the velcro is finally shot (probably from quickdraw practice), so I need to order a new case. The edges also show wear.

Unfortunately, Phillip Steele hasn't managed to do this. Slim and poorly researched, errors abound in this book to the point where one wonders if Steele interviewed Marie Barrow Scoma before or after her death. Some of the photos are even wrongly captioned.

Unfortunately, this is not a book I can recommend as meeting either of those requirements. It's clear that the author (actually, the co-author, as Clyde's late sister Marie is also credited) pursued this project with a good deal of heart. The greater is the pity, for this falls short as history, as criminology, or as a study of the two Depression era bandits. This book shows signs of being hastily produced; with greater time, it could have been a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Written!","review":"I wanted to like this book. It was written by family of Clyde, so I thought that it might have some interesting insight into the minds of the two notorious criminals. But the book skipped from event to event without going deeper into the whys AT ALL. I did not enjoy this book one tiny little bit. I thought the writing was stilted. I thought the story lacked emotion and didn't get us involved with the characters at all. There are MUCH better books on the subject out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As in-depth as a high school book report","review":"The author of this book had such an opportunity to bring a fresh perspective on Bonnie and Clyde to the reader, but instead, he just rehashed the same information that is already out about Bonnie and Clyde. I thought I would read commentary on how family members felt during Bonnie and Clyde's crime spree. I thought I would get to read what family said to each other and to the public during B & C's life and after their deaths. I imagined that they would talk about what was in Clyde's mother's diary. Fat chance! This book does none of that. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HISTORY CRIME BUFF","review":"Marie Barrow the youngest of the Barrow children decided to tell her story regarding Bonnie And Clyde and brother Buck Barrow but unfortunately she died within 60 days of meeting her co-writer at the age of 81. The result was mainly rehashed stories that I had read in other publications. Not enough of her personal story was included which I attribute to her untimely death. To bad the book did not go real deep into Marie and her families personal perspective. I feel the co-writer felt he had to complete the book with recycled stories"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here.","review":"Why Marie Barrow thought the world needed yet another book about Bonnie and Clyde is a mystery in itself. Basically, it's 146 pages of a little sister's adulation for her big brother. The tone of the book has Marie almost reveling in her sicko sibling's accomplishments, i.e., death and destruction, and she [Marie] never seems to be without an excuse for every demonic deed. Meshed in here and there are various family photos of both the Barrows and the Parkers, turning it into a bit of a psychotic family album.

In the end, through his own ingeniuity and moral choices, he finds not only his actual father but a genuine father figure: The reluctant wanderer who ultimately does the right thing.I think this is a fantastic book.

Oliver, who was bornexactly at midnight, gets kidnapped by Captain Scratch to help find treasure that's supposedly guarded by ghosts. Scratch drafted young Oliver for the job because it was said that people born exactly at midnight can see ghosts.

The story is the traditional type. A bored young boy finds adventure on the high seas when he becomes unwillingly entangled with pirates. Sound familiar? I found myself constantly reminded of Treasure Island while reading this. If you're just looking for a pirate tale, you'll do better to pick that up.However, if you've finished Treasure Island, and absolutely loved it...if you're stomping around the house shouting \\"Shiver me timbers!\\" and \\"Avast there, matey!\\", then you'll find this book to be enjoyable enough. Just don't expect anything too memorable or thrilling. An acceptable light read. It should be noted, too, that the book may appeal more to middle school boys than it did to me. I certainly am not within its target audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the newest but still works great!","review":"I'd been using Leadtek TV tuners for a long time and really like the included software - WinFast PVR.

You'll learn how (not) to invest in the stock market, get a job, buy a house, and keep up with the Joneses next door (by stealing from them when they're out). Learn how to save money by getting your kids to go to inexpensive colleges, which also takes the pressure off on their getting high grades.

Some of his humor is a bit juvenile but overall his books are generally worth the money. This one was no different and there were several laugh-out-loud sections, particularly when he discussed purchasing a car and his opinion of several cars, including the Aztek (the \\"Buttmobile\\"). His vision of the corporate world was also hilarious to me as I was one of the many individuals who suffered when Coca-Cola decided to change its formula; I mean, what were they thinking???

This book offers great insight as to what all parties are thinking in certain situations and also provides reasonable solutions to the challenges we face in the workplace.

I'm not a great lover of mint and the smell of all these minty fresh toothpastes tend to make me nauseous. I bought Aquafresh Extreme Clean just to check it out and WOW am I glad I did.

Ms. Eisler turned Chopin into a whining fruitcake, when in reality he was quite the opposite. Also, Ms. Eisler credited several myths about Chopin as fact (such as his homosexuality, when there is no proof whatsoever that Chopin was gay). On top of all this, the book was incredibly dull and slow. I got 2/3 of the way through this book before I slammed it shut in disgust. If you want to read an interesting biography of Chopin that let's his true personality come through, read \\"Chopin\\" by George Richard Marek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read many biographies of Chopin, in addition to his letters, and found that there were many errors in this book. In the beginning of the book, Eisler presents a diminutive Chopin at 5', sitting on the piano next to the outgoing 6' tall Franz Liszt. Chopin was actually 5'7\\", an average height at the time, while George Sand, his companion, was only 5'. That visual cue colors the rest of the biography, portraying Chopin as a tiny weakling who was dominated by George Sand. I also found that she editorializes more than the better biographies, adding her own bias in a \\"creative\\", way. While all biographers do this, they usually have better research to support their storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost like being there","review":"I've been riding motorcycles for 21 years and this video says it all.

The music was some of the best traveling music I've heard in a long time.For those of you who haven't been to an event like this, the video captures the pure sense of what riding motorcycles is all about.

Auto-Landing (I don't know about you, but I personally prefer to land by myself, the real thing)2. Not large playing environment.3.

Well, I am sorry to say that this game falls way short of delivering even a fifth of what that game delivered. While the graphics are fine, the actual game play is....well.... just not right, as for the carrier landing after the mission, they are a joke!

And it's hard to steer the plane and you can easily crash into the sea without even noticing.I also don't like how every time you have to destroy a ship or refuel they turn it into a \\"mission\\". For example when early in the game you have to keep shooting at a ship until it sinks, but you have to be in a certain range on the map so when you enter the range the screen fades out and then in and your repositioned to face at the ship and when your done the same thing happens. It would have been much cooler if you could have just approached shot at it and turned around on your own.Probably the one thing that I like most about the game is if you miss the explosion it shows up on your little screen inside the cockpit or when you fire a missile."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game Sucks!","review":"This game is the most generic looking and boring game I have ever played!This is like someones first attempt at making a video game.I had more fun playing the flight simulator on Activision Anthology.Every level is practically the same!Not enough variaty.The graphics should have been 10X better considering how little is shown on the screen at one time.The only good part is the sound(when using good headphones)and even then the lock-on sound is mixed too loud!Very irritating.I hate this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic gameplay","review":"The game looks good on paper, but it's very difficult to play.

Dr. Sen discusses how the narrowness of self-definition has and does lead to violence among groups who, if they but thought more critically about it, have far more that binds them in common concern than that divides them into antagonistic camps. He also discusses how over generalizing can also dismiss the legitimate concerns especially of minorities. He does this in language that is a pleasure to read and with a mind that is at once incisive and also compassionate. The humor comes from recognition of how easily humans are led away from finding common ground by those who benefit most from keeping peoples divided.This book is a necessary read for anyone who still prizes the ability to think critically and broadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off Topic","review":"Thankfully this book is not very long, so my disappointed is only so deep. It must be said that if Samuel Huntington did not write his \\"Clash of Civilizations\\", then this book would not have written or published. This is an attempt to argue Huntington's theory, which is fine, but in the wrong method.Entitled \\"Identity and Violence\\", Sen covers very little on Identity and even less on violence. Sen states that we all have multiple IDs. He then restates it. And then again. And then again with the added ideal that focusing on one ID is dangerous. He repeats this too many times.What Sen fails to address, recognize or grasp is the concept of an Identity. What is it? Why do we have them? What influences IDs? What are the connections between ID and violence. What is violence? Why is it used? Why is it bad? Is violence bad? Just way too many questions about Identity and Violence are left unanswered, unaddressed, and avoided in a book called \\"Identity and Violence\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Identity and Violence","review":"I felt this book was overly self aggrandizing in a way that academic writing often is. It takes the obvious, couches it in lofty rehtoric and tries to sell the ideas as original and pressing. They may be the latter, but are fairly self evident.

It has an elegant recursive procedureto find the path of a particular location in a world tree.There are other elegant recursive procedures throughout the book. Recursion was a weaknessfor me when I first started to program, but studying Brian Harvey'sexamples I feel more confident in dealing with recursion.I could only dream of being as masterful as Brian Harveyis at recursion.I took a class at Berkeley with Brian HarveyTeaching the SICP book not for this one(He's great).Youcan also experience him on the Berkeley Webcast through the internet.Another program that I really liked was the parse program on page312. I felt it was well organized and very creative.Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting read","review":"Scheme itself is a terse declarative programming language with few (more likely zero) industrial uses. However the important and fundamental concepts in computer science are well demonstrated by the authors here. The book does serve fairly well as preparation for SICP but if that is the books purpose then the authors may as use raw mathematical predicates which is alot easier to read than Scheme code. The library code provided by the authors is vital for doing the exercises and codingwithout these is not considered making the book a weak reference manual. The book is also too long for a single semester course which means you may as well undertake Knuth's volumes if you are in a long course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works ok","review":"We try to keep a charger for our phones in every car.

I have downloaded a couple of clips to my PC. The editing software that comes with the camcorder sucks though. The camera is light and compact. It is alot easier just carrying one camera to video and take pics. The price is high compared to one model below this one.

I have found the image to be excellent when compared to lesser \\"consumer\\" grade camcorders. My only real complaint with the camera is with the manual focus. It is extremely difficult to judge the manual focus using either the viewfinder or the viewing screen. While the auto-focus works very well, any shot that requires a custom close or far manual focus is VERY difficult to set up and requires an external monitor for complete confidence.

We have found every item in this book to be impossible, even the supposedly easy \\"1 Star\\" items. The directions say things like \\"rabbit ear fold\\" but \\"rabbit ear fold\\" is not in the book. There is tons of little niggly folding (19 folds for the tail of a whale) that it seems they could do in fewer steps. They also don't tell you which part you are folding, so you can't use \\"the big picture\\" to do our folding when you don't understand the step-by-step directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This book is well written with easy to understand diagrams. The models range from easy to extremly hard, but most of the animals are high intermediate.Most of the diagrams are so specialized that they can't make other models from the base, but the end result is an elegant model that isn't bulky like other models of this difficulty. I have most of Montroll's and Lang's work,and this is one of the best.The deep sea angler fish is my favorite with a full set of teeth. The binding is breaking apart because I've used it so much. Overall this is a book with the best models!(Watch the binding of the Dover books!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great origami book for intermediate folders","review":"I looked over a lot of origami books at the bookstore, and I chose this particular one because so many people liked Montroll's books. Now I see why.All of the designs in here involve \\"pre-folding\\" where you fold and unfold a part of the paper to get a crease. Later on, as you attempt difficult folds, the creases will be there for you to make the job a lot easier. I liked that a lot.Montroll seams to be a \\"purist\\" using only a square piece of paper and no cuts. So you can see how difficult it gets to make animals such as lobsters and crabs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stock up on origami paper if you buy this book!","review":"My eight-year-old son and ten-year-old daughter have checked this book out from the library numerous times. The folds are challenging, requiring repeated attempts and a copious supply of paper (for practice), but the completed models are outstandingly realistic and satisfying.The authors have provided a lengthy discussion of special papers and wet-folding techniques, but every model can be worked in plain-old origami paper. I'd say that if you've memorized the crane, and if you've worked your way through a couple of intermediate-level origami books (e.g., Kasahara, CREATIVE ORIGAMI), then you've got enough origami experience to tackle the folds in this book. All you need is time, patience, fortitude, and a good supply of origami paper for goof-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Finest Recordings Ever...","review":"The heyday of the Boston Symphony is recorded here in all of it's glory. A feverishly intense Also Sprach is simply electrifying. The tonal quality of this recording is excellent with great balances between sections. Of all of the American recordings ever made of Also Spach this is certainly the one to own...wind solos are beautifully phrased and paced..the orchestra Trumpets are splendid and Steinberg has a geniune idea of when blend is important and when musical ideas have to dominate.Compared to the leisurely interpretation of Ormandy(boring!) you cannot only come up with superlatives for this disc!The HOLST is done very well, without any agogic rubato or mannerisms, Steinberg certainly comes out a giant of a Conductor.

This is down towards the bottom of the pile.The detail is not very good, nor is the sound quality.Mars, one of the more difficult pieces to pull off, conveying menace and vigor, is simply rushed, and not at all convincing. The sound is not well balanced, and the horns are blaring.But neither are the other characters drawn properly. Saturn is a mostly a dirge that rouses to life a few times. Uranus, the Magician, should have some mystery with its power. Steingberg conducts Uranus like it's a musical hammerhead shark. Neptune is more twiddling than mystical delicacy.The whole symphony sounds like the conductor was just going through the paces, without thinking of what the symphony was about.Recommended: Boult, Ormandy, Karajan, Mehta, Dutoit, Maazel, Bernstein, each satisfying in their own way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snowboard Super Pipe Major Disappointment","review":"I bought my 10 year old the Snowboard Boarder Cross Race last week for his birthday and he absolutely loves it!

He was so excited that he took $... of his hard earned money (parking cars at football games) today to buy the new Snowboard Super Pipe. Unlike its counterpart, it does not work as advertised. This was a big surprise since most lego products are absolutely wonderful (fun to build and play with). It's impossible to get the snowboarders down without crashing or going over the edge.

What I like best is that Diodorus, unlike the others, tells what was happening in Greece and Rome at the same time.Diodorus wrote 40 books of history, of which Books 1 - 5 and 11 - 20 survive. Each of the 12 Loeb Library books reprints one and a fraction \\"books\\", so the numbers don't match up. If you like myth, I recommend starting with Loeb Vol 1. If you prefer history of real events, begin with Diodorus 11, which is roughly Loeb 4 or 5.The Loeb volumes give the Greek on one page and the translation on the facing page. Since I don't read Greek, it would be nice in Penguin would do a paperback with just the translation, but I haven't seen one yet.Rick Norwood"},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys rock!","review":"Their unique type of music is phenomenal.

ITS AWSOME!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic series that's back on track","review":"All in all, this is an exceptional title with few downsides. It recaptures that feeling that some of us thought might be lost when the 64 games became available. It's challenging but not frustrating to the point where you want to throw your GBA against the wall. It's a lot like Symphony, but it's different enough so as not to be a clone of that Playstation classic.

I have been a fan of Castlevania since the first one, and I've watched the series grow and evolve, but never disappoint. Circle of the Moon is no different, as it provides a lot of the gameplay reminiscent of Symphony of the Night for PSX, only on a portable platform. True, the graphics are quite dark, but an appropriate light source aimed at the unit will quickly remedy any sight problems you may have with the game.Unless you're blind. Sorry, lights won't cure that.Anyhoo, this game is well deserving of the Castlevania moniker, as it provides the RPG-meets-sidescroller type of gameplay that Castlevania fans lust for. It may very well be the best purchase for the system to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A series of hard games returns with...another hard game.","review":"I admit it.

Eventually I did beat it, years later, after so much practice and hard work I finally beat that last end boss. CastleVania was, and still is to me, the hardest game ever made.Circle of the Moon returns the series to the Belmont family from the other (actually easy) CastleVania game: Symphony of the Night. And guess what? IT'S HARD. And it's just as addictive and fun (and hard) as the first CastleVania.If you'll excuse me, I need to find a bottle of Rogaine for men. I just ripped out all my hair again.

The book is further bolstered by a series of useful maps and a collection of sixty-four color plates that will go a long way to helping readers visualize the highlights of Kyushu if they've never seen them before. If I have a quibble about the book, it's that Mr. Cobbing demonstrates a Kyushu-centric preference whenever competing theories abound (e.g., the name of Fukuoka City may have had its origins outside Kyushu, not locally.) Still, to a Kyushu partisan like myself, that is a very minor weakness indeed.

I'll doubtless buy the other seasons when they are available, There was also an AH series in which the programs were an hour instead of a half hour, and I hope that they will be available.Forty years on I can still remember the plots of some of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I remembered...","review":"I purchased this collection, happy to have the first season of what I remembered as one of my favorite childhood programs. Unfortunately, this isn't very good in retrospect. Where The Twilight Zone is BETTER than I gave it credit for back in the day (I couldn't really understand the subtext) this pails in comparison.I honestly have only seen two of the discs, and jumped through most of the episodes once the hooky plot had been established. This is third rate Hitch. A really sad waste of talent and effort. It is amazing it went on for six seasons. Maybe some individual episodes aren't third rate silliness. The 'send them to the cornfield' episode is included here. WAY sad compared with how frightened it made me as a kid.Not recommended, except maybe as a rental from the Library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad double sided Disks","review":"The first time disk 3A was bad.

Now, if they can fast track \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" they can surely get on the good foot about Alfred. I mean, really!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Double discs - confirmation","review":"Just to confirm what a prior reviewer assumed - these 3 discs are double sided and it can be fairly annoying to press the button to release the discs out of their case. I wouldn't be surprised if someone may accidentally break a disc.These discs make the prior releases of AHP discs outdated, such as those single discs that came with the old Hitchcock DVD sets from Universal.DVD quality is fairly good and I'm looking forward to 39 episodes with my favorite director."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened??!!","review":"I am torn about how many stars I should give this release.As far as the stories go, they are great. I always lovedthis show, BUT, as far as quality goes.

So far, I've played the first 5 episodes, and 2 of them have frozen up mid-way. This is the same problem I had with their \\"FRANKENSTEIN\\" and \\"MUMMY\\" box sets. Looks like the double-sided discs just plain SUCK. The problem is, you can't really return these discs, only exchange them, so there's no guarantee the next set won't freeze just as bad in a different location. The earlier reviewer that stated it must be the fault of the DVD player couldn't be more wrong. I own 4 machines of various qualities and ages, and these discs freeze on all 4. After this, I won't be purchasing Universal double-sided discs again. The overall picture and sound quality seemed great, but again, who need the frustration of dealing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"\\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\\" is a classy and smart show for those of us who want something different. In many ways the show mirrors \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" with its take on mystery, suspense, science fiction, and fantasy. It also contains a good dose of the creep factor. It accomplishes these things without dumbing down its audience. I'm a female in my twenties and I don't agree with another amazon.com reviewer that young people don't watch classic shows and movies. There are some that do appreciate quality entertainment and I'm one of them. I love watching TCM on satellite. I remember a few years ago when TV Land did run a whole weekend of nothing but \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\\" though it was very rare. I can't wait until the dvds come out, that way viewers like me aren't at the mercy of tv networks."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst dvd package ever","review":"was really excited to see that the classic series' first season was available on dvd. totally bummed out when i threw it in the garbage. disgraceful that universal could take such classic cinema and put it on a horribly constructed double-sided dvd set. got tired of the frustration of seeing half an episode and then having the dvd go back to play on its own (disk 2 was particularly bad). very angry. will never buy another universal dvd again."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT SHOW, POOR QUALITY DVD!!!","review":"please pay attention to the other reviewers that have complained about the dvd's freezing and skipping. they tell the truth. on disc one , the fourth episode \\"don't come back alive\\", the show froze not allowing me to see the final few minutes. maybe it is the double sided discs. my player is a high end denon and fairly new. the episodes i have seen have been great. it has been nostalgic seeing all the old stars in their early roles, too bad this set has all the technical problems!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An original mystery show.","review":"Who else would poke fun at something as dark as murder?

But I have a serious problem with any company that sells me a product that does not work. I actually bought 2 of this product, thinking I somehow got a freak defective set and just ordered another one and paid for them both. But neither of them play without an occasional freeze up during playing, and one of them just flat will not play all the way through. I'm not a penny pincher and I don't have time to go running to the post office every time somebody rips me off, so they can have my money that they stole from me.

I can't say, since the information about the recording is practically nonexistent.If you also want good information about Shostakovich's Leningrad Symphony (Symphony Number 7) forget this recording. There is practically nothing about the symphony in the notes. There is plenty of information about the conductor, along with a picture of the conductor on the cover and some artwork that has nothing to do with the composer or the circumstances of the time when the Leningrad Symphony was composed. I purchased this recording to replace an older two-LP recording of the symphony made by the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leonard Bernstein and now I regret purchasing this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bruch, very good Mendelssohn","review":"In my opinion, this 1980 rendition of Bruch\`s most famous concerto for the violin, without doubt, ranks in my top five regarding this opus. Yes, I realize that the orchestra does tend to be a little too front-and-center at times. However, this does not detract from the overall performance and result: an expansive and luscious reading of this concerto.Although not as memorable as the Bruch, Mutter\`s Mendelssohn performance with HVK and the Berlin is quite consistently fine throughout. The Andante, clocked at 9 and a half minutes, is heartbreaking, and is undoubtedly the highlight of the concerto. A few other performances of the Mendelssohn do top this one. The one which comes easily to mind is Chung/Dutoit/Montreal on Decca from 1981, which is the frontrunner."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"I WAS READING GOD IS GONNA MAKE YOU LAUGH WRITTEN BY BISHOP NOEL JONES AND HE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK AND IT IS DEFINITELY A GREAT READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"24\\" Deluxe English Ivy Ledge Garden","review":"This plant looks so real because it is so full and fluffy.

I bought it on vinyl when it first came out in 1981 and have sought it on CD ever sinde CDs became available. (I even looked for it when I was in Japan.) The recording is gorgeous, so if the remaster is any good at all, this will be a sonic treat. The music and performances are also top notch--my favorite Akiyoshi-Tabackin Big Band album. A number of the tunes (especially \\"Yet Another Tear\\") have shown up in other iterations on other albums, but the versions here are definitive.If you like big band jazz and were wondering who picked up the torch after Ellington, this should answer the question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"The transfers on this set are very poor.

As others have said, the roll-on applicator is wasteful. But the worst thing about the product is that it really, really smells bad. Like it's soured or something. I hate to even wear it to bed because I know if I can smell it my boyfriend can too. It would be a pretty good product if they could just add something to it that smells good.

I can tell you that it is a brilliant game and definately worth getting! If you compare this game to Mario Kart advance the first thing you will notice is that in terms of looks and visual effects it outrates those of Mario Kart.The second is that the weapons/power ups are more hilarious and creative eg.you can zap your enemies with batteries and frost all the roads with ice (so that they slide out of control).The game features four modes(grand prix,time trial,free run and mini battle).you can also play multiplayer. The characters may be familier to Kanomi fans but others will just have to discover them.The game includes 8 characters like Mistical Ninja's Geomon and Castlevania's Dracula.There is also a hidden character.There will be special coins scattered throughout the 16 courses.Collect them to upgrade your karts.This game is brilliant,you just have to get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I give Krazy Racers a 9 / 10.","review":"GBA Konami Krazy Racers - mini-review This game is basically a 'rip-off' of the Mario Kart racer game, but despite not being a very original idea, KKR is a great game.

I agree with that - I think this game is a definite 9 out of 10, and rivals THPS or IRIDION for best graphics of the launch games.The ground and track are shown with mode 7 style graphics, and the cars, objects, trees, etc. are shown with detailed scaling sprites.

The book if writing by an author who's professional career is that of an academic with minor accomplishments selling scripts. I find his pompus insights to how cinema/storytelling has declined to be a bore and off the point. The pages of filled with exasberated self justifications of his ego and do not address what it takes to be a screenwriter. I am disappointed in the ratings and purchase of this book.

At first glance, many a novelist has wondered how or why STORY could possibly be relevant to their medium since its thrust is films and screenplay writing. But, as McKee is wise enough to know, story is story - no matter what medium the storyteller uses to convey his story to his audience. What I found to be particularly beneficial was the use of visual clues to add texture and depth to story and characters. What I found to be missing, and critical for every writer, is critically relevant information about the underlying structural foundation that every story is built upon. So to that end I would recommend also looking atDeep Story: Hollywood's Secret Techniques for Writing Money Making Stories,Save the Cat, andthe Writer's Journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very formulaic and by the numbers.","review":"I felt the book was too much a paint by numbers approach to screenwriting. Having graduated from the Masters Screenwriting Program at UCLA and having studied at the feet of some of the best writers in Hollywood, I know that writing a screenplay is dynamic and every story unique in structure and potential. While there are structural elements necessary in almost every screenplay, the vision for writing a screenplay must be approached with emotion and passion! Lew Hunters 434 is a much better book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on writing","review":"This isn't just a good book for screenwriting - it's a great book for writing, period.

You cannot go wrong with the book, and the examples from movies are fascinating and illuminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much breaking down, not enough putting together.","review":"I have read a few screenplay writing books and regularly refer to a couple of them. I do not think this one will make the cut. Here is why: Yes, the book goes to great lengths in analyzing and re-analayzing and cutting and slicing story structure. The problem is it does too much of it. It does this until the pieces become so small that everything seaps through the sieve. As you read the book, you keep expecting that the author will start putting pieces together, but it never happens.I heard the author's seminars are a very enjoyable due to his performance. I am afraid the book is just a very profitable business idea, an afterthought... for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessity","review":"Robert McKee's knowledge of story is simply unsurpassed.

I'm on my second reading now, highlighter in hand.Admittedly, the first couple of chapters might put off an average reader. It's not as easy a read as, say, some of the Syd Field books. A reader will be best served by reading a chapter, stopping, digesting what's he read, then going on. And in my opinion, there's too much gold here for one reading to suffice. There are chapters in here that, taken alone, are worth the cover price.McKee's book will help you make a movie by helping you write better CHARACTERS and better SCENES.

This book doesn't necessarily give you ideas, but assists you in determining how best to execute them. Story is a thick book and takes some time to get through, but well worth it!Story has been an invaluable reference to me, because it identifies the more elusive components that distinguish quality stories from ho-hum. I've only had this book a year and already have a few frayed pages from continual use.For me, this book makes me think bigger, and drives me to reach for extraordinary ideas that work!

You'll probably enjoy this!","review":"No one writes with more passion and authority than Mr. McKee. He never recommends formula. He points out principles, that if followed, will keep you honest and aware and appreciative of this art form. His writing is free of cynicism, and if he occasionally wanders into the intellectual, he can be forgiven.

It's a bloody good mind trip, worth a read, and definitely you should buy it. If you engage with the ideas, they will stretch you.

The version I bought has six tapes, but in the first ten minutes of the first tape I begun to feel bored, so, if it were a script I would passed it, but I gave it a chance, so I listened more, more, and the more I listened, the more bored I got. I went to the library to check the print edition, and it was the same. I don't understand why it is so popular.

Out of the huge stack of screenwriting books that I have read, this is the only one with a unique vision. The others just rehash Syd Field with their own special chapter on how to make it in Hollywood. Bad Movie analogy: Reading this book is like when Neo finally see's the Matrix for what it is.

But Story reads more like a lecture, and Screenplay reads more like a conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought, overthought, overcompliated. Get Syd Field instead.","review":"McKee is responsible for making the lives of screenwriters a living hell because movie executives go to his seminars and think they know about \\"story\\".McKee over-complicates the screenwriting process by stymieing writers with way too many rules. Good thing Quentin Tarantino doesn't follow these rules.Seriously, the only books you need on screenwriting are the Syd Field books \\"Screenwriting\\" and \\"The Screenwriter's Workbook\\", and maybe William Goldman's Adventures in the Screen Trade.Aside from those works, get your hands on as many produced (and GOOD) screenplays as you can and read, read, read them.McKee will just distract you and get you thinking about rules that real filmmakers do not heed -- rules that would strip your story of all its fun, quirky, unique elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Couple of Points for the People Who Didn't Get It!!!","review":"There is no need to repeat any of the comments about how truly great this book is, but I do want to say something about the few negative reviews of this book. Namely, that it was written w/ a huge dose of ego, and that it is a hard read. To put it simply, I have read literaly dozens of books on writing, and some certainly were nothing more than an excuse to tell everyone that the author was a writing-god. However, this is not one of those books. I didn't read a bit of ego into McKee's writing, but he does tell what he believes to be the truth of story design. After reading this book, I tend to agree with him. As far as being hard to read and understand, I just don't get this opinion. This book reads as straightforward as any work about the concepts of writing, and actually is easier to understand than many others. STORY is as good as it seems...a must read for writers and directors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Write the abridged version, please.","review":"I am in a morgue with the author; he is conducting an autopsy. Strewn across the table lays the body of a story, bloated, maggot ridden, mouth agape, eyes bulging, staring up at me. I am gowned, goggled, gloved, a smear of vapor rub under my nose to mask the eye-watering stench. The author, scalpel and skewer in hand, slicing, jabbing, ripping, tearing, dissects the guts and organs of the story in long-winded, over-analyzed, often pointless detail; blathering story terminology, rancid lecturing, he rambles on and on, four hundred pages, which in spite of the vapor rub, still reeks of gagging boredom. Finishing, pushing the corpse off the table, sopping up the mess, trying desperately not to spit up my coffee, suddenly, to me, writing a story seems laborious and gruesome. Confused, bloodied, horrified, I think, \`Can it really be this complicated?'I hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"Just look at the man's credits.

McKee's writing style is so flowery and poetic, filled with 10 dollar words that detract from the point he is trying to make, the reader finds his mind drifting off the subject. I had to read certain paragraphs two to three times to even grasp what he was implying. UGH! There are much better books out there for script writing and structure. Try \\"A Story is a Promise\\" or \\"Making a Good Script Great\\" Now I am not saying there isn't some value in McKee's book. But for the price, and the three aspirin headache...as they say in Brooklyn FORGET-ABOUT-IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever Written","review":"I read this book shortly after being admitted, at twenty-six, to a prestigious MFA program with a full scholarship. I didn't go to the program b/c I wanted to write on my own, and -- with the thundering commands of McKee echoing through my head -- for the next four years, I was completely unable to write. It should tell you something that McKee himself has never written anything. He is a critic, not an author, and therefore, he has never learned that the source of creativity is not in the booming critical mind, but in the ineffable voice that only comes when all of that is silenced, or ignored. Please don't waste your time with this book, with reams of notecards, with step outlines and whatever else McKee is peddling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay well clear:","review":"If you like your books written in the virtually impenetrable propeller head style, then this book is definitely for you.

The author takes you step by step, in incredible, logical detail, through the process of communicating and screenwriting.

As many had said about its pros, i am gonna list few cons. There are no visible lights to see whether this unit is on or off...not a big deal unless you are figting with you pc to recognize your external HD. At that time it is quite annoying. I couldn't hear the fan running even when i take it close to my ears. I don't see a big difference in temperature too. May be the fan kicks in when the temperature is bit hot. My 1 TB WD Green runs quite cool and there may not be need for a fan cooling for it.Note that velociraptor drives wont fit the case. Velociraptor drives are actually 2.5\\" drives with heat sink making them the size of 3.5\\" drives.

My DVR immediately recognized the drive, and asked me to format it. A minute later, done. I had originally given the MX-1 a 5 star review, but I had to knock a star off because its fan is no longer silent. The MX-1 is fairly quiet, but I notice that the fan seems to be getting a little louder every day. I may consider disabling it. My MX-1 also came with 2 eSATA cables.

Their designs and sound dampening technology are always a cut above the rest. This external enclosure is no exception. It's easy to set up and easy to connect. My only complaint (and the reason I didn't give five stars) is that the on-board eSATA interface is recognized ONLY as SATA 3GB and thus can have some compatibility issues with older VIA SATA controllers.

I used a little silicone (like you use on a bathtub) to get around this. And finally, having quieted these design flaws, I was happy until the fan bearing blew out after a month of use. Now it sounds really horrible and I'll need a replacement.

This seemed like a good enclosure to use. However, I will be replacing the 2 that I bought very soon.1) The fan is EXTREMELY cheap and soon became noisy with a rattling sound. Unacceptable.2) They cleverly circulate the air around both sides of the drive for cooling, but the placement of the rear vent prevents you from stacking enclosures, so you would waste a ton of space if you had more than one. It would have been very easy to place the vent so you could stack them.3) The power switch is on the rear, instead of the front where you can easily access it.

According to the reviews this unit is supposed to be super quiet. But actually it is a bit noisy when it's only a few feet away from the bed.

It was very compelling and moving. It is a story of what is really behind the many practices of Hindu teaching and those in the New Age today.

Fortunately, Rabi continued to search for God and found him at last through Jesus.This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for the curious New Ager also.","review":"Rabi's testimony about his discovery of the true God even while immersed in the Hindu community of Trinidad was quite interesting. Rabi walks the reader through his childhood as he becomes a guru. During the walk he points out the love and the desperation he experiences within the Hindu community he has grown up in. Then Rabi takes the reader through his sometimes terrifying conversion to Christianity as he discovers that faith in God can help to severe the bonds which have constrained his family. The book is not only good for the Hindu, but I found Rabi's story to also be helpful to those in Buddhist, New Age, or Universalist movements which so often make the mistake of assuming that every road leads to God and that a person has to shoulder the burden of their own salvation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth will set you free","review":"This book is a very good read which tells of a man's search for true God.

If I wanted to learn fluff, I could get a Microsoft book to do that for me.This book filled that bill. Not only does it condense the facts and remove the fluff, but it covers everything you need to know. I learned about Active Server Pages enough to talk about them intelligently, when I (coming from Unix servers) knew nothing of them before. I learned about the log file capabilities, and the integration with Index Server - - I learned enough that our site was able to set up an IIS server in a fraction of the time we had alloted, and am now proposing that we convert completely to IIS.This is one GREAT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No fluff in this book, just what you need to pass!","review":"I've spent too much time and money with other books that say they're study guides, but just offer a lot of extra info that never appears on the test.

Recently, I ran out of the pads and had to purchase some at K-Mart because it was the closest store available and there were very few options so I chose Hartz. This was a horrible purchase. My puppy will urinate on this pad once and spreads throughout the entire pad and actually leaks out onto the floor. In addition this, it also doesn't block odors like many of the other brands do. Unfortunately, I lost my receipt so I wasn't able to bring it back. We've been doubling up on the pads hoping this will work in regards to leaking, but this hasn't helped either. I would NEVER purchase these again and I think they should be removed from the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING BETTER!","review":"These pads are wonderful, we change them daily, but even so, they are very absorbent, keep urine odor down, and do not leak through.

These worked great, but were a bit expensive for as many as I needed.I followed another reviewer and went to DHMEDICAL website and bought a box of 200 pads and it was under $35 after shipping. They aren't as high quality as these, but they work just as well!If you aren't using many puppy pads then Hartz Maximum Protection Puppy Pads are an EXCELLENT choice, but if you are going through alot - go to DHMEDICAL and buy them in bulk! MUCH cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"These were cheaper pads, and that being said, you get what you pay for. They come folded up in a quarter of their actual size. On half of them when I went to unfold (no matter how gently and slow I did it) the plastic backing ripped. This, of course, defeated the purpose of the pad because my dog's urine ended up getting on the floor. The ones that actually didn't rip when I unfolded them worked fine. They're pretty absorbent and they are pretty much odor free like the packaging suggests. That said, I won't be buying these again as I don't like the fact that half of them ripped."},{"rating":"1","title":"these are the crappiest wee pads on the market, no pun","review":"they're about as thin as three pieces of toilet paper and the coverage area is the smallest i've seen compared to at least 5 other brands. i'm not looking for gold plated wee pads, but these are just trashy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a user anymore","review":"I have used these pads before and they seemed ok enough. I'm not sure if the manufacturing of this product has changed, or if my shih tzu urinates more (doubt it), but these pads ARE NOT absorbent.

After that at nine weeks old my pup's urine was not being held by these pads. These seem to be ideal for smaller breeds, so I can't understand why they show a Lab on the product. Though they work ok for all breeds during the first couple of weeks, I recommend these pads mainly for owners of smaller breeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pads are small and leak","review":"The most important thing for a wee-wee pad is that it not let any liquid seep through and ruin the hardwood floors. This brand allows urine to seep through almost immediately. They are also slightly smaller than other brands we have used. Still looking for a brand that does not allow ANY seepage. This doesn't seem like much to ask, but so far all the brands we've tried allow leakage because the plastic is porous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Us A Break -We don't ask for much","review":"I had been buying this pad but no more. You have just outpriced yourself by raising the price from $9.99 to $15.21 even with the 4 for 3 discount and the free shipping(that's why the two stars). They are cheaper at Walgreens where they still sell for $9.99. You can lower the price in consideration of your customers,I'll buy them again.

The other pads I have used have never had this issue.Also, when I pulled the pads out of the bag, sometimes the corners of the pad would be stuck folded into the middle of the pad and when I would pull it apart the pad would rip and I would have cotton coming out from the pad..So, after trying these pads for about 5 days... I gave up on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pads For The Price","review":"To me there are 2 types of pads. The economy pads that are really thin, don't soak up the urine, create wet tracking paw prints on my floors but all in all serve their purpose if you don't mind the extra mess/smell and are way cheep. Then you have the great pads like Advanced that soak up the mess/smell, minimize paw prints, and never leave my floors damp but cost a little bit more.These Hartz pads are the worst of worst and priced about the same as the quality pads. The Hartz have cheep backings which my chihuahua completely soaks thru in the mornings. It is terrible picking them up. Plus if he pees once then he tends to poop on the floor next to the pad because the pad is gross and full so he doesn't want to stand on it. I have a chihuahua not great dane so if he doesn't like them then these must be made for tea cup pups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latest version of Hartz pads stinks of chemicals","review":"I have been using Hartz puppy pads since we got adopted my dog last fall and I've been ordering them from Amazon. However the latest shipment (June 2011) is different than the previous product. I noticed when the shipment arrived last week that the outer wrapping had changed (as reflected in the new photo amazon posted)- I've since read companies usually do this when they change their product manufacturers or formulations. When I opened the bag, a terrible chemical odor was immediately evident. The smell has completely filled the coat closet where we keep the pads. It is also making the bathroom where the dog pees smell toxic. The dog himself doesn't seem to mind the acrid smell, but we sure do. I think we're going to try theseWare River Pet Puppy Wee Wee Pads 23\\"x24\\" 100/box USA MADEbecause at least they're made in the USA, although there isn't free shipping.

Furthermore, my edition of the book began coming unglued from the binding no less than 3 weeks into the semester.I would not reccomend it for any class except one taught by Mr. Tunberg and Ms. Minkova themselves.

I love Dilbert, so this book is a lot of fun.However, I will warn you - having the strips arranged by topic takes some of the humor out of it - a whole section of strips dedicated to \\"Secretaries\\" for instance, is not nearly as funny as just seeing an occasional barb. Can you imagine Seinfeld doing his comedy routine by subject? \\"Ok, here are all my jokes about women\\", now onto \\"cookies\\" - no, it just doesn't work as well. I prefer the straight timeline accumulations. And you will find yourself rereading strips you have seen in other Dilbert books too.But overall, a fine collection - I still think it's great - it just could be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Compilation of Comics","review":"This Dilbert book offers comics on each frustrating topic of the office day: Boss's, meetings, secretarys, HR directors, consultants, and much, much more. It is a fantastic book, and includes Sunday colored comic strips. When you're feeling disgruntled about office topics, go to the section of your choice, and know that somebody else felt your pain. Scott Adams is a marvelous cartoonist. I recommend this book for any Dilbert fan who would enjoy reading past strips that have become outragously popular.

A year later they go to a Halloween party out in a field with a bunch of Lyn's friends, none of which we get to know other than by their 2006 costumes.Jonathan is having flash backs and sees weird things associated with Alec in his pumpkin mask. There is an old creepy pumpkin carver (Terrence Evans) who mentions other carvers. Jonathan gets kicked around by a steroid pumped ex-boyfriend of a girl, who his sister is attempting to fix him up with (nice going sis).The characters have some colorful moments, but they are far from funny.

It's not a total loss though as I thought the murders in this film were much better than the usual fare and showed some sense of style. If the dialogue was better this could have been a pretty good little Halloween film, but decent gore sequences can only do so much. I do not expect grade A writing from these types of films, but when the dialogue takes away from the story, then it becomes a problem.

Of course, I understand the lack of budget, but this can usually be overcome by having a decent story. Alas, though PK starts out semi-original, it quickly tumbles into stalk 'n' stab oblivion. The idea of an old man \\"pumpkin carver\\", who lives for / has pride in this career, is almost as interesting as it is ridiculous. The final insult comes in the form of two toga-clad morons so insufferable, so utterly hate-worthy, as to incite homicidal tendencies in the viewer!

It is a handy introduction to the battles in light of the Art of War but the reader should be cautioned that the authors seemed limited to (based on the limited bibliographical lists) secondary sources and these do not usually reflect the latest or most accurate scholarship. This is particularly important regarding ancient military history where the original source material itself has to be cross-checked with many other accounts since ancient authors or editors were so often biased or simply uninformed.If you are looking for a handy review of ancient and dark age battles in general, this is a good place to start.

The author, W. David Hager, is on an FDA advisory panel for reproductive health drugs, and was one of the few opponents of morning-after contraception being made available without a prescription.

I got the XL tall and everything fit great except the stomach area had a peculiar self-inflating hollow bulge in the front.To me it appears that Carhartt has a harley-davidson-like following who will praise whatever they produce because it's perceived as tough or cool.I really wanted to like this jacket but I'm not going to pretend. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough and comfy","review":"These jackets are legit. period.

I was hoping it was a little bit thicker for colder temps, but after thinking it's actually good for the area I am in (Virginia), b/c it doesn't get that cold here. The price of this jacket, when I got it, was so cheap and I was able to get it in a tall size! I couldn't beat this deal!

It is interesting to read this translation in the context of the two other main translations now available, Lianshang Wu's (which has the Chinese text, but has a poor English text which is closer to the original) and Veith's (which is more arbitrary, possibly because she had no background in TCM), but don't rely on this for clinical advice, it is spoon feeding you one man's opinion, and in this persons opinion, it isn't very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"The Yellow Emperor Classic is a great book and necessary for any practitioner of Chinese Medicine.

This book is packed full of both black and white and color pictures!All of her movies are covered in this book, as well as her hundreds of concerts particually the landmark concert on April 23, 1961 at Carnigie Hall! Also covered is her 1963- 1964 television show on CBS: The Judy Garland Show!If your looking for information on Judy's career, this definatly is the right book for you!

Many of Judy's biographers tend to be either hysterically gushing fans or cold and distant, and neither style makes the reader particularly comfortable. But Fricke has struck the perfect balance - his writing has warmth and credibility at the same time. He focuses mostly on her tremendous achievements in music and movies, and less on her troubled personal life. A Judy fan, new or old, can't go wrong with this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a marvellous book, John Fricke writes of Judy Garland's career in great detail while also dispelling the old myths of tempermental and mean spirited behaviour that other Garland biographers presented as fact.Here is Judy in all of her glory as the great entertainer she always was (and still is) and as mentioned earlier blows away the myths that have plagued Judy for so long, it shows Judy's effort to rise above problems and give her all, wether it is when she is performing or showing her love to her friends, co-workers and her children.Buy this book now with another John Fricke title on Judy, 'A Portrait of art and Anecdote'. Forget people like Gerald Clarke and his innaccurate look at Judy's life and Mel Torme for his self-serving and also innaccurate look at the legend. Buy this book but quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts, facts, facts do not a biography make","review":"This coffee-table book devoted to Judy Garland cannot be called a biography. It is more an accumulation of fact after fact concerning Garland, without any perspective or insight. The author seems to defend the idea that in remembering Judy Garland only her career should be looked at, excluding to look at the multi-layered, complex personality of the singer. Examining only the career of an important personality of the 20th century is as bad - if not worse - as examining only all the sordid details of her short life. Biographers should have a point of view in taking on a person's life; all this book does is worship an icon in the most religious way. This book should be read ony by diehard fans who like one-dimensional reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVEN ENTERTAINING!","review":"Good: there are many photos.BAD: the photos are very small.Good: many accurate facts.BAD: only facts, and NO index at the back!Good: a lot of text.BAD: no analysis, a verbal self-intoxication.Good: it is about Judy Garland.BAD: at the end of the book, you still don't know her: no critical appraisal, no situating of the personality in the context of popular music of the period. Furthermore, she was more than entertaining, but the book only depicts her as a \\"talent to amuse\\" us. This is almost revisionism.And last:Bad: poorly written.GOOD: so, you can skip most of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vital Haydn","review":"Another solid set of performances from the QM, great recorded sound and presence.

They are easily comparable to the masters of the medium such as Mozart and Beethoven. Both discs are done with 'sur instruments d'epoque' (instruments of the period) and while my ear is not trained well enough to spot the characteristics of the period instruments, I really prefer hearing works as the composer intended, much like listening to liturgical music recorded in a church.Both discs were very highly reviewed in periodicals when they were released, so to this I add that to my ear, they are very pleasant listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repetitive","review":"This would have been a decent book if the author hadn't gone on and on and on and on about the same details over and over.

I didn't mind the reading through the first chapter how 'classy' the lead character was and how she was very careful to not have her picture in the society columns every week so she wouldn't 'wear out her welcome' and how her friends were incredibly jealous and didn't understand stepping away from the photographer BUT it is rammed down the readers throat in every. single. paragraph.

It's unnecessarily filled with incestuous relationships written in the most dire and ponderous narrative possible from the view of a 75 year old woman reminiscing her long gone heydays.Carter's language has the potential in creating something of a worthy read but the structure and content of the novel diminish and incinerate every possibilty. As if the narrative isn't dire as it is, the chronology of events are manipulated and Dora digresses a great deal.

It's been observed that at least some of what Koko appeared to be communicating via signing was the result of unconscious nonverbal prompting on the part of Francine Patterson, hence why many linguists are skeptical of using Koko as an example of animal use of ASL.Besides that (which the authors may just simply have not known about) the book is INCREDIBLY well-researched and honest in it's examination of modern-day evolutionary theory.

The character development is weak and the plot is shallow. In general, detail is sorely lacking. Even the occasional references for \\"detailing of the laws of magic\\" are merely a sentence or two. On the plus side, I did finish the book. There are some entertaining passages, but overall, I did not find it very satisfying. There is much better Fantasy out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...this book is terrible","review":"I don't understand why this book has gotten so many over-the-top reviews. (Though, judging by some consistencies in style in many of the reviews, I suspect a lot were written by one person.) This is one of the lousiest fantasies I've ever read, and everyone I've pushed it on (maliciously, in fun), agrees. The concept of analytically describing the various types of magic is an interesting one, but the writing is so bland, so pedestrian, so rigidly following a naked outline, that the bones of the organizational skeleton poke out all over. Seriously, if you are an experienced reader and value good fiction, this is not the book for you. For good fantasy, I'd suggest Guy Kay's engaging and beautifully written novels, particularly Fionavar Tapestry, Tigana, Song for Arbonne, and The Lions of Al-Rassan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great read","review":"Like some other reviewers, I can't remember exactly when I read this, but it seems like freshman year in high school. I just found my old copy of this book in storage, and I suddenly rememebred how incredible this book is. I remember following Alodar through his trials and his desperate search for some way to win a queen's hand. I remember how he went through each of the 5 magics in the hopes of finding something that could aid him in his quest for a woman, and how he in turn becomes involved in a much greater plan. l also rememeber how I threw this book across the room several times because I was so SICK of Alodar getting repeatedly shafted by others that benefited from his hard work. But, most of all, I remember how I actually yelled out with joy (in the middle of class no less) as I read the story's climax. It is that good, and well worth the wait.

When I turned the last page, I was just glad to be done with a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In like a puddytat...out like a lambypie","review":"What a promising start and what a disappointing payoff. Some of Saul Bernstein's reactions and observations about the Midwest, and Patsy's long-suffering reactions, are truly hilarious. If you love to recall the scene in Annie Hall where Alvie Singer worries incessantly about the possible anti-Semitic overtones of the phrase, \\"Did you eat?\\" you'll love this stuff. But the plot does not hold one's interest...especially after a denoument that lacks much punch and an ending that might leave you gratified about the hero's character development, but ultimately unimpressed with the role he takes on in his chosen community. Those who have said that this novel reads like the collection of short stories from which it sprang, and not like a complete work of literature in and of its self seem to be right on the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUT OF HIS ELEMENT","review":"Charles Baxter's forte is the short story, and he has written some good ones. In this novel he is using characters he has written about previously in short stories, namely the titular Saul and Patsy, and unfortunately when expanded to novel length the characters just don't ring true. This is particularly true of the main character, Saul Bernstein, an East Coast university professor transplanted, via academia, to a midwestern college town. To me, Saul's character is cardboard and one-dimensional - the sort of character a writer might concoct after reading the works of far superior Jewish writers such as Bernard Malamud, Saul Bellow, and Phillip Roth, and then trying to create his own pastiche of a troubled \\"Jewish man\\" confronting a sometimes alien, sometimes hostile, sometimes frightening world. In comparing Mr. Baxter's creation with the works of the forenamed authors, I'm afraid the highest rating I can give his new novel is one star out of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"Hurray! Charles Baxter didn't let me down. Saul and Patsy were really back, a little older, still struggling with life. The thing I love most about Baxter's writing - no big analysis on why a character behaves as he does. He or she just is. Just like life. And no one writes truer about life than Baxter. It doesn't matter why Saul loves Patsy, he just does, totally.I knew with the first story that Baxter placed these two character in the area of Michigan where I live. And everything and everyone he writes about is pretty dead on. In fact, what he writes about is so true that sometimes it makes me laugh...or cry.I hope that at some point in Saul and Patsy's lives, Baxter will bring them back to us again."},{"rating":"2","title":"BAXTER rules again superbly","review":"The number of reviewers who passionately disliked this book makes me wonder what they were expecting, or if they just weren't in the mood for this kind of book. \\"Saul and Patsy\\" is a very well-done novel that keeps your attention throughout, even though there's something a little, I don't know, uncomfortable about the couple's decision to relocate to a small town in rural Michigan.

Annie and Jack's adventures are not only age appropriate for a curious 4 year old, but they introduce history and situations that we would be otherwise unlikely to grab her attention (Shakespeare, civil rights, etc).

In a way it's a shame, this book is a terrific reference source but to my knowledge there really aren't any good T-38 Models out there in Current production, The Sword Models T-38 being the best of the bunch but rather expensive and very hard to find.Kudos to Mr. Peeters and the DACO crew for taking on this subject. In my opinion the book (and all of the Lock-On series) would greatly benefit from more coverage of various unit markings, special markings, etc. For example, the USAF thunderbirds flew the 38 for years, yet there is only one T-bird picture in the book. A short article by Engineer/Aircrew/ Maintenance types would also help in a book that sells for @ $30.00.Overall an excellent detail book of an airplane that has been needing more coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricked!","review":"Thought this was the original record from the look of the cover. Not so. Lots of filler songs. A big disappointment. Sorry I ordered the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what century did this composer live in??","review":"A thrilling work. These pieces show off the compositional mastery of Emanuel. The Rondo in A major is a clear example that he could write beautiful melodies as well and deserves to be a standard. Pletnev conveys the feeling that Bach would use \\"old-fashioned\\" Baroque techniques as just another tool in his compositional toolbox.For fun, play this album to a music lover and let him/her try to guess the composer. Some pieces sound like they could have been written in the 20th century.I was surprised to find a passage in one of the later tracks that Emanuel later orchestrated for one of the Hamburg symphonies. (sorry - can't put my finger on it right now).I agree with the previous review regarding the sound. I thought it was played on an antique piano at first, it sounds so strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shaving cream EVER","review":"This product is amazing. At first I was a bit skeptical about using a shaving lotion as opposed to a conventional shaving cream. After the first use I was hooked. Its so incredibly easy and clean. You don't even have to wet your face before putting it on. It doesn't take much at all to cover your entire face, so the tube lasts much longer than expected. Razor burn is also a thing of the past due to this great stuff. Its got a great menthol cooling sensation to it that feels great the second you put it on. Highly recommend for guys with sensitive skin that suffer from constant razor burn. Hats off to the people at Kiehls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used this product on my legs","review":"I was advised that I can use this product as an alternative since the woman's shaving cream wasn't available at the moment. Just like the woman's shaving cream this product did not disappoint. It left my legs very smooth and moist.The texture of the product makes it easy to use. I can get a close shave without the cuts. Overall the package allows the product to be applied and stored easily.I am suprised that there isn't more competitors for Kiehl but so far Kiehls shaving cream has worked the best for me.I rated it a 4 instead of 5 since it contains propylene glycol and methylparaben.Made in USA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT use!","review":"Do Not use there cancer laden products.

Never did I expect to hear the special resonance that just about sent my teeth vibrating as I've heard on this CD. How many times can one hear, Poor Wayfairing Stranger, and still feel ones heart strings pulled. This one is SPECIAL.

It was given to me by a denominational executive to read and I found it lacking in several areas. The authors seem unaware of current trends that are effecting rural churches across Canada and the United States. While this book may provide some insight, if you are pastoring a rural church, you know everything that they have written already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the definitive biography of Pete Ellis","review":"Although ostensibly a biography of Ellis, the book tends to focus on other high-profile Marines of the era and the internacine service rivalries that Ellis lived through. Although discussing in the beginning of the book certain peculiarities surrounding Ellis' death (specifically the behavior of Chief Pharmacist Zembsch after recovery of Ellis' remains), the authories summarily dismiss any mystery at the end of the book by stating that Ellis died of alcholism. All in all an interesting read, but certainly not the in-depth biography of Pete Ellis that one might infer from the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The book was a great disappointment and filled with anti-American sentiments.The historical background was very poorly presented. A case in point was the discription of Waller's long walk on Samar and the execution on 11 natives. The author made it sound like Waller was out hiking on a whim and he just decided out of the blue to execute a bunch of innocent harmless natives. Nothing could be futher from the truth. The author also seems to go out of his way to describe most Marine Officers of the era as hopeless,uneducated drunks. He also described Pete Ellis as a racist lush. As a Marine veteran and a Patriotic American, I was highly offended by the obvious off hand slanderous comments about America and the Marine Corp. This book was either very poorly researched, or the author deliberately distorted historical truths for a personal agenda.The only reason one could have for buying this book is the fact that are no other books on Pete Ellis to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This is a terrible book. The author's have zero evidence to back up their poorly positioned arguments. They use evolution to make vast statements that justify the worst of humanity.

Mainly it consists of airy and inconclusive statements about various web-related issues. A sample, the closing sentence for Part One: \\"It would seem that being focused on and aware of the specific and particular needs and requirements of the electronic reader--your reader--is the about the most we can hope to do.\\" There's too much philosophizing and too little practical information. Even being a relative newcomer to the web design field, I found little in this book I didn't already know. There are a couple of interesting discussions, but the author could easily have made his point in a couple pages rather than an entire chapter. I'm sure there are better resources for web writers than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great topic -- disappointing result","review":"After hearing an interview with the author on a local radio show I couldn't wait to buy this book.I live in Hamtramck, less than a mile from where the Purples got their start, and I was hoping for a definitive chronicle of their rise and fall, with names, dates and locations that I could relate to. Instead, I got an extended, poorly-edited outline that begged for more detailed and specific exposition.While I don't regret my purchase I was sorely disappointed and sincerely hope that Mr. Kavieff will expand his research and revise the book with the assistance of a more competent editor and publisher. I also strongly recommend he read Lowell Cauffiel's \\"Masquerade\\" for pointers on how to write a masterful tale of the Detroit underbelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing makes this book unreadable","review":"I agree with the review above. The treatment of the subject matter was anecdotal and superficial. However, I could have lived with that, had the book been more readable on a literary level.

The typos, redundancies and grammatical mistakes were so distracting that I almost didn't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Purple Gang","review":"I am sorry, this book suffers terribly from a number of problems. I found it to be quite superficial in it's content. Were it only a problem with the author I could overlook it's problems as a sincere effort by an author who was interested enough in the subject to write a book, but the real crime is in the editing and publishing/printing. This book was allowed to be released with so many printing errors that it distracts the reader almost completely. I am sorry to say a book that deals with a subject that I find of great interest does so in such a poor way. It appears that a stronger editor was needed to organize the content and oversee the publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad For The Money.......","review":"I ordered this because I was looking for a chair that was reasonably priced with good back support.When the chair arrived, I found it VERY easy to put together.

It briefly covers a dozen or so events including shipwrecks, air crashes, space craft and satellite problems, nuclear powerplants, dams and bridges.Nearly all of these disasters could have a full length documentary or movie about it (such as Apollo 13), but don't expect in-depth technical analysis of each problem in the 3 minutes or so per event shown here.As with most of the DVD's in this Modern Marvels series, the run-time is optimistic.

So, when I ran out, I looked for more 500 mg softgels on Amazon and found these. What a mistake! They're only 500 mg of CLA but are the same size as the 1,000 mg CLA softgels from Life Extension - in other words, you get all the size of the large softgels with only half the benefit.On top of that, they smell nasty and leave an aftertaste. And the price is the same that I paid earlier for the smaller, easier to swallow Life Extension 500 mg softgels with no smell or aftertaste.

I dont trust the 2 tiny screws they give you to mount this heavy cabinet to a wall.So ill have to wait to mount till i have proper heavy duty screws and anchors. The final thing i dont like about it is when i screwed or pushed the 2 screws in the doors to attach the knobs the cheap coating on the door started to bubble up.

In fact, there is little biographical-reading on the subject of AJ Tomlinson until we are well a third of the way into the book. The value of the book resides only the tremendous-significance of this man's role in the early Pentecostal-Movement, combined with the relative-scarcity of materials dealing with his life. However, the writing style is painfully-pedantic, and I read much too much of the author's theories-on-things than I bargain-for in a biography. The most glaring inadequacy is that the book gives the last twenty to thirty years of Mr. Tomlinson's life little more than a postscript, when these years were fraught with drama, controversy, and litigation. Upon closing the book, I wondered where I might go to read the whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"The audio and video quality are extremely good.

Instructor doesn't give instructions and, worst to my mind, has no feel for the music, no sense of rhythm. She hurls her body around, and her movements are jerky, not fluid as most dance requires.

I know that a lot of text books can be considered \\"bad\\", but this is by far the worst textbook I have ever used.Ideally a textbook will explain concepts well and give relevant examples to reinforce the concepts. The textbook does neither. This textbook explains concepts extremely poorly which makes it bad enough. On top of that, moreover, this book does not give examples for 90% of the concepts.If this book is the required text for a course, I would recommend changing classes.

Furthermore, a lot of examples were the same as those from other textbooks but with much less clarity here. The diagrams were often confusing and the details showing the development of the theory were often highly masked or left out completely. On a positive note (if there is actually one), the book will probably be used later for reference, because, after struggling through the minute details and solving the problems posed here, I have a better understanding of the principles, but definitely NOT because of this book or the professor who used it almost exclusively to teach the course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An elementary comprehensive treatment of applied elasticity","review":"This book covers the elementary topic of mechanics of material (stress-strain relations, etc.) and more advanced applied topics (thin plate & shell, energy method, etc.).

Do not waste your money on these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reccomended for primary study guide","review":"I bought this book for $40 simply because it is made by the same people who make the praxis II test (also, becasue there are not too many other study guides for the 0089 test). The pluss side of the book is that it contains a 60 question practice test with answers. Seeing as how these are the same people who make the questions for the praxis test, you can be pretty certain that if you do well on the practice test. The problem with this book is that, while it tells you what you need to study for the test, it does not give you any information on the things that it tells you to study. It just says things like \\"Study ancient empires and civilizations,\\" but it doesn't give you any information on it. For this reason, I do not reccomend buying this book.

Yes, it's a sweeping epic of the type I usually enjoy, and it may have a satisfying conclusion, but I found the violence far too traumatic for me. There's one particularly brutal rape scene involving a child, written in extensive and graphic detail -- I am still (nearly a year later) having nightmares about it. You might have a tougher stomach than me or a greater tolerance for a \\"realistic\\" portrait of slave-owning America. If so, enjoy. Personally, I'd rather stick with Into the Wilderness (Sara Donati) or Outlander (Diana Gabaldon) -- same style and time period, still gripping, still a bit gritty, but books that are fun to read and re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved the book but...","review":"I am a huge fan of Beverly Swerling, but I found a the type-o's in this book very distracting!!

In my opinion she is a very good writer. She posses a great knowlege of both the male and female feelings in life. Her medical facts along with her historical knowlege certainly keeps one interested to the end of each story.Clyde J. Robbins"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading with solid history","review":"Not knowing much about the time and place before reading this novel, I learned a great deal across a broad range of topics.

I won't go over the plot in this review as it has already been done, but I will say that I recommend this book to any lover of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect mix of historical interest and story telling","review":"Having read and absolutely loved City of Dreams, I was anxious to get my hands on Shadowbrook the minute I could and I had it preordered on Amazon as a result. I was not disapointed in any way, yet again Ms Swerling has made the perfect mix of historical research and interest with a blinding story this time of the sultry south. I have a fascination with the historical aspects of her books, always so interesting and with so much detail that you really lose yourself in the time and place. But unlike equally well researched books with an interesting factual basis like the Di Vinci code, Ms Swerling's charaters are living breathing believable human beings and she spins a yarn that keeps you hooked throughout. I really recommend this book to anyone interested in recent history and/or who enjoys a compulsive story line. I also recommend City of Dreams to any who haven't read that yet either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Last time I was in America, I came across this author's gripping first novel, City of Dreams, and I've been hoping she'd write another. Shadowbrook is definitely worth the wait - and the cost of postage to the UK!Like its predecessor, Shadowbrook is Adventure on a Grand Scale: a glorious, page-turning plot that kept me up half the night, vividly memorable characters, and a fabulous talent for bringing history to life so you feel you're actually living it yourself, as opposed to merely reading about it.Definitely my favourite read of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing but still brilliant Roth ...","review":"You know you're not in for a party when the book starts with a funeral. Though Philip Roth has never been someone I'd expect to see at a party anyway. I return to him repeatedly because he's an extremely bright guy with sad, blunt observations of the general human condition that are almost always on target.This book is no exception. It is quite depressing and anyone on Prozac should avoid it! That said, if you've got the stomach, it's almost up to his normal standard of brilliance. Highly recommended to all Roth fans as well as anyone looking for some well thought out perspective on the meaning - and meaninglessness - of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - it's not very good","review":"I heard an interview on NPR and it sounded interesting and I picked it up at the airport bookstore before a flight yesterday.First problem - it's short. It took exactly 90 minutes to read - I could have easily bought a magazine that provided a longer period of entertainment.Second - it's depressing.Third - It's just not very engaging - the characters are shallow - the life stories are brief - It seemed gimmicky - I read it yesterday, and I've forgotten most of it today.This guy is supposed to be a great writer. He obviously can compose sentences well, but if this is his best effort, I'm not impressed.It reads like a bulleted Powerpoint Presentation"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely Disappointing","review":"This is a prize-winning book? If it were written by anyone but Phillip Roth it would have been dismissed for what it is - a depressing, unresolved, boring story about a narcissistic man with nothing going on in his life. Think of how boring it is when someone goes on and on and on about their various medical conditions and operations -- well about half of this skimpy book consists of just that.I'm 61 and if this is what I have to look forward to in the twilight of my life, bring on the arsenic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roth Newcomer Enjoys","review":"Everyman is a short look at one man's life and death beginning with his own funeral. This is my first Roth novel and I was quite happy with it. It dealth with the timeless themes of love, lust and dying. I don't think Roth says anything new or profound here but his presentation is quite good. Everyman confronts the fact that eventually he too will die. The date that is distantly off in the future gets closer and closer and Everyman's health gets worse and worse. Lust and erotic love for young woman are waypoints for this man as he physically begins to fall apart. In the end, he can't take refuge with other seniors who live through the deeds of their children and grandchildren- instead he navigates largely alone through his end -"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to discuss with friends","review":"Another excellent Philip Roth! After reading this short book I found I had to discuss many of the issues confronted here, mainly attitudes towards aging, facing the loss of dear ones and friends, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roth really thinks this is EVERYMAN??","review":"This is the first book review I've written because I've never felt the need to in the past, but with this book, I must. I thought this book was terrible- primarily because of the title. Is Roth saying that the careless, completely self-absorbed and somewhat heartless protagonist is representing all American men. I really hope not. There is nothing enlightening or profound in this book except Roth's apparent view that all men have careless affairs with their secretaries and couldn't care less about their families. Pointless, save your valuable time and read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Body Electric Shorts Out","review":"This is the perfect way to take your Roth if you dig him in short doses. Roth has written a Saul Bellow novella and it shows why Roth should stick with this format. I love this book - it says its piece and gets out. The passages about the boy and the ocean bring you to tears. So lovely, so full of life, so full of wistful knowledge that you can try to stay with a beautiful moment but you're losing it as it happens. Every time I plunge into the surf at Ocean City, I think about Roth's transcendent meditation on the loss of youth, the loss of courage and the foreboding shadows of oblivion on the face of the water. I paddle hard and strong into the surf, tears in my eyes. Lovely stuff.N.B. As usual, his dialogue stinks but there's so little of it, you can skim over it and miss nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment.","review":"I read Philip Roth's American Pastoral and was encouraged enough to order another Philip Roth book. Big mistake. I found Everyman to be a complete waste of time. I actually lost my place and read 100 pages over the second time without realizing it. This book is not well-written and the storyline is ridiculous. If this is what Philip Roth has to tell us at the end of a long life, I'm so sad for him. The vision of this old man chasing around a young girl and taking no more thought for what he's doing to the people around him, seems more appropriate teenage behavior. I was disgusted. It was my second and last Philip Roth book. We have much better writers in the USA, I can't imagine why this man is so famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a depressing story","review":"I don't understand how none of the hundreds other reviewers never thought to put out a word of warning. This book is about a depressed person. Be warned: it's always depressing being near a depressed person. Its even more depressing when the that depressed guy incessantly offers insights about his depression.This is the story of this book. Its very interesting, one must admit, and there's even a good plot. So good that I couldn't stop reading it. At one point I thought, hey, this poor guy, we rest of people are so lucky. I thought maybe that's the message I should take from the book. But no, its not a message we are left with. There's no message. At the end, it's just a wonderfully written, hopeless book about a lonely, ill and sad person."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"Philip Roth's new book was no more than therantings of a old man who felt he threw mostof his life away on frivolous woman chasing.It was very sad, I didn't feel sorry for thecharacter, only that I agreed with hisanalysis. I don't recommend the book onany level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I feel terrible about not being able to finish a book that is only 182 pages long, but it is just too boring. Roth states that the scene in the original play - when Everyman tells Death that he arrived when he was least expected - was the inspiration for writing this book. Well, at the risk of sounding condescending, can anyone really be impressed with such an overwhelmingly obvious observation? Who else but Philip Roth could get away with publishing a novel with an unnamed hero that is little more than a grocery list of all the operations this guy ever had? Roth's weaknesses as a writer - his self-indulgence and self-centeredness - stand alone in this book, without any of the saving graces that can be found in some of his other works - such as story, character, and insight. I'm afraid the positive reviews of this book are just cases of readers not realizing that the emperor wears no clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is my second Roth book, the first being The Plot Against America. After reading other reviews I hope to read some of his older stuff.The nice thing about this book is that it is essentially it is a novella, which allows for considerable brevity, which Roth performs expertly, with a minimum of words and maximum of emotional punch. It is an excellent portrayal of American life - how children of immigrants start in their ethnic neighborhoods and become, for better or for worse, \\"Americanized\\" and subject to the current national trends. As such, this book indirectly is a commentary on twentieth century American life. Nice approach as well, where Roth starts at the end and works forward. Throw in a few thoughts on illness and mortality, and you have yourself some great fiction. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"roth rules. that dude can write a mean sentence. i'll save you from the praise you can read in the other 118 reviews for this title and i'll get straight to my issue, which is fully technical: THE WORDS ARE TOO LOUD. seriously, my edition of this book is in 12-point type which is great for the sight impaired but awful for the rest of us. gimme the squint-inducing haruki murakami-style 8-point joint any day. yeah, this is picking nits but the gargantuan font size rendered this fabulous book almost totally unreadable. woulda been a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"What about a little cardiac arrest?","review":"Once there was a man with too much time on his hands, too much money, and perhaps too much talent. So, he thought only of himself and a bit about his daughter Nancy. Are we talking parable here...? Heck! I don't know what the boy's complaint was, but he had less respect for women than a politician. Perhaps, the author was merely feeling his own mortality. (He does not look like a spring chickie on the back of the dust jacket.) So, I guess I learned, as the reader, that we are all going to fall apart and die, or just die as the case might be. But, I already knew that. At least, it was not a long book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark but captivating","review":"It might seem a funny thing that two of the best novels of the last couple of years both center on grown men waiting for or facing death. On is of course Philip Roth's Everyman, the other Paul Auster's The Brooklyn Follies. While I think Auster had the better of Roth (it might be down to the different tone of the authors) both books are very good. Everyman is a dark, painful book well deserving of it's black cover. (The Brooklyn Follies is more optimistic while also dwelling on the characters' difficulties.) While it is seldom interesting to hear people talking about their illnesses there is something special about Roth's story of Everyman going from one operation to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyman - Every life!","review":"I haven't finished the book yet but by the time I read it, it gives me an idea of the death. Everybody will reach this point but differently, n the way people look at as well.It's not only about the death but also about the memory which will be with everybody for the whole life n we'd love to recall it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloodless, unaffecting","review":"This wisp of a novel has little appeal stylistically -- it is coldly and generically written, like a manual -- and delivers mere crumbs to the emotion and intellect. The theme of human death is explored, but almost entirely without reference to human beings. Instead we get ponderous archetypes. I guess this is what passes for sophistication: We are all animals heading into nothingness. Thanks for the insight. Just off the top of my head, I would direct readers to Barney's Version by Mordecai Richler for a novel about dying that has blood running through its veins, or to Grace by Linn Ullman, which covers the subject with a radiance that is never sentimental. Neither of these books, or authors, will ever get the kind of fulsome praise you find for Roth on the rear flap of Everyman. Congratulations on all those awards; shame about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something....","review":"A great work of literature has atmosphere, insight, or unique style.

The author may be more in tune to the spiritual realm than the medical/scientific community, as a whole, but his solutions go against the One who wrote the instruction manual and has the Ultimate Solution. I found a couple of the latter chapters interesting and informative of another's beliefs, and the author brings awareness that there is more to human beings than just the physical/scientific realm, but we differ in how it is to be addressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Natural Medicine Guide to Bipolar Disorder","review":"Besides the author be a journalist, she have done a terrific work, collecting rich information about these disorders, that affect between 1% to 8% of world population, in different severity grades. She also collected important testimonies from many MD's, who do not agree with traditional medicine and drugs for treatment of these diseases, which in most cases creates several undesirable side effects. I have used these drugs for about 10 years, and know I'm looking for alternatives less agressives to my organism. I'm gifting copies of this book to known and friend doctors, one experienced psychiatrist, and one experienced endocrinologist. It's important to have their support to implement this change, considering the complexity of the disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Excellent strategies and natural remedies for bipolar illness.

About to embark into a war of unimagined horror, few of their particular stories were preserved or documented. \\"Faces of the Civil War\\" takes those personal mementos and visiting cards as a hook to pull the reader into many previously untold stories. This winning combination of powerful images, extensive archival research, and accessible journalistic writing provides a welcome addition to anyone's Civil War book collection. It also can grab and hold student's interest in this endlessly fascinating era of U.S. history."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSI: 3 Demensations of Murder","review":"Fun game, especially if your a mystery fan. I liked gathering evidence and running it all through the lab. Be warned, you can spend hours on each case. My friends were lined up to borrow the game after I completed all 5 cases. Make sure you have plenty of memory and a decent graphics card. Graphics are good, and characters from the show will assist you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but could be better","review":"This was a great game that makes you use your powers of observation and put on your logical thinking cap. The graphics are great and the characters are familiar. Since you are able to fully install the CD onto your PC there aren't long waits while the game scoops data off the CD. The crimes were imaginative with tons of clues for you to process and sort out.The only problem is that it's fairly easy to receive a master rating after running through the crimes a few times. And once you run through the scenarios, it becomes boring. You already know all the ways to win, so why play it again? Maybe a way to fix this is to put something random in it so that a different suspect is the criminal each time. Or have new crimes available for download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely makin it","review":"Although the game itself is awesome, it doesn't play well on my PC. I've had to purchase a new video card just to play it and my PC just isn't as up to date (2 yrs old!) as it needs to be since the makers of the game have made it for newer PC's and obviously to heck with the others.Had I known prior to purchasing I would not have purchased this game.Not all the people that purchase these games are also able to spend hundreds of dollars for newer PC's just to play.Very disappointed with overall performance and the step up in computer software/hardware necessary just to play.I believe in advancing technology, but this is a game....meant to be fun....not expense after expense after expense just to play.Very sorry I paid so much for something I can't use."},{"rating":"1","title":"sworn off of s1!!!","review":"i loved s1...before this pos! i have slacker jesus, exit through fear, and the sound that ends creation. i also have the demo for exit through fear and s1's cover of sabbaths \\"who are you.\\" this cd is a waste of money; its a \\"best of\\" compilation with spoken word between the songs! dont waste YOUR money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Band going through rehab???","review":"WTF?? Is the band going through drug rehab and pushed into church?? I proudly own \\"Exit Through Fear\\" and \\"Sound That Ends Creation\\". Those 2 CD's rock and I really got into this band. But what happened here? There's less than a handful of songs that even resemble the sound of those CD's. There's a bunch of songs that accomplish nothing good, and there's literally a bunch of tracks that are just spoken religious-like passages. Why? This just makes this CD a complete joke. Save your God-spoken messages for Sunday, and give us the music we've come to expect! This band is still considered \\"Underground\\" and this is only going to dump them into the sewer with the rats and spiders.

Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Love","review":"I picked up this movie because I love the actor Heath Ledger. I was thrilled with this movie the entire time I watched it. It was definately something new for me in the way of a drug movie, but it wasn't completely about the heroin. It was also about love. There was love for each other, and love of the drug. Through the entire movie the viewer is left to figure out which love is paramount.Heath did an amazing job portraying Dan. And Abbie Cornish did a very good job playing the title character Candy. The supporting cast was also very good and helped tie the movie together.I will definately be purchasing a copy of this movie because it does say a lot about the relationships people have with each other, and how an addiction, be it anything, can effect them. I learned a lot watching this and it prompted me to read the book, which is also worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I read the book first and, as usual, it was not as good as the book.

The story...the acting...the direction...the production values...all are extremely well done. This film is based on the book Candy, which I understand is largely autobiographical (and watching the film, one has this impression). I'd seen Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain (another devastating movie), and I must say that his performance here is every bit as accomplished; Abbie Cornish is also excellent. The fact that this film deals so openly, so honestly with addiction to hard drugs, I can only imagine, is the sole reason why it's never gained such wide appeal here in the US. This is a shame since Candy is not merely a 'drug film,' it's incredibly, wildly romantic, for instance. At least the Australians got it as it won all the big awards down under- as it well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite movie ever","review":"This movie is what made me fall in love with Heath. The entire cast is brilliant. Breaks my heart every time I see it, especially the ending. Beautifully written, Luke Davies is a phenomenal poet/author. I can't get this movie out of my head, it's so haunting. Candy's mother (Noni Hazlehurst) is so perfect for her role, and Tony Martin, Candy's father, made me cry. I don't understand why this movie isn't more popular"},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 B-sides are well worth collecting!","review":"Great bands use B-sides to stretch out and experiment, try something new. One of my favorite U2 songs is actually a very strange b-side - \\"Walk to the Water.\\" The rockin' \\"Silver and Gold\\" and the pop heaven of \\"Sweetest Thing\\" (I agree with the first reviewer - this is the best version; the other one is too cluttered) are available on the B-side second disk of U2's first greatest hits package. But \\"Race Against Time\\" is a very interesting sonic journey with sped up bass guitar and explosive drumming from Larry M. It reminds me of Pink Floyd's \\"Running\\" - same kind of run-away feel although it doesn't really sound like that song at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"So mad!!","review":"So I went the other day to Ulta to buy more of the pore purifying foaming wash, but I didn't find it.

Well, to my shock, after 5 days of use, I had a severe outbreak of blemishes & my skin was extremely reddened & dry. I do not at all recommened these products for anyone with dry & sensitive skin.

I also purchased a puppy for my husband as a wedding gift. They were a GREAT pair of flip-flops and due to the fact that I bought them on my honeymoon they held of bit of sentiment (as much as a flip-flop can). Well...the new puppy has a love for all things that do not belong to him, i.e. my beloved havaina flip-flop! They met their demise several months later! I just had to replace them so I went straight to Amazon. Found their identical match for about half of what I paid for them at my resort in Jamaica. They shipped EXTREMELY fast! My only complaint is that the sizing was slightly off from my original pair. I ordered the exact same size but the new pair was a little larger. No problem really because they weren't TOO big, just noticably different.

I received them today and they say size 7/8. Basically, the sizing is off (probably due to them being made in Brazil compared to US sizes) so be careful.When I received the new pair today, the bottom is scuffed and they do not look brand new. Additionally, one of the small round pieces of the strap that goes through to the bottom of the shoe is falling out and does not seem like it will last.Wouldn't recommend ordering them on Amazon, better off going to a store that sells them and trying on to find your size and making sure the pair is well assembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item was a full size smaller than actual size","review":"I ordered a 35/36.

Recording without the guide is as clunky as your first VCR. Plus, the guide only goes out about 72 hours.

The former was the combative writer who, with her brilliant prose, greatly contributed to showcasing the horror of life under the old regime; the latter is still up for definition. One thing is for sure: she ended her activism when her party took power. The old problems, compounded by the new -corruption on the rise, crime, the health crisis, and the government's indifference or unwillingness to face them- apparently do not merit scrutiny or criticism from Mrs. Gordimer.

One of the movies I came home with was In Search of Lovecraft, a low-budget affair set in modern-day San Francisco. The acting is amateurish (barely above porn movie quality), the sets are cheap (every place has that barely-furnished look that comes when directors rent a house for a weekend and don't have enough in the budget to dress the rooms realistically), and the special effects are mediocre. On the other hand, the script is halfway decent and it's clear the writer is actually a fan of H.P. Lovecraft and tried hard to stick to the Mythos and Lovecraftian themes.As for that chick on the cover, I have no idea who that is--she's not in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-watchable mess","review":"This is a no budget, bad efx (when there are any), poor acting, waste of space.

His \\"The Water Park\\" made me laugh so hard that I cried. I literally had to pull over along the side of the road and compose myself before I could drive the rest of the way home that night. The way he describes being stuck in the giant tube (Nay nay, it was a medium tube at best) pushed me over the top. When I saw that title was included on the DVD, I quickly placed the order. I was so disappointed when we all sat down to watch it (after I'd told my whole family how hilarious it was), to find out that the version on the DVD is much abbreviated. The whole part about having to be \\"shot out of the tube\\" was left out. I was sad. :(This DVD is a little slow to get started, but the finale about Cold Stone Creamery is hilarious. I'm still glad I bought it, but now must start my quest to find to entire Water Park routine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!","review":"This DVD is just too funny for words. Me and my whole family were cracking up during the whole dvd. I've shown it to several friends as well, and no one has been disappointed. John Pinette does an amazing job of making fun of himself and his love affair with food. I was also amazed that he barely curses it in. I think the only bad language he uses is \\"S.O.B.\\" twice, so it is pretty family friendly which is hard to find in good comedy these days. I especially love the part where he goes to Italy and talks about the Italian chefs there. I'm italian and his interpretations are spot on, and ridiculously funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nay Nay!","review":"Nay Nay, don't pass this up if you are looking to get a good laugh.

I'm sorry, was that supposed to be funny? I sat through 25 minutes of this, and realized I was bored. I never laughed in the whole 25 minutes. I don't know what show those other people were watching who said this was funny, but this obviously wasn't it. If you want to hear 1 hour and 15 minutes of some large guy talking about food, excercise, his fatness and how miserable he is because of it, then this may be the show for you. NOT funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRASTIC Change in Appearance","review":"John Pinette's appearance has changed so drastically in the last 10 years I would never have guessed it was him-- I hadn't seen him since the Seinfeld finale. He looks more like a young Orson Wells. God bless him for losing weight, but I liked the heavier verson. I can't believe all the 5 star reviews. I guess that's proof of the dumbing down of America. I laughed maybe twice during the show; very low brow humor. Over an hour's worth of food related jokes gets old after about ten minutes. I bought this DVD because I remember John back when he was funny. He needs to come up with some new and VARIED material. Remember his old \\"Tattoo as Batman\\" routine, that was classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Starving--John Pinette","review":"I saw John Pinette late 2008 on The View and thought he was absolutely the funniest man ever.

GET OUT OF THE LINE\\"","review":"How could you go wrong with the guy who put the Seinfeld clan away. I remember John from years ago and he was a pretty funny comedian. It was during the playoff games, was among friends and I said hey turn on Comedy Central this guy John Pinette is on. Everyone was up for it, we turn it on (it was about quarter way in when we turned it on)and after about ten minutes we could not catch a breath from laughing so hard. So I had to own the video, I've lent it to colleagues at work, friends, and the results were all the same. Belly-aching laughter. The best part about this stand-up routine is the fact that there is very little potty language in it, so you can play it in front of children and they will probably miss those couple of words from laughing so hard themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"What!??","review":"John Pinette is one of my favorie comedians, but this dvd is a joke (and not a funny one) There may be 2 or 3 new jokes; that's it, the rest are recycled from his last dvd.

He appeals to everyone. He's not mean spirited, he's not crude, he's just funny down to his (well-padded) bones.And to think this man almost DIDN'T become a comedian... he almost spent his career as an accountant! Egad.

Lyrically he relaxed a little from the puzzling pop poetry of the Bongos . Musically the sound is lush yet dangerous, like a jungle, mixing Richard's superb guitar with strings. A few songs sound like aims at commercial acceptance (fat chance), but \\"Before You Were Born,\\" \\"Where the Truth Lies,\\" \\"River to River\\" and \\"To the Pure\\" are, indeed, pure of heart. One of my absolute favorite CDs of the 1990s. It's not too late to buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barone brings it","review":"This is a very catchy pop album without the recent trend of foul-mouthed \\"hidden\\" lyrics that seems to permeate the audio waves of many current radio stations. This here is just clever music with a beat and the tunes are quite catchy. This is the kind of stuff I would prefer to hear when driving around in my car and that's the best reason I can find to buy the CD, play the CD and shut off the radio. And Barone is still kicking out tunes so I will keep my ears peeled."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overlooked classic","review":"This album was the first I'd heard of Richard Barone and I've been following his (under-exposed) career ever since. This is one of those artists I CAN'T PRAISE HIGHLY ENOUGH. There really is no one better, IMHO.

Neil David has been called the \\"Norman Rockwell of Native America\\" and rightfully so. His illustrations are some of the best and showing both front and back views of each katsina is much appreciated.

Some who critiqued the film showed very clearly that they hadn't even watched it. Without giving away the plot, the film circles around an abandoned church that is inhabited by three very stubborn sisters; much like you'd find on the missionary board of a very influential and \\"old-school\\" Baptist church. It is a musical, so there is singing. It's a film you can watch with your family and kids of all ages. The film has been on pay-per-view, Showtime and BET. It's reminds me of initial Tyler Perry projects. Great story, uplifting message, wonderful songs and beautiful voices. Johnnie Taylor's (Disco Lady) daughter is the female lead...and it's great to see her sing. Also, Andre Pitre who has a fabulous singing voice is the lead actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but Confusing","review":"I do believe the story line was a good one, but it became confusing and so I had a hard time following parts of the play/movie.

Bolin plays a variety of styles, from his trademark, searing slide guitar on \\"Wildfire\\" to some nice acoustic work (and his lead vocal) on \\"Spanish Lover\\". I particularly like \\"Summer Breezes\\"...great song and Bolin plays some great slide work, particularly on the beautiful, melodic ending.

Discovered it in a local Safeway where previously lived, but after moving cannot find it locally now. It is relatively inexpensive versus other hot sauces (especially if you buy in bulk). It is nicely flavored, very hot (but not insanely so) and conveniently packaged in a well sealed plastic squeeze bottle with flip cap. I have gone from adding several drops in a bowl of chili to a very generous squirt from the bottle as growing to love this hot sauce. Buying a whole case seems like a alot for even the most avid fan, but sharing with family and friends has been popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great router for the money","review":"I love this wi-fi base!

Most people don't want to spend $200 on a router when they can get a cheap Linksys for half the cost. However, there are no setup hassles, no problems, and no incompatibilities with the AirPort.It works on any Mac and supposedly supports Windows as well (though I haven't tried it). Not only does this fine piece of equipment work well, it's also very attractive as far as routers go.The only real drawback is that only one computer can be physically connected, but this is easily overlooked by the ease of installing AirPort cards in recent Macs. The 1999 clamshell iBook was the first to introduce this technology, and most subsequent models will accept a card.Speed is good on this as well, as is range. There also seems to be a bit less interference as far as 2.4GHz phones go, but be safe and use a 5.8 within close proximity of the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple does it again....","review":"What can I say....easy to set up, easy to operate, rarely a problem.

I purchased a refurbished unit at my local Apple Store for $120. This was my first foray into wireless at home. Setup was challenging (it was not a snap) but I got there. I needed to call Apple once for setup help. Now two months into wireless,and I must say it has been relatively troublefree and operationally fine. I don't have to think about it, other than an occassional need to log-on when the signal is not immediately recognized by a computer.

The whole purpose of buying the damn thing was so that I could use it upstairs, but I can't even walk more than ten feet away from it without losing service.

Songs like \\"Only Hope\\" and \\"Let that be enough\\" give you that warm and tingley feeling. Jon foreman's vocals confidently lead through both tracks. And other titles like \\"Something more\\",\\"Company Car\\", and the cover song \\"New way to be human\\" show that Switchfoot has the balance to rock on some tracks but to also tone it down and create honest worship songs. I highly,highly recommend that you go out and get this cd.Its the best album i have ever heard. Switchfoot deserves the title as the best christian band out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Never Knew They Were A Christian Band!","review":"The first time I heard of Swichfoot it was when I had to fill up an extra space on a mixed CD a friend of mine was making for me. I couldn't think of another song to put in so I typed in a random word (\\"Switch\\"- the name of her hamster) on her napster search and chose the song \\"New Way to Be Human\\" by Switchfoot for her to download and put on my CD. When I got my CD I absolutely LOVED the song! It was exactly what I love in music- a mix of rock/pop with a good beat and lyrics that I could understand and relate to. I didn't know that Switchfoot was a Christian band until I went online to buy their complete CD. (I ended up buying all three, which I love!! =D) It shocked me, but I was pleased too. It's nice to have some good music that has a good message to it. I recommend this to everyone!! It is amazing music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat rock mixes with thoughtful heartfelt ballards","review":"New Way To Be Human jumped out (quite literally) at me at a bible week I went to earlier this year.

There are four really good songs: The title track, Incomplete, Company Car, and Amy's Song. This has a much more pop-type sound than their newer albums, which are more hard rock oriented. New way to be Human talks about Christ being the \\"only way to be human\\". Incomplete isw about being incomplete without Christ. Company Car is kind of a weird song about being a businessman, but the tune is catchy. Amy's Song is kind of weird too. Has similar lyrics to Newsboys Deep End and Kutless' Down. All the other songs are OK but not as good as these ones I have mentioned. I put this album in a tie withThe Beautiful Letdownfor the Foot's best album.

While I am reading another bedtime book, he is often looking over at where his 'Binkit' book is lying rather than listening to the other story, so he usually gets a second reading of it.Sandra Boynton's books are so wonderful in that they entertain the child and the adult in equal measure.

The basic structure of the game is virtually identical, but the major difference is the lack of fun. There is no sense of humor and no cool videos. And the competing races are not at all memorable. Without these elements of entertainment I very quickly felt like I was just reverse engineering a computer program.Also there are holes in the playability of the game. Several times I got stuck in a state where I had no resources to do anything and I just sat there turn after turn with nothing happening, waiting to be overwhelmed by other teams.

Diplomacy you have to discover through tech reserch, even then it's so mundane it hurts. unimaginative planet design, and tedious turns.Don't get me wronge, there are a handfull of things that are decent.

I purchased this game shortly after its release and have already upgraded it by downloading the changes Stardock has designed.

You are suddenly attacked with more ships than it seems possible to have been built in the time you had played (especially considering the amount of research that should have been necessary). Even if i set the bonuses of my civilization to max research I still find the other civilizations coming up with attack ships before I have even began research on them and by the time i can build much beyond defenders there is a fleet of invading ships numbering more than twice their known planets.I am disappointed in this game enough to go back to playing civilization and wish i had saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring!!!!","review":"i played this game maybe a few days and then never again.

MoO2 is by far better in terms of complexity and fun. The \\"decisions\\" you have to make, whether you want to be good or evil repeat themselves all the time and are not exciting after the first time. The research tree is bad, not documented and neglects the slightest approach of userfriendlyness. The whole setting of the game is boring and repetetive. You can only play the humans and lead them to another stunning victory over the other inferior species, so imho it is a truly fascist setting. The handling of your empire and your fleets is bad. The \\"battles\\" are abysmal. The politics are worse than in MoO2. I would not buy it again and I would not accept it as a present."},{"rating":"2","title":"love these can't stop buying them","review":"I love these bars which I discovered 3 years ago when I needed to eat more foods with a better glycemic response.

The chocolate turtle flavor doesn't come through very strongly. It mostly tastes like the soy crisps that cover the outside, and the (very chewy) caramel in the center. They taste good, but you should know what you're getting.These are fairly small so they're great to carry with you as a snack. They won't melt or deform in a bag.

Maybe it was just old, as others have said. It was so hard and chewy that it hurt my jaw. The taste was ok, not as chocolatey as I had hoped. The caramel was good but pretty sticky, and it got on my fingers. The nuts and things on the outside were pretty good, but kept falling off and onto the floor.

But Mary Daly, member of the worlds only majority group with minority status, is living in times which for Feminism are like times in 1940s Germany - where it's an open field for one side, with legislation on their side, while the other lies open for abuse. Let us not forget that what is termed politically correct has but a feeble connection with what is morally and ethically correct. What was politically correct in 1940s Germany stopped being PC there in May 1945. Likewise, this book could only be politically correct in today's culture of mysandronism. Rather than convince us that women are the übermenschen required to save the planet, this book merely shows the moral and spiritual depths to which victimologist Mary Daly has degraded herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roseanne","review":"Very disappointing.

I have yet to deal with the company regarding the warranty, but I anticipate having to take time out of my day and money out of my pocket to return it.It's also one of the loudest compressors of its size that I've ever used.

This sex is real too. This movie is so sexual it makes Sex and the City look like Sesame Street. The film is about a handful of characters, all with their own stories and problems, search for, well, sex. This film covers all bases. There is straight sex, gay sex between two men and two women, and men and women pleasuring themselves. There is even a scene with group sex. And it's all real. It shows about as much as any porn would show. The stories are not fantastic, some characters are not developed enough outside the bedroom, and some senarios are silly or unrealistic. The acting was about as good as the acting in a real porn, and the script they were working with was packed solid with cliches. If you want a film with wonderful acting and a compelling story, go somewhere else, and even if you want to see the film for the sex, go get a porn. It is not satisfying in either aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film message could have been sent in a less open way!","review":"The message of the film or director might be indeed sent to the audiences, but I questioned if it could have been sent in a much less open way.

The actors suck, the plot was thin and the character development wasn't up to par with the pathetic sob scenes. It's not funny either. And it's certainly not a realistic portrayal of sex in any sense of the word... there's a relatively hidden tiny minority that engage in this type of lifestyle.

The movie has nothing to do with a bus! It refers to a shortbus, which I felt means, misfits, and outcasts of society, etc. The movie starts of very slowly but picks up momentum later on. This movie is full of sexual encounters, which show full nudity and sex acts. Even though they try to depict \\"The Lifestyle\\", I feel they fell short. I am not naiive, but I know lots of that promiscuous sex goes on between heterosexuals and homosexuals. The movie touches on all of these lifestyles. This is not a movie you would want to invite a bunch of friends over to see. At least that is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUINED CIRCLE JERK","review":"As it was my turn to host the monthly circle jerk I decided to purchase Shortbus.

I am astounded that anyone could have rated it more than a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful film","review":"This film is boring with no plot or point, it is primarily a gay film that would be a good method of showing anyone why a gay lifestyle sucks. The actors are bad and unattractive, even the sex scenes are boring and antierotic. I watched it once and threw it away.

A movie about sex so vile that ironically it lacks any trace of sexiness. Or dignity. Or character development or story. Graphic sex aside, the \\"film\\" is more pornographic in the theme it so clumsily conveys: commitment be darned, sexual gratification is an individual right and the key to happiness.And don't even get me started on the acting.Makes me want to go re-rent \\"The Whales of August.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Shortbus","review":"was not porn - just a good indie type film with a twist, enjoyed it, it reminded me of Chain Of Desire which is a great film which it was a little more on the traditional side, where Shortbus went out side the box, I hope for more films like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shortbus","review":"Very funny video.

It won, I believe, the GLADD award in 2007 for best film. Excellent movie and very, very interesting as to how it was actually developed and produced.I was incredibly frustrated when, near the end of the movie with only about 15 minutes left the DVD froze. I found no way to advance the film even using the chapters.Thankfully, Amazon did replace the film with another DVD. Sadly, it froze up in the exact same spot. Apparently there was a glitch in the production of these DVDs. I did manage to get to the end of the film with many stops and starts. Very distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about very little","review":"I was prepared to really enjoy this film.

This, sadly, has little going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance Art Gone Horribly Wrong","review":"After reading the description and reviews of this movie I was really looking forward to seeing it. It sounded thought-provoking, intelligent and provocative. Unfortunately after the first few minutes the actors began to speak. The acting was fine, but the dialogue was ridiculous and by the end I didn't care about any of the characters. As another review said, this one is definitely a movie to watch with the fast forward button. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice idea, but really not worth your time","review":"I love the idea of a film that depicts sexuality as it exists, rather than in the exploitative manner of pornagraphy which reflects only (mostly unrealizable) fantasy. But this film takes that seemingly simple idea nowhere. In the end, it is just a big bore. The plot (if there is one) mostly centers around a woman's quest to have an orgasm, but one gets the feeling that it just so happened that that was the best footage that the director shot, so he used it the most in the final edit. The film has a workshop production feel -- like the director just gave the actors some ideas of themes and then yelled \\"action\\", figuring he'd use whatever worked, rather than producing a coherently written film containing a beginning, middle and end. Unfortunately, I think the director only gets one shot at this concept, so we'll not see if he could get it right the next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"sook yin lee -gorgeous","review":"the story was very interesting and informative. the best part of the film was viewing sook yin lee's beautiful body and face. i wish dhe was more visible throughout the film instead of only at the beginning. her acting was good also. i bought another film with her in it. the men in the film did not act as good as her but the story line was interesting. i hope to see more of her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shortbus","review":"This was an interesting movie. It is definitely for adult 18 and older but what makes the movie good is the following:1 - sex scenes were not restricted and provide some surprises when watching2 - The actor had to be good to do some of things in the movie which I think anyone will find interesting regardless of gender3 - I looked at this as neither straight nor gay in turn of a movie. It concentrated on everyone's issues. I happen to be turning the channel one day and saw this on logo. I almost didn't watch this the first time I saw it because I thought it was a gay movie. Much to my surprise.3 - In the end I wasn't sure I got what the real issue was other than everyone has problem within.

(The class is sexuality and eroticism in global perspectives) I'm an anthropology major and this class is classified as anthropology so I took it thinking it was about sexuality in different cultures.I was totally and utterly disgusted by the sex in this film. Sex is supposed to be an intimate thing between a married man and a woman who love each other and want to show it, not public! Do not watch if you're offended by public and animalistic sex.

This movie though flounders around in half-realized concepts which never really gel together.

This film explores the rich, complex emotional lives of a variety of characters. While superficially the characters are all very different (straight, gay, partnered, single, rich, poor, etc), what they all have in common is that they're all at a crossroads in terms of their sexual behavior, and how it either helps them to connect with other people and their own true selves, or not. To quote one of the actors in the film from the (excellent) documentary in the special features section of the DVD, the sex is really just a metaphor for something else. \\"Shortbus\\" is a deep, joyous, cathartic and beautiful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Traviata","review":"I ordered it Oct 22, paid premium for expedited posting and left for Rome and the Opera on Nov 1.

But a triggerfish is a triggerfish and what is written in this book about them is pure fiction. I'm not saying you'll never be nipped by a trigger fish though they're more likely to tug at your hair than bite you. You're certainly not going to climb out of the boat with one hanging on to you. There is great diving around the oil rigs and I would not want anyone to be spooked away from doing so thinking they will be devoured by trigger fish. There's a lot of fiction in this book. It's entertaining and Mr. Fontova's political views are pretty much in line with mine but it does not portray a realistic view of diving and spearfishing around the oil rigs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fish Story","review":"Fontava is a Cuban immigrant who scuba dives and spear fishes around the oil rigs that dot the continental shelf around New Orleans. The oil platforms have become artificial reefs that attract sea creatures and consequently, divers. The sport is dangerous, but not insanely so; its enthusiasts have swum and hunted for decades, experiencing plenty of scratches and bites but relatively few fatalities. The author apparently decided to write in the style of the WWF, which I found off-putting. But beneath the macho posturing is his sincere lifelong love affair with skin diving and the friends who share the adventures, thrills, dangers, stories, and parties. Like most hunters, they are conservationists at heart; like many men, they look back at their wild youths and marvel at their survival. Fontava has a nice sense for describing the primal thrill that comes from testing oneself against the forces of nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disconnected Jumble of Macho Bar-room Stories","review":"This book reminds me of the kind of stories you hear in a bar. At first, it can be entertaining to hear colorful characters in a bar tell drunken stories, and if the stories seem less than credible, well, that's all part of the fun.But after a while, the stories all start to sound the same. You get tired of the teller's propensity to end every paragraph with \\"there's just no getting around it.\\" If the guy trots out a tired movie analogy one more time (\\"it's like that time in Dirty Harry when Clint Eastwood points the gun at that guy...\\") you're going to run screaming from the room.Not every book has to be a literary masterpiece. But something resembling proper use of punctuation and grammar helps. It would have been possible to write a book on this topic, rather than a disconnected jumble of stories with no coherent narrative. There are some fun stories in here, but the book is too painful to read to justify wading through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Read in tooth and fin\\"","review":"This book is not written for admirers of elegant prose.The author's Darwinian view of nature as being \\"read in tooth and fin\\" is distorted and is no longer teneble.

If you slow a Supremes song way down, it becomes, whoa man, heavy. If you overly dramatize your voice and throw in a fake vibrato you become, ooh baby, soulful. Spin a Leslie speaker really fast and you're psychedelic.Then again, you might just sound like Vanilla Fudge. Faky voice trills, heavy-handed organ playing, poor arrangements of ordinary songs. Basically, all the excess of sixties-type bands poured into one really boring album.If you want to hear what was great about that musical decade, buy \\"Sgt Pepper's\\", the Stone's \\"Aftermath\\", \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", even a Steppenwolf album. Hey, buy \\"Green Tambourine\\" by the Lemon Pipers. But give this one a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Very Special","review":"Vanilla Fudge was one of the original psychedelic rock bands.

This stuff is what \\"hippies\\", \\"heads\\", the turned on generation was listening to. This was FM. We used to call it \\"acid rock\\" cuz half the people were trippin at the concerts and it was good music to trip to. This music is a reflection of what we were doing at the time. It speaks for us during those days.Vanilla Fudge were great performers with some pretty cool tunes. They might not be the greatest band of all time but they gave us a really good rush every time they played! This album is a momento of some of the most wonderful times ever experienced on this planet... the late sixties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great game","review":"This is a great realistic team base first person shooter. However you do need to have a good computer. I am running a 3.0Ghz with 512MB and a geforce graphics card and this game runs great. The guns are real life weapons and not futureristic (which I hate). You also can't beat the price. If you like first person shooters and are looking for a great game at bargain price go buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon.com needs a zero rating just for NWO","review":"Avoid this game at all costs. The framerate drops into single digits during gameplay, which means it's choppy almost all the time. Once you get into a firefight, it gets so bad, it's almost unplayable.Voice acting is a joke, it sounds like it was recorded on a home PC on the cheapest mic you could find. Graphics are dated about 1994, slightly better than Wofenstein 3D, slightly worse than Quake I.The missions are generic, and the only real difficulty to this game is surviving the rounds because of all the chop caused by the slow framerate. This game is bound for the discount bin, and even then, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"OK, unless you have a good computer you cant really get the best out of this game, like the guy who has written the other review. I happen to have a TOP spec computer in the form of an Alienware Aurora DDR (3.0Ghz 800mhz FSB, 1gig Corsair XMS RAM, Audigy plat. 2 EX soundcard), the sound is brilliant with a good speaker setup(6.1 Megaworx 600watt) and a brilliant graph card (Geforce FX 5800 Ultra), so if you have all that then go for it, the game rocks, esp. in multiplayer mode. You can get by with a P4 2.4GHZ too, and a Ti4600, 512Mb RAM, 300 watt speakers(5.1), with that spec. it will run smooth enough for you to have minimal problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and not wOrth it","review":"This truck was not worth $8.18 it was so small it look like a hot wheel car it's that small.

However, the lack of budget has not restricted the filmmakers, Phil Thomas and Matt Brooks, in providing an outright entertainer.Lead and supporting actors - Kris Miller, Seregon O'Dassey, Dan Van Wert, and Bourke Floyd have acted very well, unlike typical acting we see in low budget movies.Phil and Matt have proven they stand above the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Very disappointing dvd. Brilliant has published some great music performance dvds, but this is not one of them. \\"Actors\\" simulate Dvorak and peers some supposedly simulating performing a Dvorak string quartet while in an overgrown field and forrest. This dvd also contains two separate cds of Dvorak compositions - neither of which I was interested in hearing. If you want a great 1 hour video about Dvorak which traces his entire life using numerous photographs, I highly recommend the dvd \\"Deo Gratias\\" also available from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and uncommon","review":"This DVD was not at all what I expected, but works so very well as a way to show possible dance interpretations of atypical dance music.Ballet instructors and theater directors will love this series for its open minded possibilities.

A faithful rendering musically would lack that wonderful charisma that made them the greatest band in the world for the first 5 years of their career. (The last 2 years are best forgotten...) Almost none of these bands have got the charisma to pull off Clash songs. They wind up turning them into dull little jingles that sound as average as any of the slop most of these bands put out themselves. Just do yourself a favor and buy the genuine article. It doesn't get any better in rock than London Calling."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD makes me CRINGE","review":"This was absolute torture for me, being the huge Clash fan that I am. With each new song I actually cringed. I was so disgusted with this album. \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go?\\" was completely butchered by Ice Cube and that other dude.

When I first this compact disc, it made me want to cut my wrists. Fortunatly for me, I was in a music store, so I could go to the REAL clash section, get their first cd, and listen to it. It saved my life. As far as this cd goes...if the clash were jesus, then this is satan/aka mephistapheles, or maybe the anti christ. This is kryptonite to superman, it is a shower to a gutter punk. This cd should be banned, so it doesn't hurt anyone else.

Especially Ice Cube and mack 10, those guys are complete idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tribute is a disgrace","review":"With the exception of 4 songs (No Doubt, 311, Rancid, and the Bosstones) this album is an absolute disgrace to the legacy of the Clash. The Cracker song gets points for interesting countryfied version of \\"White Riot,\\" but even these few standouts are not enough of a reason to purchase this CD. Ice Cube and Mack 10 absolutely destroy \\"Should I Stay\\" and that is not meant to be a compliment. Moby and Heather Nova could not have done a weaker version of \\"Straight to Hell\\" one of the all time greatest Clash songs. As for the Afghan Wigs, how could you in good conscience layer the lyrics for \\"Stand By Me\\" over \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\" WOW (also not a compliment). Equally poor reviews could be written about every other song on this CD. Do yourself a favor and just get an actual ablum by the Clash. Sorry for this CD Joe."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Clash the only band that matters","review":"This album is OK if one or more of the bands on it are personal favourites but as an album I found it almost unlistenable.

This one is a pleasant suprise. As usual, the best tracks are the ones where the artist is not attempting to simply reproduce the original. I couldn't disagree with Steven Stolder more, I thought the Indigo Girls version of 'Clampdown' proved just what great lyricists the Clash were. The Clash were never so easy to categorise politically, those fortunate enough to see the film 'Rude Boy' (possibly never seen in the US?)would appreciate what I mean. My favourite is 'Clash City Rockers' (only on the import version?), which for me evokes the real spirit of the Clash I remember live in Sydney just after London Calling was released. Essential for any Clash fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God! Is this thing bad.","review":"I didn't think anything remotely attached to the Clash could be this bad.

If you want to pay tribute to the Clash, go buy one of their albums.....Any of them would be far greater than this fiasco. To the bands who participated, it's not your fault, I would never pass up the chance to cover one of the greatest bands of all time. To the traitor who decided on the bands, think of the great punk bands who were actually influenced by your music, and how much they would have enjoyed covering the greats.

No Doubt? Indigo Girls? Dwight Yoakam showed more passion when he covered Train in Vain honky-Tonk style. Besides, Garbage already 'covered' the song with Stupid Girl.I love to see the Clash reach a new audience. I think it's great that Ice Cube came on board. The cause is more than worthy so I hope it raises tons of money for the Children's Hospital, but as far as tribute albums go...this is more a tribute to 90's one hit wonders than the Clash.But I will say this...(and I'm not a big fan, but...)

The Beatles, Jimi, Dylan etc. The Clash is one of those groups that there is no band that can or should cover them.

This compilation just goes to prove that corporate music has reinserted its head up its arse - one of the very things the Clash railed against in the late 70's. I mean c'mon - 311...Third Eye Blind! Give the chance to cover our heros to those who follow in their footsteps and force change in a stagnant music industry - no matter what musical genre.

I got it home and put the needle on the thing and went WOW! It had everything that Rock N'Roll is about. No one knew at that time that we were listing to the birth of Derek and The Dominoes. Bonnie Bramlett's voice is blistering and sweet at the same time. For the next 30 years I could still hear her in my brain saying \\"Hey would you give us some red lights, 'cause this is a red light song\\". The album's still in the stack on the top shelf of my closet. I saw it on Amazon and it was time again for \\"Goin' Home\\" and \\"That's What My Man Is For\\". Order it for yourself.

There's no connection between the text and the exercises. In the exercises there appear some inane, open-ended questions that seem to be trying to make some unfathomable point. This is not a book anyone can learn from. I would strongly advise any student who must use this book as their course textbook to CHANGE COLLEGES.

Very glad only used at where I went to community college and the 4-year I now attend uses the vastly better James Stewart book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no no no!","review":"This is the book I used for my introductory sequence in calculus, and, unfortunately I also used the multivariable version for my vector calculus course. I cannot say enough bad things about this book! I can't believe that I have to give it even 1 star! I am a physics major, and although that may color my opinion, this book in no way prepares one for higher level mathematics. I found myself forced to review the concepts that I was supposed to have learned, such as Fourier series, and so forth. The only way that I was able to do calculus-based physics was by learning the applied mathematics from the physics text itself! Fortunately, I had a great professor for my single and multiple variable course (he hated the book, too!), and I was able to ace them, but it would have been easier without this book. Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a stinker!","review":"Had to suffer through this book for undergraduate science background requirement. Also used the multivariable book by same authors for Calc2 requirement. Full of extremely poor explanations, expects you to jump from simple examples to complex problems. This would be fine if I was a Harvard math wiz like Deborah Hughes-Hallett. However, few of us are, so how about some better examples and explanations that a normal human being can follow. Also, try examples without skipping so many steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely irritating","review":"My College Calculus professor uses this book as a suppliment to provide examples for the class use. Everyone hates the problems as they are vague and lack any explanation on how to solve the problem or even where to begin. It appears to me that someone wrote a book simply to create problems that cannot be solved by the book's explanations. Calculus requires a working understanding of the ideas and concepts of the base math before an sort of obscure application should be used. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless they already have a good understanding of calculus and wish to delve further into the application of the math to the real world. In that case, buy the book. For the other 95% that are just wanting to learn calculus; go buy a different book that teaches you something first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous Calculus Book","review":"This is quite possibly one of the worst books with which to learn Calculus. There are only sparse examples, and the majority of ones within have virtually no application to the problem sets for each section. \\"Calculus\\" by Thomas and Finney is an incredible book by comparison, with many useful examples and detailed explanations of concepts. If you are required to purchase this book for a course, go ahead and buy it (then sell it like I am doing now), but also look into a supplementary text by Thomas and Finney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is a Waste of Paper","review":"This is a horribly designed book, with vague explanations and problems at the extremes: 30 seconds to solve *or* 20 minutes. In my AP Calculus BC class, our teacher apologized to us a week into the course for having to buy the book. For the remainder of the year, we ended up using worksheets and other materials. I would give it 0 stars if it were possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible book","review":"This book is horrible. The examples don't guide you for all of the problems and the explanations aren't very good either.

I often find myself unable to understand it's concept just because of those calculational error. The company that make this text book is very irresponsible, because they've never try to correct their errors. I have seen some company that actually reward their readers if they ever find a caculational error, but this book is just way out of there. Unbelivablly poorly made, the company made this book to earn money, not to teach students to understand the subject of Calculus~ Do not buy it ever~ As for me, I will run as far away as I can the next time I see a book from JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good text.","review":"I used this book for a one-semester course and I did not gain a very good learning experience from it. The exercises did not coordinate with the examples and concepts that were presented. I had to use Anton's book to supplement this book. I feel that if I did not go to a different text I would not have gotten above a B in the course. I recommend buying Anton's 5th edition (it is out of print, but available from Amazon) or Stewart's text.

My theory is your class is only as easy as your . If the instructor has communication problems, you turn to your text. But what if your text really, really sucks too??This book has extremely inadequate examples, and they cover only 20% of what they end up giving as homework problems. You simply cannot turn back the page to the explanatory section to see how that particular type of problem is solved. Please, DO NOT purchase this book. I aced trig and pre-cal...both the texts and the teachers were perfect. But I have had to drop my first calculus class because of this bad teacher-text combo.There are better books out there. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"I used this text for Calc I & II college level courses and I was completely disappointed. The examples are very obscure and the approach is far too technical for first timers and experts alike. The solutions to the examples are very hard to trace. I.e. they jump from one part of the equation/problem to another and don't tell you how they got ther, which leaves you feeling uneasy. I think even Isaac Newton would have a hard time with this text. If you can, avoid taking a class that uses this book at all costs, and if you can't, make sure you have an excellent instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is difficult to follow","review":"The book very good problems to work on throughout the book. But, big but it has very poor explaination that asuume that you do have some previous knowledge of the subject.

Hardly any explanations in any of the sections for problem solving. And the homework problems rarely relate directly to the material in the preceding section.

If you have to use this book for calculus, DROP THAT SECTION!!! Unfortunatly for me it's the book the entire math Dept. uses. The Student Answers Book is even worse. You don't even get all the odd problems, it's every other odd problem (i.e.: 1,5,9,...etc.) how stupid is that????? Of all the math courses I've taken this is by far the worst book I've ever had to use. The person that commented on the problems at the end of the chapter being difficult because of the steps skipped during the chapter is correct. I'm just thankful my teacher if teaching the concepts to go along with the ridiculus methods of application teaching this book focuses on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"I had taken Calc I with this book, and now I am in Calc II and we are using this book. I was sitting here trying to read through the sections assigned and getting very agitated with the vagueness of this book. Since day one, I have hated this book. Instead of teaching you theories, concepts, and how to use the applications, recognize different patterns, their idea of teaching you is by giving a few examples for each section. The problem is that they skip 3 or 4 steps, and you have no idea how they arrived at a particular answer. Then, when you get to the homework problems, it is hard to do many of them because the examples are ... and do not relate often to the homework problems. Do not buy this book if you don't have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oftem confusing, strange irritating format","review":"I am using this book for a calc II college course, after taking AP Calculus in high school.

The preface says that the authors wished to create a book where students could not derive the answers to exercises from looking at worked out examples. Well golly how convenient.

Instead go to a used bookstore and buy another calculus book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Love It or Hate It.","review":"In my experience with this text, students either love it or hate it. They hate it because it does not offer a brief overview of the topics, like many more popular calculus text books. Instead \\"Calculus: Single Variable\\" requires that a student throughly read many examples as it explains rules and laws along the way. Those who love the text do so because the examples offer a firmer understanding of the concepts at hand, instead of just covering enough material to answer the questions at the end of each section. Although this is a very good text book, it definitely requires patience on behalf of the reader, and may not be the book for students who just want to slide by."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really is that bad","review":"Most of the other reviewers agree: This book is awful. I had to buy other books and always go on-line to find better explanations to do my homework. The authors forget to explain how to do the problems in the problem-sets.

(My wife and I are a mezzo and a baritone, and just completed a duet recital with almost the same repertoire.) I disagree, though, about the recitatives. They are some of the most expressive I've ever heard and are worth the price of the disk alone. Bartoli's vocalism and artistry are, as always, amazing. Terfel's tone gets a bit spread when he's singing with Bartoli, perhaps so as to make room for a smaller voice. Still and all, a great recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous","review":"As splendid as Cecilia Bartoli and Bryn Terfel are individually, their glory is just that much expounded when singing together. At many points it seems almost as if they are competing in their melodic virtuosity, but you can tell they are just having the most magnificent time while competing thus. They sing a pleasant variety of duets, and are decidedly fine singing practically any style.I probably enjoy this album more than either singer's individual albums, although they are wonderful themselves.

All I had left was an elective, and I decided on TCP/IP since I had been working with it for some time.Not able to justify the cost of the 5 day Microsoft course, I started looking at \\"test-prep\\" books. When I compared content and actual exam objectives, this one matched closer than any other I could find.I took the exam two weeks ago and scored higher on this test than on any of the other five.

At the end of the day this was the drill still driving screws while the rest were waiting for their batteries to recover.

Scanning to PDF (my main concern) is seamless and quick (much faster than my \\"all in one\\" printer/scanner and stitching things together). It gets the \\"mostly\\" in the title because it's fussy about how the paper is loaded (first time the second sheet was slightly off square and jammed it) and even if I get the stack of papers perfect, about every 6th document it'll stop for no reason and I have to redo the scan).

I am overwhelmed with the influx of new documents and was looking for an upgrade to my older scanners that took too much time to use. Now, when I get a new document I almost immediately scan and throw it away. The One Touch software has been significantly upgraded to previous versions I have used. I still haven't quite figured out the approach to two sided scanning since this device requires you to flip the document and rescan the other side.

The ADF on the first gave up during the warranty period and Visioneer replaced it. The second one (the whole scaner)gave up about a year outside the warranty period, so it's a goner. It's a fairly servicable scanner for the price (when it works), although it really only allows you to feed about 5 to 7 documents at a time. I like the Paperport software.

The left brain's finally connected to the right brain, to quote Neumeier's phrase. We use the book to introduce new hires to the brand concept, then follow up with training on our own brand.

I'm a writer and consultant trying to explain branding to fundraisers, and what I intensely like about Marty Neumeier's brief \\"whiteboard overview\\" (his phrase) of branding is that it answers ALL my questions about branding and brand strategy quickly, simply, with nicely selected examples. It starts with what branding is NOT (not your logo, not your visual ID, not your products). Then it defines what it truly is, \\"A brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service, or company.\\" That's in the first couple of pages. But of course there's so much more.

It gets into areas that traditional marketing and positioning books fear to tread, namely the role of aesthetics in building brands. As a 30-year veteran of Madison Avenue, I've learned the hard way that it doesn't matter how great your strategy is---it's execution PLUS strategy that moves products. Neumeier is one of the first to recognize this simple but elusive truth. It's enough to give one hope for the future of the marketing business. For that matter, for the future of business.

However, I purchased a Kiddy Nite Hawk CO Detector with Digital readout and for some reason, the peak memory level for this product shows about 16PPM while the First Alert Alarm always shows zero.At this point neither one of the alarms have gone off so I'm hoping that my family is safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The Gas Co. said....","review":"I bought this plug in first alert cm detector. The Gas Co rep told me that it only detects at 70ppm, which means I'd likely already have headaches and be vomiting. He recommended I throw it out and buy a cm detector that detects at 400ppm. Also, he said socket plug ins are not effective as most sockets are low on the wall. The best kind is a battery operated detector (400ppm) that is placed within 2 ft of the ceiling. The idea is to be notified before you/family gets headaches and start vomiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet the expectation","review":"Beferoe buying anything in Amazaon I generally see the review and rating.

I rate it as a very good decision!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully we never have to hear it's alarm","review":"This unit was very easy to install. All we did was plug it in.

I purchased two, one for my home and the other for our income property."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a Digital Read CO detector","review":"This is a solid CO detector. The only thing I didn't like is that it is ac powered (with battery backup). The ideal installation location is in a hallway outside the sleeping areas per the NFPA. However, I have no ac outlets in my hallway! Therefore, I put it inside just one of the bedrooms. A digital readout is a must since the alarms will sound with about 70 ppm and 60 minutes exposure. I want to know my CO ppm level even if it doesn't trigger the alarm (mine was 0 ppm). Other nice features are a peak CO ppm reading in a 24 hr period and unobtrusive dim green readout which turns bright blue for reading. Unit is set to End of Life itself after 7 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon was great to work with","review":"This was well-rated by a consumers oraganization and we got them for our home.

You deserve 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product & Good Price","review":"I've always been one to research what type of products I should buy and it was no different for this carbon monoxide alarm. I found out that it was rated well in Consumer Reports. I liked the idea that this monitor only needed a battery for backup purposes. I was afraid we'd bump into it on occasion since it hangs in our hallway and is only a foot or so off the ground, but we haven't as of yet.

There is a digital display on the unit, but the display is always off. The right hand button is to display \\"Peak Level\\" not current level of CO. The CO Memory automatically resets itself back to zero every 24 hours. I wanted to get a unit to monitor current CO levels in the room, a number displayed constantly and hands free.Very tempted to send this back. While it probably works well, it is not what I expected.On the plus side the unit plugs into a wall socket or the power adapter comes free from the unit and allows a remote installation.And like other reviewers have noted the owners manual is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Alert CO Monitor","review":"So far it works good in 3 months - every few days we test it and works good. Only thing could be improved is to have the green light that shows that the monitor is on is so deep inside that we can hardly so from a distance and the reading of amount of CO in the room even while testing is so deem that we can hardly read the number. Dial numbers need more light on them and this could be because the green light is too far in. I may talk to the Company for this in few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"We are very happy with the product so far and we saved a considerable amout going through Amazon.

The only thing that makes me think it's even working is the power light, which is not very bright.

(I returned the product and bought a different brand.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Warranty!!!!","review":"I bought this alarm at Oct 2009 from Amazon. Only after two years, it broke. I call First Alert Warranty department. They told me that they will send me a new alarm but I need pay $6.5 shipping fee. Then came to most annoying apart, they DO NOT take credit card. I have to mail check to them. Only after receiving my check, they will send me the new one. And their warehouse is in different state with their office. That means that I will not have c/o monitor in my house for almost a month!!! That kind of poor warranty this it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery door won't stay closed","review":"I bought two of these earlier this year. Luckily, we have not had an occasion for the alarms to sound. However, on one of the units, the battery door doesn't close properly, and there is not a way to repair it. It stays open slightly most of the time, and occasionally falls open completely. It has been this way since I received it. However, it was not apparent until I opened the product packaging and opened the battery door to insert the batteries. Due to the packaging of this product in hard plastic that had to be completely destroyed to get it out, it wasn't possible to return it once opened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I ordered two of these units in April 2012. Both units have falsed more than once, usually in the middle of the night. The peak level buttons on both were erratic in function from the start -- the button on one unit recently failed completely. I've junked both and ordered a couple of Pro-Tech units to replace them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it work?","review":"Despite the other reviews describing situations where this detector might have even been life-saving, I am not convinced that the detector I received actually worked. I never saw my detector register anything other than zero, even during an incident in which we lit a wood fire in an indoor fireplace and forgot to open the flue. The apartment quickly filled with smoke, and doubtlessly abundant carbon monoxide from the smoldering wood, and yet the detector steadfastly registered 0 and didn't make a peep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carbon Monoxide First Alert","review":"This product was easy to set up and arrived as promised.

Hopefully this unit doesn't end up doing that. The previous detector was from the same brand but a different model; I will post back if this one goes out on me.It's a nice unit and does provide an ac cord that you can plug in 10+ ft away from the actual unit; or you can keep the cord and ac adapter snugged into the back of the unit and plug the entire thing into an outlet. Thats a really nice feature about this model; also the LCD display memorizes the last amount of co2 it has detected so you can always check back to see if you had any leaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works I think","review":"Since I have not had a carbon monoxide alarm go of with the First Alert CO615, I cannot truly tell if it works (product up and running for 4 months). However, I have the unit plugged in by my bedrooms and at a fairly high level because carbon monoxide rises (giving ample time to react). I like how it has a constant battery symbol showing the strength of the battery and has a green light that shows that it is powered on through the outlet. It is not the prettiest thing in the world, but heck smoke detectors aren't either. Overall I have not had a problem with this product and I will post if I do. Recommended at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken low battery indicator; batteries very hard to remove","review":"The detector arrived with a broken low battery detector. Both the batteries it shipped with and a pair of brand new batteries (fresh from the package with an expiration date of 2022) caused the low battery detector chime to sound. Also, the batteries are *very* hard to replace--you have to press very, very hard at just the right angle for them to pop out of the housing. Very frustrating and disappointing for what I hoped would be an easy to use product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design!","review":"After the batteries are installed, the battery door (which is on the front of the unit) does not close. It just flops open. The door catch is a horrible design. Even if you could get it to close, I wouldn't trust that the latch would be durable enough to handle multiple battery changes.

Many times, I have to hold the switch down for several seconds, then it will switch, but switch back after a few seconds. There have even been times where I had to disconnect the switcher all together, just to get to the other computer, so I could shut it down, rehook up the KVM switch, and restart, so that the KVM switch would recongnize the fact that there is another computer hooked up to it.This product is worthless to me.

Most of the tracks have, as their foundation, Mehldau's incredible sense of balance between the complex and the simple. Mehldau's sense of when and how to fill--and not fill--in the spaces continues to be an incredible strength of his approach. Metheney's contribution is to ride this gentle wave with his usual mix of engaging accessibility. Metheny's use of a synthesizer effect allows him to explore two of the tunes more freely which provides the most satisfying tracks on the album (5 & 9). What the album lacks in explosiveness (check out Mehldau's version of \\"Solar\\" on the album Art of the Trio Vol IV) it makes up in subtle inventiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Better With Age","review":"I've always liked Pat Metheny's music; for some reason I always thing of surfing Trestles when I hear his music.

More Lyle!More Lyle all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute genius","review":"This is a superb collaboration. Such beautiful, honest, subtle musical story telling. It's the most creatively that Metheny has played in years. Larry Grenadier and Jeff Ballard are absolute geniuses in their own right. And Brad Mehldau is just on a another plane - he is incredible.The new quartet truly respects each others' styles, yet they don't play as individualists - they truly collaborate and amplify one another's work. The duos between Metheny and Mehldau are like a yin and yang dancing around one another - they just work together. Established structures emerge and then unwind in various directions in a way that just seems to make sense. Hard to put into words. It's sophisticated, beautiful, challenging, and exhilarating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"Under 200 pages, well written, loaded with references and end notes.

His potted history of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry is reasonably good. But his discussion of the esoteric layout of Washington DC is borrowed wholesale from The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital (previously published as The Secret Zodiacs of Washington DC) by David Ovason.And someone should tell Taylor that simony is nothing to do with magick!All a bit silly, really.

It's a trap. Keep your fingers out of it... ;)If it doesn't perform as I expect, I'll update my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This trap, while strong and well-built, is useless for trapping squirrels, as it claims, because the trip mechanism requires too much force to allow the trap to trip. I have not caught one squirrel with it. They are able to remove the bait from the trap tray without tripping the mechanism and getting caught.Also, it is dangerous to set this trap, and you must be very careful. If they had simply provided a thumb screw lever on the right-hand side of the trap, one could have very safely been able to set the trap without the risk.Very disappointing product! If you're trying to catch squirrels, pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful","review":"This trap is is strongly built with a very powerful spring. Setting it can be intimidating because it requires strength and care because one could easily break one's finger or even a wrist. I've tried setting it and found it too difficult. Because of the strong spring, releasing a caught rodent for disposal after being trapped, would be a huge, messy challenge in reverse. However, inertia on my part has prevented me from requesting a refund even though its unlikely that I will put it to use. My rating is not for use of the product, but for safety concerns.

On occasion the storyline bogs down into too much technical detail about virology and epidemology, which interrupts the pace of the narration. Not that some stretches of the book are too slow; the book is in general fast moving. Parts are are not very realistic (especially if you know more about the topic) and on occasion it is hard to connect with the main protagonists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrill in a Day","review":"I started reading Pandemic with no idea what to expect from an unknown author, and I was pleasantly surprised. The topic is incredibly timely, and the book was informative as well as exciting to read. I found the novel to be well-paced, a page-turner at times, while slowing down occasionally, just enough to let me catch my breath. It was mostly an easy read, but technical enough to make me feel that I was getting a scoop on developing events in medicine. It drew me in so tightly, that near the end, I refused to put it down. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"Save your money: Pandemic promises much and delivers little.

As it turned out, this was an excellent read.Even though the author is a first time novelist (and this can be seen in a number of places), he captures the reader's attention very well. There is a lot of medical / viral terminology, but I did not find that I got lost or confused. The novel starts out a bit slow, but definitely picks up as it goes along. The situations leading up to the climax are quite realistic and very possible in today's world.Overall, an interesting novel and a great effort for a first time novelist who happens to be an ER doctor from Canada."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pandemic = Page Turner","review":"Couldn't put this book down once I started reading it.

Just as importantly, it contains very compelling characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has to be a better way to spend a few hours...","review":"I picked up this book on the strength of the title and the handful of reviews at Amazon. I had previously read, and enjoyed, the Hot Zone and a couple of other books from this genre. I therefore had fairly high expectations. Sadly, this book was a serious disappointment. While the science provided by the physician author is laid out well, the plot is so trite, the characters so two-dimensional and stereotypical, and the dialog so wooden that I seriously contemplated abandoning the book mid-way through. I had always assumed that writing a pot-boiler a-la Grisham, Crichton et al, must be something that it would be hard to do badly. This author has certainly dispelled that notion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I thought this book would be a page turner because of my previous experience with medical novels.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Season Inside","review":"What Feinstein did for Knight in his Season On The Brink, he now does for one entire season in the world of college hoops. This book is an inside look at everything from the grueling (and often gruesome) practice sessions that go on behind closed doors to the intimate personal lives of some of college basketballs biggest stars, from the tough lives of teams and players going nowhere to an astonishingly close up view of the winners who go all the way to ultimate glory. A Season Inside goes from coast to coast, from top to bottom, from glory to defeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, Informative Look at College Hoops","review":"Author John Feinstein's college basketball narratives are interesting, exciting, and informative. He covers the game with a broad approach, letting readers see many personalities, the pressures, and the often intense practices in this ultra-competitive sport. This book does not focus on any one conference or team, but presents a very interesting and broad national view of college hoops in the late 1980's. Yes, many of us fans realize that this multi-billion dollar industry unfairly gives players scholarships while coaches (and others) get rich, but hey, this is still a very entertaining sport. This is a very readable and entertaining look at the college game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who mixed this!","review":"There's not much more to be said about this CD than what the other reviewers have said already EXCEPT the mixing. The whole CD is in true stereo and sounds great, but interestingly on a few songs, Bobby's voice seems to change places a few times. It becomes very distracting especially on \\"Somebody To Love,\\" in which the instruments, lead vocal, and chorus jump around the speakers numerous times.Someone had a field day mixing this CD, or was it like this on the original album in '61? Otherwise, the sound quality is great and at least it's in stereo.There isn't one bad song either, except for \\"Artificial Flowers\\" which is a strangely upbeat song about a poor orphan girl who gets frozen to death, which I think is a little weird. But other than that, a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small collection of early hits.","review":"I agree with the above review but add the following caveats: For the same price, you may buy the \\"Ultimate Bobby Darin\\" CD, which includes the same songs plus five more hits. You don't get Darin's commentary on \\"Ultimate Bobby Darin\\" (although one disc may have the singles versions of certain songs and the other disc may contains the LP versions--I don't recall), but you simply get more for your money with \\"Ultimate.\\"Second, this disc, which appeared originally as an LP in 1961, represents only the first few years of Darin's career. Other CDs offer more songs for the same price, although it remains difficult to find one CD that combines both rock hits and standards, as this CD does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turned the lights out in the store","review":"I titled that because I had been in the store over an hour hour and was just about to give in looking for something that would lift my spirit and this tape caught my eye.

Clifford takes feminist theology seriously, giving a helpful analysis of diverse claims, themes, and authors. There is a serious effort here to uncover the internal logic of the authors and situate them in their contemporary context.The book would work well as a college text and the pedagogical aids would enrich a student's understanding of theology in the broader sense.

Every type of battery that we have tried leaks inside the unit after a while rendering it USELESS. Not to mention the batteries are a real challenge to remove. So much so that plantronics equiped these units with their very own plastic tool which is attached to the bottom. This would be the epitomy of negligent and sloppy engineering. Don't waste your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thie was a great book about the greatest player in hockey!","review":"This book was very good. It told about Wayne Gretzkys life, his stats and how great he really was. Thats why his nick name is the Great One. He set more than 61 records and has set untouchable ones. This is one of the best sport books ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info, bad pictures","review":"This book seems to be really informative so far. We're in the midst of designing a 700 square foot data center and there are a lot of great tips and tricks we never would have thought of in there.My only complaint so far is the quality of the pictures. They're all black and white, which is fine, but they look like they've been photocopied about 20 times before they made it to the book. Very poor quality there for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough bang for your buck","review":"I thought this book was way overpriced for what I received. It looks like someone made it by themselves on a Xerox machine, certainly not worth the $60+ dollars I paid for it. The pictures actually look like photo copies.You should be aware that this book is written for someone who is going to build out a data center facility from the ground up. I didn't think it was intended for the average data center person who rents floor space from a collocation provider and doesn't have a lot of control over the actual facilites themselves.Not very many companies in this business can afford to build their own data centers and most, even the big companies, still rent space from a provider. Just keep that in mind when considering this book.There is some good information in this book but in my opinion it isn't worth the money it cost to purchase it. Purchse at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky Me!","review":"I got to hear Mary Lee and her Rockin Corvette a few times in NYC and I'm so happy to find her CD's here on Amazon! She just makes you feel like she's got you in the palm of her hand... and it feels reeeeeeal nice. Blood on the Tracks - coming out soon... can't wait to hear THAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward","review":"This book is rather muddled. In an attempt to explicate the workings of the cryptic clue, the author has invented a bewildering variety of terms (e.g. olapsek, parabrebit) that makes the text more confusing than the clues themselves. Poor organization and type design exacerbate the problem.It does list quite a few of the standard equivalencies found in (British) puzzles, and is somewhat useful in that regard, but beginners will find the Random House guide to be much more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult book","review":"This is an unusual book, and not one I would recommend for novices learning about cryptic crosswords. The author has focussed on clue analysis in a quasi-academic manner, and - as noted by other reviewers - created his own labels for the different types of wordplay. I feel these only confuse matters.There are no cryptic crosswords to try in this book, just hundreds of sample clues taken from a wide range of sources. Some readers may like the notation Greeff has devised for describing clues, but, as a crossword setter myself, I didn't find it very clear or helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting...","review":"Interesting that 3 of the 4 reviews for this book are all by one person, and while all are different, all are also 5 stars! The only other review is far more critical and useful. I'm taking the advice of the 3-star review and buying a competing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MUSIC STIRS THE SOUL","review":"I first heard North Sea Gas while I was on a business trip to Edinburgh in 1991 at the Caledonian Hotel. I have been a fan ever since. Their music is very uplifting and exciting. The songs are toe taping and moving. \\"Flower of Scotland\\" I think captures the soul of the Scottish people. The song about the Alamo would stir any American. I had a great time that night when I first saw them and definately you wont be dissapointed if you purchase this CD. If this is your first NSG CD, It wont be your last. A new CD Dark Island is available and I just purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel's Playground is a must have for any music lover","review":"David and I were both members of a country band together for a couple of years. It didn't take long to realize how immensely talented he was. Not only as a pianist, but as a musician in whole. Angel's Playground is filled with incredibly fresh melodies, the kind that you will find yourself singing all day long. I never knew that so much could be said without saying anything at all. You can tell that a lot of emotion went into each track. This album is also filled with some incredible playing. Some of the licks will leave you wondering if David actually has a 3rd hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very satisfied listener","review":"I received this CD as a gift and I could not be happier. David's music is beautiful to listen to. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys classical piano.

This Ostrich is no exception-- it is incredibly detailed and beautifully made.The figure is sized perfectly for little toddler hands and the quality is superb. My little one has been playing with this for weeks and not a single scratch. There are so many great details on this-- very helpful in guiding children in disussions about animals and the different parts to identify (ears, eyes, nose, etc. are all detailed).Also-- the Schleich animals all stand solidly. No wobbles so little ones can play without frustration. Fantastic, educational, and very fun toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"It's a recovery strap that looks good under my seat in the truck, Have not used the strap yet, Stay posted........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Golf School:","review":"BAD! Wow; this man gets plenty of press and great reviews, but I cannot see why! The book is written at a grade eight reading level, and it does not state anything new.

They should make it clear in the discription what is included when you are buying multiple products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Attempt at a Good Idea","review":"This book has one redeeming quality: the volume contains many unusual and telling 'pieces' descriptive of American history.However,the volume is flawed in two fatal and fundamental ways. 1) There is no bibliography, thus the reader has no way to determine where the editors located their material. For example, the first piece in the volume (\\"How the World was Made\\") is simply attributed to 'The Cherokee Nation'. 2) The editing of the material is suspect at best. The Rev. Dr. King's \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" has been redacted from its original fifty pargraphs to a mere 18 without wxplanation. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golf Puzzle --Fun for all ages.","review":"Educational and fun.

Naturally, at the time it was written, that was a valid threat, but now it is almost amusing to read such speculations about that particular superpower.This is a well written book that provides solid information that the end of time IS near. I would recommend this to both Christians and non-Christians alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy linux gamer","review":"I ordered this item because I only had a 64mb TNT Riva 2 card, which wasn't giving a great performance, and because I was able to find it cheap.

I'ts divided in 2 section, the first one for abs, the second one for legs and buns. The exercises are not various and very specifical: crunches for your stomach, squat for your legs. You just have to repeat two/three exercises fos some minutes. When I bought it, I tought to find in this dvd a fun combination, or different exercises i didn't know. Nothing like that. It's certainly useful for a total beginner, but not for a person who was looking for a complete and various workout for abs and buns. It's quite... \\"old\\"!There is no possibility to chose different levels and workouts, and you have to combine this dvd to another workout to have some results..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The GRAX880VHS-C A Dream of a Camcorder","review":"Best and most simple to use little camcorder I've ever used or owned.But now I find the JVC GR-SXM25OUwhich a friend purchased I like even better so may sell the GR-AX880 to buy it.

This CD was a great help.It is smooth and silky,but still tough and full of feelings.I would definately suggest this CD for your listening needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to its brand name.","review":"First piece of advice is don't underestimate your size. I'm a smaller built guy so I almost went with the small; glad I didn't, the medium really does fit like a glove. Its a bit tricky to take off when wet but the form fitting contours keep it out of your way (I'm a diver)and provide nice protection. Durable material, good price compared to what you find in the stores. I wasn't too worried about the style aspect but it does look good on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body Glove mens shirts","review":"Be aware that even an XL size is more or less comparable to a medium in a T-shirt size.

This view of the future is just not that plausible - except for the idea that virtually unlimited money can buy unlimited power and influence. \\"Ordosoft\\" is a thinly veiled and somewhat contrived evolution of Microsoft. In addition, the bad grammar (not in dialog, but in the narration) is jarring and not excusable. I'd take a pass on this one - or borrow it from the library if you must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible - rotten - stinky","review":"I thought this book was quite a bad read because when the ideas weren't cliche they were dumb and the characters were poorly developed and unbelievable... and most of all because the author cannot write his way out of a paper bag.

The future he warns us of is even now setting our walls on fire. Down there on the beach waits the wooden horse.

I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I just finished the book and thought it was fantastic. There were Gibsonian elements (Neuromancer,Idoru) in it, though it often made me think of Rudy Rucker (The Hardware Trilogy). Nonetheless, while I'm reminded of this author or that, Ortega has a unique style of his own, which is quite interesting and lends itself to a good read. I think the best part of this book was the fact that it became more of an art form; the entire section related to the delta symbol is a unique concept in writing and it made the impact convayance of situation much more intense. I look forward to reading Ortega's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking but technical!","review":"Interested in space marines? Familiar with the 40K Universe? If so, this is a remarkable book. The book makes heavy use of the language and concepts described in other novels and the game books themselves, making this a poor choice for new players.INCREDIBLE story! Lots of twists and turns, very well imagined, constant action, interesting characters. You can tell from the writing that the author has a great passion for this story, and really enjoyed writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent middle period Carlin","review":"This was the first Carlin album I heard (I knew of him from TV appearences like the Baseball vs. Football routine). At the time, I was bowled over. I was glad I still liked it now. This album could have used less commercial parodies and more stand up but overall a great listen. The title track is a classic, also love fussy eater and have a nice day. He's gone beyond the hippie persona of the 70s but hasn't become the curmudgeon of his last few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Comedic Genius","review":"I was about 10 when I heard this album for the first time and it's still as funny today as it was the day I heard it. In fact, it's probably funnier because I get all of the subtler references I missed back in 1980.As others have mentioned, the album is compiled from material taken from one of Carlin's live shows and interspersed with studio materials. And while others have also used this kind of a format (for example, Denis Leary's Lock-N-Load album), this is by far the penultimate example of a mix between live and studio comedy.From the live material, the \\"Place for My Stuff\\", \\"Rice Krispies\\", and \\"Ice Box Man\\" are still laugh out loud funny. The studio material is also very funny and I have always thought that it was included to highlight the wittier side of Carlin's comedy -- the \\"Book Club\\" and \\"I'm a famous person and I'm for sale\\" bits make me laugh every time I hear them.I don't think you can call yourself a Carlin fan and not own this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"George Carlin,the man who has mocked The Lord and made so many blasphemous remarks about the creator of this universe,is now paying the ultimate price for his rejection of God's chosen son,Jesus Christ,and is now burning in the depths of Hell.If he had no time to repent of his sinful,God-rejecting ways...I am sorry to say,that the man is NOT in a better place.These comedians who mock the Saviour and his Father,are putting their soul in eternal danger,and like Carlin,if they don't repent of their God-less ways,they'll end up in the same Hell as Carlin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Carlin CD Ever","review":"this is by far the worst carlin cd ever. he foregoes his observational humor which is the funniest around, and attempts to do skit humor. i for one, hate skit humor and was upset almost to the point of being mad that i baught the cd. this is definately the worst carlin out on the market. avoid this one. i would give it a rating of '0' if i could."},{"rating":"1","title":"very expensive to operate","review":"This unit is so expensive to operate and sent our electric bills through the roof!!

It mixes \\"Asian\\" groups to create an Asian community that only exists in the United States, blends in many of the \\"old world\\" bits and behaviors on the part of elders and the newly arrived, but misfires in focusing on what they do, why they do it, and limits itself to only part of the story, not necessarily the best part.Not great, but at least somewhat interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panels","review":"The panels arrived in a timely manner and seemed ok until I looked closer at them.

Either they're too pop,too rock, or just plain bad, but the latest offerings have not been good. However, three fresh faces that I have liked have been Bobby Pinson, Keith Anderson, and Jason Aldeon. \\"Hicktown\\" may be a rocking country single, but it does not reflect the rest of his CD. If you like a more classic sound, 'Lonesome USA', 'I Believe in Ghosts', 'Why Do I do That to You', and his remake of 'Asphalt Cowboy' (from Blake Shelton's \\"The Dreamer\\"), are three that come to mind. If you like 'Hicktown', then keep it going with 'She Loved Me' and, to some extent, 'Amarillo Sky' and 'You're the Love I Want to be In'.

Problems were solved (both Amazon and Pacific Bicycle were helpful) but it was a long and frustrating experience. Allow 1 hour for assembly. The bikes are sturdy and well made, but a little bit crude. They are heavy and only have a single speed so they are not good for hills. But they look cool, and my kids love them!

I used this on professionally bleached hair and the dye covered unevenly; it was dark blue at the middle and ends of the hair but sky blue at the roots. It faded greenish in a week even with good care and looked kind of cool while it was fading, but it faded way too fast for my taste. The only reason why it gets 2 stars is that does look kinda cool during the fade process but that time window is slim, like 1 or 2 days before it really starts looking shabby. I won't be using this brand of dye again, ever. Use Jerome Russell Punky Colour in Midnight blue instead, it's everything this dye wishes it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-amplified version a joke?","review":"Well, I've used the blue manic panic(amplified) before, it turned my hair blue for months.This time though, I bleached and dyed my hair with this non amplified pillar-box red and it faded within a week.

I didn't notice ANY difference at all. It faded to orange in less than two weeks (washing every other day, in cold water, with sulfate free shampoo.)On the plus side, Manic Panic is easy to apply, washes off skin easily, and usually even washes out of clothing.I was really hoping that it would last longer, because I love the just-dyed wildfire color. No such luck. I've sinced switched from using Manic Panic to using Special Effects. The difference is astounding, my special effects-dyed red hair has lasted, without noticable fading, for three weeks and counting now. It does stain skin, but I'm willing to deal with that since it means I don't have to redye my hair every two weeks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S PINK!","review":"i've been using Manic Panic for 5+years.i loved the original version of vampire red very much it faded to a beautiful orange then to ginger and back to blonde.well when i bought this hoping for a longer lasting color.i left the color in for about 3 hours.i would've left it in longer but i did not have the time.the color was beautiful at first.exactly what i wanted but after a few washes i realized instead of the orange to ginger shade the original formula gave me it was leaving me with a rose color that is now fading to a pastel pink.although the color is vibrant and pretty even with it fading to pink i'm very disappointed that i'm now going to stuck with pink ends for the remainder of my pregnancy since i can not bleach out the pink.THIS DYE IS PINK BASED!

There wasn't enough product for all of my thick hair so i only did the under layer. During the first rinse i rinsed until the water was clear but every shower i took after that for the week after i could just see more and more purple come out. By the end of the week it had already started to fade to a pale purple. Half a week after that it looked more of a dirty purplish blonde that wasn't appealing.I loved the color, and i know that's it's only temporary. But i wish that i hadn't wasted the time, honestly.

It was rusty and peach-ish and only lasted one wash before it faded to a disgusting burnt peach color. I believe I applied this 5 different times over the period of 2 months and got the same result every time, gross dull color that washed out after a week.A few people told me my hair was too processed to hold color, which I was ready to accept - but I just triedCreative Image Adore Crimson 68and BAM!

But these spoons do not look great. Right out of the package every handle had a discoloration problem and/or slight scuff marks.

I am not sure whether this is due to quality control or simply because the material is only 18/8 stainless steel vs. better quality 18/10 or 18/12. The handle edges are also not nice and rounded but rather unpleasantly hard and sharp to the touch.I will keep them simply because I need them in a few short days and have no time to reorder something nicer.

Wrong kit, bad description, and missing parts that were listed in print and in the picture, not much more to say than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piano","review":"I really like this piano.

It deals with the very basics before giving the reader a taste of some of the most common opening moves and basic strategies.

It is also markedly free from malice.I sought out this book after becoming aware that congregants at Chicago-area UUA churches were involved in various activities rooted in beliefs about matriarchal prehistory. That struck me as odd, because I regarded contemporary Unitarians as rationalists committed to Enlightenment thinking (I now know differently, although certainly many are).While I would surely benefit from reading a book written from the opposing perspective, I found Eller's treatment so overwhelmingly convincing (and materials to the contrary so flaky by comparison) that I have little desire to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitifully Ignorant","review":"This book is pitifully ignorant of human history not to mention spirituality.

There has been much evidence from researchers to support the truth of Matriartical cultures. However I guess since a male dominated Patriartical society has done a good job at distorting and destroying ancient Goddess evidence people have a hard time believing what is clearly in front of their eyes. The sadder part is that it is written by a woman, but I guess that when you are afraid of your own herstory and women's empowerment it is easy to support writtings that add to one's egotistical and false assumptions. All I can say is that if you are a TRUE Goddess woman you would be better to spend your time reading books like The Great Cosmic Mother which speaks of women's cultures and destruction by Patriarchy. The only real illusion here is the false notion that Patriarchy has always ruled.

The book provides historical backgrounds on the aformentioned countries that determined our economic philosophy, and offers a most disturbing outlook for the U.S. economy should we not change our focus from the current ROA driven ends, to a more sustainable investment philosophy via our workforce, Research and Development, innovation, education, national savings rate, etc. The writing is on the wall, and if we don't pay attention and make the changes that we need to make individually and as a nation, the U.S. will fall from it's perch of being the leading economic nation to that of number two or three.

I imprinted on the Gould interpretations (1955, 1981) so am perhaps partisan, but I've found wonderful humanity in other recordings, notably that of Igor Kipnis. I had read that Tureck's style had influenced Gould, so I had high expectations. Those poor people that say Bach is boring, monotonous, mechanical -- they've probably been forced to listen to interpretations like this. I wish it were otherwise, but this sounds like a piano teacher. No clear artistic message comes through. It's technically refined, though slow in tempo. The overall impression is - no soul, no swing, no message. A Goldberg that fails the Turing test.

Now that the tables have turned somewhat, one wonders if Tureck herself had hoped to a forge a seminal re-recording of the Goldberg Variations in Gouldian fashion with this latest release. Sadly, this album falls short of even her own earlier performances of the work. Tureck's playing, which never bore the stamp of genius to begin with, now seems to have lost its unique tactile control as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow and melancholical","review":"Slow and melancholical are the words i'd use for this performance.

The only complant I have is that the bottom cover that keeps on falling off. After my first encounter with those radios, I bought my own, which was the Motorola T289. Since we had radios without codes, we had to use the regular 14 channels. With outside interference, my radio, and along with other brands of radios, worked flawlessly with these.

From the title, I was expecting PILATES workouts. To call it a Pilates DVD borders on false advertising. Maybe 20% of the content is bastardized Pilates, while the rest is a mish-mash of yoga, calisthenics, and weightlifting moves. I would never have bought this DVD if the packaging had accurately reflected the contents.I gave it 2 stars only because it is an okay workout. I prefer10 Minute Solution Yoga. But if you want actual Pilates, tryPilates - Beginning Mat Workout. That one is a 20-minute Pilates workout, with a separate 10-minute \\"Power Boost\\" Pilates workout for those days when 10 minutes is all you can squeeze in--and it is REAL Pilates.

But that's really it... Overall, I think I feel worse. My back hurts from some of the poses and my knees actually hurt too from some of the leg exercises. The instructer moves WAY too fast and doesn't really instruct how to do the poses properly. I think the stretching segment is the worst because it's way too fast. You end up rushing through and I feel like I'm pulling my muscles and not stretching them. I always thought that stretching should be a slower process...

I have done this around 4 to 5 times a week for the last month, and find that I'm ready now for something different. That being said, it's a good DVD to get started on, and for alternating your routine. Pilates classes cost $20 and up a class, so to get a $10 DVD is a pretty good value at the end of the day. IMO it's good to have several dvd's that you can rotate to confuse your body, so it doesn't get used to just one routine. I really did not find this difficult at all, and after a month, have not seen \\"rapid results\\" but an overall strengthening in a very gentle way.So, yes, I would recommend having this in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful pilates DVD!","review":"As a casual pilates practicer, I was looking for DVDs that would give me the benefit of pilates without requiring too much outside knowledge or in-depth studying of the practice. This DVD definitely serves it's purpose; it's effective, you can feel the burn, it targets each and every part of the body, and there's enough diversity within the 5 workouts to keep you from getting bored. Aside from the instructor not being a favorite of mine, and some repetitiveness in the moves being used from workout to workout, I'd highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the lengthening & toning benefits of pilates, and especially to people limited on time to exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great solution!","review":"I am really happy with this DVD....i can feel the results the next day for the most part.

I don't recommend this to anyone who is not already very familiar with Pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex","review":"I have to agree with some other reviewers that a number of moves on this DVD are unnecessarily complex. I recommend 10 Minute Solution: Pilates because you will feel the same burn with less maneuvering. There is not really a difference in the challenge level between the two DVDs. Regarding the workout on this DVD, there are new moves I haven't tried before, but I had no difficulty doing them. Like the 10 Minute Solution: Pilates DVD, I did not really feel challenged and only felt a burn during the ab workout. I've tried three different 10 Minute Solution DVDs, but I guess 10 minutes just isn't enough for me. If you are trying to lose weight, try 30-Day Shred. If you just want to maintain your shape and you are tight on time, this might be okay for you. I would not recommend this if you want to tone up your legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Saver!","review":"This DVD affords the opportunity to compose a workout routine directly from your DVD player. You can pick multiple 10 minute workouts, and put them in the order you'd like to do them, directly from the menu option of the DVD! This workout is a great start to my morning. I recommend this DVD for anyone who is experienced w/ pilates at an intermediate level.

I agree with other reviewers that you should have some experience with other pilates based workouts before attempting this workout. You will find yourself confused with the moves unless you've went through the motions in other beginner/intermediate type pilates workouts. At my fitness level, I was able to complete all of the moves successfully aside from 1 or 2, which I will need to continue building my muscle control in order to complete them. I felt the burn the next day, it really works your muscles in all the right places. However, even when completing all of the sections in one workout session, I did not build up a sweat. If you want to experience a sweat/burn in a workout, I suggest doing cardio and then finishing your workout with her dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not boring!","review":"I just did the entire 50 minutes. I have been weight lifting for years and wanted to add pilates to my exercise routine. First, she is a plesant instructor and the 50 minutes flew by. I don't know if doing only one set of an excercise is going to give me results as I am used to doing three sets of say 12 or 15 reps., yet I do feel the burn and the stretching is something I never do (I know not good!). I could not do alot of moves as I am new to pilates so there is a challenge. I normally use 12 to 15 pounds for my arms and with the moves she does, I had to use NO weights at first and then just 3lbs. She has alot of muscle definition - is this from just these exercises?There are no calve exercises so I will do my standard ones. I will see if I get Rapid Results I am so wound up from doing too much lifting for so many years, I think this will help!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This is one of the best fitness videos I've ever used. So good,in fact, that when I lost my original copy in a move, I bought a second one. I like that the video is broken up into 10-minute segments. That gives you the flexibility to fit both your schedule and desired workout intensity. I also found that I see quicker results from the workouts on this video than from others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective~!","review":"I had tried one other pilates dvd and didn't like it but since I enjoyed other 10 Minute Solution dvds I thought I would give this one a try and I am so glad I did! The time flew by for each segment and I really enjoyed Lara as an instructor. You also add hand weights to some segments which is nice. In fact the only equipment needed was a carpeted floor or pilates mat, and light hand weights. Plus you are able to do this workout bare foot, a nice change of pace. My only complaint is that I could not do all the moves in the cardio segment, too advanced for me but hopefully in time I will increase my flexibiity.

I found it relaxing but could feel the burn afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful advice if you buy this dvd","review":"I bought this DVD after taking a pilates class with the pilates machines, so I was familiar with some of the mat moves throughout the five 10-minute sections. My pilates teacher told me that if I purchase ANY pilates DVD to supplement the pilates/machines class, the best way to do it is this:1 - Review the move according to the teacher and practice it once.2 - Pause the DVD.3 - Do the move AT YOUR OWN PACE and AT YOUR OWN LEVEL.4 - Do not try to keep up with the teacher.After 4-6 sessions on the DVD, you should be able to do the moves SLOWLY, but WITH STRENGTH and BETTER CONCENTRATION - AT YOUR OWN PACE, even if it takes you longer than the prescribed 10 minutes.If you try to keep up with Lara - you could end up inflaming your lower back, or straining your neck.You have to ask yourself - what's my goal?To get stronger?Or to get it over with in 10 minutes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners","review":"I'm sorry gals. I tried to like this one. I do like the instructor. But these positions are impossible for a beginner.

If you are a beginner, I urge you to try to rent or borrow first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners!","review":"This easy workout is not only short and programmable but the movements are great for Pilates beginners.

Tebaldi certainly commands the part as others have said and is never drowned out by the orchestra. As she does command the role she does sound far older than fifteen but no problem really. The singing is clear, Bergonzi is a beautiful lyric tenor and the orchestra sublime under Tullio Serafin.

There are holes for the dock connector, hold switch, and headphone port that are all easily accessible. Although its not clear in the picture, the screen is covered with hard plastic and the wheel is covered by a thin plastic film which is essentially invisible.

Or the question of whether or not there is a God and what leads us to believe there is... I like this approach better-- not only does it make sense (Why didn't I think of this before and write the book? I'm thinking... or, Why didn't someone else...?), but it is Biblical-- as Christ is the epicenter of the Scriptures.

I dont know why his name is listed on the credits because he is nowhere on this record which sounds like an Italian Bobby McFeren? of \\"Dont Worry be Happy\\" fame ,He sings with his own brand of \\"Mouth Music\\".Not my cup of tea. One highlight of this record is one song with the lovely treated trumpet of Mr. Jon Hassell !!! who played with Brian Eno way back when, how on earth he wound up on this record I dont know. Hassell did one Italian soundtrack record called \\"Sulla Strada\\" which took me years to find before the Internet.Maybe they met in Italy somehow. Anyhoo those of you expecting the Brillian Ital style of Bossa that Conte has given us for over a decade will be disappointed here. WAH !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stylistic, Mood Setting, Lounge Music","review":"This album has some great tracks, and is perfect atmosphere setting music for a lounge, pool, or poker party.

However after listening to the disk, it does not sound like any of the other Nicola Conte recordings that I own, such as Jet Sounds, Bossa Per Due, or Other Directions. In fact Nicola Conte's name does not appear in the list of musicians, the composer, arranger, producer, or anywhere in the credits. So unless the name Marc Beacco is an alias for Nicola Conte, then it would seem to me that this is not a Nicola Conte recording, and that the listing in Amazon is incorrect. There is nothing on this recording that is in the cool, jazzy, lounge, bossa nova style that I associate with Nicola Conte. In summary, I am very disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fax a diaper and get a online cappucino!","review":"If you want to know how to run a home office business and take care of 3 small children and still have a good laugh get this book.

His new CD \\"Sleepless\\" demonstrates that he has evolved from the one-time frontman for the J.Geils Band to be a musical chameleon. \\"Sleepless\\" is a genre-jumping album, familiar yet new at the same time. Wolf masters all the genres within, from Americana to Honkytonk to Blues to R&B (complete with a horn section) to classic 70s-type rock. Comparisons are everywhere on this album, which is perhaps why it is so pleasurable to hear.

Keith's whiskey soaked vocals on \\"Too Close Together\\" are great to listen to, but this is Pete's album all the way. Buy it!!

A song like 'NothingBut The Wheel' will make your hair stand on end. 'A Lot of The Good Ones Gone' will make you cry. You will fall into the arms of 'Marianne' and end up 'Sleepless'.

Geilish\\" songs on this album are \\"Never Like This Before\\", \\"Oh Marianne\\", \\"Some Things You Don't Want to Know\\" make this album way worth the price of admission. The addition of contributions by Mick Jagger on \\"Nothing But the Wheel\\" and Keith Richards and the rockin \\"Magic\\" Dick on \\"Too Close Together\\" push it to the \\"must have\\" category. This effort by Peter Wolf will likely be overlooked by the mainstream but for true fans of bluesy, old fashioned party rock and roll shouldn't follow suit.

The story is told from the viewpoints of various characters, with different styles, and is really a marvelous read.unfortunatley the parts dealing with the present (or within the last 50 years) are rather lame. Only the first and the last chapters that tell of the present are must reads.

He covers knowledge and power, sexuality, prisons, mental health.... The span is enormous, highlighting Foucault's multidisciplinary reputation.The downside of the book (indeed a limit of the Manga-like series) is it spends too much time on Foucault's role as as a chronicler of data, and leaves the reader on their own for much of his conclusions. An example: the book talks of Foucault's description of the medical clinic and doctor's \\"Gaze\\" but the book doesn't share if Foucault thought this was good or bad. Given Foucault's well deserved reputation as a complicated writer, this beginner could use the help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening!","review":"This book gives an interesting look at West African tribes, their customes and traditions and coins them through the lable of \\"Judaism\\". The writer and reshearcher comes up with various theories on how so-called Africans could be practing this \\"religion\\", when in fact they are only keeping the \\"ways of their forefathers\\".A great read for the inquisitive mind, if one can take into account when it was written, and the overture of the racist Eurocentric mind that stives to grapple in the dark on how so called Africans could keep \\"Jewish\\" practices rather than just draw the obvious conclusion that these African tribes are indeed part of the lost tribes of Israel.Any African American in particular would find it very interesting when trying to reshearch their cultural roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hebrewisms of West Africa","review":"The introduction drew me into this book. It (intro) puts you at this end of history and the possible relation to the author's postulation. The book is rich with eye-witness accounts, linguistic references and a large arsenal of sources are sighted.

Numbers and statistics are nonexistant other than a few graphs that look like they were sketched by hand. The author tends to throw lots of questions at you to think about, but doesn't give any advice on the topics.There were a few bits of useful information on how other people will look at your business and value it, but it's not worth reading through the whole book for them.

I feel quite sorry for her i would not recomend this book for anyone who want's to read the truth. I can say some of it is not the truth due to my knowlegde of Motown, David Ruffin and Tammi Terrell. She used many people as shapegoats for her own stupid choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible content, terrible writing","review":"The book title was so misleading. This woman (bless her heart) really believes that she was David Ruffin's common law wife when indeed she wasn't. From what she wrote, she was the woman that he \\"kept on the side\\" as he remained married and dated other women. The author wanted the reader to feel sorry for her because he continued to cheat on her although he was NEVER truly committed to her by my definition. She also talked about how he beat her over and over again, yet she continued to let him crawl back into her bed. She even changed her last name to Ruffin after his death. The book was loaded with grammatical errors and it appeared that it had not been edited because like a high schooler, she underlined words for emphasis (which was very distracting)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ugly Truth","review":"Although this book contained some interesting tidbits about the Temptations, it is very poorly written.

However, the entire book was like the writer sat down and started typing, turned in the book and it went to print. Events flash back and forth, words are underlined, and one never quite understands what about the relationship that made her put up with abuse and other women. Supposedly, the lies began from day one so what was the glue again? I love Motown and the idea of reading about the real deal of any of the many stars is appealing, but I found no real deal here.

But instead of going back to Charn they go to Narnia and the evil queen escapes. See what'll happen next in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.I think that this book is great for everyone because first, the humor is great. Second, the story line is so good that once you pick up this book you'll never put it down. Third, the characters are with you for the rest of your life. Over all, if your parents are nagging you to read some classic books read the series of Narnia because it's just as classic as The Pearl or Pride and Prejudice but funner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magician's Nephew","review":"\\"Don't I just wish I was taller, I'd punch you in the head!'Two friends, Polly and Digory, that just met are off on a mission to get rid of and evil magical queen from a different world, find a magic apple for a talking lion.

He's got an affable way about him and I hope he continues to do the remainder of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was good.","review":"The Magician's Newhpew was a very good book. It was funny and a great adventure story. Digory and Polly seemed to be very real to me and loved to have fun as many young children love to do. I think that the part of the story where they were deciding what to do with the hampsters was not neccesary, but I think they made the right desicion in leaving them there in the wood. I think that Evil Queen Jadis should have been taken back to her own world before they went to Narnia. I guess if Lewis had done that, there would be no Narnia stories. Well, or at least good ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralls the mind in other-worldly wonder","review":"This book opens up new worlds, quite literally, in such a way as has never been done. It holds particular revelatory significance if read in the original order (as the sixth book); it leads unimaginably beautifully into The Last Battle. Since my reading it ten years ago, it has changed my very thinking. No one reading it may walk away the same person."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!!!","review":"Wow. I really loved this book a lot. I am going to read it many times. I loved the characters personalities. Lewis described them very well. I liked the way he described the places. I liked the part where all of the animals began to talk. I really loved the part where Digory brought Jadis back to life. I will recomend this book to everyone. Even if you've read it, read it again. I greatly disagree with everyone who hated this book. If you did, you need to read it again. You'll probably agree with me then,that this book was awesome!!! What scared me was that Jade is my middle name. And that's so close to Jadis that it's scary! But, getting back to the book.I wish I could tell C.S. Lewis how much I loved his book. I can't explain exactly how much I loved it. I am so glad that you have read my review. I LOVED this book. READ IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful beginning","review":"A lot of people argue about whether The Magician's Nephew is book one or book six in the Narnia series. Either way, (I read it second-after The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and have now reread it after finishing the series) it is an excellent book. It is the genesis of all the adventures in Narnia; and is a masterpiece! A little boy named Digory and his friend Polly are sent to a place between the worlds by Digory's mad-scientist/magician uncle Andrew. From there they awaken an ancient evil, witness the death of one world and the birth of another. In telling the story, C.S. Lewis writes with both wit and skill. His grasp on human nature is both insightful and entertaining. This book serves as a parable for our own creation and fall. It is a book I recommend to people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"As I remembered it","review":"The story is just as I remembered it from childhood.

It was very good, but i must warn those who aren't big fantasy lovers. This book is 110% fantasy, some \\"cutesey\\" fantasy. Over all though its very good, it kept my interest, although compared t be just finished Eragon, it seemed rather short. Good for a quick reading book, and if you love fantasy, or just want to read the books before seeing the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion Cody B.","review":"I think that the book \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" is an ok book to read. The author showed how well he/she's imagination is. This book has its ups and downs however, I would rate this book a 4 because of authors other works, some are better some are worse. Some good points from the book are that it connects to the second book (The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe). One of my favorite chapters in this book was The bell and the hammer, because Digory and Polly have a fight over if they should strike the bell. Another chapter I liked was Stawberry's Adventure because Strawberry the donkey finally is chosen to be a talking animal. I liked the way the author wrote because I could follow the book easily. There was only one thing in this book I really didnt care for and that was - I thought Aslan came into the story too late in this book. Overall, this book was very fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"C.S.

By that I mean it is one of the great books and it has a story that has endured the passing of time and still reads well today. This is an amazing feat considering the book was written almost 50 years ago. If this is your first forray into C.S. Lewis, this is a good place to start, as chronologically, it is the first book in the series. Just keep in mind this is a classic children's book with a fairly simple story as opposed to the more modern YA books like Stanek's Keeper and Kingdom books that have more complex plots and many more characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"Though this book was number six in the series, it is actually a prequel to the whole series, set long before the Chronicles of Narnia, and shows the creation of Narnia, as well as showing where the White Witch came from. You can't miss this book - if you've read the other Narnia books, this is a definite must. While the other books were set in the 1940's (in the real world) this is set in the turn of the 20th century, before the Pevensie children were born, and the main character in this book is none other than the boy who will grow up to become the Professor. This also explains the origins of the magical Wardrobe featured in the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read them in the Right Order","review":"All 7 books are amazing, and there's not much more to add to the many great reviews. \\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\" has always been my personal favorite, but honestly they're all good.However, I just want to suggest quite strongly that you read these books in the order they were written/published and not in this new order. \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" are both more meaningful after you are already quite familiar with Narnia.

Poly and Digory were exploring when Digory's uncle sent Poly to a different world!

When his selfish Uncle Arthur tricks them into going to another world, they inadvertently bring a cruel witch to London and then find themselves at the birth of a new land called Narnia, where Digory will suffer the most agonizing test of his life.Although not the first Narnia tale Lewis wrote, it tells the tale of how Narnia came to be, as well as being an engrossing story in its own right, with charming color illustrations. Technically written for children, and suitable for most young people (the Witch may trigger nightmares in very sensitive little ones), the beautiful characterization and layered plot lines provide plenty to enthrall adults as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of C.S. Lewis's Best Works","review":"Even though C.S. Lewis has written numerous fantastic novels for all ages, the one titled \\"The Magicians Nephew\\" was not his best. He included great description, which helped the reader to create a clear, detailed picture of the scene that was trying to be described. However, C.S. Lewis made the story drag on and on so that it seemed to take forever to get a picture full of description of what he was trying to say. I also do not think that this book had the best plot. I would recommend \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" C.S. Lewis's most famous and best (in my opinion) books written, for children, teenagers, and adults to read. This is because it is not only a Newberry Award winning book, but includes phenominal descriptive phrases and easy vocabulary for people of all ages to understand.

There are so many to choose from. From the multitude of books written about Kafka, R. Crumb's is actually a good addition. It provides something new to the world of Kafka, just as Maus provides something new to the WWII genre. It is sophisticated, intriguing, and downright creepy: definitely a great addition to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Someone passed on a jar of this cream to me several years ago, but I hadn't used it until recently when I ran out of my other product. I did notice the tingling for the first 2-3 days of use, but it didn't bother me and lasted only a few minutes. I used it daily for a couple of weeks and then one day I was looking in the mirror and thought \\"Hey, what happened to all those little lines on my upper lip and around my mouth???\\" They didn't disappear completely but were much less noticeable. The deeper lines in my forehead even seem to be softened somewhat--I'm hoping they'll get even fainter with continued use. I haven't noticed my age spots fading (at least yet).

The first night I used it, I had the tingling sensation that it stated I might experience. It lasted almost 20 minutes. Second night, I waited a bit longer after washing my face before putting it on, and still had some tingling, but not as long. I was noticing that my face was feeling extremely dry during this time. The next day I noticed my face was flaking all over and had an almost leathery feel to it... needless to say, I stopped using this product. My skin tends to be very sensitive to certain products, so perhaps this was just one of them... so if you are the same way, I would be very cautious about using this product on your skin.

The filming for the movie was in Stuart, FL, our hometown. We were watching for the background scenes / locations and also for any local extras we knew.Having done a great deal of historical research on the Ashley Gang and especially when they died on Nov. 1, 1924 at the Sebastian Bridge by the 7-man Sheriff' posse ... there was a great deal of 'liberty' taken by the screen writer and director int he story they told. So, don't believe everything you see about the Ashley Gang and especially about Laura Upthegrove and John Ashley (as children). Too bad the writer didn't stick with the actual facts -- those were so much more interesting than their 'story line'.The other problem we had was the editing of the film ... it just didn't flow well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I can't add too much to what as already been said in praise of this wonderful CD.

And speaking of twang, while Jennifer Nettles certainly has a capable voice (for pop music that is) the obviously forced drawl in her voice just makes it come off as corny.

Sugarland is the bomb. Bet the folks that left the group regret it. Jennifer Nettles does have a twang in her voice, but what a voice, what an artist.

Get the CD, enjoy the duo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy the Ride","review":"Album is great. At first I was leary of the group becoming a duo rather than a trio but they seemed to have pulled it off. I did miss that comradery of the three of them together from the first album. I hope the third band member overcomes whatever it is she needs to and can come back for the third album. I believe Sugarland as a whole, though, will continue to produce outstanding work with whatever/whoever they have to work with. Their sound is unique and Jennifer's (Janis Joplin) sound at times lends that over the top feel we all need to get through the day. Great album. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"So often follow-up albums to debut smashes are let downs ... but Sugarland's Enjoy the Ride is definitely not one of them.

I'm stunned by the beautiful, warm tone he produces from his violin. Surely these are among the finest performances I have heard of Bartok's works for the violin and orchestra. Boulez leads a clinical, yet lyrical, performance of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra that is full rate, yet not quite as compelling as those I've heard with Boulez conducting the Cleveland and London Symphony orchestras in his Deutsche Grammophon recording of the Ravel Piano Concertos. Still, this is a minor criticism of what is otherwise a superb CD. Of course, the sound quality is absolutely impeccable, thanks to Deutsche Grammophon's state-of-the-art digital recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaham's Playing Is Impeccable","review":"Gil Shaham plays his violin more cleanly than many violinists out there. And he doesn't sacrifice virtuosity or lyricism to get that beautiful tone. In this particular concerto (and two rhapsodys), Shaham turns in an incredible performance equaling the great recordings of the past in playing. This violin concerto hasn't gained the popularity of say a Brahms violin concerto, but it certainly has great moments within it. One of the problems of this recording is not Gil Shaham, but Pierre Boulez. The ending is problematic and it leaves you wondering how the piece could have ended like that. The way Boulez has the orchestra playing makes the listener think Bartok must have just gotten sick of writing at some point so, mid-sentence he just wrote a quick ending and made an end of the concerto. That being said, it's still a terrific recording. Both soloist and orchestra do a superb job playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"i don't know too much about Bartok.

The problem with the pillow is that it is narrow. I bought this for my fiance who suffers from congestive heart failure and has trouble breathing at night. He is not a large man, but he cannot fit comfortably on this pillow. Either his arms dangle down off the sides of the pillow (which is uncomfortable) or he has to cross them over his chest like a vampire in a coffin. I have the same problem on the pillow, and I am only 5' 6\\" and weigh 120 lbs. Ultimately it would cost me too much to ship it back for it to be worth getting a refund, but it is useless to us.

After reading all the reviews, I bought this one. It works quite well. I'm not too fond of the egg crate foam surface, so I put a thin pillow on top of it and then put my regular pillow at the top of the wedge. Very comfy.

I have a background in it thus I just used ye old deductive reasoning and common sense, aka; yer knoggin, lol. I found the rack's hardware to be high quality and well thought out, only one \\"wrench\\" needed (get yourself one of those 'pen knife' looking metric allen key folding sets, around $10 at your local home center), all the threads were well done and spun on easily. The adjustable bike size feature is even marked with wheel size! This rack is extendable both horizontally and vertically, so for those looking for a \\"longer\\" looking rack (as I was), this one certainly fits that need. My only neg is that I wanted a silver/aluminum color, but I see most bike racks are all black nowadays.

It also seems to be greatly adjustable to fit whatever bike frame you might have. However, for a novice bicyclist, the instructions were way too brief and I could not figure out how in the world to get it on my bike. It ends up I had to return the rack anyway, though, because it was not compatible with the rear bike basket I bought in the same order - the basket is a Top Peak rear basket with a nice clip in feature, but you need to have their special back rack for it to clip into.

The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because the instructions for installation were not helpful at all.

It is very solid; I think it's going to work out great."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"So... everything seemed to be in order. I got the product relatively quickly, and it looks quite nice. I mounted the little arms on the bike and then went to mount the rack on the bolt holes near the rear axle... and the bolts didn't fit. the holes on the bike are too big for the bolts that came with the rack. So... attempt one at mounting the rack: unsuccessful. I'll go buy additional hardware (bolts) tomorrow (losing points sunlite...) and see if I can mount that bad boy. It was a big dissapointment. And the instructions are quite a joke. Mine came with one picture and vague, relatively worthless instructions.

The instructions are useless, but it's pretty self-explanatory from looking at pictures online. I was able to attach all screws firmly except the one that goes behind the chain. I'm not comfortable trying to remove the chain so I just hand-tightened it, and it seems to be holding fine. The other three points of attachment are rock solid however and it doesn't rattle or move at all (I'm riding a roughly 10-year-old Specialized and I luckily had all the pre-threaded holes needed). I'm using it with a set of Nashbar Daytrekker Panniers and they go very well together.

It was packed with instructions and parts, including some extra hardware that I will carry in my tool kit. The instructions are very vague, but I was fortunate that the fitting arms came assembled, and didn't have to figure it out. Referring to the picture here helped me to see how the arms attached to the rack, and it wasn't difficult to see from there where the other end of the upper arms would attach to my bike. I've posted a couple of other pictures that might help others with assembly. My Trek 7100 had threaded holes on the rear of the frame, I'm guessing for just such an accessory. Once I dug out the right hex keys (a 4mm for rack bolts and a 5mm for the bike bolts), the installation took under fifteen minutes. The rack seems very rugged, and I am anxious to use it. After that, I suspect I'll be back to give it that fifth star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had some issues with this.","review":"This is a nice rack with a sleek look to it and the bag I bought to go with it fits nicely.That being said, the rack was not all that easy to install. The hardware did not include brackets in the chance that your bike doesn't already have pre-drilled holes for the support arms, I had to go to a bike shop to get these. The brackets that you tighten to adjust the height of the frame, what they call \\"spring retention systems\\", easily stripped thus the frame would not stay in place. I ended up, after dealing with it for hours, going to a bike shop and having them drill permanent holes into the bottom brackets so that it would stay in place.After all the headache that this rack brought me over the past couple of days, I am glad that I had the guys at the bike shop drill the holes and secure the frame for the extra $20. It would of cost more to send it back and wait for another one to come in.

Playing on a familar theme of people with special powers who were once experimented on by the government, Clover cleverly sidesteps cliches. As is common with other CLAMP works, CLAMP tries to throw an interesting art twist into their story, with Magic Knight Rayearth they played off of the style of RPG video games. Clover uses the style of a film, with an airy arrangemnet of panels and scart-yet-detailed art. There is lots of white and black space and panels seem to float on the page. The plot itself is haunting, with anghst, love, and sensuality. The lives of the characters and delicately interwoven and they break obsticals that are infact themselves. The relationships are interesting and bring the plot together with a crechendo. There is no shortage of twists to pull you along and it promises not to disapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the kids","review":"My son plays with monster trucks all the time and he loves the ramp.

The storyline is ridiculous and completely CORNY. Sabine spends her entire adult life in love with a gay man and when he dies, she spends the entire book mourning his loss - she was a third wheel!! His secretive family is revealed after his death and this is when the book gets completely nauseating. This book just dragged on and on and on. What a complete waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK LACKS MAGIC","review":"I cannot understand how this book is a national bestseller. I thought the book was boring. It is extremely detailed especially when it comes to the dream sequences in the book. This book could have been condensed 100 pages to get to the main highlights. The ending fell short and did not bring any kind of closure to the characters in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, dull...I don't care about most of the characters","review":"I was 25% into the book and was bored. I never do this, but I glanced forward 50 pages and thought, 'ok, that sounds interesting'....It wasn't. I couldn't figure out where the story was going. I kept trying, hoping something would pick up. By 75% through the book, I had to force myself to keep going. I gave up, came on to Amazon and read enough reviews to say, \\"omg\\". I'm done.

You truly felt her grief for the loss of the \\"love of her life.\\"The problem with the story is that nothing really happens. I kept reading the book and waiting for \\"it.\\" Waiting.. waiting... Exactly when you think \\"it\\" has happened, it turns into nothing.This is a story with no climax. It is an easy read, and while Sabine is truly enduring, this story was a disappointment.This is now the second (and very likely the last) Ann Patchett book I have read. I feel neither book lived up to the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a drag","review":"I love Patchett's writing style. Unfortunately, it carried me through this story that otherwise I would have long abandoned. The L.A. characters - Sabine and Parsifal and Phan - were all relentlessly perfect. The plot was dull. The ending was absurd. The Nebraska characters were a little more interesting, but with no plot for context, that didn't help much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamefully bad editing - riddled with typos","review":"I don't know if the print version is similarly flawed but the kindle version of this book is so full of typos that I believe I deserve a refund. My favorite typo thus far: \\"the twenty two feces of famous people staring vacantly in her direction\\"The problem is pervasive enough to interfere with the meaning of the text. This is a decent and interesting book (though not Patchett's best) but the kindle version is substandard and should be pulled and corrected.

It was so well-written and it touched me so deeply. I read it at least a year ago and I still find myself thinking about the characters. The book has a lot of depth and it got me hooked on Ann Patchett. I went from this to her \\"state of wonder\\" which i loved as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful book hindered by tons of misspellings and copywriting errors","review":"This is a very good book. However, I really can't recommend the Kindle version as it is absolutely chockful of copyediting and spelling errors. As an example, early in the print book Sabina drives past 20-foot-tall faces on billboards; in the Kindle edition, it's \\"20-foot-tall feces.\\" Do yourself a favor and buy the print version. These errors are very annoying and distracting after a while, and given that the Kindle edition isn't exactly cheap, I believe they're unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Read","review":"This is a great book to fall into on a Sunday afternoon. Ann Patchett is a master at weaving a beautiful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"I was a big fan of Patchett's beautiful, understated Bel Canto. This book had an intriguing setup: a woman is married to a magician who loves her but is gay. After he passes away, she learns that the family he claimed was dead is actually still alive.Unfortunately, once that mystery is resolved, which doesn't take long, Patchett seems to run out of interesting ideas. To be fair, her characters are likable, plausible people, and she has a talent for lovely, understated scenes. But, the story loses much of its tension as soon as the closet runs out skeletons, and turns a little too sentimental. Patchett even goes as far as to include the stilted device of the dead magician giving advice to the protagonist in dreams. This one fell well short of Bel Canto for me -- I do recommend that book if you haven't read it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute delight.","review":"This book is a delight; beautifully written and thoroughly engaging. I was enchanted by the story and the people through whom the story was woven. After I finished reading it, I closed the book and then opened it back up to reread it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending leaves a lot to be desired","review":"It took awhile for me to get through this book. The writing was okay, but it was not one of those \\"I can't put this book down\\" type. I hated the ending. It left me empty. I expected a lot more. What happened with the plot? I felt like the storyline was all over the place and not centered. It just seemed to jump all over the place. It's like trying to put a puzzle together and you find that you have lost one or two pieces of it to make it complete. Very disappointing indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful thinking and regional bias!","review":"Let me get this straight: life after death is beautiful and the dead can visit their loved ones (not to mention foreign countries) in dreams; the Midwest is the only place with child/spousal abuse; Los Angeles is a paradise and THE hope for suffering people (sunshine, ocean, tolerance, and fresh limes? Hmm, I always think smog, crime, and earthquakes.) I would not recommend this to anyone living outside of LA."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment compared to Bel Canto","review":"I loved, loved Bel Canto and so was expecting great things from Ann's prior book. However, I was disappointed. The plot was a little too contrived and unbelieveable, and I didn't find it inspirational at all, like Bel Canto could be. Just depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment In the Reading","review":"After the reviews I had read for this book, I expected suspense and mystery; a real page turner. I found instead a thoughtfully crafted journey of discovery for a woman who had comitted herself to a homosexual man and his lover. Ms. Patchett paints detailed pictures of Sabine's quest, but the process of her explorations is less an Agatha Christie than a feature on \\"The View\\". Plus, if you don't like LA you'll find its loving descriptions thereof to be tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Patchett Lacks Magic","review":"I wanted to like this novel, but I just couldn't. Like all of Patchett's other works, this one is boring and hard to read. After I bought the book and read it, I felt like I had been tricked by an evil magician. I felt like an unwilling participant at a magic show--the lady who gets sawed in half. The plot is jerky and lackluster; it's predictable and rather dull. The characters are slippery and distant. There is no energy, no rabbit out of the hat. It's a one woman show where the magic is missing. It deserves a zero but the marks don't go quite that low."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of a lost love; of grief, remembrance, and a slow discovery.","review":"I'm a very big fan of Ann Patchett; her book \\"Bel Canto\\" may be one of my favorite pieces of contemporary fiction. \\"The Magician's Assistant\\" may not have been quite as good as \\"Bel Canto\\", but it was still a delightful read. One of the best parts of Patchett's writing is that her characters are always fully developed, and she is able to place you inside the mind of each character with no more than a few words. It was no different with Sabine, the main character of \\"The Magician's Assistant.\\" The story itself is far more leisurely than Patchett's other novels. It is the story of a lost love; of grief, remembrance, and a slow discovery. That said, I was not once tempted to set the book aside for another one. Only the end left me slightly disappointed--a few ends were left hanging loose, and not knowing drives me crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Anne Tyler, check this out","review":"After getting over my initial bewilderment of a straight woman character knowingly marrying a gay man and obsessing over him long after his death, it all was made plausible as Patchett weaved this reader into another well told story. Filled with a colorful cast of characters based in L.A. and Alliance, Nebraska. I have become more and more a fan of Ann Patchett's work. Her stories are nicely diverse and spread out all across the human spectrum.Her extended dream sequences don't make a lot of sense to me, and I thought bogged down the pace on this one, still I enjoyed the book as a whole. I like the subject a lot, \\"families with major issues\\". Reminded me of Anne Tyler (high praise), and just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Kept Hoping It Would Get Good","review":"Alas, it did not. I really wanted to like this book. I like Bel Canto with exception for the absurd (in my opinion) ending. Maybe I just did not understand the main character at all. While I understand her motivations to learn about her husband's family I never made the leap to an understanding of her decisions prior to the start of this book. It seemed like such a strange and sad illusory way to live. And I truly felt sorry for the fact that she was so in love with this man that could not possibly love her in the same way. I also predicted the way this one ended about half way through the book...so sorry no good plot twists and turns along the way. This was easy and not really that interestin."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED this book!","review":"Quite frankly, I bought this book because it had a rabbit on the front, and I'm an avid rabbit lover. But I ended up loving this book, mainly because I could relate to her grief (I'm a widow, too). And the quirky ending, that makes you wonder, did she and Kitty ever really get together..., was great. I thought all the characters were very human and likable, and you felt compassion for the position that all of them found themselves in, due to what happened so many years ago. Not to mention, as a rabbit lover, the random notations about the rabbit were charming, i.e., on Page 182, when Sabine calls home to her dad in LA, and he says, \\"Guess who's sitting here in my lap, helping me read the newspaper?\\" And Sabine says, \\"You'll spoil him.\\" And her dad's response is, \\"No such thing as a spoiled bunny. This is an animal who possesses an infinite capacity for affection.\\" Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of unusual, complex characters.","review":"Sabine's husband, Parsifal the Magician, suddenly dies unexpectedly. After 20 years in a most unusual union, Sabine thinks she knows all there is to know about her former mate. However, she soon finds out that smoke and mirrors were Parsifal's stock-in-trade on many fronts. As she comes into contact with the family her husband strove so hard to conceal, she finds others trying to sort out a different sort of grief Parsifal left behind in Nebraska. As Sabine and Parsifal's family try to understand the dynamics of Parsifal's lives with the other party, one can almost see the way to healing and redemption for at least some of those involved.A book of unusual, complex characters in non conventional settings, the strength of this book is how it demonstrates that, no matter how different and non-conformist we may be on the surface, we are nevertheless very remarkably the same in what we want and what we fear.A lovely and oddly inspiring story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublte surprises in an interesting story","review":"The author has a keen sense of places (LA and the plains) and a feel for their people who live in them. The broad shape of the ending was easy to guess, but there were a lot of subtle twists and turns in getting there. I am recommending the book to my friends, at least the kind who would not care if there is a real Walmart in Alliance, Nebraska."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Magic Here","review":"After total entrancement with Patchett's \\"Bel Canto\\" perhaps I was expecting too much from this book. Behind the flashy prose, time shifting gimmickry and mundane dream/reality superimposition there is a simple and not particularly appealing story. Very slow reading and very little reward for sticking it through to the end.Read \\"Bel Canto\\". Let this one disappear."},{"rating":"1","title":"So What?","review":"Ride the waves of Sabine's depressed point of view on and on and on and on and on. Its a well written ride, technically, if not a satisfying one. Its painfull to live in Sabine's head and the author makes no attempt to let you out of there, or even to just spruce it up a bit with some healthier life choices. Makes me think of Catcher In the Rye. Yes, its a ride, but do you really want to ride it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Typos = Where's the editor?","review":"I bought this on my Kindle App for Ipad, every page had a typo!!

As Sabine told her nephews, the trick is in the verbal patter and movement that keeps the audience's attention away from what is really going on in front of them, leading them to believe that something out of the ordinary is happening. This was a disappointingly undeveloped book with just enough promise to fool the reader into thinking it held greater meaning that it did.

The plastic smell was awful to my sensative sense of smell.I tried all the other \\"fixes\\" and at last resort bought this. This has such a highly medicinal smell that it was almost as bad as the other smell I was trying to remove.This product is NOT good for those with very sensitive noses to smells. It does NOT neutralize the smell as it seems some reviews state. It just covers them up with another. It did not remove the smell of the luggage and I had to return the luggage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best push call made","review":"This call is deadly. It sounds more realistic than any other push button call made. Killed 2 toms with it the first week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Recording","review":"This CD is a big disappointment. Although the Cleveland Orchestra plays the right notes, the feel of the music is all wrong, especially as far as tempo is concerned. Dohnanyi probably deserves most of the blame here, as he is the one who dictated the crazy tempi and weird phrasing. The second movement is a good example. Dohnanyi seems to be in a race, trying to beat somebody to the finish line. He flies through the thing and slows down just enough every once in a while to make sure the orchestra is still with him. Also, the recording quality itself is pretty clear, but the sound is too bright and thin. Poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time","review":"It's about time this book was written.

Overall, it is an easy read but very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"We ordered this through Airmiles points. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a review of this product but figured with a $140 price tag it should make decent coffee. Well the coffee is not very hot and the carafe doesn't keep it hot.

I can't wait for them to come out! But this one I found to be disappointing. It had virtually no plot and little interesting interactions with the animals but what felt like an inordinate amount of \\"lecturing\\" about various and sundry things. Frankly, it was dull which is something I never thought I would say about one of Ms. Brown's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mystery...","review":"I picked this book off the library shelf because I like a good mystery, but this seems to be a book about foxhunting with a sparse mystery story added as an afterthought. It was disappointing in many respects: hollow characters, poor writing, unrealistic dialogue. I haven't read any other Rita Mae Brown, but I'm a little confused by her popularity. If this is representative of her work, she's not a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Characters!","review":"This novel seemed like a rush job.

Think of Tom Clancy's techno-thrillers. This falls into that category. The author manages to blend plausible and exciting action with technical material in a very readable story.

I highly recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy From Genbukan, Don't Get Robbed Here","review":"These books are available from the Genbukan website for around $40.

Then he obnoxiously pursues her with completely inappropriate sexual innuendo -- peppered with more explicit sexual repartee.Was there really a time that a man's unwanted crude, intrusive and chauvinistic comments were considered sexually alluring? A different author would have taken this plot beginning and turned it into a stalker novel rather than a romance.And the supposedly strong and independent heroine keeps allowing the hero/stalker to persist in his way-too-personal-over-the-line-into-creepy innuendos. Is she really unable to shut him down and send him away? This is a book that promotes \\"Her lips said no but her eyes said YES!\\" Don't let your daughters read this one -- or your sons.I didn't finish it. I assume that they wind up together and blissfully happy.

Her books usually have intrigue and a plot. This book had neither. If I wanted to read a victorian romance novel with a transparent plot, I sure wouldn't have paid this much for it. I would have have purchased a cheap romance novel which is all this really was. It's a shame when a good author starts trading on her name and publishing slop like this. At this point I am reluctant to purchase any more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this book!","review":"I was a bit skeptical about reading this book after seeing other reviews. Turns out i really liked it.

He was a sheriff and should have known better, frankly he gave me the willies. The heroine was not realistic, no woman I know would have reacted to those situations the way she did. She should have threatened to press charges on the stalking hero. Also I found very little humor in this book. Not funny, not interesting and not realistic. I like my males Alpha but not machismo. Not to mention that making bets like he did is immature and frankly insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for modern women!!","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.... it should have been set in the 1800's, with a wimpering maiden.

No need to look further, this book's got them all.Sunny Chandler's return to her hometown after three years brought back old gossips alive. Sunny, who was determined not to show her hurt, not just came back to hometown for her bestfriend's wedding, she came back in style to show the people that she was no longer a shy miss from Latham Green, but one tough city girl. Ty Beaumont, the town's new sherrif, who was fascinated with this city girl wasn't going to let Sunny get away just like that. He made a wager to lure Sunny to his bed within a week. But of course Sunny wouldn't give in so easily. And that's when the plot thickens.What I like in this book is the two characters--Sunny and Ty-- are so explosive that you might find yourself singed by their explosion. I guarantee you won't be bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"exc read","review":"Sunny Chandler's Return by Sandra BrownThe wedding was a farce, she had been married to the groom once herselfand left when he told her he felt trapped.

It works great and extremely helpful, I think that's why manufacturers charge outlandish amounts of money for these type of helpful tools. They know you need the tool so they take advantage of an opportunity. If it wasn't so pricey I would have given it a 5 star rating.I do however recommend this product because of it's usefulness.To button a 6 button shirt would take as long as 10 or more minutes plus a lot of frustration, and now it takes only a couple of minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 uses...","review":"I got this for my husband who has occasionally has trouble with buttons due to a muscular autoimmune disease he has.

It is not really interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Like a Train Wreck","review":"With the variety of entertainment available on today's market, it is rare to find an action film that can actually hold a is even rarer to find one that does so simply due to the poor quality of the film. This movie is so utterly repulsive that one can't help but stare on, fascinated by the sheer lack of imagination, befuddled by the few snippets of dialogue that string together into a \\"plot\\" (and I use the term VERY loosley), and generally curious to see just how much worse the movie can get. This movie could be used as a form of capital punishment (as it seems repeated viewing could cause brain atrophy), except that such a punishment would most assuredly fall into the category of \\"Cruel and Uusual\\". Actually spending money on movies such as \\"Shootfighter 2\\" only encourages studios to produce more of its ilk. In short, not only would I recommend never watching this movie, but I would also recommend that any existing copies be destroyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific! A Story for Rebirth of a Town and a Person","review":"I read the \\"Storm\\" in one sitting.

If you have given up all hope, this book will give hope back to you - for yourself, for the world.

Although known for playing many wrong notes, he played and recorded in a time when this was not as much of an issue as it is today. This does not mean he did not have the ability to play them correctly, instead what you get is incredibly original, fresh and idiosyncratic interpretations of Chopin and Schumann.

Quite a bit of the time he is writing to the VB programmer moving up to VB.Net. Other times he is writing to the very beginner, going over very basic programming concepts anyone who has done any programming would know (what is a variable?).

Within 15 minutes, it becomes obvious that Billington must have resigned himself to narrating what amounts to a highly personal, somewhat idiosyncratic retrospective of those works of Russian culture that have stood out to him as particularly significant.

Many teachers will say that they have practiced Dr. Johnson's principals of teaching a child to \\"learn by figuring it out\\", before his book came into print. They are the teachers who will be remembered. He highlights learning as a process and when a child discovers on his own, instead of soley reading in a book or hearing from a teacher, then he seeks other answers on his own as well. He becomes what educators hope will happen to him; an independent thinker, always curious, always questioning, and often debating. Children who are given the freedom to learn how to find answers become the independent thinkers we need in our free society. Thank you Dr. Johnson for this wonderful reminder about what education should be; as well as a helpful resource book to guide parents and teachers along this path.Shirley Johnsrud"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Wow!

Every question you can think of, from \\"what is therapy like\\" to \\"what kinds of therapy are out there\\" to \\"how do I know if I'm being taken for a ride\\" are covered in this book. What I most liked are the bite-sized answers, which are quick and easy to read and don't get bogged down in unneeded details. I can tell from reading this book that the author knows of what she writes, both as a therapist herself and, more importantly, as a former client! I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Precious Gem!","review":"This book should be in every Christian home out there!This book has helped me tremendously on my walk with Jesus.

This is one of those books you read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless for Understanding Jesus Christ Throughout Scripture","review":"Without a doubt the truths in this book have changed my life and how I relate to God. I have never read such an easy-to-read and yet thorough explanation of the significance of the Old Testament Tabernacle to modern Christian spiritual growth and development. I understand repentance, the importance of the Holy Spirit, and the meaning of baptism so much better now and, as this book has taught me, these principles are just the beginning elements of the Tabernacle - awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tabernacle is a Person, NOT an inanimate object","review":"This book was given to me over thirty years ago.

It would matter little, I argued, what the book contained. Just the title and a half-decent graphic on the front page would suffice.It seems to me that both Mr Grand and his publishers Wiley are attempting to cash in on this very idea. The problem is that the joke was a bad one in the first place, and that it is now being made far too late in the day.I hope that the software development community is sufficiently aware that it won't be taken in by this outrage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This book epitomises so much of what is wrong in the software industry that I wonder if, in a sick kind of ironic way, that this is its only value?It cashes in on buzzwords in the title but is full of errors and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the material by the author.There is nothing to redeem this book. It is an embarassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck........","review":"Please read the Composed Method Pattern in this book.

Unfortunately, the author didn't think so. Going through the book and visiting the companion website to get the source code to run was a waste of time.For the most part, the code didn't work at all! It didn't matter what compiler version you make use of; I used 4 different versions of the JDK. A book is supposed to save you time when you are trying to learn. This book doesn't fit the bill. I still had to go to the web in order to get working examples of the patterns mentioned in the book.I'm sure the author know's what he talking about. I just think that he should prove it by writing programs that are tested and that compile before shipping it off in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended - Summary of Elementary Programming Concepts","review":"I will be returning this book tomorrow. If I compare my expectations (ie. a \\"design patterns\\" book) with what the book contains, it is one of the worst books I've ever seen. Things like \\"grey out not available menu items\\" and \\"use switch statements instead of nested if/elseif\\" are simply good programming techniques that we all learn; they are not what we come to know as \\"patterns\\". It isn't so bad to have a book like this, but it should not be called a patterns book, because this is highly misleading. One who buys a patterns book isn't expecting this kind of elementary information. To be fair to the author, it is the type of material that makes it not acceptable, not how it is written. It presents good programming standards and guidelines, but a 20 page book could accomplish that with simple examples, without repetitive and unnecessary information. If you want a patterns book, don't even consider this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stating the obvious - A very poor sequal","review":"The author has tried to create a book from very few usable patterns by padding with an irrelevant introduction for a second volume (First fifty pages) then filling the centre section with mind numbingly obvious GUI and coding patterns. The last section on testing patterns gave me the feeling that the only thing the book missed was a 100 page \\"Introduction to Java\\" and a \\"Scraping the bottom of the barrel\\" pattern.The books lack of pattern names at the top of the page and a sensible method of quick access to patterns plauged the Vol. 1 as well. Experienced programmers (Ie, those not learning the basics of Java) will not find this book useful enough to justify the purchase and will be very disappointed if they expect design patterns of Gamma, et al standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design pattern II","review":"Just like movies. The first book was a hit but the sequel was dissapointing. I would prefer wait for one more year and get something worthy buying. Very dissapointed. I was expecting either more patterns, more application using pattern on first book, or just digging deeper into patterns previously discussed. Too bad. I will not be waiting for volume III."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe an OK book for VERY beginners to programming in Java","review":"Despite volume One's syntactical and logical errors as pointed out by some of the reviewers, I actually liked volume 1. This sequel was so disappointing to me that I returned it as soon as I could.If you're looking for more *design* patterns, then this is NOT the book for you. If you feel that a \\"Dialog\\" is a pattern (that's right, any plain-old dialog) or if you've never used a Java interface as a holder for constants, then give this book a try; otherwise don't bother.I actually didn't find a single pattern that was interesting to me. It was either stating the obvious or completely useless. There was a whole section of \\"Testing\\" patterns at the end of the book which I didn't even bother to look at.I really don't understand the author. Did he run out of *useful* patterns to document.The only folks that might benefit from this book are extreme beginners to Java and programming in general. For the rest of us, there are other patterns books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad to find I'm not alone about this book","review":"After reading the GOF patterns book I felt I was ready to tackle on more patterns and bought this book.

Bench, who enjoyed a career that landed him in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989 speaks about his troubled marriage and divorce, his up's and down's in his career (at least through the time of publishing 1979) and his closeness with his family. The best part of his story is what it was like to be a key member of the Cincinnati Reds' Big Red Machine. From playing American Legion ball in Oklahoma to being the 1976 World Series MVP and saving the Reds from elimanation in the 1972 National League Championship Series against Pittsburgh with a bottom of the 9th game tying home run, Catch You Later makes you feel like you accompanied Bench on his travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candid Johnny Bench","review":"I first received this book for Christmas from my grandparents in either 1979 or 1980. I was only 15 years old when I read it for the first time back then, but I enjoyed reading what it was like playing for the Big Red Machine, my all time favorite team.Bench was very candid about his career, his past, family, teammates and women. He does talk about some of his liasons with females (which was eye opening to a young teenager :)). But I still have this book and occasionally will look through it. To me, Johnny is the greatest catcher ever.

It highlights the careers of all-star caliber players that just missed the MLB Hall of Fame by introducing their stats and some good anecdotes. Not enough photos especially for the old-time players that someone from this generation would need to have in order to connect with. Some of those interviewed are repeated for multiple players thereby diluting the strength of the accolades they attribute to those 'Out by a Step.'

I frankly (sexistly) deduced that both negative reviews were made by men, who perhaps didn't know much about jewelry. I have to admit they were right. The 'tarnish' that they refer to isn't tarnish at all, but more like a wearing away of the metal - it can't be rectified by polishing the ring. It's definitely not silver, which is disappointing, but they've cleverly stamped the '925' (a symbol on sterling pieces) onto the inside of the ring. I'm also relatively certain that the 'onyx' is plastic as the facets are dull and look scratched, but can't be sure about that. The ring still looks relatively cute on, and I may keep it because I bought it to wear with a specific dress to a formal event, but very disappointed that I spent $35 on something that could have very well come out of a vending machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The quality of this ring is horrible.

In this case you get what you pay for, upon receipt I was very disappointed to find that the silver was miscolored and spotted. I attempted to use a polishing cloth, but this was of no help.I would warn anyone that you get what you pay for with this ring, very cheap feeling and looking. You would be better off getting a ring out of a gumball machine. Luckily Amazon has a good return policy for these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful costume jewelry","review":"This ring is a very cheap imitation of what nice rings are supposed to be--and a bad one at that.

Even though Deborah Cox was the first to put out this song, she sounded too mature for the song.

The guy is an uninspired pianists who would struggle to keep up with proper jazz musicians, his interpetations are bland, background music and do we really need more cover versions of jazz classics? When i had the misfortune to hear this i couldn't believe how dull it really was-it makes Kenny G seemed the natural succesor to John Coltrane.

Also, ghee can be stored at room temperature, best away from light.My complaint is the cost. It is twice as expensive as butter.

The sound is amazingly transparent and detailed. The subtlest pluck of string and the softest pianissimo are perfectly captured. The crash of symbols at the beginning of the fourth movement is startling! The percussion is rendered with great clarity, with no muddiness. Every note is caressed and beautifully crafted. Perhaps the only shortcoming is a lack of intensity in the more turbulent sections. As others have noted, the parody of the Bohemian minstrels also might not have been sufficiently mocking. Regardless, the attention to detail and the craftsmanship of the playing is top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for what I've Needed","review":"This cable has worked great as a replacement male-to-male for my laptop cooler.

I built my own cabinet and attached the \\"store bought\\" top. I had to drill and countersink the base plate and used some longer screws to attach the router. As for changing bits, just loosen the locking screw and drop the motor out of the base from the bottom. Then you can change the bits with the motor on the table. This also helps keep the buildup cleaned off the depth adjusting mechanism. The depth adjustment stays in front for easy access compared to those where you twist the motor in the base. Plenty of power for all but the larger bits. I am considering the variable speed Freud plunge router for my table just for panel raising bits (more HP and slower speeds), but hate to give up the convenience of the bit changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value","review":"I am an ex- professional carpenter/ cabinet maker.

I bought this to catch in the bullpen and let some of our catchers use it a couple of times. Sudddenly, I found the starting catcher and the back-up catcher asking to use the glove all the time! The back-up bought one almost identical to mine and uses it when he's in.When the head coach left, I needed another catcher's mitt and so I went with another one. This glove has been harder to work in than my older one, but I think that the leather was softer on the other one. I have been catching our fastest pitcher and the glove is starting to work its way into shape.I would highly recommend this glove to anybody who wants an affordable alternative to one of the more high-end heart of the hide gloves.

You do not get long strands of spaghetti as pictured, but short, somewhat thick 2 inch pieces. The sauce is almost identical to Franco American Spahgettios (from what I can remember before my gluten-free days), so this will appeal to kids more so than adults. The noodles are rather hard and chewy, so the texture was the worst thing to contend with. However, it may simply be that gluten free pasta is hard to can without breaking down, so perhaps it has to be made that way. The can is a single serving size, so is a bit expensive if you factor that in. In conclusion, if you have a child that has to be gluten free and never had the chance to taste gluten products, this will probably be okay as they won't notice the texture difference. Otherwise, they may be inclined to spit it out (or at least swallow it like aspirin)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids wouldn't even eat","review":"I was very excited about this spagetti, but unfortunately, it was awful!

Several books have already been written in that fashion on the same subject in the past. It is not of any interest to those other readers looking for who the boxers were, who commanded them and where they fit in the long history of peasant uprisings in old -and not so old - China. In the book, so little is said about them that they seem to have landed in Peking from another planet.

The Boxer Rebellion is a wonderful tale of resilience, diplomacy and sometimes sheer luck. This is not an account of the boxer rebellion as a whole (maybe the British version title was better: 'Besieged in Peking'), but rather tries to capture the atmosphere of the fifty-five days that some say changed China and the world forever. The author only gives us the foreigners' perspective and we have very little information about the Boxers and the Imperial court. This helps the reader to feel for the ones trapped inside their walls, as they too had very little knowledge of what was going on in the outside world.

Often, facts are couched in a writing style that expresses the either the author's opinion or an attempt to be humorous or witty.If you want a quick read that will leave you wanting to know more, and don't mind *a lot* of opinion, this book is okay.

An overview of Israel by someone who does not parrot the pro-Israel line. Finally. Sadly, Mr. David has become so hostile to Israel that he sees evil everywhere and is unwilling to give any Israeli the benefit of the doubt. This book is overbalanced in its hostility.It is also very (surprisingly) weak on the 1945 to 1949 period that created Israel. By weak, I mean he just doesnt give enough pages to this vital period.That said, the book does offer some information that might lead interested readers to better, less biased sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm.","review":"What to say about this book?Yes, it is biased to the nth degree- it has no pretensions to the contrary, though, so we can't fault it for that. (...)It can run thin on certain topics- like early Zionism, for example. Much better books on the topic from a similar viewpoint exist, such as Chomsky's 'The Fateful Triangle'- a scholarly, tasteful, and engaging, if also unashamedly biased, exploration of the subject. Just note how readily David regurgitates him; obvious 'borrowing' is an obvious sign of quality.However, this is a good ultra-quick, ultra-dirty guide both to the flaws of the status quo and to 'anti-Zionist' thinking. It's perfect for debates and light essays- both for easy collection of facts to back up one's argument and understanding 'the other side'. Think of it as Cliff Notes for Chomsky and Said, if you will- it would be a grave insult to author, viewpoint it represents, and reader to think of it as anything more serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written.","review":"This is the first book I have ever returned to a bookstore.

This book only contains the bad things the Jewish did. I did not say that those are not facts, but in order to be objective and to learn the truth, information was needed from both sides. The author also put personal comments that were very sarcastic. For example, after describing about a man who cruelly murdered Arabs, he said \\"Sounds like quite a guy!\\". I personally as a reader did not need those sarcastic comments. I want to be able to make my own decisions about what I think. If the author intention was to present his own point of view on the matter, certainly he has the right to do so. However, maybe the title should be different. The title should clearly said that this book was his own point of view and did not represent the Jewish point of view. I felt deceived and manipulated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be subtitled ...","review":"This book is an extremely partisan manifesto of the Arab-Israeli conflict; it simplifies this tragic case where two largely just claims collide into a black-white issue. It is not suitable material for 'beginners' who might prefer to form their own opinions: It is rather propaganda. I am not lamenting that fact just because the propaganda happens to be anti-Israeli - If it was so utterly anti-Palestinian I would have the same objections.For those who are looking for a book just to get a clear overview of this vexing conflict, amazon has many other fine titles available. This one is not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Required Objective View","review":"More than a protest against Israel and an insistence on nullifying the existence of the state, the author urges, or rather insists on the objective truth to be exclaimed first, and then further debate to ensue. Some of the negative critique on this book were written by subjective, ethnically biased, close minded hotheads screaming that Ron David promotes a one sided view. The 'other side's view'. They should consider the reality that so many of his statements made in this book seem so skewed to them only due to the factual truth behind them suddenly exposing misconceptions they had carried through their whole life. Prior to reading this book I also had a slew of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame more people do not read this book","review":"I bought this book and I have to give it a 1. For the simple reason that it is not more widely distributed. It is exceedingly fair, and very informative. Please, do not take my word for it. Get the book yourself, and note that every single thing the author says, who is Jewish, is backed up by verifiable facts. The shame is that these facts, while absolutely concrete in international law and agreements, have been largely ignored.The author is NOT an anti-semite, and critises that are. He is not a Holocaust denier, and he is very sympathetic to it( of course, he is Jewish after all).Just because his chapter titles are quirky doesn't mean that the information contained therein is false; read it, he backs up everything by quotes from leaders, and history that is not denied by anyone, even by Zionists.It is something that everyone should read, since US tax dollars are what fund the Israeli regime more than anything else. We should know what that pays for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscholarly material","review":"I can see from the other reviews that this book has an audience. But it is simply antizionist propaganda with little connection to reality. I do not recommend it.Oh, there's some great storytelling.

And you'll find out that the Jews were absent from the area for 1900 years. And much, much more. Even if such statements were true, they would be irrelevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict.If you want to know something about the Arab-Israeli conflict, there are plenty of reasonable books on the subject. My advice for a beginners level book is \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict,\\" by Mitchell Bard. I also recommend \\"Islam and Dhimmitude,\\" by Bat Ye'or. And yet another reasonable book is \\"The Rape of Palestine and the Struggle for Jerusalem,\\" by Lionel Casper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever published this work should be arrested for incompetence","review":"This is perhaps the worst book I have ever read on the Middle East conflict. It is so simplistic so biased, so wrongheaded that one wonders why whoever put it in covers did so. It portrays little Israel as monstrous superpower gobbling up Arab lands. The Arabs own one eighth of planet earth and have not managed to put up one democracy in the twenty plus nations they have. This book is by the way not up-to- date and goes up only to 1993. I was particularly offended at the way it defamed the late Sa'ad Haddad head of the former South Lebanese Army, a true Lebanese patriot unlike the Islamic fundamentalists now controlling the territory he once worked to keep free of terrorists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Israel Propaganda","review":"My recommendation is that you skip this one. The authors present a wholly one-sided Israel-bashing view of the conflict which ignores most of the well documented history of the conflict.I suggest you google instead. The only reason it gets one star is that this propaganda leaflet masquerading as scholarship has some minor amusement value...did make me laugh. Also, one star is the lowest rating possible. Ultimately it would be a shame if anyone actually believed the content of this book although I'm confident that few objective readers will fall for it. If you must read it though, make sure you go to the Israeli Embassy website to read a more balanced viewpoint.Beware any document on the Arab-Israeli conflict which demonizes the opposing viewpoint. Also, beware of books recommended by those who *liked* this one! Whew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bombast kills the message","review":"Writer's like Mr. David don't seem to understand that in presenting a wildly opinionated view of the Arab/Israeli crisis, they will inavariably alienate open-minded readers. Much of the information here is fascinating, and is certainly contrary to the myths and one-sided journalistic fluff that we're usually exposed to, but the author's sarcasm and borderline hysteria makes the message hard to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent foil to prevailing discourse on this issue.","review":"In school, were you ever taught that Menacham Begin and Yitzak Shamir were big time terrorists? e.g. assassinating UN diplomats, British Lords,...blowing up the King David Hotel to further their goals? I wasn't. Written in a casual, sometimes puerile tone; Mr. David factually contradicts many popular notions about the roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict.His thesis is that Israel, not the Arabs, has been the aggressor in the Middle East for most of this century. Furthermore, he uses the words and actions of many Israeli leaders to back his claims.If you've ever wondered why the words \\"Arab terrorist\\" roll off the tounge but \\"Israeli terrorist\\" is almost beyond the boundary of expressable opinion; this book is for you.Depending upon your political orientation, you'll either love or hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Peace Through Better Understanding\\"","review":"Mr. David has definitely taken the road less traveled...One hopes and prays that Mr. David's attempt to create a better understanding about this touchy subject will help with the middle-east peace process, and in the end help save the lives & ease the sufferings of-among others-countless Arabs, Jews, and Christians.

I'm a little less impressed, simply because not all the directions are clear. A couple of things that we weren't sure about, we adjusted the rules to fit our own needs. It still worked out just fine. My 7 year old plays it as well, despite the game recommending ages 8 and up (I think).No Harry Potter knowledge is needed, but basing it on Harry Potter makes it a little more interesting. My youngest son enjoys sending people back to \\"start\\" with the ghost.We chose this game over the Trivia game, as only my oldest son and I have read the books as of right now.

I almost bought the Clue Harry Potter Game, but thought the more expensive game would have a beautiful board and wooden pieces - some sort of work of art at least, not just a cardboard playing surface and plastic pieces. I read the reviews that expressed how much fun it is. It may be fun, but I don't know. I was going to wait until my son opened it for Christmas to play it with him. I think I'd rather not now...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"Honestly, $100 for this game is outrageous!

But only to take apart and scoot around the bathroom. The main problem is the seat not being latched to the base. It easily moves around and once my daughter noticed this it became a toy that she takes apart and carries into other rooms. She's gone potty a few times on it and when she notices Mom or Dad going potty she'll pull it out and sit on it next to us, but not for long. I tried putting the seat on our toilet and it fits with a bit of sliding around but no way for her to fall in. Perhaps I'll try that for a bit and see how it works out. Oh another thing, the seat has crannies for pee to get stuck in that make it hard to clean. Not a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft, cushy","review":"My 16 mo is underweight for her age >1st percentile, however, the seat still fit her bottom well. I had also ordered the Kalencom pottette but she slid through that one and we had to return it. I thought that we would use the potty in addition to the seat, however, I have never had to use the potty. The step stool is odd shaped (potty-shaped) and cannot fit snugly by an adult potty seat or sink. I havent been able to use it as a secure step-stool for this reason. The potty seat in itself is cushy and comfortable for my baby and she seems to like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"toilet trainer","review":"dont really like this one, it is to hard for him to get on, and the part for the boy doesnt work well. disappointed for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay seat but needs grip bottom","review":"We purchased this item for our daughter (just shy of 2 now) so we could ease her into using the potty. It is okay but I am currently looking for something else.Pros: Lightweight, no fancy buttons or anything requiring batteries, easy to clean up, separate seat that fits on toiletCons: slides all around the bathroom floor, handle broke off, cheaply made, no storage areas like other potties offer, when lid is down as stool it's too short for my toddler (who's very tall for her age) to reach the sink for brushing teeth/washing hands.Overall it's done the job, but when the handle broke off recently I decided it was time to look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I have never written a review on here before, but after my experience with this potty, I thought I should. I bought it on here after reading great reviews about this training potty. I have to say, it gets the job done and it's small for traveling, but that's the only good thing about it. It's cheaply made, which is not great for my very active son who climbs on top of everything and throws everything where he can. Today, one of the handles broke off and anther broke in half, though it is still attached to the seat. It had a lot of nooks and cranies to clean, and I have had a few messes to clean up because of the urine guard as well. I have yet to use the portable seat on a real toilet so I cannot tell you my experience on that, but it is a hassle because it moves around a lot, as it does not attach to the training potty base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Potty I've Seen","review":"I did a lot of research before finally purchasing this potty, and I'm so glad I did! It is by far the best potty I have seen...easy to use, easy to clean, no worries about leaks with the long front splash gaurd and a decent size! I don't normally write reviews, but thought this potty was worth the time. The removable seat is not exactly what I was expecting...it's rubbery rather than cushie and isn't all one piece...but it is still very good quality and keeps accidents at bay...I've found splash guards to be a necessity for both girls and boys! It's also nice to have something that can transition from the little potty to the big one. My daughter is 18 months old and almost potty trained thanks to an early start at it with this potty. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter liked it.","review":"This is our first time potty training a child and we feel lucky that we found a good product. The seat seems comfortable. My daughter likes to hold the handles. It's very easy to dump and to clean. I like knowing that the seat can later be used on the big toilet. It will make the transition easier since she will be familiar with it. Also, the price is reasonable so we bought two of them. One for upstairs and one for downstairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan to return","review":"This was delivered on time but I didn't open it right away cause my son isn't old enough yet.

It's not too much problem when she pees although she likes to look down and some pee just shoots right out. But it's when she poops. She likes to get up and look then seat back down and smears poop all over the seat. And there are lots of parts to take to wash then dry. I am back on Amazon to look for a different one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toilet training and transitioning","review":"This toilet trainer is great. Easy to use, clean and is multi-functioning. Love the way we can use this as a step stool too, and it doesn't slide around. My daughter can carry it by herself over to the sink and already has her own routine! This has made training easier and the seat can also be used on regular sized toilets so this is a really good deal! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it so much we bought two","review":"My son is just starting to potty train.

I'm very happy and pleased with my decision.This potty is great. It comes apart easily for cleaning. It is just the right height for her to get on and off without help. The hole for the potty is large enough so everything goes where it's suppose to and the seat is soft and flexible and shaped for comfort, and I mean soft plastic not padded so nothing soaks into it to cause odors later.

Peter Parker's friends Gwen Stacy, Mary-Jane Watson and Harry Osborn also emerge in this run. Amazon's current listing of Steve Ditko as illustrator is incorrect. John Romita (Sr.) drew all monthly issues in this collection (Stan Lee's brother Larry Lieber drew the one annual). As testament of Romita's skill the artwork impresses despite the removal of his coloring.I prefer the Amazing Spider-Man DVD-ROM for its complete collection of the entire ASM run in full color PDFs.

Ben appreciates Delilah's physical attributes but also recognizes her goodness and character. His campaign to win her heart through kindness and romance makes the book a great read. As an added bonus, Banks has included two other romances featuring four well-developed secondary characters. And each chapter begins with a \\"Delilah's Dictum,\\" a memorable axiom by which the heroine lives (e.g., \\"Word to the wise: Don't go into a catfight with long hair and acrylic nails. You'll lose both.\\") Banks' witty dialogue, hot love scenes, and heart-warming storyline make this a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love another great Leanne Banks book!","review":"For anyone who has ever laughed and cried and loved a Leanne Banks book, don't miss this one!Yes, like her wonderful Silhouette Desires this book is hot.

This book, Secret Lover, was all I thought it would be, and then some. Julia writes with the kind of fast moving action that I like, yet with the in-depth character development that a good writer is known for. Every book has just gotten better and better. I cannot recommend her stories highly enough. If you start this Secret Lover, I guarantee you will not be able to put it down. The romance of Rachel and Caleb should be made into a movie. And that epiloque! It was wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read in a long time...","review":"This book was very entertaining and allows the reader to become immersed in the story. It is slow at times, but the story is complex and the ending is not dragged out to the point of being predictable.Caleb is a really great hero, because he says exactly what he is thinking and does not play games with Sophie. Once he knows his feelings he never wavers and his responses and reactions are very realistic.I disagree with the reviewer who thought the epilogue was rushed. I rarely have the opportunity to read a book where the rest of the character's lives are explained. I found the epilogue very touching and a perfect ending to this book. When you invest time reading a story, you want to know what happens to the characters past the next year of their lives. Julia London is a very talented author, but read her \\"Charmer\\" series first or you may not like Sophia's brother Julian very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well written sequel","review":"This was a very enjoyable read. The characters were very real and likeable. I agree that the first 40 pages or so were a slow read at first but I knew it would get better. The story was very good after that and I really enjoyed seeing Sophie have a better turn of events from the last book. I also thought the epilogue could have just been left out. It seemed very rushed and I really didn't want to know all of the info given. It kind of ruined the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL AND BORING!!!!","review":"I could not finish this book!!!!

Have read almost everything from the Literary Guild to the Mystery Guild. I have read all of Julia London's books. But in \\"The Secret Lover\\" she went a long way to create a character that is so completely unable to think for herself, the most insipid, weak minded female I have ever read about. Yet at the same time created Caleb, a perfectly wonderful, kind, understanding man. Sophie actually disgusted me to the point that Ms London has lost a reader.

A young woman elopes with a nefarious cad who abuses her. She escapes to the Continent with the aid of her brother who also helps her get a scandalous divorce. Eight years go by. I was intrigued.Then came the first chapter. The first 4 drag on and on, introducing absurd secondary characters and back story that I'm sure were meant to be amusing and/or informative - it failed miserably. Fifty pages into the story we finally get an indication that the hero will so make an appearance. I could barely tolerate the TSTL Sophie and the intrusion of Honorine and Lucie Cowplain type characters.I skimmed over the pages, looking for some substance to this story. I got so annoyed with crowd of characters who suffocated this romance with their own little personalities that up just ended up throwing it against the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Love Story","review":"I'm so glad Julia London created a story for Sophie - a 2nd chance after a really bad decision to marry a man who used her and abused her. I agree that it was a little slow to get going, but I loved that the love between the h/h stayed true throughout. Their primary obstacles came from outside sources (friends, family, society), but the readers knew with certainty that the hero truly loved the heroine and she was not making a mistake again. This was about Sophie learning from her mistakes and making better decisions and having courage in making those decisions. I loved the ending and thought it was beautiful. Worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!","review":"This was such a wonderful book!! It starts off a bit slow but develops into such a heart warming plot that leaves you wanting more!

I knew that my weight issues all had to do with my view of food and use of food -- I wanted to rewire my thinking. This was a good mental booster to keep me focused. Sometimes, I even heard myself repeating the lines on the tape when I was getting ready to eat for a reason other than hunger. It stopped me and got me out of the kitchen. I listened to it in the car almost every day for a year (even the tape tells you not to listen to side A in the car). Anyway, I am now 20 lbs lighter and feel like food isn't the demon in my life it always has been. 20 pounds isn't much, but for someone who has been on a diet since 2nd grade, finally feeling like you've got food figured out at age 35 is the real prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tried everything and nothing works?

But you do have to listen to it everyday, both sides for six months to get yourself reprogrammed, even though you start losing weight after the first month. I have worn my tape out and am buying another. Thank you Slim Forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found it again","review":"I had the cassette of Slim Forever for Women many years ago when it first came out.

Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love side B.","review":"I have Ms Howell's ' Weight Loss ' subliminal cd and have been using it several days now and really love it so far.I went ahead and ordered this one as well, thinking it was another cd of only subliminals as I favor those over any guided hynosis which I have never had any success with, either with cds or in person sessions, nor am I am fan of affirmations that I do not believe about myself. Having me repeat things like ' I am in demand ' seems silly to me, as I am not in demand at all, and making me say it over and over will not make me believe it.This cd is a combo, and the fault lies with me for not reading the product description or going to the website, had I done so I would have known that the subliminals that I am seeking are only on side b, side A is a guided hypnosis with affirmations to say.I love Part B so far, but am glad I paid under $ 10 for it, as I will only be listening to half the cd.If you love affirmations, hynosis and subliminals then this is for you !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Nothing is a magic weight loss pill but this tape is as close as it gets. Very very rewarding. My thoughts about food were changing from the first time I listened to it.If you must drink coffee, this guy recommends coffee substitutes because coffee is high is pesticides and decaf can still contain up to 14 mg of caffeine per cup. He refers to it as having your morning cup of pesticides. So think of it that way and perhaps it will be easier to go off coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifestyle Changes, Not Dieting","review":"So far so good for me. I have lost 8 lbs in 2 months of using this tape.Side A is a relaxation technique that helps you think positively about your body, and develop new habits with eating and exercise. It's all about having a new attitude about food. It's better to feel slightly hungry than to feel uncomfortably full. It also tells you to only eat foods that translate into beauty and health for your body. This is the only part I found lacking. What foods, exactly, translate into beauty and health? Fresh fruits and veggies, of course, but what about low fat processed foods? I suppose the author intends to leave this to the judgement of each listener.Side B is music and wave sounds over voice, apparently containing the same message as side A.I will continue to use this program, and keep you updated with future successes.Best of luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Success Here","review":"I have listened to the tape FAITHFULLY every night for almost eight weeks, and it has not impacted my inability to focus on weight loss.

Since most of the reviews were pretty positive. I have been studying a lot on the subconscious in these past years, so I do know that working with the subconscious can bring in positive changes. I do believe that this tape might genuinely work miracles for some people, but obviously one size does not fit all. I listened to it for 5 weeks straight, everyday, once for side one and maybe four times on average daily for side two. But nope my eating habits didn't really change for the better. Most of the stuffs stated on the tape were pretty positive, but a few statements I felt they could have done without or worded in a way that could have been a bit more positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant End to a Major Sci Fi Series","review":"A brilliant end to the series. She ends of the triliogy in a fashion that links up various series in a almost seamless way. Few authors can write a series over such a long period and make little mistakes in the time line. Truly an outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a worthy finale","review":"The saga of the Plieocene Exiles was so good that it's almost unfair to compair the rest of May's books against it. However one would like to think that the finale would at least be compatible with the story told in the original series. This book is not. The metapsychic rebellion ends up presented as a minor piece of fluff, relatively inconsequencial compared to all of the build up. It was especially weak compared to the way the rebellion was presented in the original series.May remains a good storyteller, she just ought to keep her story straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great ending. Rush job?","review":"This book isn't that bad, but it's not great. It's worth getting if you want to finish the Trilogy. But the Trilogy isn't that great in itself.The Saga of the Exiles was much better than the Milieu Trilogy. The latter seems like the result of a rush job compared to the former. A bit disappointing, knowing what Ms. May was capable of.Also as someone mentioned, there are many inconsistencies between the two. For one, in the Pliocene Saga the metapsychics were hurling mind bolts spinning illusions fairly easily. Whereas in the Milieu Trilogy, Marc (Mr Powerful himself) in his youth and most of the rest seem to be much weaker (except for farspeech)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book did absolutely nothing for me","review":"I enjoyed the previous two books (\\"Jack the Bodiless\\" and \\"The Diamond Mask\\"), they were above average science fiction books.With \\"Magnificat\\" however, I kept rolling my eyes at the blatant attempts by the author to use the novel as a platform for her religious and moral views. She just ended up making the characters look stupid. These people are ultra-intelligent, demi-god like characters, yet they ended up acting like a bunch of dumb, little kids, no intrigue, no slick plots, just \\"the biggest brain wins\\" period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewrite the last 30 pages","review":"I had a similar problem with the Pleiocene Saga in that May weaves a rich tapestry of characters and compelling situations, only to cut you off after the climax. This book would profit from a lengthy denoument, something for the reader to savor after making it through the first 8 books. Events at the end do happen too quickly and while the final conflict and resolution is cogent, as always, a deeper satsifaction is lacking. Still, May's universe is extremely well-structured and just a staggeringly brilliant vision of the future. The scope and bredth of her entire body of work is inspiring. Magnificat begins in the same meticulous and careful manner we've come to expect from May. Right about the time that Marc first meets Cyndia, it seems events get a little clumsy and rushed. Still a highly recommended series, and if you've read the first two, you can't stop there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"Julian May is such an imaginative, forward thinking and gifted writer, that it is difficult not to become personally involved in the beautiful and tragic fates of her characters. This is one of the best series that I have ever read, and I recommend it to any one who has a love for intelligent and accurate science fiction. With a meld of hard science, Teilhardian philosphy and some foward thinking, she has examined the foibles of human nature and shown us a fascinating world. All her books have been compulsive reading, and I hope that there are other people out there who appreciate this series as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"not useful, overpriced","review":"The same item is available on Amazon under a different title for $1.45 at http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00012K7UU/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_f/103-4797890-7675868The photo on this page shows one hand holding the magnifier for use.

For this purpose, it is almost useless, The instructions which come with it say it should be held 4 feet from the page....which means you need 3 hands to read a book.I used it for the first time looking up a number in a compact phone book. Holding it the recommended distance seriously distorted the image. It was very dificult to read. I think this will, in short order, become an entertaining optical toy for my son (it is a fresnel lans).I'm glad I decided to order more than one magnifying tool because I did find one which was as good as this is disappointing. Although much smaller, the Fulcrum LED Card Magnifier is much more useful. The lens is clear (no distortion), it has a smaller area of higher magnification and a useful and very bright built in led. It's also very portable so I can always have one around when I need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not replace a high quality magnifying glass","review":"This page magnifier is the size of a page, but the quality of the magnifying glass is extremely poor. If you raise the flexible page just a little above the page, all resolution is lost. It's like looking through high guage clear plastic, there is no clarity.

It never failed to make me laugh and make me cry. Her Real Name is particularly haunting. Even after not having read it in a long time, I still recall images from it as if i was there.

When I was driving 7.5 hours one way on a Friday and then back again on Sunday, I needed something that went beyond music. I stopped in a truck stop and perused the audio books. The Destroyer series looked fun.It has been sheer pleasure to listen to! I even (now that I am no longer driving so much) listen to them in the car for the shorter commute.Cheesy? Campy? Silly? Sure! That is exactly what makes them so much fun. I was a huge fan of the old Green Hornet series and these books remind me of that. They are graphic in description for sure, but listening to Richard Sapir read them is marvelous. He is very talented.I will be buying more of the audio books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Original","review":"This is yet another of the knock-offs of Captain Charles Johnson's General History of Pirates. It includes narratives of all the old favorites: Blackbeard, Kidd, Roberts, Bonny and others. As usual, Johnson's prose is preserved and some of the original illustrations grace the pages. The editor/publisher has includes a glossary, bibliography and notes to the original text.However, the down side of this particular volume is that it includes only a subset of Johnson's original writings. And, there is no added index with which to quickly reference particular names and such. While I don't quite agree that the editor has ruined the original, I do find that this version falls short of its potential. P-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirates","review":"I didn't like this book.

Even fewer that I couldnt even finish due to how bad it was. This book tops both lists. I have a passion for the cival war as well as the men involved. I wanted to learn more about Gen Sherman so I picked this book up. I wish I had not. The writing is tedious and boring. The author may have spent 5 years researching the personal and military writings of William Sherman, but he should have spent another 5 writing a book that was worth reading!! I HATED this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better served elsewhere","review":"Probably closer to two and a half stars.While someone new to Sherman will get something from this book, the best biography still is Marszalek's. The Sherman in this book comes across (at least to me) as a cardboard man at times, which, having read Marszalek's book (and others), I knew not to be the case.Although the book covers his whole life and is over 400 pages, most of the important military aspects of his career (look at the subtitle) are given little coverage. A couple of pages each for Shiloh, Chattanooga, not much better for the Atlanta Campaign and the March to the Sea!Analysis of Sherman's relationship with Grant is cursory, which is a pity, because this axis was the major factor in the Union's triumph in 1864-65.I don't intend to keep my copy now that I have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherman","review":"I found the book to be a great read. The author gives just enough background and insight into the Civil War without going overboard. I was looking for a biography on William Tecumseh Sherman, the man, not a book about Sherman and the Civil War. This book fit like glove. The author does a great job of bringing Sherman to life in all aspects of his life: family problems, his military ambition and his foray's into the private sector. Though Sherman is probably most remembered for his 'March to the Sea', the author gives it appropriate attention, but there was certainly more to Sherman than that military campaign. Excellent book on Sherman.

The book is couched, loosely, as a college English syllabus (Not unlike Lew Welch's hilarious and luminous Courses). Written in the last year of his life, and published just after his death, Style is a witty, unsparing look at teaching, poetry, writers (Style 3 features a wonderful insight into the curious relationship between William Wantling and Charles Bukowski--complete with an actual letter fo Bukowski excoriating Wantling for his failure as a poet since becoming a teacher), and the vicissitudes of the writing life. Wantling as teacher? Wonderful! Would loved to have taken a class with him. That's not possible, but this book brings it close.--Kevin Jones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Finally, a definitive Chatwin biography! I waited years for this -- and I wasn't disappointed. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about this fascinating writer. The thing to remember about Chatwin is that he was a very English character and I think this may frustrate some non-English readers who -- forgive me for saying so -- may lack the taste or patience to appreciate him (as some of the petulant comments from previous reviewers suggest). He was such a difficult man to figure out even to his friends and I am not surprised that he ultimately comes across as unknowable in this otherwise thorough, valuable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reference.

I knew this man was a controversial but interesting figure, whose book \\"In Patagonia\\" had moved me deeply years ago; I expected great things from his biography.Was it Nicholas Shakespeare's prose? I don't know. It is hard to believe that one could be bored reading about such a hyperactive, outrageous and exciting adventurer. Much as I hate putting down the author's obviously monumental effort, I look forward to the day when Bruce Chatwin's life will be written about with the same vibrancy, intensity and verve with which he lived it.There is no doubt that the book is of great value as a reference and a resource about Chatwin and his life.

The author introduces the verilog programming issues in a smooth manner .

The examples tend to be contrived and mostly show how *not* to write good Verilog code - by the author's own admission! You won't find a decent example of how to model a flip flop until pg. 144, in the chapter \\"Advanced Procedural Modeling.\\" If you really want this book anyway, buy it used and keep it for reference. After all, in the introduction the book says \\"Some of the information you want might be outside the scope of this book. Some of the other sources are simulator reference manuals; and the comp.lang.verilog usenet news group.\\" (sic)You could also try \\"HDL Chip Design\\" by Smith since it covers Verilog and VHDL. At least it shows good style and thoroughly explains what each line of code is doing and shows synthesis results with small schematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy transition to verilog, good reference book","review":"I have a VHDL background and this book was recommended to me. It made a smoooth transition into verilog. I read the book globally and then kept the book as a reference on my desk. If I needed something specific like file I/O and generating vectors, I used the example as a template to complete my verification. Also it helped to organize my files, like having one verification environment and easily plugging in tests by use of common tasks.

This is the best business book I have read so far in 2006 (of 20 total)."},{"rating":"1","title":"pseudo-intellectual junk","review":"This book is easy to read quickly, and not worth reading slowly. It is an unorganized collection of short, repetitive essays that draw analogies between choosing investments and findings from psychology and other areas of science. Nothing here is novel to anyone who reads magazines like Wired, or book reviews in the Economist, among other sources. Nothing in this book is quantitatively precise or directly applicable. Everything is suggestive, that's all. Parts may be thought-provoking if you haven't seen them before, but everything is derivative of other authors.This book was written to make a buck, that's all. The editing is cynically sloppy. For example, the table on 56 is an update of the table on page 75, but neither page has a reference to the other. The author teaches a class related to this book in the Columbia University MBA program. I hope the class has some rigor; this book does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intelligent Book","review":"I bought a copy after seeing a rave review and for the first 50 pages or so this book held my breathless attention - a sort of freakonomics for the high-brow set. The fact that from that point onward I could pretty much skim the book was a sign of how fast knowledge is becoming disseminated these days - the ideas sounded so familiar (the unlikely events are much probable than most people think, the fat tails, etc, etc). This is not really a criticism - if I knew this before I bought the book, I would still buy and enjoy it.

I thought it was going to be more interesting than it was. The more I read, the sillier the whole concept of being a debutante seemed. I also felt like the author copied the style of the reporters who used to report on debutante balls.

As an alumnus of Parks College of Aeronautical Technology and as a Docent at Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, I use this book frequently. In all my efforts, accuracy is of the utmost importance. This book satisfies me in my efforts. I only have one gripe with it, and it is relatively minor. There is a clear, well-defined, difference between engines and motors. Engines require heat energy in order to perform work and motors do not. Motors produce heat as a result of performing work...a big difference. It appears that the author is not aware of this and he continues to equate the terms (engines and motors). Other than that, he has done a fine job. I know the difference and, when asked or conducting a tour, I so inform visitors of this difference with a touch of humor. Regardless, I love the book. The author did a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool, Lots of Insight","review":"Drive Well, Sleep Carefully is visually interesting with great tunes and tons of live footage. For those who are looking for a \\"live\\" dvd with uncut performances, this dvd is not for you. The whole disc feels more like a documentary than a live and uncut sort of disc. That's not entirely a bad thing, because voice overs add to the overall artistic feel of the disc. It seems like some people have given this dvd a lot of negative feedback because the members of Deatcab come off as whiny occasionally;however, it seems that many reviews that give negative feedback do not take into consideration that being a \\"rockstar\\" is a difficult job. Frankly, Deathcab is rather honest in many parts of the film, and Drive Well, Sleep Carefully shows a dimension of touring that a lot of music fans do not see. Overall, this disc is worth adding to a disc collection for non-Deatcab and Deathcab fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This DVD is amazing.

I admit, I love their music and, in print, Deathcab interviews well...but this little filmstrip fails to capture either very well. Which probably is less of a critique on the band than the film-maker/editor. (Who knows what a better cutter might have come up with.) On the PRO side, they did shoot it all in 16mm and some of the extras (the Lightness demo in particular) are excellent. Buy their music? YES, see them live? - YES. Buy this DVD?

I don't think anyone finished it. In fact at one stage I read out one or two of the more pretentious and portentous passages to my partner, and we ended up rolling around laughing at the meaningless gibberish posing as serious insight.

It is a must read if you're a fan of the intellectual novel. I found myself having to \\"translate\\" it as I went, chapter by chapter, in order to keep up with all the literary, philosophical and historical references. This is not at all a plot-driven book, in fact it seems to be completely unencumbered by any kind of standard novel format. It can be read front to back, back to front, or in the \\"prescribed\\" order. Several of the chapters could be extracted completely from the book and stand alone quite nicely. Yet, it is a novel, with a crew of characters and settings you would love to be a part of. Latin American beatniks in 50's Paris?

If you have taken any antibiotics, there is a good chance that your intestinal flora is out of whack and that probiotics can help.In any event, my only complaint is that the information is rather sparse in terms of general health questions given the price of the book.

I've only used it once and washed one time after using it with Frederic shampoo and conditioner and still feel the solfness. I haven't put it to the ultimate test, but I have walked in to the bathroom when my husband was showering and my hair didn't frizz like normal!

Unfortunately, she speaks WAY too fast, a little too much, and just zips through the poses. The narration is off- she's telling you to take your time, relax into it, breathe a lot- while on screen she's already moved into the next pose- so she has to quickly catch up in her narration. I am in no way a traditionalist so I don't take issue with the approach- I just find it irritating and don't get how it's supposed to be for beginners. It's just too speedy a form of yoga for my taste (and that's saying something because my regular kundalini is by no means slow)- and now I unfortunately have 4 of these discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Awesome Yoga!","review":"I haven't flowed through all the routines yet but what I have done have been terrific! There's the right mix of being easy enough for newbies but also opportunities to keep going in poses to further challenge if that's what's right for you. I'm looking forward to hopefully get into some of these advanced poses someday. And how about the value!?! Hours & hours of yoga for only $20. I've seen videos with an hour of flow for close to $20 in the big box stores. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with these DVDs. I'm so glad I've got my set!!

I was at a point in my practice where I needed more of a challenge. She does a good job of explaining pose variations which helped me get more from yoga. The only thing that I didn't really get and was a little annoyed by was her tendency to say \\"breathe a lot\\". What does that mean?

I wash w/ my baby's cloth diapers, and it would usually turn inside out in the wash. The dry cycle made the thin plastic waterproof line start to come lose. It slowly got worse, with each wash/dry cycle. And now it's totally off, so just not a usable laundry bag (I used this bag as a hanging laundry bag, not a pail liner). I also have the green bag and the liner seems more durable, more secure. No problems in the dry cycle. Will not be buying another of these; some cloth diaper friends recommend Planetwise. Can't cinch this bag shut well enough to keep smells coming out to a minimum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wetbag for cloth diapers","review":"We've got two of these for our 10 gallon step can that we use as a diaper pail & they're just great. We had some issues w/our dipes delaminating (the inner plastic coating pulling away from the outer fabric - as a result, they look wrinkly) and these wetbags went throught the same hot/sanitary cycles and there's no sign of the delamination on them. They're great! And the colors are good, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKED!","review":"I read all of the positive reviews on this bag, and really wanted to like it. However, I used it for 2 days and it leaked terribly! Also, it caused a real headache in the washing machine. The bag would fill up with water but it wouldn't all drain out in the spin cycle, so the remaining water would drip all over my diapers, getting them too wet to throw in the dryer, and requiring me to do an extra spin cycle. What's the point of a pail liner if it's going to leak and cause extra work on laundry day? Now I just throw my dipes straight into the pail, and disinfect the pail while the wash is running. So much easier than dealing with the bag. I don't know what I'm going to do with the bag at this point - I'll either use it as a dry laundry bag, or return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice wet bag, but a little expensive....","review":"I've had this bag for almost a year, and it's been washed every 2-3 days during that whole time. It has held up in the lengthy, hot washes very well! I always line dry it, so that may help too. I like the drawstring top, but only use it when I'm traveling. I found that leaving the top open and exposing the diapers to air cuts WAY down on the ammonia build-up. This bag fits perfectly in a 13-gallon trash can.The only drawback is the price -- there are other decent wet bags out there that oost less. I'm not sure the drawstring top is important enough to make up the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this wetbag for our pail","review":"so great that we bought another one! best brand. opens up very wide for easy use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly, and damp","review":"This bag is a thin material that is very much the same as the outside covers of my bumgenius - I keep it inside my diaper pail, and at first used it like I would a garbage bag like shown in the pic - folded over the pail - so I could drop dirty diapers in through my diaper pail lid. Because my poor little girl's room smelled like pee so bad the next morning, I started pulling the draw string and stuffing the bag in the pail to try and keep the smell in, but that is not working either. It has felt a bit damp to me as well. I have a small wet happened bag I travel with that does a great job, so I think that I will look for something larger like that. For now, I spray lysol in and on the pail every morning to try and keep the smell at bay a bit. I would not suggest this bag for cloth diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A workhorse pail liner","review":"We chose this product as our cloth diapering pail liner for its price and for its versatility. It is the perfect size to line a 10 gallon step trash can, which is what we use as our \\"diaper pail.\\" The stretchy elastic at the top allows the liner to fit the pail perfectly. Whenever we wash diapers, we also wash the liner, so it stays clean and nice-smelling. I have found that the bag travels well, too. We have used it for car trips and I have taken it in my suitcase on a plane. When we get to our destination, I hang the bag on a doorknob. It holds several days' worth of diapers, which is especially nice when we're traveling and unable to do laundry as frequently.

She carts down the famous composers dedicating a page or two to each of them pertaining to different eras and different classical styles.

The Polar Express was reviewed as one of the best and I have to say they were not wrong. The Engine is spectacular, but the rest of the cars are not quite as grand as they are made of light plastic though they look good and the interiour lighting is a nice touch. I highly recomemmend this set to anyone looking to get into toy trains,with care it will last for years. It does take more room that an Ho set would but this is the size train (O gage)I had as a kid. We set it up under our christmas tree and when the grandkids came over they could not get enough of it. It was a huge sucess and I am looking forward to building up a train table in the basement as a project of fun that will last for some years to come.

Quality is good but not perfect.","review":"My 1 and 3 year old love to watch the train go around the tree and push the whistle button. It's fun for them, even though they are too young to snap the tracks together or connect the cars. The puffing smoke worked nicely right out of the box. The set comes with enough track to make a rounded corner square around the base of our Christmas tree perfectly. The observation deck railing doesn't stay on, and will need a couple drops of crazy glue. One of the track pieces had a flaw in the plastic snap, but it still worked perfectly all Christmas season. Nice and very heavy metal Locomotive. Feels like quality! The passenger cars all light up nicely. I think the steam-sounds tender would be a nice addition to this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product - - DO NOT BUY!","review":"This train was to be the star Christmas gift for by boys....it did not run.

He loves trains and especially the Polar Express. We opened it and set it up. The train itself looks great and is very heavy. We put it on the track and ran it. After about 5 minutes the green light goes out on the transformer and the train stops. I called Lionel customer support and they said they have had problems with the CW80 transformer and they would replace it. Great news. I received the the new transformer 2 1/2 weeks later. My son was so excited. We set it up again and push the lever and the train goes 1/4 away around the track and the green light goes out again. They are replacing it again but im not holding my breathe. The transformer is made in china. Do I need to say anymore?Received my third Cw80 transformer and guess what.

This is a high quality Lionel train set with a fine build quality. No regrets. I have been using it nightly on timers with christmas tree without any problems.

The details are extraordinary and my son (5-years-old) loves it as much as I loved my first Lionel. We've already spent hours just watching it go round and round. A great stand alone pack or addition to a larger layout. For those looking to add on with the additional cars and not familiar with the Lionel line, be sure to purchase the necessary track (for Disappearing Hobo car and Conductor Announcement car.) The observation (included) may need a little drop of kit adhesive to stay in place. Included characters are a nice touch, but note the one engineer is lacking his long beard (easily remedied with a little bit of painted steal wool and kit adhesive.)Well worth the money spent, whether you're 5 or 50."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG- the BEST","review":"The whole family is thrilled by the Lionel Polar Express Train set! The diecast locomotive engine is a future-heirloom. I was hesitant with the plastic rail, but it is all made of superb quality.

We also love how the passenger cars light up with beautiful silhouettes from the movie- the abandoned toy car, the children's passenger car, and little Billy's caboose. Set up was a cinch, too. I'm hopeful that this train will be a part of our Christmas tradition for many, many years to come.

My son's Little People toys by Fisher Price are much more durable. I'm so completely disappointed because we were going to have this train for his entire childhood & pass it on to him when he was grown & had his own family.

The value of the item is the engine/track/control. The rest of the prodcut is worth $5-10 combined - so the overall value of the item is questionable. The train will not operate or pull all of the passenger cars - as it appears to be too much weight. The Engine sometimes works and sometimes doesn't and I found if I unplugged/plugged it back in, it may resume working. The Engine has to be placed on the track just so - it is somewhat difficult and frustrating to get it in the \\"right\\" position. The engine's horn never worked and the smoke only worked the first day or so - it too was sporadic.

We got a great deal on the train set but now it's selling for over a $100 more than what we paid for it. So if we want another one we have to spend even more money!

It must have fallen off, but we never even saw it happen. Also the plastic whistle on top of the engine fell off after I simply touched it. Hugely disappointed.

I called Lionel and they offered for me to ship it to them at my charge and they would repair it. I really thought since this was a brand new toy out of the box, and such an expensive item that I should have been offered a new one. And to charge me shipping for their lack of quality control really got my goat. I returned it to amazon, with whom is easier to deal. But shame on Lionel, perhaps if they moved their manufacturing back to America their product could live up to its reputation.

When we hooked it up, the transformer's light blinked green suggesting a power overload. It even blinked when we had it plugged in but not hooked up to the track. A quick bit of research on Christmas Eve suggested this is a very common problem with the Polar express c80 transformer. Lionel customer service has offered to replace it, but we must bear the cost of the return shipping on the defective transformer and the one they are shipping is coming UPS ground in 7-10 days. As this was a Christmas gift for my young son, this set, and Lionel's warranty, is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"I bought this train with my Christmas money, and it took a week to get here, but then it didn't work anyway.

It finaly doned on me that I could fulfill that childhood wish. I ordered the Lionel Trains Polar Express train set and when it came you should have seen her eyes light up as I set it up for her. She was like a kid again. We will not be around many more years but we have already promised our son that it will be his when we no longer need it. The train is wonderful. The details of the engine and cars are great. We sit and watch it with the room darkened and see all the lights in the cars and on the engine as it circles the track. Even I enjoy this finely crafted toy and we expect it to last several generations. Thank you for making it possible to surprise my wife after so many years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing train","review":"I just received the train on Tuesday & it's amazing, my grandfather asked my son while we were visiting him over the summer on vacation if he'd like a train for Christmas & he said yes. I decided on this one so we could make it bigger over the years I set it up & everything to make sure everything is in working order & put everything back to wrap up for Christmas. Although my son will be 9 1/2 at Christmas he'll love it, I have always wanted a train to put around the Christmas tree. I call this my future grandchildren/great grandchildren's project lol. I highly recommend it. It's very simple to put together & just beautiful. The last 3 cars are 12 inches long each & light up so cool, i'm an excited mommy at that. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I returned 3 of these - all dead out of the box. Two of the trains that showed up had the guts falling out. I had to push everything back together. I know Lionel went through a lawsuit a while back, which they lost and went into bankruptcy, and are obviously looking for the cheapest way manufacture their trains. I am in manufacturing and can assure you this is among the worst I have seen. For three hundred dollars this should be 10 times better than it is but it's not.

I finally discovered that the wheels would come off the trucks and that would derail the train. Tried to fix, but was unable as double axles were too short to fit between trucks. Had to return it.The cars came in plastic wrapper and did not have pull out strips. The wheels on cars kept coming off trucks and train kept falling off track. This from a brand new train out of box. Paid 299.95 for this train and I am thoroughly dissapointed in Lionel.Don't waste your money on this one It is not worth half the price. It has the look and quality of chinese stuff. Poor.

Well, I didn't see a \\"bell\\" option and since it came from Santa, my son wonders why it doesn't work. Why wouldn't Santa just put it on? He's not upset, just curious. Also, the railroad workers look nothing like the movie characters. Just another small detail that Santa would've taken care of.

The problem was that it did not work....and cost me about $30 to ship back. I never did figure out where the problem was .. whether the engine itself or the transformer. I just returned the whole thing. I wasted an hour putting it together probably another hour taking apart and putting back in the box. As well as most of a day waiting for UPS to come and get it. It cost me $30 to return a train that didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the hobbie train enthusiast","review":"I was not sure which train to get when I first looked on line for a train to go under my tree this year. I had first seen a plastic version for 100. which was nice but then I found the die-cast version for $238. I chose the die-cast version, this was not a hard decision to make because I am a Loinel toy train enthusiast. I absolutely love it, it was everything the advertisement said it was. I was disappointed that it did not have the bell option but it does smoke and whistle and I can incorporate in into my train room. the delivery was a day early which was great! I would say that the plastic version would be better choice for young children but for the adult kid like me ( age 35) it is an awesome investment and you can hand it down for generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a Christmas gift","review":"Bought as a Christmas gift for my son and two grand sons.I hope this is a good Quality ones not like some of the other s that I have read about.

I try to avoid cultural stereotypes in any case.But my husband pointed out that in saying that The Blade was lost, they totally ignored all the cavalry sabers and rifle bayonets.

Her father the King wants to know what is going on, so he sends Jace a local agent to spy on her. The more Jace gets to know Parker the more he falls in love with her.

I intended to gut them and use the boxes to hold some horn tweeters, as these were cheaper than buying either blank cabinets, or the boards, fasteners, and carpet needed to make my own cabinets.When I got them, I noticed that they were rated at the same sensitivity (97 dB) as my horns, and on a whim, I hooked them up in my system, crossed over at 6 KHz. I was surprised to find that the sound from them is pretty good, airy and clean, but just a tad harsh when driven hard. I'll probably replace the cheapie piezo drivers with the horns one of these days, but I'm not in a big rush to do so.I can't comment on the durability of the boxes, since I don't move them around. For under $30 for the pair, I presume that the boxes are made out of particle board and wouldn't expect them to hold up under a lot of abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pyramid PMBHTW4 DJ 4-Way Tweeter Box","review":"It worked great for me.

I like the fact that the book is written for kids and with them in mind. It takes the time to explain what the Internet is and how it works. It explains why kids need to be careful, and most importantly, gives good advice on how to be careful. Best of all, it doesn't take a condescending or scolding tone with the reader, but explains why the Internet can be dangerous. This book also has some good common advice built in for parents, and addresses how parents need to be involved in what their kids are doing, not just vaguely aware.I'd recommend this book to anyone who has a child or teenager who spends any time in chat rooms or significant amounts of time surfing the web.

We ended up buying the Cuisinart Advantage steak knife set for even less money, and they have very sharp straight blades (the best to cut meat) and comfortable, riveted handles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victorinox By Forschner Steak Knife Set","review":"Up until now, I have always been delighted with all the Victorinox knives that I own. However, this set was a disappointment. Virtually all the Victorinox knives I have ever come across were sharp as a razor blade, serrated or straight edge. These steak knives, cut like knives in need of sharpening! The handle construction is first rate, but you don't cut with the handle!! Victorinox by Forshner is the maker of the famous \\"Swiss Army Knives\\" and their reputation alone has been enough of a reason to purchase their products. I will be more cautious in the future...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forschner lover - completely unimpressed","review":"I have a number of Victorinox Forschner knives, and until now have never been disappointed. These knives are not made in Switzerland, but rather in Portugal for Victorinox.They don't share the same polished finish that the kitchen knives have.The black Forschner stamping is uneven in appearance, and simply doesn't look as professional as on their kitchen knives. I'm sure the markings will come off with use quickly. Knives also arrived with sticky goo on some of the handles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tentacles?","review":"I am trying to gain a balanced and objective understanding of Islam. This is not easy with all of the ignorance and prejudice that abounds these days, even among academics. I have several of the Rough Guides, so I thought I would check this one out.After reading the Introduction given above and coming across the phrase \\"Islam spread its tentacles still further\\" in one of the early paragraphs, I decided that I would pass on this Rough Guide. Talk about biased language from the get-go! Maybe you should pass on this title as well.Also, the endlessly rehashed innaccurate stereotype about Islam being a religion spread by the sword boggles my mind especially since the religion that best fits this description is Christianity--not Islam. Just think Crusades, Thrity Years War, and on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freedeom of speech does not cover libel.","review":"Of course, many people will probably be checking out this book and a big deal will probably be made of it being banned in Malaysia on the premise that it has been deemed \\"prejudicial to public order under the Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984\\".What else would you expect? In even the introduction reproduced above, the book repeats the age-old orientalist claim that Islam was spread by the sword. Do you really expect this to go over well in Malaysia? The people there know quite well that this is false since they have many muslims there, yet a muslim army never invaded Southeast Asia-- The British, Spanish, and Dutch, yes, yes, and yes; the arabs, turks, and persians, no.Many of the book claims made are not even controversial, they are just factually incorrect and libelous.

I could see myself so many times, especially when dealing with the health care system! It made me laugh hysterically and also tear up. This book is a must for anyone dealing with aging parents. If you are in the middle, or beginning of your experience it offers strong reassurance that you are not alone. If you think you are going crazy, it gives you the sanity that you didn't think you had. It offers helpful tips, especially when a parent is suffering from dementia, which so common and often goes unrecognized.

I was an only child and I knew my father loved me dearly, so why was he treating me like this.

This book is a treasure for caregivers, family members and anyone who may have to deal with this horrific disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Jacqueline Marcell!!!","review":"I can't even find the words to thank this author for writing about my own trials and missteps. I was feeling every emotion, guilt, anger, love, sadness, and couldn't wrap my head around the issues I was encountering. More importantly, I thought I was alone. I was ashamed of the negative feelings I had towards my parents; parents that I love--parents that I now have to take care of on a daily basis because they no longer can care for themselves.

During the last stages of his life, he became more and more difficult to handle- physically and emotionally. I was looking for help and found it by purchasing Jacqueline Marcell's book titled \\"Elder Rage\\". It's hard to have a pity party for one's self after reading her book. She made me laugh and cry. This book is a mandatory read, if you are thinking about taking care of a loved one, even if he/she is the most docile person in the world. There are so many helpful ideas and resources all in one place. Don't let the title confuse you into thinking it's only about dealing with the most difficult situations. It is more than that.

She was talking about everything that I was living. I was then fortunate enough to hear her speak in person and again she shared so many of the things that my own family was dealing with in caring for our dependant parents who were suffering from Parkinson's and Ahlzheimer's. Please read this book as many of us in this \\"sandwich generation\\" will be taking care of our parents or know someone who will. I am also an RN who can now share her story with my own patients and given them the advice that they need and encourage them to buy her book.

I have passed this book on to many people and received it back with words of thanks for the recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really helpful, easy, and enjoyable read!","review":"I bought this book for a friend, but read it before handing it over. Am I glad that I did! The author expresses a very honest and revealing look at dementia/Alzheimer's disease as she becomes the sole caregiver for her parents. She gives us tremendous insights into dealing with doctors, agencies, caregiver aides, relatives, and so much more. And, she does it all with a great sense of humor that makes this book a page turner. I could not put it down. There's a bonus appendix with in-depth questions and answers, and helpful information that a caregiver can begin to put into use immediately to help modify the behavior of a difficult elder.

Jacqueline's amazing journey and her trials with hospitals and doctors is of comfort to caregivers - as they soon realize they are not the only ones going through such ordeals and it prepares them with solutions for what may lie ahead.

The book reads very comfortably. Aging parents are not the easiest to care for. It's an emotional rollercoaster as you'll read in her book. I was horrified and touched by all that the author went through, but she kept pulling through with perseverance, love, and tons of patience. This book has been extremely helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, humorous and a must read","review":"As a student of Gerontology I was anxious to read this book. I laughed (Jackie is a wonderful writer) and cried as I read about Jake and Mariel Marcell. I found this book to be very insightful and agree that it is a must read for anyone who is dealing with the elderly or even studying the subject. Jacqueline Marcell writes in such a way that the reader cannot help but get caught up in what is happening and feel as though you are experiencing everything she is going through first hand. I applaud her for her strength in dealing with her parents (especially her father!), the many caregivers she had to screen and a system that needs a real overhaul when it comes to dealing with the elderly and what is really needed.She has gone through a lot and thankfully she is sharing what she has learned with the rest of us by writing this book, creating a website ..., and doing speaking engagements."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful and funny","review":"Although our situations are not exactly the same, I could so relate to this story.

This book not only was written with great humor it was also very helpful in dealing with issues that you have never dealt with before. It helps put everything in perspective and helps the caregivers understand that they are not alone... most of all it helps you laugh again! Every situation, when lead in the right direction gives hope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caregiver's Dilemma","review":"I have found this book to be enlightening as it shows the secret world that some caregivers might deal with. As our seniors fight to hold onto what little power they have left, some of them may fight in ways that are devastating, as in this author's experience.I advocate for the frail elderly in my work, and am biased on the side of the losses they are experiencing, but have also learned that not all the elderly I advocate for are as sainted as I may have initially liked to believe. They are, after all, human beings with fears and needs that they must deal with as their bodies...possibly minds...and most of all society's Ageism lets them down. Kudos to Ms. Marcell for telling an honest accounting, and sticking with her folks during what must have been some personally heartbreaking situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read about your life, before it happens","review":"As the son of an Alzheimer's sufferer, I felt like I was reading about my own struggles for sanity in a world gone out of control when I read Elder Rage.This exceptional and heart-breaking book showed me that I'm not alone in this roller-coaster ride that your life turns into when you start dealing with a person who has this incidious disease.Anybody who has aging parents (and who doesn't?) should read this book now. Because it's best to prepare for what your life can turn into before it actually happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb book during a difficult transition","review":"If I could choose a million stars to rate this book I would. This book should be used as a text book in any college course dealing with caring for aging parents. It is both humerous and poignent at the same time. I laughed and I cried as I related to the many similar experiences I could relate to while caring for my own \\"Jake and Mariel.\\" Ms. Marcell also provides EXCELLENT reference tools that I have highlighted and reread many, many times. God Bless Ms. Marcell for providing a light at the end of the tunnel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elder Rage: Delightfully Entertaining and Insightful!","review":"Anyone who even knows somebody with an elderly parent must read Elder Rage by Jacqueline Marcell. My husband and I couldn't stifle our laughter in Barnes and Noble just reading her table of contents! We were there to do the demographics on our own book and ended up buying hers. We couldn't put it down and bought at least 10 copies for our friends and family who in turn purchased copies for their friends. I have spoken to her on the phone several times and she is just as hilarious in person as her writing depicts. She is a terrific writer and person. You won't be disappointed in the least.

Jacqueline Marcell wrote a memoir that shakes you to the core especially if you see similar behaviors within your loved one. My sisters and I are dealing with the decline of our beloved eldest sister so we are grasping for all the help we can find to make the journey one that is respectful to her and not so trying on us. Although Marcell's journey was very intense physically too, she offers humor and hope along with some definite guidelines to help others through their family journey. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star from me is that I wasn't a fan of her movie and tv references which detracted at times from the flow but not enough to get in the way of her compelling story. I highly recommend this helpful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horror Story, but short on Helpful Facts","review":"Sorry, this book was a disappointment. The sub-title was, \\"How to Survive Caring for Your Aging Parents\\". Maybe I mis-read it as \\"How to Care for your Aging Parents\\".... But it did satisfy my needs.It is a hair-standing-on-end horror story of the author's elderly father who had one emotion, rage. The story would have made an interesting introduction to a factual self-help book, but the helps were only a few short appendices. The \\"cute\\" writing style wore thin, and after 70 pages.... off to the used bookstore box. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rage of Elders","review":"The crux of this book seems to be a daughter, spoiled but verbally abused, and her never ending childhood. She is now well into adulthood - I say grow up! All parents make mistakes. The elderly father is a handful, but most people in their 80s are! Her style of writing can only be described as cutesy, deviating far off the subject with flashbacks, then back with silly references to song titles. This is a serious subject. The best part of the book is the reference section in the back, which gives helpful information and references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"I'm not sure this book needs another review as the majority of readers all agree this is an amazing journey of hope,depair and unrelenting love by the author towards her parents. Jackie,despite having her own health problems,continues to fight with and for her parents as they all negotiate the health care maze concerning dementia. I can't imagine NOT giving up with all that the author went through to assure her parents of the best care possible. But she continued to use her humor and love for her parents to marshall all efforts to find answers to her father's illness. This book highlights how extreme measures are sometimes needed to receive the proper diagnosis and treatment. For many in this situation if the finacial assets were not available,as in many cases, the elder relative might languish without the necessary health intervention. The Physicians guide in the back is a wealth of information in and of itself. Many thanks to Jackie for this riveting journal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elder Rage Coming of Age","review":"Jacqueline's book gives us a frightening peek into our future when you consider the sheer numbers of baby boomers headed towards their golden years, however, her message is loud and clear.

No one seems to realize what a terrific physical and mental drain it is for a caretaker in the day to day fray. Jacqueline Marcell has been there, done that! Her experience, written with wit and humor, has shown me that there is hope for those in the caregiving role. We may not ever receive the appreciation that we deserve for a thankless role, but by God we can laugh to keep the tears at bay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Everyone With Aging Parents !!","review":"Every page of this year 2001, 346 page book will keep you interested, amused, and informed, as the author details her trials and tribulations of coping with her elderly parents.

Her humorous way of presentation can help us get through the tough times that we're all faced with eventually. There's a useful \\"Physician's Guide to Treating Dementia\\" that's loaded with useful information. A great 10 page resources list includes agencies that can help, along with their phone numbers and web sites. You'll have a hard time putting this book down once you start reading.

When my husband's parents entered thier \\"golden years\\" early I was totally unprepared. Most of my freinds were having babies, not dealing with aging parents. In my search for information, I not only found the answer, I found a compassionate, heart told story that I could relate to. As I read Elder Rage, I laughed, I cried and I felt renewed. I strongly recommend reading the story, but if you don't have time, pick up the book for the reference section alone,it is unmatched.

His dementia is worsening as time goes on and he is getting harder and harder to reason with. I was so thankful to have the book \\"Elder Rage\\" to read, because I learned that some of the terrible guilty feelings that I have been experiencing were actually \\"NORMAL\\" whatever \\"NORMAL\\" is. Jackie was able to demonstrate the trials and tribulations of dealing with elderly parents in an informative yet humorous way. It really does help to remember that adding humor to serious situations makes life much more bearable.I for one am very thankful that Jackie took the time to write this book and share her experiences with me.

Because this is a disease that begins gently yet if patient reports mild symptoms to medical staff, this record is enough to eliminate them from obtaining long term care insurance and most average families cannot afford the $7000 per month fee for long term care which could last many years. Also, I found the writing style very annoying, irritating and useless in terms of offering support or help. The constant reference to media titles only filled space which quickly caused me to skip some of the text. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not applicable to most people","review":"I did not find this book useful at all. I got it because it was so highly recommended but the author's situation is extreme. Also, she had way more time and resources to deal with the issues than the average person has available. If you are a person with an average income who has parents who are aging without any dementia issues, this book is not for you. Furthermore, I found the author's constant TV and song references annoying and distracting. I cannot understand why this book is so highly rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a how-to","review":"This book is not a how-to; it's a story of one person's attempt to deal with her aging father. I did NOT find it useful to wade through all the stories to try to find the nuggets. There are plenty other good how-to books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-centered, entitled whiner complains about dad","review":"The section from page 272 on Behavior Modification, is moderately useful. The majority of the book though, is essentially an extended rant (with humor) on the injustice of having a father who misbehaves so badly, and how much it screws up the life of the author. It would be better except for the constant tone of self-pity, and the clear lack of sympathy and understanding for a man whose behavior is caused by neurologic disease (dementia) rather than simple ill-will. All events are interpreted in terms of their inconvenience, and understanding comes little and late in the narrative.I was hoping to recommend this book to the families of some of my more challenging patients (I am a geriatric neurologist), but this narrator really makes the process of caring for a parent with dementia sound like the greatest act of self-sacrifice known to (wo)man, rather than the fairly ordinary, if difficult, task that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved my patience!","review":"I'm a nurse and also work in Medical Humanities where stories of illness and caregiving are highly valued. So I speak from professional as well as personal experience when I say listening to \`Elder Rage' helped me cope with my own challenging elderly family members - and as a result I've grown much more patient with them. Highly recommended for everyone from the family to the physician. Thank you Jacqueline!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elder Rage, or, Take My Father... Please!: How to Survive Caring for Aging Parents","review":"\\"Elder Rage\\" - or Take My Father, Please - well, Jacqueline Marcell has the courage to say what we're all thinking right there in her title!My family used Ms. Marcell's book in a particular way... as a guide.You see, near the back of \\"Elder Rage\\" are several pages of questions and answers about parental behaviours.So often, a parent would do or say something completely uncharacteristic for them that would confuse and frustrate family.We'd check Ms. Marcell's Q&A; list and there would be our problem with ideas for how to solve it (plus, understand where mom and dad were coming from)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful!","review":"This book has helped me through a lot recently. I heard about it on the Today show in April. I ordered it that day. I cried while reading, thinking of what I have before me. I could not believe someone else had experienced something I was going through at that moment. This book is kept close by for those moments I need support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, heartbreaking, helpful","review":"I did enjoy reading this book, at first because it made my own foray into the world of caring for aging parents seem tame by comparison, and then because of the author's obvious commitment to her parents' well-being (at times at the expense of her own) and her tenacity in navigating the maze of doctors, caregiver options, and other aspects of this journey. I feel inspired to perhaps hang in there a bit longer and give it all I have out of love for parents who perhaps weren't perfect, but they ARE dear, and it feels good to be able to assist them in their most vulnerable time of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book filed with Wisdom, Love, Laughter and Tears","review":"God Bless Jacqueline!This is a must read page-turner which gave me valuable insight on things I could do to make my father's remaining years happier and safer - and also taught me how to change the way I look at and manage this daunting caregiving task.I purchased a copy for my sister and she loved it as much as I did.After I finished ER, I was lost without my Mariel & Jake updates and wanted to know more about their lives and love story and how Jacqueline and Ariana were coping. If you're like me, you'll be happy to know that Jacqueline will provide an update from where the book left off through 2012, all you need to do is contact her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"Very easy to read, hard to put down, defining the entire gamut of emotion caregivers face--presented with a generous heart, large doses of humor, and utmost reality. Valuable for caregivers who share the frustration, anger, and guilt that often occurs when caring for a loved one with dementia. If you struggle with the daily challenges of caregiving, learn how to manage and put it all into perspective from someone who has been there, done that, and knows!-Peggy Watson, M.S., CCC-SLP and Nancy Shadowens M.S., CCC-SLP, co-authors, \\"Dementia: Loving Care with a Therapeutic Benefit\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"This book was amazingly helpful and very easy reading. The reader gets involved in the lives of Mariel & Jake and picks up many helpful hints on elder care from their daughter the author. This book helped me understand how frustrated my mother feels dealing with dementia and that my feelings as a caregiver are natural. There are tips ranging from safety to finding the right treatment and keeping elders interested in life. These are all relayed in the true life adventures of Mariel & Jake. I highly recommend this book to anyone dealing with an elder with dementia."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Are My Sunshine, Jacqueline Marcell!","review":"When my father moved in with my family 8 months ago, my world began to spin wildly and turn upside down. His behavior has been unexplainable and unpredictable, including three marriages since my mother died less than 3 years ago! His ranting, raving, and uncontrollable rages have shaken my confidence in myself as a daughter, wife and mother, and professional. Reading \\"Elder Rage\\" has saved me! I understand my father's behavior much better, feel less defensive and guilty, and appreciate the extensive resources that are included in the book. Written with compassion and an incredible sense of humor, this book is a MUST READ for all adult children who are finding caring for their aging adults a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta laugh, gotta love 'em, gotta keep trying","review":"Jacqueline Marcell's Book \\"Elder Rage\\" is a wonderful heartfeltaccount of her experiences taking care of her parents in their last years. She shares her pain, successes and failures with surprising honesty and delightful humor. I am in the middle of caretaking for my 90 year mother with dementia and I was laughingout loud. Couldn't put it down! She was so persistent with coming up with new strategies to try new ways to help her parents. Takes a lot of forgiveness and loving somebody anyway. Makes me think about how we should be creating more options for the care of our dear old ones, who have nurtured us all our lives and now need a little help on their journey. Jacqueline, thanks for an IMPORTANT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter or \\"Gerontologist?\\"","review":"I have lived through the same nightmare as Jacqueline Marcell and I can tell you- no \\"gerontologist\\" can take care of your parents better than you can-or knows more about them than you do. Yes- \\"professionals\\" can help; can offer sugggestions, but when it comes to making decisions -it's solely a family affair. I saw no \\"inappropriate medicating\\" of parents in this book- medication is a lifesaver for both the dementia patient and the caregiver. The goal is for ALL of us (families) to survive this disease, as long as possible and with as few life-threatening catastrophes as possible. I found the book funny, brutally honest and REAL. This is REAL life- it represents our REAL parents and Jacqueline's story is REALLY the way things happen when we find ourselves facing dementia in our own families. It's a \\"must-read\\" for all caregivers, physicians, nurses and other caretakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and great for writers!","review":"I picked this book up for fun, but halfway through it realized that it would give a lot of authenticity to my writing, especially dialog. (I am an aspiring writer.) I didn't enjoy it any less after figuring that out -- if anything, I enjoyed it more! It's very readable, not at all like a dictionary. It's more like a popular history.I am planning on using this with my fifth-graders and asking them to pick a chapter and write dialog based on the words from one decade.I'm also planning on ordering a couple as Christmas presents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, creative, beautiful food","review":"Although I do not have their first book, the second book is a joy to use and read. The authors' sense of humor is revealed through several photographic series of comical restaurant vignettes. The food, while traditional, has a nice spin so that you really feel like you're making something special and familiar. Their fried calamari with anchovy dressing is the best ever. Directions throughout are clear and concise. The wine suggestions are helpful. This book would intimidate an insecure cook, but it is really easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great companion to the first book","review":"If you've ever eaten at the Union Square Cafe and loved it, you'll be happy to know that there is now a 2nd book of recipes from that famed eatery. I had the first, and was very pleased to find some of my favorites in there. The second is also terrific, and a great companion to the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great Second Act","review":"i LOVED the first Union Square Cookbook, and use its recipes regularly...and i have been SO disappointed with this one...i have not made ANYTHING that i liked from this cookbook...spare yourself"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Napoleon of New York","review":"Fiorello LaGuardia was an amazing character. He was loved and hated depending on who you asked, but one thing is for sure- he did great things for the city of New York. This biography explores his immigrant roots, his rise to power, and his quest for revitalizing New York. A tough politician indeed, but one who brought greatness and glory to his city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polyester- won't use it","review":"I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this- it's polyester! For everyone who says it breathes- no, it doesn't. Polyester does not breathe nor does it absorb. It holds wetness in simply because it doesn't absorb it. If you've ever worn a fleece sweater and then got warm and sweaty, you will know how uncomfortable it is to be in wet polyester fleece. I wouldn't do that to my kid! I'll stick to wool, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for any baseball fan!","review":"I really loved this book. My only complaint and trust me it's a small one is that I wish the chapters were a tad longer cause the stories are so great! I sure miss the Mick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-present for all kids","review":"I also was given this book when I was young. I'll never forget the story, I think of Hank Bauer or Billy Martin, I can't remember who, but they were at a cabin on a vacation I believe and someone was carrying an oil lamp and somehow it set on fire while they were carrying it, but they still kept it in their hand until safely disposing it, in the process burning themselves. They asked the guy why he didn't drop it and he said he knew the place would have gone up in flames if he did.Baseball fans will remember that every time Mickey came to bat, whether at Yankee statium or on the road he always received a standing ovation. Too bad he died so young."},{"rating":"2","title":"whee","review":"I might've ruined the total rating in terms of stars by being stupid, but please read this book! I'm only at page fifty and the prose and illustrations are excellent. I like to imagine Devon as a magical wonderland, even though it probably isn't. You get extremely clear mental pictures of everything that Teale describes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Live Samples","review":"A great live recording for Samples fans. However, 2 of the songs are mislabeled (not by seller). \\"Wild River\\" is actually \\"Seany Boy\\"- done acoustically . And \\"Buffalo Herds and Windmills\\" is \\"Little Silver Ring\\". Not a big deal, but if you're looking for those songs, you won't find them here. Also \\"Last Summer\\" on the packaging looks like it's a part of \\"Buffalo Herds\\" - it stands on it's own and is not \\"edited\\" or anything. Cool sax work throughout the show - brings a different feel to some of the tunes. The sound is solid -If you like your Samples live, you can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"These bits cut WAY more than 35 holes...","review":"I use these bits regularly to drill glass ranging from 1/8 to 3/4 inches and averaging 3/8ths inch thick. I can drill more than 250 holes with a single bit when run in a cold water bath on a drill press. They rarely clog, are self cleaning, create an accurate hole and start well on irregular surfaces. They are manufactured from heavy duty materials. They are stout. I have tried about five other brands of various designs. This Hitachi design is simply the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnished after one hole","review":"This cut through the first half of its first hole through tile beautifully. Then it stopped dead. We were spraying it with water every second or so, and running it at low RPMs, and it still was useless. The diamond abrasive was worn off entirely, and the tip became smooth. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"seductive but not worth the $$$","review":"I know these look like a great idea but...I used to work at a gardening center - we'd put various kinds of plants in these and they'd always die as soon as these started to thrive. the water all sinks to the bottom of the bag and the top of the plant is in a state of continual wilting esp. in hot weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"RediTabs cut in 1/2 OK for youngsters...cheaper than buying children's Claritin & it's in the RediTab formula!!","review":"If you are reading the reviews on Claritin, you probably already know it is a wonderful allergy medication, so my review isn't really on the Claritin itself. My son, who is 4, suffers from seasonal allergies. The children's Claritin works great for him, but it is so expensive that I went to our family pediatrician in search of a cheaper method. His pediatrician informed me that the childrens Claritin contains 5mg of the active ingredient, and the adult RediTabs contains 10mg...thus cutting the RediTab in half results in the same dosage as the childrens. This has been a wonderful help in paying for my son's Claritin because this adult box of 30 RediTabs lasts him 60 days for the same price as a childrens box of 20 chewable tablets. Now, I am no doctor and am only relaying to you what my childs pediatrician said was OK to do. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great savings.","review":"Purchased two boxes from Amazon at the normal price of one box,(compared to my regular store locally), freight included.

Didn't work at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant virttuoso","review":"This is a dazzling technical performance by a very talented guitarist. He does take some liberties with the dynamics and timing, but the result is a distinctive interpretation. These are performances of notable energy and conviction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tahiti Guide Book","review":"This book is written by Jan Prince who is an ex-pat American that has lived in the islands since the 1970's. I found the layout, information and light-hearted manner of writing essential to planning my trip to Tahiti. I looked at many other guides on the Tahitian Islands and none of them seemed as informative or easy to read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might think!","review":"From the description, I thought this was the book that I was looking for - an insider's look at the \\"real\\" Islam. While the author does spend a little time on origins, history, and beliefs of Islam, he spends the majority of the book telling us how to relate to and convert Muslims. I think that the author could perform better service by talking about the religion in depth to help us relate. I don't need a step-by-step conversion guide! However, it is well thought out and written, and I never questioned the author's sincerity, Christian faith, or motives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading at Best","review":"This book purports to take you on a journey into the heart of Islam for the purpose of helping an outsider understand the world of the Muslim. This book in fact is just a manual on how to convert Muslims into Christians. I found this book misleading due to the fact that there is no mention of converting Muslims anywhere in the title or on the back cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presenting facts out of context leads to false judgements","review":"The author has presented most information out of context to prove his point. It seems the author has a negative image about Islam and its fundamental beliefs. For example, the author presents the idea that Islam encourages war and violence if followed in its true essence, whereas if one would take the time to research the author's citations he/she would soon realize that falsified inforamtion has been presented. I would encourage readers who would like to discover more about Islam in its true essence to get a copy of the Quran and a biography about the Prophet Muhammad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside Islam : Exposing and Reaching the World of Islam","review":"A very misleading book. The author has not researched the subject well and much on the content seems to come from stereotypical misconceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Inaccurate and False Views","review":"The book seems to be yet another attack on Islam, from an attempted credible source. Unfortunetly, the views and the ideals Mr. Safa writes might have been the reason why he is a former Muslim. You want to know true Islam, read the Quran and not some book by a person with grudges to the religion. Following his national radio address, it only proves that his understanding of Islam is hardly close to what the religion preaches. If anything it tries to explain hate from the cultural perspective, neglecting to express that Islam does not preach such things. Playing with emotions is not a way to present fairly the way of Islam. This is not a book to prove which is better, if so don't call it Inside Islam, but instead Why Christianity is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A right-on, tell-it-like-it-is tale","review":"A very stark, often poignant tale of the social and demographic changes experienced in Detroit during the 1960s and 1970s.
