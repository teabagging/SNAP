Fortunately, at the end of each chapter, there are pointers on the relevant RFCs for the discussed topic in that chapter. My next statement is an impression and not a proven fact but by having read the first edition a long time ago, I have the impression that some details have been removed in this edition in favor of a better coverage of more new protocols.

Armed with nothing but an acoustic guitar, keyboard, and her impressive vocals, she managed to win over the crowd. Of course, buying the CD was inevitable. I was not disappointed! With a full band, Emm Gryner has forged a lush, full sound. This album is one of the very few albums (and I am quite picky) which doesn't require programming or skipping tracks. \\"Hello Aquarius\\" and \\"Death is a New Day\\" are outstanding tracks, but I've never gotten tired of playing this CD from beginning to end. This is intensely powerful songwriting that, with proper exposure, should be topping the charts and flooding the airwaves.

She has a very soothing, pretty voice without seeming boring or whiny. The pieces are both singable as well as danceable, interesting people of various musical tastes and prefrences. Her mannerisms and emmense talent cross age barriers, appealing not only to teenagers, but to older listeners as well. The album, proving both enjoyable as well as thoughtprovoking, has succeeded in introducing Gryner as a fresh voice in the music world, abling her to go \\"Public\\" in style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose something else","review":"This is not what I expected - it is see through so you must wear something else under it which adds to your size which is not helpful when your dealing with plus size!

It doesn't just focus on American culture but explored/blended many including : Afri-Carribean culture, New Zealand culture, Lebanese culture, European Culture, White American culture,Turkish and others.She is a very expressive and vivid writer and it all comes together happy, happy in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"nearly died laughing","review":"True, this is not great literature and neither is the plot terribly good or believable, but, and this is a great but, I have never had such a good laugh since I can remember.

The result is strangely unappealing, stilted and distant.The Independent on Sunday describes this book as \\"screamingly funny\\"; in truth, it's an untidy story that, I suppose, raises the odd chuckle.

We got it for a Christmas present last year and we didn't take it out of the package until April/07. We grilled at least 2 or 3 times a week and enjoyed the convenience of it. Within the past month it has been going on the blink. It won't turn on or heat at times, but if we plug it in the next day it usually works. Today halfway through the grilling it just died.

I would have given it 1 star but it does cook shrimp pretty well. It's a shrimp-cooker but makes really dry chicken & hamburgers..yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The grill cooks too cool to char.","review":"This grill (I actually own the larger size of the same), is a poor cooker. Heat off the bottom half is too cool to char (think black lines, not tan lines), and heat off the top and bottom halves helps cook your food through.Imagine cooking a slice of bell pepper, or for that matter, a hamburger patty, on the grill. When you're done, you have light or no searing on the bottom, but your bell pepper's soft, and the hamburger patty is cooked through. You might have light searing on the top, if whatever you're cooking was thick enough to touch the top. But whether or not your food is thick enough, radiant heat from the top will cook it.Overall, this grill is a poor choice. If you want to drain fat from your food, consider pouring the fat out of the frypan when you're done on the stove. Don't waste your money on this grill or any other. On the other hand, if you want to cook a pancake, you could probably use this grill to good effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"So real......you can taste it!","review":"The Helliconia Trilogy is \\"must\\" reading for any Fantasy/Sci-fi buff.

The book was written as a thesis for the author, and then published. Each story is from a real person who experienced the loss of a parent at a young age, and how, if at all, God factored into it. It is not a book that tries to sell God, it simply puts into play, how a young child feels after having lost a parent, if they are angry at God, do they blame Him, and as years pass, if they were able to return to God. For me, personally, I was 'angry at God' for more than 3/4 of my life, and after an epiphany, I decided it was time to let that go. It's a wonderful tool for understanding what happens in the mind of children who have lost a parent young. How they adapt, grow and develop after the loss of this parent.

I ordered a replacement battery (Energizer CR1225) and the thermometer then worked fine... one time. I put it away for a couple of months with the power definitely off; the plastic sleeve is quite hard, so there's no chance that the power switch was accidentally pushed during storage. The next time I needed the thermometer, the \\"new\\" battery (used just that one time) was just about dead. The thermometer would turn on briefly, but then the screen would fade out. I should have listened to all of the other reviewers who described severe battery problems for this and other Vicks thermometers. I suspect the small number of reviewers who said \\"it's great\\" just got lucky with specific thermometers that don't have rapid battery drain problems, whereas most of the thermometers have this problem. If you buy one of these cheap Vicks thermometers, be prepared for it to fail very quickly, even with a brand-new battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came with dead battery","review":"It didn't get off to a great start with a dead battery.We have an older Vicks V965 Basal thermometer. Basal thermometers are the more accurate version needed for tracking ovulation.So we wanted a spare as a backup or for travel. Fortunately, Amazon had it.Or not. Apparently this is the V965R. This version is not a Basal thermometer. The rapid reading feature advertised might have been a hint, but who would have thought it with the same model number?This thermometer measures by waiting until the temperature reading starts to level off. It's not clear how level is enough for it, but the times vary from 8-25 seconds and the readings vary by about half a degree, which is very significant when an 0.4 degree temperature shift is normally interpreted to signal ovulation. So our confusion aside, the thermometer is very inconsistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy - pick something else","review":"The main reason this thermometer got 1 star was because it lasted about 20 uses in less than a month and now the thing beeps real long at me when I try to use it.

He teaches nothing about how to incorporate your own personality. Basically, he would like you to memorize his techniques. He misses the point that, firstly, photography is art.

The film is about a family that moves into the town of Ludlow in Maine, and they find out about the local Pet Sematary and the Indian burial ground beside it. When his son is accidentally killed on the highway, Lewis Creed must decide if he should bury his son in the burial ground and see if he will come back from the dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Is Better!","review":"This movie is a great example of a horror movie. It has not too much blood and just enough killing. Very disturbing when the child dies, but picks up after his reincarnation. An unsuspected ending, never saw it coming. I recommend this to all horror movie and Stephen King fans. It won't be a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The king of the so-bad-it's-funny movies","review":"Pet Sematary is, hands down, the worst \\"horror\\" movie I've ever seen, but it thankfully falls into the category of movies that are so dreadful that they're hysterical to watch, which is why I enjoyed it so thoroughly. The collection of actors is awful -- there's not a good performance in the bunch. The family patriarch would be better off playing a serial killer, while the daughter is the most annoying screen child to grace my television in a long time. But the film's most ghoulishly-delivered line -- \\"The ground beyond is...SOUR!\\" -- sends me into giggling fits every time I hear it, and it's well worth watching just to see the unbelievably bad make-up job done on a flashback character with spinal meningitis. Go into your viewing with an open mind and low, low expectations and your experience should be a blast -- and keep an eye out for Stephen King's brief cameo as a minister at a funeral."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing Horror Film!","review":"I've read almost all of Stephen King's works just as I've watched all of their screen transalations and at least three movies came out much better than the book. They are: Salem's Lot, The Shining (I don't care what Stephen King thinks about this himself, but Kubrick's version was rather intense) and the third is Pet Sematary. This film transcends fear and churns emotions to pieces. This movie rendered me helpless as what to feel - emotionally damaged or scared to near death or both. It can be a fascinating experience if you look back later on. A one of a kind of horror film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT! AN ALL-TIME FAVOURITE!","review":"I will say it again. STEPHEN KING is a genius. I read the book a long time before I saw the movie, and I wasn't dissapointed. The movie was even better than the book.

Great actors, magnificent story and excellent special effects, make this the best horror-movie of all time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible adaptation of a terrifying story...","review":"This absolutely COULD have been a frightening movie. The movie (for the most part) stuck to the book, BUT why did they pick the absolutely most bland actors to play the characters? With the exception of Fred Gwynn, the acting was atrocious in this movie. The actor who played Louis Creed delivered all of his lines in a monotone voice, and we were not able to see the extent of his anguish over the death of his son.This is one of my favorite King novels, and one of my LEAST favorite King movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW SO BEWARE!","review":"This is absolutely one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen in my life.

First Louis buries his son in the graveyard so that he will come back to life, then he kills his son. Then he buries his wife and she comes back to life and kills him. That's just really morbid in my opinion. It wasn't ALL bad though. Like I said, it did have some really scary scenes. And I thought that Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were pretty good together. You might enjoy it if you like stories with really morbid endings.

To this day there are scenes in it that I still can't watch. I think I have seen the scene with Gage and Jeb once, and that was in the theater. Zelda still scares me and I usually have nightmares after watching this movie for the 100th + time. Aside from some not so fantastic acting at the beginning (the lead characters - it takes them a while to get \\"warmed up\\") I especially think Denise Crosby's depiction of a mother in turmoil is particularly believable. Some of the things from the book that they left out of the movie may have been a little more helpful in explaining a few parts, but otherwise, I think this is still one of the scariest movies around. I think it's sad to see that the younger generations can't appreciate this movie as frightening, from being exposed to more graphic horrific movies/television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Failure at the End","review":"Read whatever everyone else said, but...King's book ended abruptly in a way that was shocking and ambiguous: the reader could decide that the ending was either hopeful or horrible.

This is the worst film adaptation from a thrilling novel, ever. The characters are totally wooden, poorly selected, no chemistry, & what the hell is Yar doing in this movie? What the hell is she doing in any film?I especially enjoyed that the family, knowing how dangerous the road was, sits close to the road & lets the toddler run right into the road: smack. The acting is horrid, the whole movie is poorly cast. I did like that the father-in-law belted the irresponsible Dad at the funeral. He should've taken out his own daughter while he was at it.

Predictably, the family goes through separations, people come back from the dead, and they all end up on the slab. Sweet, isn't it? No suspense, no redeeming social value, no entertainment.

There is a veritable wasteland of comic terror titillation movies in the US for the bored teen who wants to veg out infront of the TV. The old bulging eyeball under the raised eyebrow is all his acting is about and the parents/ child seem cut out of card and colored in technicolor.Say no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpleasantly Good...","review":"I can't say that I actually like Pet Semetary, but this isn't a movie that your supposed to like. The whole movie is very creepy and disturbing and from the opening credits you know that this movie is going to be unpleasant. Pet Semetary is not a jump out of your seat horror movie, but rather one that has a very erie and sinister feel to it that is very effective. From when the little toddler died to the flashbacks of the mom's sister Zelda everything about this movie is tragic and extremely frightening. If you love horror movies then you've got to see Pet Semetary. Regardless of your taste in movies, if you are not disturbed by Pet Semetary then something is wrong with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book: Scary to the max Movie: Major dissapointment","review":"The book is so frightening that I was literally shaking while reading it.This film adaptation is so bad and unworthy of the book it's not even funny. The scene (in the book) where Gage's father goes to the cemetary to dig up his son and take him to the Pet Sematary was bone chilling. And it was fairly drawn out in the novel. The movie barely even eluded to it.Nothing amazes me more than how poorly cast book adaptations are most times. Gage's father (in the book) impressed me as kind of nerdy, wimpish, and definitely not very good looking. (unlike the actor in the film) I was thinking maybe somebody who at least looked like Richard Dreyfuss.I however can't give the film 1 star because Fred Gwynne gives a credible performance and the films premise creates enough of an atmosphere to at least warrant consideration. But that's about it.Don't be misled by how bad the film is. Pick up the book and prepare to be scared out of your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"slim fast","review":"First it all, slim fast is a nutritious drink and not only it keeps me full for a long time, instead of eating big breakfast, can be used a substitute of a big meal in the morning if you watch your diet; I definately recomend this product.

My friend couldn't get through this movie! I love it. True horror!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accurate rendition of the novel.","review":"Reiterating what other reviewers have stated, \\"Pet Sematary\\" is one of the most disturbing and suspenseful books that I have ever come across. And as opposed to most Stephen King flics, which are usually half or one-star disasters, the movie, Pet Sematary is actually just as good, if not better than the novel and follows the novel very accurately.The actors used in the movie are just the way that I imagined them being in the book: down-to-earth family people, but interesting and solid. As far as I could tell, there were no inaccuracies between the novel and the movie and the few parts of the book that the movie may have omitted were unimportant, non-suspenseful sections. In a nutshell, the acting was great, the suspense was even better than in the book, and this is probably the best King film that I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This movie was every bit as perfect as the book, with the exception of the scene with Louis digging up Gage. In the book, this scene took up about 30 pages (literally)and was extremely detailed and eerie. However, in the movie, it took up about 5-10 minutes and seemed like it was just thrown in there without any thought or consideration. This would be a five star movie, with this one tiny detail keeping me from giving it a perfect 5. But, don't get me wrong, in my opinion, Pet Sematary is easily the scariest novel that Stephen King has ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries hard but never becomes scary","review":"This adaption of the terrifying and exquisite book by Stephen King never rises above mediocre. The emphasis is on gore and guts instead of the novel's intelligent approach to the real horror of the death of a child. Though Fred Gwynne is perfectly cast, he doesn't have too much to work with. I think you might enjoy the film though had you never read the book to compare it to, because it does have a dash of suspense and horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a thrill","review":"this is a steven king movie so you know that it will be a wonderfully great movie. about a cemetery that any thing that is buried there will come back as a killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book,Horrible Movie","review":"Sorry guys,but I really,really detest this movie.As I was reading the book,which is one of my favorites I was always thinking how if they made a movie out of it,it would probably be awful because they would do specific scenes one way instead of the correct way.Well,guess what?

Wonder if Pet Sematary two will be out any soon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the book.","review":"This is a good horror film that does justice to the book. King does a good job as the screenwritter and watch out for his cameo. Not the best horror film, but is still a good film. Get it on this special edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King Does It Again","review":"This effective horror movie that doesnt shy away from the bloodshed/brutality, and the chills and thrills is sure to keep you up all night long! Be prepared to be plunged into a non-stop whirlpool of shocks and chills that just wont let up! When a new family moves into a new house in Maine, everything seems perfect. But what they dont know, is that behind their house, lays a secret so deadly, so horrifying, that only the master of Horror Stephen King could concoct"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Horror Movie Of All Time!!!","review":"I have seen tons and tons of horror movies. But this one is my all time favorite. I am 18 years old but I still get the creeps everytime I watch this Stephen King Masterpiece.The movie is about the Creed family moving into a new house. They thought everything was perfect and nuthing could go wrong. Boy where they wrong. There neighbor Jud Crandall tells louis about the place where the dead speak. An old Indian burial ground where your loved ones come back from the dead. But Jud forgot to mention one part your loved ones dont come back the same. They come back evil.This movie is an all round classic and every horror movie fan has to see it. This movie is a must. Written by stephen King, the movie came out in 89' so you know it should be a good horror movie. 80's horror movies are the best. Pick it up at amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been better","review":"I've always gone back and forth on this movie. As I am sure it's a fantastic book and story, the bad acting doesn't live up to those same expectations. Suprisingly bad performance by Jessica Lange. The only real suprises are a great performance by Fred Gwynne and the little boy, who turned out to be a star in his later years. I do admire Mary Lambert, but maybe she's better off sticking with music videos rather than movies.My answer is a remake of the original with a different cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet Sematary","review":"This movie was easy to follow and ok if you read the book.

After all, the Shining was a really scary book AND. A spectaularly done movie.Not this case. The movie was true to the book story, but the acting was so bad. The lil boy looked adorable not creepy, and we know little kids can look convincing (Danny in the Shining).In a way, though, I'm relieved. The book was soooo scary I was nervous to watch the movie. But no. It wasn't as good as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie to have","review":"This is one good King movie. It is generally very creepy and has a good setting to go with it. Its a very original idea and a creative one. Basically a mans son gets killed and he bury's him in a pet cemetary that is possed by some ancient evil Indian spirits that would bring the dead pets back to life, but they come back evil same goes for the people buried there ... and so on with that the rest is for you to go out and see this movie goes for $10 in stores and I had it for a while so you dont have to wait for amazon to get it, unless you want to.So go get it well worth the money and its a flick you will most likely watch plenty of times I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER GET CHURCH FIXED!","review":"When I saw this in the theater in 89, it scared the hell outof me!

Gage was only about 2 years old!If this movie doesn't send chills down your spine, nothing will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment to Readers of the Book","review":"At the annoucement of a new King book I race to be put on a waiting list or buy it outright. What involves me in his books is the partnership that he establishes with his readers. His words feed the readers imagination and therefore involve him/her in the story. This movie forgot about the partnership and attempted to represent what should have been left to the imagination. The little boy was comical and the actors should have been allowed to act. I will continue to watch and read everything that King throws our way, but this work does not represent what I know he is capable of doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie!","review":"This movie was not very good! the book was so much better, don't waste your time or money on this crap!

It is almost a BOMB. Per Sematary is a mean-spirited movie that is saved from * by being scary, but that can't save how dark it is. For example, were you happy when that woman hung herself? Who wants to think about suicide? Though horror movies are geared to be somewhat dark to be scary, the mean-spiritedness(and sometimes cruelty) is to excessive.

A bait box must have entryway that is at least a foot long, with a big lip at the opening. If it is made from plastic pipe, the entrance tube needs to be turned upward 45 degrees, and the opening no larger than 3\\". The company that makes this one sells it because it it fits nicely in a box or on a store shelf. That's irresponsible and ends up poisoning a lot of other animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a box of them...","review":"This tool is incredibly poorly made. It stripped six 14 gauge braided wires before the jaws stopped clamping and cut exactly one 14 gauge wire before something inside snapped and the cutter stopped working.Having said that, the design is wonderful--particularly if you're working jammed up under your dashboard like I was.I wish I could find one of these made by a reputable manufacturer. Good tools are worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a serious tool","review":"This tool broke after just a few wires stripped.

I tried using the adjustment knob, but it did not help. I used it only on small gauge wires (car stereo wiring harnesses), and it did not last long at all.Save your money and get a better version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"If you're looking for a tool for occasional use on small wires for use on a breadboard or something similar, this tool can help keep your equipment cost down. It is easier and more reliable than side cutters or a blade when stripping solid wire for breadboard use. It avoids the small nicks to the wire that frequently occur when using those tools and so prevents the wire breaking easily when bent at that point, as is typical with breadboard jumpers.This particular stripper comes as a bonus item with many other products.The wire stripper portion works fairly well, but sometimes it takes a little fiddling to get it to work just right. An automatic stripper in the $10-15 range is far more effective and will last longer.The plastic around the metal wire cutter jaw breaks after a few uses on larger wires (say, 14 gauge solid copper). After this happens the stripper portion continues to function. If you restrict it to cutting small wires it should be ok if you are careful with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made","review":"I bought two of these and the first one broke after a few weeks. It would last longer if it was made all out of metal. It does strip wires though and would be good for occasional use around the home."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be minus one star","review":"I bought one of these things just out of interest, as the design looks good, however I can not believe how rubbish they are. They are unable to strip anything, they barely able a dent in the insulation. I can do a better job with my teeth.I have never before come across a product so pathetically unable to perform the task for which it was made, yet be so specifically designed as to have no other use. They're too light to even use as a hammer. Most Chinese junk works at least once (and usually only once) but these are something else.Do a search on here, these things are listed several times, ranging from $1.19 to and unbelievable $16.58! I paid just over a dollar, and at that price the manufacturer, importer, and retailer are all making money. Let the 'made in China' label be your guide.I ended up sneaking them into a mates tool box, just to get them out of mine.

What an uplifting album, filled with songs with a certain quality of upbeatness to every song, even the mellow songs (think \\"King of Broken Hearts\\"). Ringo is known, according to \\"Into RingoRama Land\\", for having a \\"band atmosphere\\" and most let's this be known in \\"Vertical Man\\" with an aray of special guests, ranging from Alanis Morissette to even his Beatle mates. Some of the musical highlights include \\"Mindfield\\" (a very trippy-like song, fun to sing a long too), \\"La de Da\\", and \\"Without Understanding\\", where Ringo manages to steal in a few Indi sounds in only a style that Ringo could create. Beatlesque and Beatlesque!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ringo Starr shines yet again on this release!","review":"Ringo Starr is on a roll, in the 90's he has released his best work and he is still going. Vertical Man is probably Ringo's finest work. He is an entertainer he is not on the stage to make money he is there to entertain. On Vertical Man that is what you get pure entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the Beatles","review":"Ringo Starr was not a bright man. Nevertheless, he was the second drummer for The Beatles.Ringo was never quite able to fill the shoes left by original drummer Pete Best. But the Beatles made due with Ringo, and had continued success, even without Pete.As a life long Beatles fan, I decided to buy Horizontal Man* shortly after it was released. I listened to it once, and can't imagine ever listening to it again. It is terrible. There are no good songs on the album, and the drumming is awful.* Although I haven't seen it in awhile, I'm pretty sure that my copy of this album is titled 'Horizontal Man'. It's probably an import or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy","review":"Ringo is the best but this album is terrible really. Most of the songs have the same beat, there is no cool to it, everything sounds so crowded and noisy. Since I couldn't find more than a couple of likeable melodies on this album, I started to hate Ringo's band, I find their way of playing loud, hysterical, unrelaxed, hurried and senseless, In my opinion those lamers didn't give a chance to the potentialy best drumming in the world become what it could, but anyway, don't expect a sound masterpiece and you might be fine with it. There is one great, great, great song on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drummer for a important band","review":"aside from playing with the Beatles what else has Ringo Starr done worth noting musically? he's not Quincy Jones.all the talent in the world can't cover up how run of the mill he is.George Harrison can write a little bit.he is at least so-so.but if you don't know it's time to know that it's downhill after Lennon&Mccartney.they had&have all of the main talent from the Beatles.Ringo Starr is the Yoko Ono of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling and candid story","review":"Losing Malcolm: A Mother's Journey Through Grief is the compelling and candid story of Carol Henderson's traumatic experiences arising from the death of her infant son.

This one is awful; the picture is very jumpy, and the remote is anything but intuitive,with many buttons almost impossible to find without good lighting and glasses (and I don't need glasses to read or drive - just to read this silly remote). But the main problem is the jumpy scratchy picture. I'm so unhappy with this that I will never again by Panasonic ANYTHING -- or Quasar, since they now appear to be affiliated with Panasonic (although the Quasar TV/VCR I bought 14 years ago is still going strong). I bought two Magnavox TV/VCR combos from Amazon which were much cheaper than this set, and they're perfect - but this Panasonic stinks.

Panasonic traditionally makes excellent 13inch TVs. On a 13inch set the electron gun has a very short distance to aim and deliver a precise image against the phosphor screen. The electron gun can keep very accurate control. The closer the electron gun is to the back of the tube's screen gives it that control to deliver a good sharp picture. VHS tapes look very good.

This song sounds like Leonard Cohen, that like Dylan, this like Syd Barrett, that like Richard Farina. It's good. It's strange. There are some very beautiful songs here. Some are trapped in the past while others hover outside of time. Tom Rapp's vocal style is an acquired taste and it sounds like he is trying out different approaches, some which work and others which do not.

It's a great abs and lower body workout done all on the floor using dumbbells and ankle weights. If you're new to weight training you could start off light or even no weights and get a great workout. If you're used to working out, going heavy gives you an awesome ab/hip and thigh workout. You feel and see results right away. It's a workout you'll pull out for years to come.

I would give it a 5 star, if the box was decent. The box does fall apart easily. Make sure you do the lid first and add lots of tape on the inside.This was a good price for the clothes and that is why we still bought it. The clothes should fit age 2 - 5 , if they are under 38 lbs. The headbands might be tight for older children. We have to add some more elastic for one of them. Over all she enjoys it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trunk is a waste","review":"While, the clothes inside the trunk are adequate (barely), the trunk is a cheap piece of easily breakable cardboard. I had to go out to buy a small suitcase for my granddaughter to keep the clothes in. The clothes are very basic. I also subsidized these by buying Disney princess dresses at Wal-Mart. I would not recommend this product. Just buy the pieces and put it together yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a hit!","review":"Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter who loves to dress up. This was great because this was Disney outfits-Snow White, Cinderella etc. She likes the movies and books so she could relate. The quality wasn't the best, but it is what I expected, you have to pay over $20.00 per dress for ones that are put better together. They should last till she outgrows them. This gave her choices and she could share while playing with friends. It also arrived quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy 'trunk'","review":"While the price is fair at $10, the extremely flimsy 'trunk' doesn't even stand correctly on its own or, for that matter, close. I bought this as a 3rd birthday gift for my daughter and the clothes is snug. So, the recommended age should be from 1-3yrs old.

She has played with it for a couple of weeks now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dress up fun!","review":"My daughter received this dress up set for Christmas. It is a nice assortment of dress up items that can be mix and matched for Disney princesses, or any dress up. My daughter is a small 2 1/2 year old, and the clothing just fits over her winter pajamas - I can't see a 4+ year old be able to wear these. Some of the accessories are too big (headbands, jewelry) but she really doesn't mind.

She loves playing dress-up. Some of the accessories she didn't know what to do with them so they get thrown to the side. The card board trunk is hard to figure out how to put together. I didn't know you would have to tape it when I bought it. It took both my husband and I to get it figured out. I had to hold parts together while he taped. The trunk is not very durable. Overall I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too small for a 3 year old","review":"I didn't expect much as far as quality goes because the price is so low. But since it is sold for ages 3 and up, I would have expected it to fit my three year old. The tops barely cover her tummy. She was very disappointed and uncomfortable having her stomach exposed. She looks like a hootchie princess. My daughter wears a 3T or a 4T. These I'd guess are sized perhaps 24 mos. The head bands must be sized to fit maybe a 1 year old. They are very tiny.Other complaints: One of the earrings was broken in the package. It doesn't matter though because they are such junk, I just threw all the jewelry in the trash.I suppose I'll have to get out the sewing machine and see if I can come up with a solution to make these work for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel world.

The fantasy elements all surround two factions of an alien race that is living secretly among us. One faction is intent on taking over the world; the other faction (Ukiah's) is intent on preventing that. Much of this book centers upon Ukiah's search for his forgotten childhood (an interesting twist on amnesia). The plotline is a search & rescue operation for a kidnapped friend.I've not read the book before this, about Ukiah's youth, and found the \\"Tainted Trail\\" stood on its own.

I really enjoyed \\"Alien Taste\\" and \\"Tainted Trail\\", which I just finished last night. I have to admit that the reason I bought the books was because of the main character's name, Ukiah Oregon. I happen to live in Eastern Oregon & know personally where Ukiah is. I found the story line quite intriguing & thought it was well written, other than a few grammatical errors, which other reviewers also mentioned. But all in all, the story was good. In \\"Tainted Trail\\", the book is centered around Pendleton, Oregon. I live 22 miles from there & recognize the places the author obviously visited in order to get research on the novel. I really enjoyed reading a book that was located close to where I live. Believe me, that doesn't happen. Anyway, the books are fast, fun & remind me of the X-Files before that series ended. So suspend disbelief and have fun reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish this was more widely available","review":"This is a vital story in the Ukiah Oregon series.

I left the religion after 45 years so I know the teachings well. Many of David Reed's comments on the verses were not proven with enough conviction that you could actually answer a Witness with his thoughts.He has a lot of opinions, but without biblical backing the Witnesses would not even question their beliefs. I have trouble believing he was ever a devout Witness.All of us have opinions, but without scriptural support, a Witness would not listen.I believe the books by Ray Franz have much more force since he was on their Governing Body and wrote much of the literature. I really enjoyed his two books and believe what he said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Evangelistic Witness To Jehovah's Witnesses","review":"This book provides helpful biblical analysis in light of Jehovah's Witnesses Interpretation of the Bible. Mr. Reed helps the reader to answer JW's objections about the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the authority of the Bible; yet from a biblical and theological perspective. Moreover, the book includes evangelistic methods and techniques on how to approach and be an effective witness to Jehovah's Witnesses.Jehovah Witnesses believes that The Watchtower Society is the sole \\"channel of communication that God is using... we will not progress along to life, no matter how much Bible reading we do\\" (See, Reed pg 124-125). \\" It really disturbed me to see those men elevate themselves above God's Word,\\" said the author (125)."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"If you are tired of avoiding Jehovah's Witnesses that come to your door, and would like to know how to answer their distortions of the Bible, this book is for you.

J D is an artist whose brilliance far surpasses James Taylor & Jackson Browne with more melodies, more vocal depth and breadth and all round better performance. The backing group reads like a whos who of LA music, reflecting the acclaim that important musicians hold JD in. This album is one you can\`t be without if you like Eagles, Tim Schmit, James Taylor, latter day Poco etc, get this, his best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this one as well","review":"JD Souther is/was 70's Southern California Rock. Everyone wanted to be him and he just wanted to be left alone. Black Rose, produced by Peter Asher definately shadows this self produced album. Don't let that stop you from getting into the soul of JD Souther in this record. A must have for anyone that has any other JD Souther recordings, and since it stands as his last solo effort in 23 years (as of 2/2007) certainly worth the time capsule of his artistry at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every house needs furniture!","review":"This is a great addition to the 3 story doll house from etoys.

It was easy to put together. It is, however, very cheaply manufactured. The tin handles bend easily. The spreading mechanism is easily clogged by larger granules of fertilizer or dolomite lime. The hollow, light plastic wheels skip over the ground leaving patches without distribution. I am amazed that a large company like Scotts would put their name on garbage like this.

Maybe something went wrong with my download but it didnt seem to have a problem. I could see the picture for the cover of the book and the covers of the other books they wanted me to buy at the end but all throughout the book itself there were only words and big blank spots where the pictures should have obviously been.

It seems the glowing recommendations are for the Kindle version or the hardcover.I ordered 4 copies of the paperback version and all 4 looked like they were printed on someone's inkjet printer.

The paintings look dark, \\"wet\\" and blurry. Perhaps the latter is a result of too much enlargement.Thin covers and stapled binding in the great tradition of Scholastic. (sarcasm intended)Still, this cost a buck. (Wonder if it came from the Dollar Spot at Target?) And it does provide a fuller telling of the story than some truncated editions (such asWhere's Peter Rabbit?: A Lift-the-Flap Book (Lift the Flap)).

The ideas presented as keys to improvisation are 1) changing note values, 2) adding notes to a melody, and 3) using chord tones. These are fairly basic ideas, but what makes the book so useful is that the author presents lots of examples based on some classic tunes, and provides analysis of them. This is a really fun, engaging effort that you will stimulate your creativity. The book will engage your interest and lead you along the path of competence.

Household , who wrote this novel in 1939. was a pioneer of the modern novel of suspense, action, and intrigue. Rogue Male has an added dimension of psychological depth and insight, a feature often lacking in contemporary examples of the genre. The story concerns a marksman with sharp survivalist skills who stalks and attempts to assassinate an unnamed Central European dictator. (One can safely assume it is Hitler.) The would be assassin is caught but later escapes and flees across Europe with various agents in pursuit. As they close in , he literally goes underground. From this point the narrative takes more surprising turns which I will not divulge. There is a fairly decent movie version of this novel (starring Peter O'Toole) which I believe came out in the 1960s."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic thriller","review":"Household's upper class hero is both offensive and attractive. He would snub you as a peasant, but we delight in his approach to the Nazis as he hunts the biggest game of all - Hitler and then is hunted by the Nazis. The final sequence in the pit is a delight. A superb book to be read and enjoyed. Both versions of the film are excellent as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"To endure without object","review":"I read about Rogue Male in a men's magazine listing of recommended \\"action\\" books for guys. It was at the top, and having never heard of it I pursued it. It is a taught story full of amazing details about the eponymous protagonist's survival and planning as he manages to escape his staged suicide after an attempted assasination of a leader clearly based on Adolf Hitler. From his journey back to England from Poland to his hiding in an incredibly imagined catacomb of his own creation in Dorset, England, Household's language and eye for detail impress and terrify. Rogue Male was written in that memorable year, 1939-the same year Hitler invaded Poland and stands as a grounded and gritty precursor to that proud and bombastic Englishman the world knows well, Bond, James Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rediscovered gem.","review":"I had to read this novel as one of the set books when I was at school. At the time, I really didn't appreciate it but then, many years later, I came across a copy in my local library and so I decided to give it another go.

This model hardly shaves close, even with the 3 blades, even if kept plugged in, in hopes that it might have more juice that way. If I saw this on an Amazon Friday Sale for $5-10, I wouldn't even waste my money. Norelco should be ASHAMED at such poor quality. P.S.

A man casts his eye down the well of knowledge to uncover the true nature of reality. This underlying reality, stripped of its' drifting clouds of commonly accepted values, propped up illusions and personal delusions, is more hallucinatory and bizzare than any drug experience. William Lee becomes a stoic witness to the everyday madness that is modern life."},{"rating":"2","title":"the work of Howard Shore","review":"I loved this film when I first saw it. I am disappointed that it is not available on DVD. There are a number of decent reviews here. Oddly, none of them mentioned the soundtrack. Howard Shore put together a work that I can compare to no other. The soundtrack features Ornette Coleman. It is a perfect match for the film. Haunting, mysterious, emotional. Coleman is superb.The soundtrack did not come out of my CD player for months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold a candle","review":"This film cannot hold a candle to Burroughs' literary masterpiece. Admitedly, I had high hopes, but I really wasn't expecting it to be this far off the mark. The film misses some of the most crucial and intense social commentaries that Burroughs weaved into his novel. While it would be hard to reproduce a cut-up on the big screen, I felt like too much time was spent on the superficial physical oddities and it seemed as though there was an attempt to make the story linear when it really isn't. It's a decent attempt, but just doesn't capture the depth of what Burroughs was writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no","review":"I really did not enjoy this item. Having never read the classic, I thought I could shortcut the process with the movie version.

Burroughs' Naked Lunch would have been impossible, and thankfully this movie doesn't try to do that. Instead, it takes the same surreal, nightmarish feel of the book and applies it to the story of how Naked Lunch was written. My advice: If you've read this book already and are expecting an equally brilliant film, you will be disappointed. And if you don't care for the movie, read the book anyway. Aside from all that, the Naked Lunch movie, on it's own, is pretty impressive. You have to see this movie at least once in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"something against me?","review":"this movie has got to be THE WORST and most disgusting movie I have ever seen. it was also damn boring and the plot was really stupid just like in most cronenbergs flicks. why didn't he stay in the adult business? really, when I wasn't trying to keep myself from vomiting, I was having a hard time keeping my eyes open.

I didn't read the Borroughs book. Having watched the film, I have no intention to. As far as the movie goes, I couldn't even begin to tell what the plot wass. The entire journey was nauseating; not due to content, but the lack there of. The only thing that kept me going was the faint hope that it would deliver a strong ending. In this aspect, this movie failed to a greater extent than any movie I have ever seen in my life. There wasn't an ending, it was simply a cut to scrolling credits. The only thing I could do was laugh at the idea that maybe someone made this film with the sadistic intent of wasting the time of any audience that might be compelled to watch.

Burroughs novel. A mystery science fiction/horror satire with no real plot structure or theme worth pondering over.The story follows the depraved life of a pest controller/writer who succumbs to the hallucinogenic effects of his pesticides. It's really more a coming-out-of-the-closet story disguised as bad science fiction/horror. This depraved farce is nothing but a sequence of homosexual/bestial innuendos from beginning to end. This story and film is an utterly grotesque composition that makes Fellini's 'Satyricon' seem like a Disney film.The film merely enlightens the viewer as to how so-called 'artists' can display such bad taste under the guise of creativity.

He wants me to read it to him again.This book has a lot of action, fighting, clever escapes, magic, hand grendes and all kinds of fun stuff.This book is out of print, unfortunately, and I suspect it's going to stay that way (unless someone edits it). It is violent, even graphically so at points. (Demons and a dragon die horrible deaths.) It's not politically correct, and probably won't be for some time to come.

The durable shoelaces with metal aglets are gone. The trademark \\"smile\\" is no longer recessed in the toe. For some reason the insole eyelets are now located partially in the rubber midsole. The material and overall feel of the shoe is now flimsy, thin, and cheap. Oh, and -inexplicably- the blue version of the shoe now features white stitching.The changes were probably for financial reasons, but I'd gladly pay 10 to 20 dollars more to have the Jack Purcell be like it was back in 2008 or '09.Just save your money and buy a pair of All-Stars and draw a line across the front of each shoe with a marker.

Skaggs' current lineup features Cody Kilby, who won the 1998 National Flatpick Guitar championship at age 17. Wielding a Bourgeois flat-top, Kilby lays down clean, fast lines and outrageous solos that push the envelope of acoustic lead guitar. His clarity, power, and dexterity are matched by an ability to spin melodies that sound delightfully free, yet artfully composed. Bryan Sutton -- Skagg's previous flat-top virtuoso -- adds his magic touch on two songs, and Tele terror Johnny Hiland burns on the title track. Mandolinist Andy Leftwich deserves special mention for his rippling, warp-speed phrases.

Worth reading to answer the charges...","review":"This book basically puts forward a theory that the founders just established the Constitution for their own personal economic gain. This book is well-researched, but its premise is totally flawed. Moreover, it tries to portray all of the founding fathers as self-serving and looking out for their own economic interests. It doesn't really explain why some of the wealthiest colonists and statesmen such as George Mason and Elbridge Gerry refused to sign on. Moreover, I'd recommend that any student of the Constitution, study the writings of the framers and the Constitutional debates to answer these charges. I also recommend _The Founder's Constitution_ set, edited by Phillip Kurland and Ralph Lerner. It is an excellent tool for examining original intent. The renowned constitutional scholar, Forrest McDonald, does an excellent job introducing this book and debunking its controversial charge towards the Constitution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Text","review":"Charles Beard caused a minor scandal when this book was published in 1913. He argued that the Founding Fathers had foisted the Constitution on the country in order to protect their property interests in land and public securities. This was strong medicine 90 years ago when the public still thought of the Founders as demigods rather than conspiratorial politicians.Despite its age, the book reads well and is refreshingly iconoclastic. Since rightwing politicians and jurists still talk as if the Constitution had a divine origin, Beard's message hasn't lost its relevance. However, there's no denying that his book is a one-sided lawyer's brief, which selects and presents only the evidence that supports its thesis while ignoring everything else. No one who has read The Federalist would even recognize Beard's description of it.Modern readers who want a balanced and comprehensive history of the origins of the Constitution should look to books by Forrest MacDonald or other historians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant -- upheld by recent scholarship","review":"Charles Beard's thesis held sway for decades --and was not attacked in a significant way until after his death in 1948.

When the album starts off with the synthesizer chords of Roscoe, you can definitely tell you're about to take a trip into the past. Don't be misled by this thinking the album consists of nothing but nostalgic or antique sounds in any way but consider it as a new interpretation of the music that brought success to Bread or America. The musical performance and instrumentation is exquisite and compliments lead singer Tim Smith's crooning voice quite well.

There is not the electronic experimentation... just the creepy vocals backed by guitars and pianos. Think more Decemberists... less Muse... and Midlake is what you get. I have listened to their previous album \\"Bamnan And Slivercork\\"... and I must say that \\"The Trials of Van Occupanther\\" is incredibly superior. It's less congested and more focused.

I had long ago given up on hearing anything current with that eclectic 70's sound ever again. So, to hear a new band actually throw their collective hat into that daisy ring.

I tried to listen to it again thinking I would hear something I missed, nope. The more I listened to the same 2 alternating chords (which is what most of the songs sounded like), the more painfully bored I got, it's like I'm hearing the same song with different lyrics 10 times in a row.

By February, one of them no longer worked. We tried new batteries, etc., and nothing got it going. We figured it must have taken a rough hit. Then the lightsabers sat in a drawer for a month (nobody ever wanted to fight using the broken one). When my son got them back out, in March, the second lightsaber was also broken. This time we knew our son hadn't done anything to it because it hadn't even been used! Within a few months they both just died for no reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My son wanted this toy for his seventh birthday. He was disappointed because it doesn't really do anything.

If you are interested in France during WWII this book will also be of interest to you. Lea is a beautiful, young aristocract coming of age at the onset of German occupied France. She is the 20th century French version of Scarlet working for the French Resistance' in Vichy France. Follow her as she rides her blue bicycle carrying messages to fellow members of the organization that fought to free France from the clutches of Hitler and the traitor Marshall Petain. As passionate as Scarlett, Lea takes her determination, beauty, and boldness into exciting escapes of valor and romps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icelandic: Grammar, Text and Glossary","review":"A very good manual for learning Icelandic.

All the best songs no bs filler. Like a really good greatest hits collection with a couple of extras (namely a couple of new tracks, jimmy jones [original] and 3 MC and one DJ live). Might not be a good buy if you already have all the albums already. Would be 5 stars and the best album ever except it doesn't have \\"girls\\" which is possibly my favorite song ever and more live cuts (3 MCs and a DJ is tight). This album is tight. Just remember its not like rare cuts or a live album or something its just a really phat greatest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I think this was a great cd my favorites are Brass Monkey, 3 MC's and one DJ This is a great cd no matter what type rap/rock beasties"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome cd but lacking a few songs","review":"This cd has many of the beastie boys great songs but i was dissapointed when a few songs such as girls, no sleep till brooklyn and time to get ill. But this definatly shows the beastie boys growth and change thoughtout their awesome career of punk to hip hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate Mail Welcome","review":"I bought \\"Hello Nasty\\" without being familiar with their previous material and think it's wonderful. Then I got this and wondered how they ever came to be so big.There's some good stuff but mainly it's repetitive and uninspired. A few rhyming lines and a beat does not music make.I think the album is arranged chronologically, and it definitely gets stronger as it progresses, so maybe I'm missing the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Hits","review":"I am a fan to the end, but I am not impressed with Alive. It seems that the B-Boys came up with it from scraps of Hello Nasty. However they threw it on the Sounds of Science to sell their fans a reason for buying a Greatest Hits album. Why do these guys need to give us a Greatest Hits collection? The album should be re-titled \\"Sounds of MTV\\" This album is targeted to all the Eve 6 and Blink 182 fans.

Nor was Country Mike's Theme. And good luck finding Biz Markie covering Elton John somewhere else. You even get three (count 'em three) new songs. \\"Twenty Questions\\", in which MCA attempts a 60s Bossanova. Beck may have done it better with Tropicallia, but MCA has Miho from Cibo Matto on his side. Then you got Live Wire, which manages to be funky and dancable while expressing Ad-Rock's sorrow at the death of his friend Dave Scilken. And finally, you got the single, Alive, which is some good ol' fashioned Ol' School rhymes. It's a real pity that you people gotta bite, but I can understand because they sound so nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great anthology!","review":"This is a great cd! It is overwhelmed with different beastie boys songs. Other people who reviewed and said that it had weird stuff on it and that they wanted more of the normal stuff are all really ignorant and stupid. Those screw heads need to realize that beastie boys don't have just normal songs, they have changed and evolved so much that you can't pin point a median to where you could define a type of song that is NORMAL beastie boys. This cd documents all of their different kinds of music and changing attitude and is a totally awesome cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash! Shame on the Beasties","review":"I've only got one thing to say about this collection, it's a stab in the back to Beastie Boys fans who've already bought all the Beasties' earlier albums. Their real fans already have half the songs on this set but still have to pay for a double album if we want to get all the new or previously unreleased tracks on it.Shame on you, Beasties. I know you have the clout to keep this kind of thing from happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Everything?","review":"There are too many songs not included in this compilation. Unless your a diehard fan who has to have everything that the Beasties release, buy the original records. The majority of their debut album, Licensed to Ill (Paul Revere, Hold it now hit it, No sleep til Brooklyn, Rhymin & Stealin', She's Crafty, and The New Style) is not on this and that doesent make any since. Not to mention songs from Pauls Boutique - Looking down the barrel of a gun, Car Thief, and The Sounds of Science (the title of this compilation!). Where is Finger Lickin' Good from Check Your Head? How about The Test from Hello Nasty? There are many songs on here that were not even popular or that great. The only thing special here is the previously unreleased music but definitely not worth the 25.50 for both CDS. Way too much missing. To be honest, the Beasties dont need a compilation all of thier records are good and worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I pick the songs next time?","review":"ok, this is weird. This was supposed to be a greatest hits package. And, with two cds, there shouldn't be anything left out. But they don't put \\"Girls\\" or \\"Paul Revere\\" on, but put some songs that weren't even hits!(Three Mcs and One DJ), plus the new songs that blow, such as \\"Alive\\". All in all, not a good buy. Get License to Ill instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"the sounds of science? not scientific at all.....","review":"how could a certain music group put out a collection of their greatest hits and name this collection of hits the THE SOUNDS OF SCIENCE without including a very great song on theirs sharing the same name? that hardly makes sense to me???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beastie Boys","review":"First, The Beastie boys shouldn't even be a band. I'm not sure why they even are trying to make this album alright.

Don't waste your time or money on this or any of their cd's. Stick to Ice Cube baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"is this the last of the beasties","review":"i hope not. from the begings in the mid 80's to hello nasty and the sounds of science the beastie boys have been my favorite band. the sounds of science is a collection of there best songs. but i think they should have added paul revere to as the 43rd song on this cd. t5he cd has both the young imature \\"braty\\" beasties songs and finishes with the mature chart toppers of recent years. my favorite songs on this cd are remote control fight 4 your right and brass monkey 22dollars is a good deal buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"I never really thought much about Beastie Boys until like many others my age were introduced to them via Hello Nasty. I liked Intergalactic on the radio so I bought the CD and it is still one of my favorites. There were other songs I've always wanted but didn't want to buy every CD. Now I can hear them all: Hey Ladies, Sure Shot, Sabotage, Brass Monkey, etc. Sure there are a lot of lackluster tracks, but you can't complain that its a bad bargain. I even heard some cool rare stuff. Boomin Granny is awesome. So is Country Mike. The booklet is very interesting reading too."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a cd-r, don't bother.","review":"If you are into the Beasties enough to consider buying this album, you probably have all their main releases. Stick with them. The \\"unreleased material\\" is unimaginative re-mixes off of \\"Hello Nasty\\" with a few punk songs gratuitously thrown in. If you are die-hard, have an extra $20, and nothing else is catching your eye, it does have a cool 80 page book with good stories about the songs; But it ain't Check Your Head."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's missing!","review":"A fair Beastie Boys retrospective. Biz Markie singing \\"Benny and the Jets\\" makes the entire album. Here's what's missing: The Scoop (This is Ruff and Tuff!), Professor Booty (My chrome is shinin' just like an icicle, I ride around town on my low-rider bicycle.) and B-Boy Bouillabaise (Get on the mic, Mike!)

It's worth it more than this two-disk set with quite a few holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!","review":"In this Album the Beastie Boys show all that they can do.

Either way, it's 2 cd's full of rap, punk, hits, funk, rare tracks, and anything else they could have thrown on. As huge as it is, and all over the place musically, I wonder if it's too much. I mean it's great, but I think the casual fan might have enjoyed one disc full of the hits they would expect: \\"Fight For Your Right To Party\\", \\"Pass The Mic\\", \\"Sabotage\\", \\"Intergalactic\\", and so on. Or I think one disc of \\"hits\\", and one disc of extras would have made more sense. But overall, this is a great package for casual, or hardcore fans.

I chose it based on the reviews. It is about 2 women who are drunk all the time (and I mean all the time) and do drugs. What is funny about that? It was even depressing because one of the women has a teenage daughter who lives with her and has to witness what a sloppy drunk her mother is. The main actress (and I use the term loosely) totaly over acts her part. I wish someone could explain where the humor is because I certainly couldn't find it.

I have yet to find another comedy that would a.) make me laugh so much, and b.) make me laugh out loud even after dozens of viewings. For me, most comedies, even the best ones, generally wear out after two or three viewings. The same thing has happened countless of times: I find a new show and fall in love, then start watching the same episodes again and soon find myself getting bored. I expected this to happen with AbFab as well, but it didn't. Even though I know most of the lines by heart now, the delivery still somehow seems fresh to me. It's a work of genius.However, the show is quite outrageous and I know of people who simply don't get the humor in it, so be warned, but personally I think that AbFab is definitely worth of taking the risk. The chances are you'll be wetting your pants over and over again, and if you don't find it funny you can always (as Patsy would say) 'mark it up and sell it on'."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE SITCOM, GREAT AMAZON INSTANT PRIME SERVICE!","review":"SUFFERED THROUGH 10 MINUTES OF THIS BRIT-COM AND TURNED IT OFF!

It has the same production values (bombastic excess), and a really really strong opening. But, if you want to buy just one Sparks album, get Kimono My House.

They've had a couple of hits and a trilogy of albums. Kimono my house was the first and Indiscreet was the last. This album is firmly placed in the middle and was always the difficult one, the one that made my friends turn away from Sparks alltogether. I, however was more persistant, and was able to find the jewel inside. Granted, it takes a great many listens to fully get your grip on, mainly because of the mad tempo they keep throwing their ideas and twists onto you the listener, but here they are at their musical and lyrical peak.

His noble singing, impressive characterizations and powerful understanding of music is clearly portrayed here.There is only one thing missing for perfection: Fischer-Dieskau's marvelous performance of Mozart music, absent in this set, but you can find high peaks: Schubert's Das Wandern, Die Forelle (always one of my favorite lieder), Brahms'Wiegenlied, Wagner's Die Frist ist um (chilling) and Verdi's Eri tu (sour mix of rage and sorrow)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DFD, please, don't sing Verdi anymore!!!!!!!","review":"I think that the Verdi of DFD is the worst in recording's history!

It's a beautiful depiction of a simple life that reminds us to take a step back from all of our ambition and things that we find important. It's a testemant to Mama's faith. She focused on what was important to her in life, which is what we all should do.

We got this for our daughter when she was about 7 months old and she still loves this toy at 14 months! When she was younger, she just loved to bang the halves together and shake around the yellow happy face ball. When she found her voice, she loved to yell in them as if they were megaphones to hear how her voice sounds. Now we make a bunch of balls and roll them around to each other. She tries to stack them, but loves knocking them down. She's a little young, but I still try to use them to practice her colors and numbers.

No joke! So much to do with these cups. You can stack them into a pyramid, make 5 balls with them and roll them, stick the little yellow ball inside one of the 5 balls and jiggle it and so much more. All my friends who come over have a ball with this toy as well.I got this for my son when he was around 7 months..and he would just take the pieces in his mouth. Now at 9.5 months, he knows how to take the pyramid apart, and just absolutely loves the little yellow ball by itself. The colors are so bright and pretty and this will be a great toy for the bath as well.This toy will last well into the toddler years, as putting the balls together is quite difficult (it even took me a few attempts to get the hang of it). That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I will wait and see a few months from now if my son figures out how to put the balls together.FYI: This toy is CHEAPER at Walmart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots o Cups","review":"I bought these for my son because he loves to play with simple cups. He was about 9 months old at the time. They can be stacked as shown in the picture and they hold together in this form. You can also use them to form spheres by snapping the similar sized cups together. It is a tight hold and cannot be broken except by an adult or older child. The little yellow ball is also a fun addition. His favorite \\"use\\" of the cups is to hit them against each other or against other objects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of different ways to play!","review":"I wanted looked everywhere for some stackable cups. My sister-in-law found these. Awesome! Not only do they stack, but you can make them in to balls as well. They are very durable, but my daughter has a little trouble pulling them apart sometimes.

She carries that around all over, plus you can put it inside the balls and make the balls jingle too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of sharp edges","review":"I was excited to get this toy for my 5.5 month old son. However, on day one of playing with this he put the cup in his mouth (he mouthes everything at this age) and he promptly started crying. I didn't make much of it until it happened again the next day. I think the sharp edges of the cups gave him a mini abrasion of his gums. While these toys may be great for older kids, I wouldn't recommend it for infants that have no teeth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite toy so far!","review":"Our 9 month old LOVES these cups. She's enjoyed playing with them since she could sit up on her own and continues to find new ways to play with them. Currently, her favorite thing to do is bang them together to make noise!

Although it's very colorful, with varied hues not usually seen in baby toys, there seems to be just too many parts. Once they are all apart, unless the toddler is older or brilliant, mom will have to put it back together if she ever wants to see it together again. Because of the many pieces, it's also easy to lose one or two. But it's still a great variation on the classic pyramid stacking toy.I wrote that some time ago and now have two grandbabies playing with it. Jacob is now 22 months old and this has been his favorite toy for several months. Now baby sister, who is 10 months, loves it as well. So what if it never regains its original pyramid shape, a favorite toy is still a favorite toy. This one causes tussles between the two almost twins."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 1 year daughter doesn't try to collect it","review":"It is generally not interested in this toy.the first couple of days she folded part of each other and playing with balls, and then stopped.

Our 11 month old is just not so impressed. There are definitely better ways to spend money; try eeboo's tot towers which are beautiful, educational, and nesting blocks that WOW in more ways than one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fun","review":"My 11 month old was not interested. The only part he liked was the yellow, smiley ball that made noise. I had no fun with them; they slip and slide when you try to stack them. We have the regular cups in the nursery at church and the children and adults love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reward toy for 4 year old","review":"I purchased this for my son when he was 3 1/2 as a reward type toy. I give him a cup and when he gets the ball on the top, he gets a reward. He loves this! He counts all the numbers over and over again each day, reading them from the front of the cup at the same time. He remembers what number he is at and asks for the next number. He just turned 4 years old. We still use this. He gets pretty excited when he gets the ball on top!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of disappointed","review":"We have both this stacker and the traditional ring stacker from Fisher-Price. I would recommend that traditional stacker. While this toy allows you to turn it into multiple balls to play with, I guess my dislike of this toy is that my 1 year old can't get the cups off when you stack them since they lock together. So what's the point of the toy? At least with the traditional stacker he can practice stacking and taking the rings off himself. He loved the traditional rings when he was a baby too. I think this is a cute toy, but aside from turning it into balls to play with, it doesn't really serve it's original purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"This toy looks so fun, and has educational value on several levels, but it turned out to be very frustrating simply because the cups are more than a little difficult to take apart. The children at my daycare were delighted with the colors, and with the whole concept of nesting and stacking, but when they were all nested together into one ball, it was impossible for the children to open them and difficult, to say the least, even for me. Also, they're slippy-slidey when stacked together, although that's not a big problem. I'm really disappointed. I expect to be able to make a purchase with confidence from a respected name like Fisher Price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baby Toy","review":"Yes, there are already multiple reviews of the Stack and Roll cups, but I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus. I like how the item is compactly packed which lets the purchaser see how easily and compacly the toy can be stored.Here's an item with multiple uses and multiple attractions for one's baby. It can be used to practice eye-hand coordination and teach colors and numbers. The cups can be stacked or attached in pairs to make rolling balls. Putting something like the smiley ball inside adds the element of sound.We are very pleased with the Stack and Roll cups as our little grandson who loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Versatile","review":"As others have said, this toy set is extremely versatile; you can do so much with the cups that it is one of the few toys I leave out all the time (I rotate my 16-month-old son's toys so neither of us gets bored). Highly recommended as a baby gift, as it's not immediately evident how useful this set is if you just see it in a store, so I probably would never have purchased it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected joy","review":"We did NOT expect this toy to be the blast that it has been! It was the first official toy for our daughter to show so much interest in at the ripe old age of 4.5/5 months old.My sister had told me to register for stacking cups and this was the closest thing that I could find at the time. My daughter LOVES the jingle ball with the face on it. She cracks up when we make a ball out of two bowls and pretend they are a horn (as they have a hole in the bottom of each bowl).She is 8 months old now and we are still enjoying them.Some reviewers have said that the bowls do not stack evenly. I'm guessing that this is user error as they are MADE to click together.Good times on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Cup Set","review":"I received this stacker cup set as a gift for at the time my 4 month old daughter so she kind of grew up with it. We use to put the head piece in one of the larger sets and roll it around and make the \\"cups\\" into balls when she was younger to roll around. She now stacks it but I can see that the love for the toy is wearing off since she is older.It is a very durable toy, easy to pack to travel, easy to clean and versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting toy","review":"The toy is well made and stays fun for kids for a long time. My daughter started playing with the toy at around 6 months and still likes to play with it (20 months). As she learns new things she learns new ways to play with the toy (like stacking in order). The toy can be stacked like in the picture or two pieces can be snapped together into a ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Fun!","review":"These stacking cups provide hours of fun for both baby and parents. They stack in all different ways and you can snap 2 together to make a ball. The yellow ball has a bell inside that makes noise that is great fun when used together with the cups. Our son started playing with these when he was about 5 months old and hasn't grown tired of them 2 months later. He also loves chewing on them and hitting them together. He isn't old enough to stack them or snap them together, so I foresee many more months of fun and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Toy for Toddlers","review":"This is a learning, having fun, laughing toy which can be used in so many ways. Stack them upsidedown, color by color individually, or just load and unload them. Watch your baby learn and grow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old who LOVED it.. she will sit on the floor for hours pulling the ball apart stacking it and then trying to put it all back together. It can be a little harder at times to pull apart for her so she does sometimes need help but once you loosen it up it's awesome.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This toy is so simple, yet, amazingly well-designed. It not only stacks up like a tower, but also can be a set of nesting bowls to learn how things fit inside one another, plus 2-by-2 they snap into a set of 5 balls to roll around, or - to throw in the diaper bag they all snap together like Russian Dolls to store compactly as one ball. The little face on the yellow ball is SO CUTE, it has this precious little smirk, with lots of personality (not your typical generic smiley) and the fine rattle inside it is mesmerizing. The bowls are easy to grasp and satisfying to clack together to make noise. Our 8 month old LOVES this, and my husband loves it about twice as much! Only complaint is that it's sometimes hard to get the pieces apart once snapped together, but, I'd rather that than they don't stay connected! Awesome toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"my 10 month old approves!","review":"My son loves this stacker toy. It's one of the few toys that he doesn't get bored with. We practice counting, and he is starting to learn stacking, and we will also put two halves together (to form a ball) and roll those around the living room. He is just now starting to roll it back to me. Or roll it at the dog. lolThere are a lot of pieces, so it's pretty easy to lose track of them. This will either drive you crazy, or you will learn to live with it. When stacked the cups tend to stick together a little too well, so your little one may need help unstacking them. Overall it's a great toy, and I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory for splitting video output for projector and TV","review":"I bought this thinking I could distribute the output from an iScan Pro video processor to a Sharp front projector and a 37 inch LCD TV.

Alas, it is not to be with this version of Red Fern.The seeming little things get glossed over like the impact of Billy's first trip into the city. Would it be so hard to shoot the fire escape scene or the ladies laughing at Billy in town?

This was my favorite book when i was young, and never have I seen a worse book to screen adaptation. I cant see how they did it, but the director actually caused me NOT to feel a thing when the dogs died at the end. Wow!!

Now I read it to my 5th grade class. The original movie was very disappointing, as it did not follow the book. I have always hoped that the movie would be remade and remain true to the book. Such was my anticipation when I bought the 2004 release. Unfortunately, this version has the same bastardizations as the original movie and other facets that make it difficult to enjoy. For example, most of the hunting is done in the daytime, even though the narration says it is night. Like the original movie, Billy does not win the coon hunt outright, but rather the real winner declares Billy the winner and gives the trophy and money to him. Many of the highlights of the book are left out, which I can understand due to time constraints, but why can't we get a movie of Where the Red Fern Grows that makes some attempt to remain true to the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book deserves better than this...","review":"This wonderful book deserves much more than this movie. I was hoping for so much more, especially from Disney. It seemd to me that it was made hastily and on a tight budget...Coleman and Ned Beatty (sp?) did their part, but Dave Matthews? This story did not deserve to have an actor if his inability playing the role of the young man's father. As a young man who read this book over and over, and for a Father who was excited about having his 6 year old son watch this movie with him, I am very, very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the Red Fern Grows DVD","review":"I showed this movie to my 4th graders after reading the book to them. They were a little disappointed with the movie. It left out some crucial scenes that lead the reader/watcher to make a connection to Billy and so the movie is not as meaningful as the book. There were lots of tears in the book, not so many during the movie. My students were also disappointed in the lack of details of some of the biggest scenes in the book, the boy dying with the ax, the hunting competion, the death scene. It's a good movie, but no where near as good as the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like a Hallmark made for TV Movie","review":"I think the biggest problem with this movie is the casting. The actress who plays the supposed mother living in the middle of nowhere looks like a model, and has very odd and awkward expressions. The gentleman who plays the father acts poorly, the young man who plays the lead character feels much older than he is supposed to be, and plays the part a bit too goody goody for believability. The only part well played in the movie is the part played by Dabney Coleman. This movie feels like a cheap made for TV movie, which is a real shame given the pedigree of the book to which it represents."},{"rating":"2","title":"where the red fern grows!!!!!!","review":"Stuart Dickison did such an amazing job as Rubin Pritchard.He was in great shape and he was a very very good actor.

Some of the scenes were actually laughable. It seems as though Disney threw this together and was unwilling to spend any money on production (coon hunts were filmed during the daytime!) The acting was horrible. With such a wonderful story to work with I am amazed at how bad this movie was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been a theatrical release first.","review":"Who's running Disney marketing. I loved this film. It is a classic Americana family film the should have been shown in the theatres first during Christmas before going to DVD. With the Millions who have read the book over the past 35 years (book Number 2 of all times for 35 years) and the 30 Million plus Dave Matthews fans, it was destined to be a huge box office hit. What would Walt think about Disney not releasing this film to theatres if he were alive? Disney let this one slip right through their fingers. There was magic between Joseph Ashton (Billy Coleman) and Dabney Coleman (Grandpa). They both did a great acting job, and Dave Matthews did great his first time out. With music classics in the same film like Mac Davis, Kris Kristofferson, and Dave Matthews, there should have been a theme song done by the three. Disney marketing did a grave diservice to a great classic film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the Red Fern Grows","review":"I thought the acting in this movie was very poor. It also changes the book and it show how devoted the dogs are to the boy or how much real work it took to get the dogs. The hunting is in warm weather and in the day time, very unrealistic. It also does not portray the true poverty that this mountain people we in. I thought it was a poor interpretation of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"where the red fern grows","review":"Don't waste your money on this one!!! Buy the original, or better yet, read the book. Dave Mathews is a great singer, but as an actor, he leaves a lot to be desired.

This one's got plenty of good information, and I like the simpler approach. However, if you're an elite athlete (or wannabe), perhaps this may be too simplistic. Things I liked:- The simplistic approach to training (I just don't have time to break down my build phase into 5 periodized segments :-))- The emphasis on establishing *realistic* goals- The creative training log formats- Many good ideas & suggestions to take away and use in a way that works for *you*.There simply is no one-size-fits-all, magical training program out there that will turn you into a better triathlete. Every person's goals, abilties, time schedule/commitments, and life in general are unique. So, glean some new ideas from this and other good books out there, and design the best program for you.

Even Mr. Drummond wouldn't be blown away by this movie. And the plot was so incredibly stupid. And sadly, throughout the whole movie I couldn't help but think Dana Plato was totally on something.

I certianly have more respect for working mothers. Sorry, but you will never convince me that those kids in Columbine shot up that school because their mothers didn't stay home. THAT in itself is a whole different issue of parenting. Quite frankly the book is sickening and takes women all the way back to the 1950's as far as women's roles. I was particularly appalled when the women claimed that in their partnership marriages, their husbands careers and lives came first. What is equal about that? I'm sure the men DO support their wives staying home because they are getting spoiled out of the deal. I threw my copy away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laziness Justified","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that this is just an excuse for lazy women who don't want to join the REAL world and work for a living. Most women today work full-time and do all the household chores and tend to the children. It's also time for husbands to take on some of that responsibility as well. Also, we set a better example for our daughters when they can be proud of their mothers who are not simply \\"hubby's little helper\\" (unpaid prositute, cook and house-cleaner). Get out and earn your way in the world ladies. Money is Power!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need an inferiority complex, read this book!","review":"All of the stay at home moms in this book are very affluent, and either had very successful careers high on the corporate ladder or in acting or modeling, or their husbands are very wealthy (ceos, doctors, sports stars, actors). While it would be interesting to read a few stories of women who formerly had great careers and decided to interrupt them to stay home with their children, most stay at home moms are not like that. This book made me feel like I have never done anything with my life. Just not very useful to the normal mom, although if you are a millionaire CEO you might get something out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant first novel","review":"Sure, it's a bit too long. But it's brilliantly done -- precision prose, a raw naked dive into her character's emotions at the moment she suffers a near-psychotic break when her brother suicides. Part way through I thought the subtitle should be \\"How I Became a Control Freak.\\" Perhaps the people who don't love this book had perfect childhoods, weren't Ugly Chicks, didn't dream of a Fairy Godmother. It's a great story with wildly imaginative detail, and she writes poetic prose. I'll be reading everything else she writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful","review":"This is the kind of book that makes you feel more alive and makes you love the experience of being alive. It crackles with energy and insight. And it contains a powerful, soulful story, beautifully told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it; sorry","review":"There are very few books I have not been able to finish, but this one I finally had to give up on about a third of the way through. For all the reasons the other one-star and two-star reviewers gave. The writing itself is good but the story line is terminally tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...At Least I Finished It","review":"I was so glad that I read this coming-of-age-in-hippiedom novel...mostly glad that I didn't give in to my ongoing desire to put it down and forget it. Ms. Long had the guts to stick to it and write it all; the least I could do was stick to it and finish reading it. But omigod...it's really a tiresome read. Are the rave reviews just puffery? The story just plods along with its feet stuck in the murky mud of childhood disappointment, long after the mud should have been scraped off and left behind. Ms. Long's writing is not too bad (oops, damned by faint praise), and she probably got a lot of catharsis writing it all down. But ya know what? Get over it, and get on with it. It's grow-up time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"After reading all the fabulous reviews this book received I couldn't wait to buy it. What a disappointment. So self-conscious and over-written that I only skimmed it. The narrator/heroine is self-involved and tedious. The story is so predictable I knew what the last scene and \\"moment of truth\\" would be from the first chapter. A big bore. If you want to read a fabulous coming-of-age novel about the children of hippies, then read Danzy Senna's Caucasia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While this book starts off well, it quickly goes downhill. This isn't just a look back at the muck and mire of a bad childhood, it's a self-pitying, wallowing, drowning in it. I didn't like Juniper/Jennifer or anyone else (except maybe Chris - and you don't really get to know him). I also didn't like the overuse of the \\"Ray. My father, my daddy, my dad\\", or \\"Faith. My mother, my mommie, my mom.\\" If you read this, you'll know what I mean. All in all, a real disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"I'll give her this, she does an excellent job at evoking her setting. Too bad she didn't extend the same delicate touch to the horrifically over-wrought characterizations. It read like a depressing cartoon. But it was an excellent cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I love this book. The main character, Jennie, is one of the strongest female characters I have read in fiction - tough, smart and intent on re-inventing herself from the hippie child she once was. The novel weaves between the present - a road trip begun when Jennie's brother commits suicide - and the rich past of Jennie's hippie parents who invented their own new life in New Mexico. The prose is lyrical and lush, and each scene is so beautifully rendered that I felt I had lived it - the book draws you so closely into Jennie's world that, upon closing the book, I would sometimes find my own world a little disorienting.Most important, I felt that Jennie is engaged in a task that faces each of us - carving an identity within a family and a marriage, sorting through the past to find the pieces that have meaning and truth for the people we are now. The book is wise and rich in the ways of grief and forgiveness, family, and, most important, love. A rare and unalloyed pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping plot, strong characters","review":"Gripping; I could not put this book down...I love stories that use different timelines which truly enhance each other, and ultimately converge in a meaningful way. Usually when reading fiction, I feel as though I am a spectator watching the characters as they progress through the story, but with Juniper Tree Burning, I felt much more involved... I wanted to somehow jump into the story myself and hug or scream at the lead character; she is that compelling. She is certainly not always likable, but that is part of why I enjoyed the book so much... it is very different from anything I have ever read. I anxiously await more from Goldberry Long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic...and cute!","review":"This was a perfect product. It's so low cost, but works great and is great for a whimsical gift.

He's supposed to be some hard core killer or something, but in his attempts to put on a southern (I think) American accent, he sounds more like a nerdy android.

I bought her this oven for Christmas and it's been working fine for 5 months. She uses both the toaster and microwave features frequently. In fact, she likes the way the toaster works better than her prior toaster oven.

I still use it on daily basis. Based on poor performance of my previous toasters and microwaves I expected this to die a long time ago. It is not as quick as a regular toaster but then again I've never had burnt toast with this. The inside looks still good, no chipping/peeling whatsoever and it's easy to clean.

The author presumes you have no skill or ability - like him he adds - and offers a rigid mechanical rating system that is completely incompatible with today's game, (particularly the internet games).The end of this book is filled with doomsday predictions for those who want to make a living playing. He insists that the pro's make less money than average doctors or lawyers. Unfortunately, his findings are based on a study that was conducted in the 70's. This book may have been published in 2000 initially, but it seems like it was written in the 80's. Perhaps this is a nice gift for someone who already has every other poker book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Title: NOT about sporting weapons","review":"I award one-star because this book, its title notwithstanding, is NOT about Mannlicher \\"SPORTING and Military Weapons\\", it only concerns Mannlicher MILITARY weapons.Of the 240 pages in this book originally published 50 years ago, exactly THREE pages concern Mannlicher sporting arms; EVERYTHING else in the book concerns Mannlicher MILITARY arms.I cannot comment otherwise about the book; I purchased the book to learn more about the Mannlicher Schoenauer sporting rifles and returned it immediately upon learning of the book's demonstrably deceptive title.P.S.

I kept thinking that it'll get better, there will be some excitement, but nothing. The writing style and story seemed too reminiscent of Barbara Delinsky, whom I used to like as a writer, but also grew tired of her books. This book seemed centralized on one character and Ms. Stone normally writes with 3 female lead characters. I kept thinking that someone else wrote this book, not Ms. Stone.

It may have been a very good book when written, but not today.It is dated: It has not been updated to reflect the technology that is currently available today as far as e-mail, electronic billing and payment, cell phones, mail forwarding services, and banking. The unfortunate part of this is that a significant part of the book covered this kind of information.In general, the deeper I got into the book, the more elementary it got.

They make tons of watches you never see in stores or anything then one day when you do see one you want and boom, its gone out of stock. I guess i love a shopping challenge, like a hunter this was my prize. Its not too extravagant but still has a large face so don't let the pic fool you, and the contrast is easily readable.

The extent of Allin's threat to society only ranged as far as his throwing arm could...Nevertheless, if you *must* own one of his records, this is a good one.

Everything he plays sounds great especially his Mexican, Caribbean, Italian and Spanish music. I just read another review and did not realise that he is also Horst Wende another great musician whom I love. This kind of music will live on and on and I really enjoy listening to RD/HW. I would love to get all of his selections but so far I have almost half of them and I always keep looking. It would be great if they could all be available on CD's.

Comedy is one of those itchy things that you either get it, and love it or you don't. I didn't. I found the dialect frustrating: It was supposed to be set in Kent but the dialect read more like northern England, you have to read it slower to work out what is being said and in doing so you lose your attention slightly which takes the edge off the humour to the extent that you're not even aware that humour is present. At least that's what it was like for me. Whatever the nasty thing in the cowshed was isn't explained in the end but you're left feeling that there is a hint of bestiality that didn't really suit the book, being or trying to be a comedy, hence the lack of explanation.

The second time, I stopped trying to plow through and just skilled around. I admit I did laugh aloud, but only when I was struck by the reflection that these two friends thought it funny. My advice: forget it. If you want to laugh aloud, pick up THREE MEN IN A BOAT (To Say Nothing Of The Dog) by Jerome K. Jerome, and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of Doom and Mirth","review":"This book is a very funny parody of the Gothic pretensions of D.H. Lawrence-style rural melodramas. In this Gibbons is continuing the Jane Austen tradition of comparing reason and emotion and contrasting her works with Gothic novels. The characters at Cold Comfort Farm are hilariously stereotyped ones from Lawrence and others. Gibbons is very good at puncturing the insufferable misogyny of male intellectuals of the period (Mr. Mybug being the main example) and showing how it covers a craving for some kind of connection.Although there are parallels with Austen, in Austen's books the heroine would have a moment where she realizes that she has also been wrong. That moment never comes with Flora, who is always right and reasonable all the time. She is thus almost a symbol rather than a character that develops over the novel. Still, it is a very funny novel from a woman's point of view. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining little book","review":"Written as a parody of the sensationalized novels of the 1930s, Cold Comfort Farm is a short, funny, entertaining story. It all starts when orphaned Flora decides she would rather live off her relatives than find a job. After dashing off letters to her unsuspecting relations, she picks the Starkadder family of Cold Comfort Farm to move in with. The Starkadders are a bit of a backwards bunch: an oversexed brother, wild sister, and Bible thumping father, among others. They are all overseen by Flora's Great Aunt Ada Doom, who saw \\"something nasty in the woodshed\\" years before. Hilarity ensues as Flora attempts to clean up, domesticate, and civilize the Starkadder clan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Comfort Home is hilarious...engaging...entertaining.","review":"If you know someone who is ill...a shut-in...or who just enjoys a good laugh, Cold Comfort Home, is a perfect gift for them all.

I love the book. Excellent writing: strong motifs gives the text depth, such as the flower motif tied to the main character's name, Flora, alluding to the beauty and selflessness she comes to exemplify. The story line is simply beautiful and clever, the characters are wonderful and silly; I highly recommend the book (and the film!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abriged Edition","review":"Pay attention that this book is an abridged edition.

Lawrence, you will laugh yourself silly over this ... oh, and buy the movie, too!!This is literary parody. It is a classic in Great Britain, less well known here.

Considering how popular Jane Austen is in the US at the moment, I fail to see why the Sussex dialog and other British-isms need to be changed. I know the book so well that I thumbed through this edition and found that it wasn't only the Sussex language that was changed- EVERYTHING is watered-down, so the piquancy and charm is totally missing. I am grateful that the bookseller was very accommodating when I requested to return it for a refund. Back to the British publications for my fix!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this edition","review":"As many have stated, this is an abridged version and lacks a great deal of the novel's descriptive prose.

The book is just so-so; I only laughed two or three times, the plot takes 3/4 of the book to develop, and the lucky coincidences and favorable plot developments are piled on so thick at the end as to be a little absurd. Having said that, there is a part of the book that I couldn't put down- near the end where Flora's plots start to have good effects, but before the last few pages where the author seems to go a bit overboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger - the belt clip connection is fragile","review":"The first day the belt clip broke loose, and my 80GB ipod fell to the concrete pavement.

I can't give any examples here, 'cos I don't want to spoil the astounding revelations exposed throughout the book but if you read it, you'll know what I mean. And you should read it.Amusing word plays - like the blood lusting Hemogoblin - show Powers humour to be unsubtle, unlike the plot, which is so full of sub-plots and different levels, that you can't help sharing the calm desperation of the main character as he sinks lower and lower into a reality he could not have suspected existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleverness and little else...","review":"I like Tim Powers' books. I don't like this one too much though. Powers love of the grotesque is in full force here, but what you've really got here is two stories that don't need each other.

I find it seemless and am never tempted to skip anything. There are many shades and colours from Wagner to twentieth century compositions that should present no challanges to those who generally avoid the modern. There is not much point commenting on the singer. Like all opera singers, it is a matter of individual preferences. Norman is my kind of singer, dramatic, emotive, moving and vocally splendid by turns. It's a great voice yes, but it's great singing. That's what I think it's all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carter crashes and burns in this one","review":"When I saw that Carter released a new CD, I was quite excited and quickly snatched it up. Unfortuantely, Carter spends the entire album flaunting his skills by constantly screeching his horn, popping the reed, and all other assortments that, by themselves, give a solo an added touch, but when together as a complete solo, just make it disgusting.Though I still really enjoy James Carter as a musician, I feel like he could have done much better.

Assistant Professor Lutes, a self-proclaimed scholar in the area of women in journalism, places herself as the \\"sage on the stage\\" as she lectures ad nauseum about the objectivity and subjectivity, objectification and subjectivization of turn of the century newspaperwomen. The author presents very few actual examples of the works that defined these women and even less information regarding their backgrounds and histories.This book could provide the impetus for my dissertation on why academic writing should be relegated to textbooks and journals: the pedant always wants to 'instruct' in the abstract instead of 'guide' through the tangible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most important middlegame chess book I have read to date","review":"The Art of Attack is a book that does not deserve to be out of print.

I am a Class \\"A\\" player (1800+), and I found this book slow, tough going. It is quite helpful in teaching how to attack, but I personally found it difficult to see the forest for the trees: there are long variations in many positions, and often there are errors (duly pointed out by editor John Nunn). When the errors contradict the author's point, what are we to think? And even when they don't, the wealth of detail can often lead you away from the principles Vukovic is trying to illustrate. So, in my opinion, this is a good book, but to use it, one must:1- work hard at going through all the variations, and then try to correlate them with the points the author is trying to make;2- be willing to make allowances for the mistakes and errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"believe it","review":"it is what they say it is... aVERY good book. if you can find it cheap buy it. do it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"one point of note","review":"In almost every list of most helpful chess books this has found itself right up near the top...any questions...go get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of mistakes","review":"This book shows good ideas and that is why it gets two stars instead of one.

It's not. I love well written erotic romance ala Robin Schone or Emma Holly authors who don't feel the need to have the male lead denegrate and humilitate the female throughout the book. Nor is using the four letter \\"c\\" word to describe her on almost every other page. Yes, there's a lot of graphic sex but but I lost interest very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than last 2","review":"Her last 3 new books have been awful.

The first kiss is not even identified. I don't mind good sex in a book. This was too much.

I have no desire to ever read this author's work again"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable mystery and love story rolled into one","review":"I really enjoyed this relatively short story by Dumas. It's a fairly easy read and the story is very simply laid out. For such a short story, the plot is very tightly woven, and you will be delighted when all the pieces come together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"The sentences in the beginning of the book are very long. So long that you might lose track of what it is that you're reading ;). However, if you look past that and keep reading I'm sure that you'll find that it really does get better. The only bone I have to pick is with the love interest Rosa. She is a rather weak female character if you ask me. She's got the whole swooning thing going on, and while I realize that this book was written a century before a Women's Rights Movement, I'm still annoyed that women's characters were either conniving and murderous or swoony and stupid. Otherwise the story is quite good; you're totally rooting for Cornelius and his black tulip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumas is indeed the master story teller!","review":"Who would have thought that a book, with a simple plot about two rivals trying racing to be the first to grow a black tulip, could be so unputdownable? There are no lords and ladies, no swashbuckling heros, no evil cardinals or Miladys -- nothing but a darn good yarn, and a very sweet love story.Dumas is just brilliant (as always) and his dialogue (as always) is among the finest I've ever come across. A very quick, albeit enjoyable, read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"This book was described by Publishers weekly as:\\"This not-especially-thrilling thriller...\\" This is an awful way to begin the review of this slower, more thoughtfully paced book. The writing is good, the characters are compelling as always and the descriptions of the landscape and the surrounding situations are a pleasure to read. This book is a nice escape into a more civilized and slower paced universe than the one we inhabit.There is not a lot of action, there is some and it is satisfying, but there is not a need for it. There is little moralizing or preaching. There is a constant theme of \\"protect the environment.\\" But this isn't a bad thing and it is done pragmatically, not at all shrill.It seems most reviewers focus on the idea of the tangible ghosts. That is not the important part of the book. What is important is the idea of family, and love.I found this book to be very satisfying and finished it in 2 days.If you enjoyed the first two books you will enjoy this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted this for my book collection to read again and rto share with others","review":"I originally read this book out of sequence picked up at the Library. and it was fantastic- Modesitt's world is similar to ours with a few glaring differences. great story setting and ghosts great author!

He was fortunate to have lived in a time and place on the cusp of cultural interface, european/native american, native tribe to tribe, and spanish/native american. He obeserved it all from within and without and recorded it in a memoir filled with love and humor. The people he met in that time and place speak in their own voices, still strong and true after more than 100 years.

But it does say that there are 200 lollies and they are correct. I am very happy with this product because they are delious and amazon has a good deal for them. Other places i have gone it cost 4 $ for 10 of them which is 40 cents apiece. If you buy them on amazon there around 10 cents apeice which is a very good price.

First of all it's not really what I expected, in the picture it looks like it has a flexible arm, it doesn't. It's a giant spring wrapped in a thick wax, so it's very flimsy and hard to actually pick up an object. The claw is very small as well.

Learning that it is out of print, is a great loss for me all future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Senses","review":"This book is a charming story about a bear who smells Christmas coming. I am impressed that the author came up with so many smells to include. Both my girls (ages 18 mos and 3) enjoy listening to this book and sniffing the scents. Not only does the book include a variety of smells, but it incorporates the smells in the scenes of Christmas and the sounds of Christmas. It seems to enhance the traditions of Christmas. A drawback to the book is that it has quickly lost its smells or maybe we have simply sniffed the smells all out too quickly. Another drawback, like most children's books today, the author uses passive, lazy verbs when more vivid verbs could have been used, such as the author's writing \\"had\\" instead of \\"ate\\" or \\"gobbled\\". Overall, The Sweet Smell of Christmas is a worth-purchasing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite","review":"This book was my daughter's favorite. She actually ate the orange from the top of the stocking. She's now 34 and expecting her first child. She found this book in the basement and most of the scented pages still had a slight smell.

Not a classic by any means, but it is cute.The stickers do not last. The only sticker that still smells is the Christmas tree. This book has been packed away from January to November.

Replacement stickers would be nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book for the little ones!","review":"I bought 2 copies of this book for my two 4-year old nephews for Christmas. Usually, when they open presents, a book would get tossed aside (at least until bedtime) while they went for all the toys.

Unfortunately only one of the three works the way it should. The book I gave to my daughter had no smell on the stickers. I scratched and scratched over and over and only got smell from one sticker. I had to unwrap the others to check. One book was good and the other was not. Very disappointing after reading the other reviews. I will be trying to return the two without smells."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Wonderful Memories!","review":"As a child, I knew it was Christmas when my mother brought out this wonderful book. I scratched and I sniffed, year after year, until all the scent was gone. Or so I thought... Last year, while unpacking a box of childhood books and toys, I ran across my copy. The fragrance is faint, but the memories are strong. What a magical feeling this book evokes, combining a charming story with scents that have lingered in my mind all these years. I just bought a copy for my own 6-year-old, and I can't wait to give it to him for Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it used to be...","review":"The integrity of this book is seriously compromised by the new, non-descript, circular stickers. They actually obscure the illustrations that they cover. It makes me sad that what used to be a childhood favorite is now seems so cheaply made. Also, the scents are faint. If you're buying the book for the story and illustrations it is still fun. But if the scratch-n-sniff aspect is an important component(why wouldn't it be?), you'll probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"I had this book when I was a child and I still remember the scents in it.

The book is colorful and the sniff spots are all themed with Christmas baking traditions which is nice, however the main event of the simple story is Saint Nicholas arrival to bring gifts to the little bear and the other associated myths, rather than the true celebration of Christmas as Jesus wonderful arrival."},{"rating":"2","title":"beverly","review":"What a heart-warming experience to introduce another generation to welcoming the holiday season by reading The Sweet Smell of Christmas. My two-year old grandson simply cannot get enough.

My mother would bring the box out of the attic, and my brother and sister and I would all grab handfuls of those favorites we enjoyed for a short time each year. This book was such an important part of our young plans. We thought Christmas just couldn't happen without each of these important smells. We had oranges in our stockings, candy canes on the tree, and hot cocoa on Christmas Eve while we looked at the tree lights in the dark.

I noticed from the reviews that this has been a problem for many purchasers. The story is cute, but without the scratch and sniff portion, you may as well get a different Christmas book.

She is really picky, so I thought if she liked them they must be great. She is not really very experimental and I love all kinds of things. I like them. They are good.

Almost as interesting was the excellent booklet accompanying the set with a miscellany of pictures and with contributions from his wife and others.I cannot but wonder just how great his achievements would have been had he lived and of the distinct possibility that the reputations of the 'three tenors' might have had to be revalued.

Not only do they love music but they love the people. They are there for us and they are the voice for every single one of us. They represent us to the fullest and I love them for that. The diversity is amazing, their personalities are joyful, and their music will take you into a whole other world.

Heck, even Outside was great. But Reality is just a horrible album. It's not like I want it to be horrible. I wish it was a great album, but wishing won't make it so. The lyrics to Never Get Old are absolutely laughable. I love Bowie but not every album he's done is great. You guys should learn to accept that. The only readon I gave this two stars was because it has 'Days'. One of Bowie's most sincere songs. A song which many of you overlooked in your glowing reviews in favor of such turds as Never Get Old. Maybe ballads are what Bowie should be doing now. He still has such a lovely voice but he rarely uses it with any conviction any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bowie Since Haroes","review":"OK. First off, I'm not a fan of the Ziggy period. The only good song out of that era is \\"Space Oddity.\\" Bowie doesn't hold my attention until STATION TO STATION.Simply put, REALITY is Bowie's best album since HEROES. Everything works: song writing, arrangement, performance, production. There isn't a weak song on the album.Aside from a couple of bright spots (WHITE TIE, BLACK NOISE and OUTSIDE), HEATHEN signaled the return of Bowie the senior statesman. Both excellent albums, REALITY outshines HEATHEN in many ways.Bowie is clearly one of the most intelligent people in the \\"business.\\" I've always admired artists who are courageous enough to change, even if that change causes them to go through some bumpy roads. For that alone I give Bowie credit for taking his fans through some rough patches. It's nice to see he wound up his career on a very strong note.An excellent companion piece is A REALITY TOUR. The DVD is awesome.David Bowie - A Reality TourThanks, Davie.-"},{"rating":"2","title":"David Loves New York","review":"Let me start by saying that I am an old school Bowie fan. My very first LP was Diamond Dogs. That said, Reality, DB's latest release is a fun ride through post millenial NY. As a frequent visitor and lover of NYC, I can hear the city woven throughout the songs. This is, however, not a concept album. Reality is also not nearly as dark as Heathen another 'NY album'. Reality is a collection of rock and roll pop songs, that do not pander to a particular genre or audience. Many reviewers have compared this album to various stages of DB's past. How could one not notice these references!?! But they are only references. Reality is the product of a skilled artist and entrepreneur knows how to craft quality music (and product).Why 4 stars? This is not a genre defining milestone like Ziggy, Diamond Dogs, or Heroes. If you are looking for groundbreaking work, lighten up or buy another album. This release is undeniably pop. But it's also a fun ride through Gotham with the top down."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is still great","review":"When I first heard \\"New killer star\\", one thing came to my mind, the song \\"Final solution\\" by the band \\"Pere Ubu\\". \\"Final solution\\" has also been performed by Peter Murphy and his vocals sounds pretty much like David Bowie on this one.I see a lot of \\"Pere Ubu\\"'s influence in this album. No, we are not going in a new century with this album, I think we are going in the past with some music that was not very popular at that time.Do they all still stick together (Iggy Pop-David Bowie-Peter Murphy). I think so as they influence themselves a lot.A good album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowie without gabrel reeves","review":"All though this cd has many pleasurable moments, it has its flaws namely that Gabrel Reeves is absent. Gabrel brought a rawness with finese to the cds he work on with David. Earthling and all three Tin Machine cds surpass this cd. I have been a fan of Bowies for thirty plus years. Bowie music works best when he abandons the tecno sounds he used on Scary Monsters and Outside. The rare cover of Harrison song try some buy some is a tribute. It is probaly Georges worst song though and David adds nothing to it. This cd will probaly work better live, stripped of it's slick production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowies back in form","review":"For me, when Bowie made good music it was the tonal shades in his music and the emotions conveyed by voice that pulled it off. His lyrics did not have to be perfect for the song to work.When Heathen came out, I knew the wait was worth it. Since Scary Monsters, I wondered what happened to Bowie. Maybe he was too happy with life? Earthling was interesting but Reeves guitar work was always irritating. Heathen was Bowie back in form.Reality continues where Heathen left of. A bit more experimentation and a bit more edgy.Maybe this album is not for everyone. But if you have ever enjoyed David Bowie this album is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Cd From The Man Who Gave Us Ziggy!","review":"David Bowie is just so great, I mean he just keeps getting better (and cooler). His last cd, Heathen was a nice blend of rock and slow tunes. Reality, his latest is more of the same but even better and rocks more. Songs that are really cool (and my favs) are New Killer Star, Pablo Picasso, Never Get Old, Try Some, Buy Some (written by George Harrison) and Reality. All are really excellent songs and Bowie's voice is fantastic. This is a great cd that you should immediately add to your collection if you like Bowie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite but a great album anyway","review":"Reality is still Bowie quality; I think most fans should purchase it if they haven't already. However, I find that I'm not listening to that one as much as Earthling, Heathen or even Let's Dance (a timeless classic). Most songs on the CD are amazing, catchy and highly creative; in this, Reality is pure excellent Bowie. \\"Looking for water\\", however, is the reason why the CD stays on the shelf most of the time. It's noisy, repetitive and downright annoying if you ask me.One of the things I enjoy most about Bowie is that his albums are usually pure pleasure to listen to from beginning to end; no bad songs, it's success after success. For Reality, I have to actually get up and go skip that one song, which bother me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Carlos Alomar","review":"There just hasn't been a good Bowie album since Bowie became as ass and stopped writing with Carlos Alomar.

This is another one but there's really not much here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long time Bowie Fan","review":"I have been a Bowie fan since 1972 and he still remains my favorite Rocker of all time. But this CD is horrible!! No emotion, poor writing and NO songs that \\"Reach out and grab ya\\". It's obvious Bowie has run out of material after 25 studio albums. Bowie seems to be writing for the young bubble gum pop music listeners. Lets hope that his next record is for all his long time loyal fans.. This is a sellout. You want to hear a great recording that spotlights his piano player Mike Garson, listen to Aladdin Sane. This record will help you forget how BAD Reality real is.. Sorry David, but truth sometimes hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowie not at his best","review":"Being a huge fan of Bowie, I was looking so forward to his follow up to Heathen which was such a classic Bowie album. However, I was and continue to be disappointed by this album.It starts off well with the track 'New Killer Star' but even that song wears thin with it's insipid \\"ready set go\\" and wimpy chorus. The songs are very ordinary (which Bowie can do well - see 'Hours') and boring but with some bright spots. Bowie's version of 'Pablo Picasso' is an artsy rocker in the vein of 'Heathen's' 'Cactus', 'Fall Dog Bombs the Moon' is good and the lounge lizard tune 'Bring Me The Disco King' is interesting but otherwise a bit of a blip in Bowie's catalogue as far as I am concerned. Still love ya' though God - oops I mean David."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality Bites","review":"Preface: I am a die hard Bowie fan. I've seen The Man at least 10 times in concert (including the \\"Glass Spider Tour\\"). Heck, I've even seen Tin Machine twice. This is just him phoning it in. My personal theory is that he is amassing money to build a space colony so he can prolong his life by living in zero gravity.Reality is a weak album, he didn't even try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice is gone, cd is a blur except for guitar","review":"I hear so many sounds, calypso, harry connick jr, and a narrow range of voice on this cd. Not one song sent me and his artwork matched his music, chaotic and unoriginal, Sequieros eyes. Once I heard it I didnt want to play it again. I think a guitar instrumental would have been better. I guess his collage style of writing has run dry. That is why he shouts water, water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeremy","review":"Reality is not as derivative as most of Bowie's music. Rather, it has a flat, generic sound that seems to be coming from several different places. The best thing I could say about Heathen and Reality is that they are boring, which is is an improvement from the awful music he made during the 80s and 90s. The serious-sounding cover of the Modern Lovers' \\"Pablo Picasso\\" is baffling. The only reason I even bothered listening is because Visconti is back in the loop, but not even he can bring Bowie's music back to life. Bowie's vocals sounds worse on every album. He used to have a versatile voice, but now he is only capable of a low murmur."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply GREAT!","review":"This record rocks-I don't know how he keeps doing it, but this man as everone well knows is an amazing ARTIST who keeps the listening experience continually interesting. I don't know where he gets his inspiration, but his well is far from dry. I have been a long time Bowie follower, and this record though it just came out, is already a CLASSIC. Think of his only peer of his generation who is doing much the same in terms of keeping it fresh and always interesting, is of course Marianne Faithfull- especially with last years KISSING TIME'. With this record indeed Bowie continues to blow us all away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different world","review":"Reality is a great escape. The vocals are amazing and the hooks are addictive. Bowie is a timeless legend and will always make great music. I love that this album is outside the box and that the songs hit you. The guitar rifts and editing are amazing. The songs all belong together on this album and the sound is intoxicating. The best songs are \\"New Killer Star\\" and \\"Days\\". \\"New Killer Star\\" has a driving beat and origanlity. \\"Days\\" is a song that haunts you and the chord changes are so fluent. The whole album is a detour from the usual. This is music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una de sus mejores interpretaciones!!!","review":"Es como estar junto a el desde La Guitarra en el Viejo San Juan, Puerto Rico.Noche de pura bohemia a capela con su guitarra."},{"rating":"2","title":"five stars","review":"I agree.

Mix a hip shooting group of Florida islanders into a lazy island setting with apparitions and tarnished journalists and sooth saying tattoo masters, throw in a sea monster and a pirate or two and a flatulent manatee, and you got exactly the book I want to read as I lie in the sand and feel the sun on my face. It's the next best thing to a frozen drink at sunset. Not as psychotic as Tim Dorsey's creations, or quite as eco-conscious as Hiassen's, the book is a well-written little adventure that's just plain fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading for the winter's blues","review":"stumbled across this novel a year or so ago. found it again yesterday and, in rereading it, am remembering how light-hearted and delightful it is. yes, it has all the cliches we expect in a novel about florida after Carl Hiaasen's success, but there's an originality and lightness there that is all McClelland's own.once heard that \\"smile comes from within\\": reading this novel will nurture that smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Quirky and Wonderful","review":"For anyone who has visited Cedar Key, FL, this book will be a fun read. For anyone who has fallen in love with Cedar Key, it's a MUST READ. The author certainly knows the unique island in the Gulf of Mexico and uses his knowledge of the people and places to his---and the reader's---advantage. He uses the real names of places and some characters are composites of actual people.It's not just another wacky book about Florida. It's over the top but as much fun as any Carl Hiaason book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER EVEREST MEMOIR FROM 1996","review":"I expected a dramatic book about mountaineering (in the beginning), survival, and determination but got mainly a memoir about family problems, bouts with depression, childhood and earlier climbs. I really tried to like Beck and I do admire his ability to come back from death and recover; but does one need all this drama and trauma to make a man realize that his family and loved ones come first and are the main things in life, and you don't have to climb a giant mountain to understand? In my observations, I always find obsessions a bit weird and off-center in life. In fairness to Beck, the 1996 story has been professionally and strategically told by others, so maybe he and his ghost writer had to fluff up the pages to make a book. There was definitely enough for a great magazine story but a stretch to find over 300 pages to keep the reader interested. Enough said...Beck, hope you're back on the job and helping others like so many helped you. Mabuhay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of an Everest book","review":"I read this book and was severely disappointed in the story. I've read a lot of the accounts from the 1996 tragedy and Beck Weathers story was particularly fascinating. I truly expected someone who came back to life to really have something good to say, lessons learned, but that was not what I got out of the book. He does not seem contrite that he left his family alone most of the time for years for his climbing pursuits, comes back half dead needing them desperately. The book makes me think he'd do it over again and did not learn much from his ordeal. His wife seems extremely bitter (probably not unjustified)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"It may seem unkind to trash a book written by someone who survived the terrible ordeal that Mr. Weathers did. However, I really think this is a dreadful book. It reads like a religious tract: man becomes separated from his family due to his obsession with (insert alcohol, gambling, work or mountaineering here), barely survives through miraculous intervention, and is a changed man from that day onward. There's almost no description of climbing here. The Everest expedition is over within the first few chapters! Instead, most of the book is a long history of Weathers' childhood and family life; why this should interest anyone is unclear. If you're looking for a book about climbing, adventure or the beauties of nature, avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very human experience","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. I have read all the books I can get my hands on about the 1996 Everest tragedy - enjoying mostly what I've read - but this book has been different. It has a more human appeal than the other books. We get the \\"behind the scenes\\" look at what it takes to go through something like Beck did. Beck takes us through the tragedy, the aftermath, and his life before. This is truly an amazing account from an amazing man who puts the whole tragedy into perspective. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for mountaineers","review":"If you like to read about real mountaineering, try a book by Joe Simpson or Jon Krakauer. If you want to read a book about a guy who blows off his family to climb, and all the damage he does because of it, then this book is ideal for you.I was hoping to read a survival story, instead I got family dynamics."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give zero stars, I would","review":"The only amazing thing about this book is how it managed to get published.If you want to know about the 1996 Everest tragedy read *any other* book. Not this one.It is a badly written book. It's not really about the bad journey down Everest: it's about this guy's entire (uninteresting, middle-class republican,self-centered, suburban) life. And his wife's (uninteresting, middle-class,country club, Texan housewife's) life, to boot. Can you say 'narcissistic'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a Break!","review":"This is definately no \\"Into Thin Air\\" or other excellent Himalayan climbing book. It dwells on Mt Everest for the first quarter of the book, and then we have to put up with the medical, amputations and problems with his wife. Virtually no photos, just a rambling tale of the aftermath of the disaster, I have all the sympathy in the world for Dr Weathers, but planning the story ahead of time would've mad it a much better read in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It!","review":"I have not read this book and will take the advice of those who have said to \\"skip it\\". I am still mystified why everyone of the experts ignores Anatoli Boukreev who was the only one to save anyone on the '96 expedition. Krakauer and the rest of them tried to point the finger at Boukreev as some sort of negligent and uncaring person and apparently have been successful in denigrating this heroic man. Weathers was in a spot he never should have been, Krakauer, Hall and the rest of them knew it before the whole thing started but did nothing. They were more interested in the commercial aspects of the entire journey. I am not interested in Weather's personal life."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"this book is boring me ****less.\\" - a comment to my wife","review":"To be perfectly clear, I am glad I read this book. The problem is that I'm only glad to have read about 20% of it, the rest is stuff that I frankly could care less about. Now, there are people would appreciate the soap opera Weathers describes as the relationship between he and his wife deteriorates. You can find these people in the trash-novel section of your local booksture. The folks who browse the mountaineering section of said bookstore are more interested in the 20% that I was referring to above - The actual experience on everest and its aftermath, which is presented honestly and is quite intriguing. Even gripping. It has value. It is worth the $7. It is the reason why I gave this book two stars, not one. However, the majority of this book is a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was expecting more of an account of the actual Everest event, which I had previously read about in Jon Krakauer's excellent book. This was a poorly written account of the author's time on the mountain, with much more gratuitous writing about his relationship with his wife. While I ultimately did finish the book, I wondered why they felt the reader would be interested in much of the book past Part One, and why they felt compelled to share this personal information. Proceed with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I suppose I was expecting to read more about the climb and the months he spent with the group of people he was climbing with. But the book seemed to me to be more about his wife's life who comes across as a woman who would make me very tired. I kept getting this impression of her standing over him with whip in hand telling him how she wanted the book wrote. I had to force myself to even make it half way through. At that point I finally told myself that this thing is not going to get any better. I then closed the book and never finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left for Dead","review":"There was nothing compelling about this book. I expected much more writing about the actual climb and less about Beck Weathers personal family history. I don't care to know about such intimate details regarding Beck's marriage or what his children think of him.Also, I was amazed at some of the medical references he made such as not knowing you don't necessarly feel thirsty when you are dehydrated....isn't he a doctor???Honeslty, If I was climbing Everest, I would not want a person like this on my expedition...the eyesight, the lining under his clothing...some of this is common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a climber - not worth buying.","review":"I'm glad Beck survived, that is truly inspiring. I would probably go and listen to a lecture by him. However, don't buy this book if you expect interesting climbing stories. It's more about family dysfunction. In 10 minutes you can glean most of the climbing out of it.The rest of the story? Pull out 20 years of poorly written, overly long Christmas letters from eccentric 4th cousins - substitute names and you have this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some insight as to what happened","review":"You kind of have to dig to find out what Dr. Weathers really thinks about the whole Everest 96 disaster. Bottom line: He was climbing when he should have been husbanding. The most telling line in the book: Boukreev didn't stay with the people who paid him to guide them. When he did make his way up to the South Col, he only bothered to save the ones in his expedition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"I am about 3/4 of the way through and have read the constant bickering that took place between his wife and himself. We wanted to read his account of the tragedy on Everest and he wrote about 2 chapters worth (there are 24 or 25 total) on the tragedy. The rest is about his failing marriage. If I wanted this, I would have read an Oprah book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story about a man's failing marriage","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. In my keen interest in the story of the 1996 disaster on Everest I was eager to find out the turn of events according to Beck. Instead I got a book which gave us an insight to a man's dull and failing marriage besides other personal problems. What a waste of money. Hey we've all got personal problems and people have suffered a lot more than the Weathers family. I admire the man for his determination for striving and reaching his goals but he sounds more like a big wimp than a man who attempted to climb everest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bearing the Soul","review":"Beck Weathers and his family have bared their soles for this revealing look into a climber's head and his family life.Starting with the actual tragedy that has been chronicled in many venues, Weathers follows this with a microscopic view into his personal and family life. Nothing is left to the imagination as he battles inner demons and resulting family crises.His quest for climbing skills and knowledge is shared with the reader, including the many disappointments and mistakes, culminating in his Everest epic. He concludes with revelations of the seriousness of his injuries and his mistakes.Although I was disappointed in the low quality photos, it is still a valued purchase that I will keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peruse before you buy..","review":"I read this after reading Jon K's book.Almost right off the bat we discover Beck was having some issues with depression....this trip was either going to be a wakeup call or a deathwish.His writings I didn't mind...this trip humbled him. The parts from his wife could have gone....what an arrogant angry woman.As far as how this relates to the rest of us...if it was me on that mountain, I would be dead. The governor wouldn't even have picked up the phone.Save your $$. Check it out at the library, or read Jon Krakauer's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Climbing","review":"Porly orgainzed and scattered. About half way through I strted skipping over the family stuff.

Find another book","review":"All readers are intrigued by life and death struggles such as conquering Everest. If drama, suspense, excitement, and insight into a near death experience from a personal perspective are your interest, you won't find it here. Every chance the authors get to instill the feeling of what it must have been like to endure this expedition, they fall short. Its as though this book was written as an epilogue to \\"Into Thin Air\\". This book never takes you anywhere. The style of conversation-blocking with family members and friends smacks of a journalist transcribing tape-recorded conversations. If you want to taste Beck's emotional experience, you will have to hear him in person - there is no comparison. But if you want to know the fury of Everest - find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brave Attempt to Make Up to His Wife","review":"Dr. Weathers clearly has undergone a terrible tragedy; however the tone of this book is clearly one of hopeful self-flagellation--\\"maybe if I beat myself up enough about what a jerk I have been others will stop doing so themselves!\\" Let's hope his wife doesn't let him forget. Not very well written, but it is faily entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much family","review":"The parts about climbing were very good. But just too much of his personal problems to be a 'climbing' book - might be good for those who want to know about the problems of depression/etc.Seem he, like many other who wrote about that tragedy, did a book for self healing. Which is OK.But it did help me better understand somthing's bout Everest in May of 96. I have read most of the other books about that tragedy. Any one of which puts a different slant on what happened - read 'em all."},{"rating":"2","title":"left for dead","review":"For a real life story it does not get much more real than this, a passion becomes an obsession that takes away the hero status that he was aiming for in the first place? . I found it easy to read. A bit of soft filling in the middle and couldn't really relate to the relationship with his wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously?","review":"Probable one of the worst books I have ever read. I am no critic; but....even though Beck Weathers sounds like an interesting guy. The book ineptly titled My return from Everest....ended on page 109. the next 244 pages covered his disasterous and selfish marriage with Peach (his wife)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beck Weather's Left for Dead","review":"I am an avid reader of mountain adventures, sailing adventures, caving adventures and the like. I like fast-paced, riveting stories, with a good balance between background information and excitement.I first heard about Beck Weahters and his ordeal when reading Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air.\\" So I ordered Beck Weather's \\"Left For Dead.\\" I was disappointed.It was ok but not as good as others I have read. The part about the climb was excellent, the part about his recovery dragged on, and the part about how he has grown from his ordeal was ok. I became bored very quickly about his writings of his wife Peach.Ok book, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"This book should have been fantastic. Beck Weathers went through hell on the side of the mountain and could tell one of the greatest adventure stories ever. Unfortunately what the book contains is a lot of self congratulating about past accomplishments, needless anecdotes,and most irritatingly, a lengthy argument between him and his wife about who is the worse spouse.If you want to read about the Everest disaster go out and get Anatoli Boukreev's The Climb or Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. Both of these books focus on the event itself, not boring filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Tabloid","review":"As an avid traveler and collector of books about travel, guide books, etc., my opinion of this book about a tragic yet fascinating time and topic, is very low.

Krakauar's account entertained supreme, however after reading Lobsang's and Anatoli's points of view i think he may have somewhat missed the bulls eye.

Here is an account by someone who actually shares a responsibility in the so called \\"tragedy\\", someone who should be ashamed of his endangering many lives, and who managed to make a fool of himself on Everest. Instead of disappearing from the public eye in the wake of his pathetic performance on Everest, he decides to write a book and join the \\"let's cash on it\\" club.

Clarke was a great scholar who knew over 20 languages. He read widely on the customs of the ancient world, so he explains cultural references that would escape most of us.More importantly, Clarke's total respect for God's Word and his complete devotion to his Lord are apparent throughout his works. Clarke examines the Bible phrase by phrase and sometimes word by word with an unusual carefulness both for the correct understanding of the text and for the souls of his readers.This is an expositional commentary not a devotional commentary, but Clarke frequently pauses to apply the Scriptures to your life.Clarke was a good friend of John Wesley, and his theological positions are primarily Arminian, but his Commentary will be a tremendous blessing and help to any sincere student of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very few books that covers the design of Manual Gearboxes","review":"I wish this book had more practical design information on Manual Transmissions, but as it is there is some good information for the engineer."},{"rating":"2","title":"buyer beware","review":"The recommended age for these skates is 4-5 yrs...

If they were a bit more thick for extra support these would be close to great.SIZING:My daughter wears a girls size 2 SHOE. I ordered a size 3 SKATE because that is what she wore at the roller rink when she rented skates. They are a bit big on her, but almost perfect fit with two pairs of socks on.

It is quite filling despite being so light. I like the Multigrain the best because it feels and tastes more substantial than the others. Some people complain that it is too hard - but that's how it is. That is the reason it is so good - it feels like toast, but you don't have to toast it. It is not rock hard, just hard enough so that you use your teeth. Even my 16 month old son eats it... So if you've only eaten soft Wonder Bread all your life this might not be for you.Another advantage is that it lasts a long time unrefrigerated (just keep it in a zip lock to avoid bugs) so is very practical to have around for a quick meal. I suggest using a tray to put butter and cheese on it, otherwise it will break if you use an uneven plate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very tasty","review":"I'm trying to get more whole grains in my diet, and try as I might, I detest whole grain bread.

This is a collection of late-career live performances, late-career studio performances and a few studio tracks from the 1970s. Maestro Domingo's voice is not in top form on many of the tracks, in others the orchestra drowns out the voice, and the sound is unbalanced and muddy throughout. If there's any saving grace it is that this is a diverse and unusual collection (no 'Nessun Dorma' to be found here). In my opinion these two disks are not a good introduction to the great operatic tenor Placido Domingo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, realistic view of eating disorders","review":"As an adult who suffered from chronic anorexia onset in junior high, this is the first book out of many that has so accurately described the true emotions and actions surronding an eating disorder.

Best of all Newman presents a realistic look at the progressive development of the disease and of the recovery process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably unrealistic","review":"I read this book at Border's one day, and I liked it at first, but then I realized the book was extremely unrealistic. The soft ending is just stupid because the girl's problems are solved too easily. And how can someone who is bulimic just stop shoving a finger down her throat? I have never experienced eating disorders, but this book doesn't seem like anything that could happen in real life to a real person because it lacks to portray someone who is actually bulimic. That's my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I loved this book, but at times it was very confusing.

As an adolescent, like the main character, I know the pressure of having a good appearance today and being slim. Thankfully, I've never felt pressured to lose weight, but I know someone who was hospitalized because of this problem. I think that Newman did a superb job on this book, because I could really interact with the subject.

Unfortunately, it doesn't always end like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat Chance review","review":"This book was great! My ASB advisor told me to read it and to tell her how it was! I loved it so much I finished it in two days. I think this book should be a required reading book for girls from the ages of 12-16. It tells the honesty about eating disorders how it is. I love how Judi tells it how it is. Her concerns are exactly like a normal teenage girls concerns (But then again, who is normal?) Boys, Clothes, and self-image is what our socity has pounded into girls minds these days and this book helps girls balance it out through another girl's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very realistic","review":"I didn't like this book at all. I'm in seventh grade and I thought this book was very unrealistic. I think the author was using a lot of stereotypes. The girl, Judi, said that she read seventeen magazine all the time so she thought she knew everything about fashion. She kept relating everything to seventeen magazine. She is supposed to be in eighth grade and she got depressed because she thought she should be on dates during the weekends. She also got depressed because she wears size twelve (she is supposed to be tall) and her friend wears sizes 7 and 8. This author should have talked to some REAL eighth graders before assuming they all read seventeen and want to fit ino tiny tiny tiny sizes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put the book down....","review":"This book kept my attention & I kept reading on to find out what would happen next.

I made the mistake of jumping ahead and mistakingly plugged in the power to the DP-311U before turning the printer on. Now, I have to get an RMA, send it to DLink, and wait for them to reset it, as there is no at-home reset option. DLink has an advantage with this product as there are no similar products from the major router manufacturers.

After a few more tries, I called up the D-link tech service and tried all the things they suggested. When that did not work, I tried to return it, but it had already been 14 days, so Office Max would not accept it.I called up D-link again and went through everything they suggested--to no avail. They finally declared the item defective. This meant that I needed to return it, AT MY COST, to D-Link. I would encourage you to stay away from this product.

Someone here wrote that in such case you need a \\"crossover\\" ethernet cable (or adapter). THANK YOU! I learned that routers have the smarts to figure our what type of unit is plugged in, and automatically assign transmit and receive signals to the proper pins. My PC and laptops didn't do that, and the DP-311U wasn't smart enough either. Hence I needed the cross-over cable (just for the one-time setup). Sad thing, before I figured this out, I spoke with 2 people at D-Link's technical support; we spent easily two hours. But neither one suggested the cross-over cable.

In many ways, the story is like the Elseworlds tales that DC comics run. Ellis has taken the characters we all know and love and placed them in a very different, darker world, which is perfectly suited for his style of writing. This is worth reading for the new spin on Nightcrawler alone. The art is also terrific (even for an \\"X\\" book, which is saying something). i think some people may have avoided picking up X-Calibre if they weren't fans of the Excalibur series, which is too bad because they missed out on the best written chapter of the whole Age of Apocalypse."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAR OLD DADDY","review":"This 1971 British \\"horror\\" film is certainly one of the most befuddling and confusing ones I've seen.

Mother Edith and daughter Jane conspire to kill dear old dad to get him out of their lives. They manage to do so when he goes off for a weekend of shooting at their cottage. But things go wrong when they return to the scene and find the body missing, or is it? The script by Olaf Pooley (who also plays the neighbor Reed) is so ambiguous, by the time the film's over, you don't know WHAT really happened. If it's an attempt to explain the decline into madness, Pooley isn't sharp enough to evince it.

It also completely lacks any analysis - of the characters, events, Paula's reaction to them, the impact on her life, etc. Its main redeeming feature for me was its brevity - had it been longer, I may well have given up.

Some reviewers had trouble with the install crashing when it was almost done but I did not. I'm not saying you won't have trouble but I did not. I have one last point to make about the install.

The biggest problem is a FAT mouse-pointer button that is stuck between the forward/reverse buttons and the TINY laser pointer button. Since the laser pointer + forward buttons are the most often used in a presentation, the presence of this FAT mouse-pointer is just an invitation to accidently bump (and reveal) the mouse pointer on-screen. Ever wonder why the simplest remotes (4 buttons, no frills) cost more? Because these are easy to use!! Don't make the mistake I did.

Battery lasted about a year with limited use. My only issue with it is that everyone in my group uses the same device, and we have yet to figure out if there's a way to change transmission frequencies. When we are in ajoining training rooms one of us has to stop using the remote otherwise we end up changing each other's slides. That's the down-side of having a longer range. But in general, we are very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great & Then Stopped","review":"The presentation remote worked well. It provided good control of forward and backword motion for Powerpoint presentations. The RF technology did eliminate the need for line of sight operation. I really enjoyed using the product. Then one day, at the start of a presentation, it quit working. I assumed the battery had died, no one happened to have the special battery on hand, so I put it away.Later, I tracked down another battery for the device, put it in, and nothing happened. I checked voltage levels and the battery was fresh. So, I contacted Keyspan for warranty help. And after 3 weeks have not recieved any response.Hopefully, someday, they'll respond and fix the device. Without the service problems, I'd give the device a 4. With them, it seems your choice is to purchase and hope it doesn't break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable enough","review":"I've given up using this product because it is just not consistent enough. It will work well for short periods, but then I have to click the button repeatedly for a slide to move forward. Sometimes only every third click will work, which is very annoying when you are standing in front of an audience and talking about what is about to appear. This has happened in several talks, so I doubt it is anything to do with RF fields in particular environments. Obviously, the product is not designed with a high-reliability wireless protocol.Other problems are the complex method for turning on the laser pointer, the rather low brightness of the laser pointer, and the non-standard choice of battery. Some things are very nice, such as the small travel size and weight and the fact that absolutely no setup is required (one of the only true plug-and-play products I've seen). Its too bad that this was taken to market without getting all the details right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Device Poor Performance","review":"I first heard about this product from another instructor at the school that I work at. After trying it once, I immediately went out and bought it.I used it for one semester and experienced some of the same problems that others have; draining the battery in the carrying case and difficulty with the laser pointer. Now, after only one semester (16 weeks) the back button on the front and side is not working at all.I sent an e-mail to Keyspan, but have yet to hear a response. If this is the type of service and performance we can expect from them, then who is their competitor? My initial thought was to buy another one, but I don't want to give money to a company that isn't going to back up their product.I love the product and the idea, it was great when it worked, but I don't think that I will be buying any future Keyspan products because of the lack of customer support and the short life span of a workable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawless... for just three months","review":"Teaching with a presentation remote is a declaration of freedom. No longer having to seat in front of the computer to flip through my Keynote or PowerPoint presentations allows for more participative discussion. The Keyspan's cluttered yet complete interface provides all the functions of the competition at a fraction of the price. Moving the cursor, flipping pages, laser-pointing... It's all there. Regrettably, it only worked for just three months. I even changed the battery (a very expensive and even more difficult to find 3v model) but nothing happened. It turns out the original battery was still fully charged.In conclusion: I can't recomment this product. I have now ordered the RemotePoint Navigator.

And then we get this one thats better then the first 2 but still laking in a lot of areas. First off is Terry Farrell's major OVERACTING and disregard for her character really puts a dent in the viewing process. She was sooo annoying I wanted to shut off the movie..But dident cause I love Pinhead. The second complaint of mine is Anthony Hickox laid-back directing which he put NO thought into whats-so-ever and the story has hardly anything to do with the first 2 films. Lets use a example of how a wicked scene is made rancidly terrible...\\"Demons are coming for me father\\"..\\"there are no demons child. Demons are a metaphore\\"...\\"then what the f*** is that?\\"....Bad, bad, bad. She could have said that wickedly but she just sucks. I swear, thank God the forth film was good.

I like this third installment in the Hellraiser series quite a bit because it explains Pinheads past before he became Pinhead.

All in all best Hellraiser in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst horror movies ever!","review":"I thought \\"HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER II\\" was bad. But then comes along another sequel to give the series a bad name. Of course, there is plenty of gore to keep the average horror fan entertained, but the whole concept of what \\"Hellraiser\\" is supposed to be about has been lost. Even Pinhead has lost his touch as the ultimate prince of pain, I find him more funny than scary. So, overall it is just a complete waist of time and I think I'm being generous when I give it two stars. I'm waiting for another \\"Hellraiser\\" movie to give one star to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The end of a Good Series","review":"Hellraiser: hell On Earth is when the good series ends and all the [...] load movies are started. It is a great movie not up to the levels of 1 or 2 but still is good. Too bad they didn't release the un cut version because that is better then then R rated one.

Also, if you read the warning label on the bottom of the dvd you will see a ton of spelling errors. It'd quite funny if I was fighting with the seller who sold me this product. Avoid this product and pick up yourself a real copy of the dvd, if you can actully find one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This CD is quite different from the two previous Hellraiser soundtracks. The first two were pure horror music, dark, slow, imposing this one is like a combination of horror with action music. It is not quite as good as parts 1 and 2, but it has some great moments (such as Gothic Rebirth, Mind Invasion, The Devil's mass) and is highly recommended to fans of dark film music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Unrated Version that was on VHS?","review":"Hey! Everyone knows unrated is a joke. 9 out of 10 times there are scenes in the film that you would never miss... 2 more minutes of nudity, maybe a little more blood in scene, some junk that hit the cutting room floor even. Yet, I really enjoy seeing this picture in the form I had it on VHS. Nostalgia? Maybe. All I know is that this is the 3rd running of this disc and yet this Unrated version is nowhere. Why? First running was in 2006 and didn't have much in way of extras either. I recommend not buying this if you love to see your movies uncut. Too much too often are they putting out a product lesser at an unreasonably high price. I feel that way when it comes to seeing a picture like this come out without the ability to choose the unrated or rated version on the disc. Have some passion about your product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy to complete the series.","review":"The only reason I bought this DVD is to complete my Hellraiser DVD collection. Not that I don't like the movie, it's just that the DVD is pretty lame. First of all, this DVD is a special order from Canada. The cover dones a huge SPECIAL EDITION lable on the left side of the cover. Sadly to say, there is NOTHING special about this DVD. The movie itself isn't even in it's original theatrical ration (widescreen), which is a real bummer, and the picture itself is very gainy and not any better than the VHS edition. The only other feature it contains is chapter selection. Woopy (. . )! Every DVD has chapter selections; is this the feature that makes this DVD so SPECIAL! Again ONLY buy this DVD to complete your Hellraiser DVD collection. A real bummer compared to the special features on the Hellraiser 1 & 2 DVD's, but at least it's cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellraiser 3 - Get the uncut VHS release","review":"Unfortunately, the DVD of Hellraiser III is long OOP(out of print), and the copies that are widely available(on auction sites,used stores,etc.) are more likely to be bootleg releases. Beware bad video quality on those dvd's, which also happen to contain the cut version of the film. The VHS actually has far better video quality, and if you manage to buy the one that says 'uncut(or unrated) version' on its cover, you will get a fuller version of the movie. Yeah, a VHS release that is better than the DVD, how sad is that? :J Here's hoping this Hellraiser entry will one day get a better DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst in the series...","review":"First of all, I'd like to comment on the DVD. There are two dvds pictured in the description and they are both the exact same dvd with different artwork. I'm guessing someone decided it was a bit ridiculous to call it a \\"Special Edition\\", when there are NO extras on it. There really isn't anything \\"special\\" about the dvd. It has the movie. That's it. But it is hard to find so it's nice to be able to get for a decent price. The video quality is the same as a new vhs. Not bad but obviously not remastered or anything like that. I watched both \\"versions\\" on a big screen tv and they looked fine and sounded ok.As for the film... all I have to say is that a girl gets all of her skin ripped off, while she is screaming. And it's gross. YEAH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The weak point of the series","review":"THis movie is over all a horrid mess. Pinhead goes from a overwhelming Intimidating factor to a wisecracking Horror freak. There are some creative new Cenobites but thats it.the story revolves around a reporter who is trying to find out how this boy died. As it turns out he stole the Box and opened it. Pinhead himself is trapped in this statue that an art collector/ NIght club owner buys. After Pinhead is freed he kills everyone in the club, makes 4 new Cenobites (who die easily) and kills a priest just for good fun.This movie loses the flair that the past two entries held. Pinhead didn't massacre hundreads of people jus for the sheer enjoyment, he only came out when the box was opened and killed the person who opens it, plain and simple. THis movie oveall is garbage except for die hard collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've gotta weigh in on this one...","review":"...because, truely, I found this one of the most maddeningly awful movies ever made. I've sat through worse movies, (second Crow movie anyone?) but what made this one so agitating, is the quality of the first two, just to follow into the lameness of this one.I don't mean to step on the toes of the people who enjoyed this one, but honestly, I don't even understand how this one could possibly be ranked over 1 & 2.1 and 2 had some really nice stories based around an interdimensional S & M cult. This one starts off interestingly enough, but spins off into a ridiculous straight ahead horror flick, with some ironic death/mutations on the characters (i'm not gonna explain that; i hate it when people ruin things for me; if you see the movie, you'll understand them; if you choose wisely to see something else, you'll do better to forget this mess altogether) that are just silly.This is simply a regrettable road for one of my favorite movie villains of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid \\"horror\\" flick...","review":"It's a horror sequel, so I'm being nice with the two-star rating. Horror sequels are rarely ever good and this is no exception. I honestly forget most of the plot, but I think it had something to do with Pinhead trying to get out of a concrete block and enlisting the help of a teenager. The gore is useless and vague, the dialogue makes little to no sense and the special effects leave much to be desired. The series only got worse with \\"Bloodline,\\" but the fifth is a real treat, as I've said hundreds of times before. \\"Hellraiser 3\\" just falls flat on the screen, dying in an embarrased blunder in front of the viewer. Somewhere, Clive Barker is angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"pinhead is back","review":"hellraiser has been a strong horror movie ever since it was made, directed by clive barker and to the third to the issue it still has it's story about a puzzle being played with which opens the door to hell.

As a Barker fan for years the first two movies are the only true Hellraisers in which Clive Barker had the most to do with and isn't embarrssed about. The first is a classic and the second was a special efx showcase. Hellraisers 4 through 6 are much better then 3. The cenobites are ridiculous and the plot [was unacceptable].

Director Anthony Hickox successfuly enriches the tired (and somewhat sick series) with this sequel in which he adds his distinctive directing style which is second to none when it comes to visual panache as well as his unique use of sound design. The film is guaranteed to please any horror fan and is highly recommended to any one who enjoys gory , stylish and visually amazing films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with one huge flaw!","review":"As others have said, this book is extremely extensive. It covers just about every notational circumstance (available up to the mid sixties that is) in great detail. This is my number one reccommendation for a notation book.However, the section on Jazz is absolutely horrible, and offensive. Not only does it contain numerous flaws, it is missing a ton of stuff that the Jazz composer needs to notate. Also, it is offensive in that he refers to most Jazz music as \\"not serious.\\" The book would be almost perfect if they would just leave the Jazz section out altogether. He apparently did not take very much time researching Jazz compositions (I don't think he every looked at one!) and did not put an importance on that chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere first","review":"Certainly one is entitled to praise this book if one feels it warrants praise. It is rather much, however, to call everyone who feels otherwise unserious and ungrounded. Well, this book is more extensive than most music notation books, and that is worth something. On the other hand, 1) it misunderstands rhythm--as the grounded and serious and often performed composer Paul Creston points out (much more often performed, by the way, than the author of this book) and 2) for most \\"extended techniques\\" there generally is no standard notation, as a glance at \\"New Music Vocabulary\\" by Howard Risatti will demonstrate.The supercilious composition student (or soi-disant \\"serious, grounded composer\\") can learn much about rhythmic notation from Paul Creston's \\"Principles of Rhythm\\", yet I recommend Paul Creston's \\"Principles of Rhythm\\" for all musicians of all temperaments. (I don't recommend his \\"Rational Metric Notation\\", by the way--another story.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need","review":"Every thing you need to know about music notation is there.

Especially where that matter is widely available elsewhere, as in this case, it is appropriate to judge such a book by its manner of presentation. I find \\"Music Notation\\"'s manner of presentation deficient. It is difficult to use and difficult to trust, and its style is obtrusive and annoying. Again, although music-notation reference books tend to come and go, there are many alternatives to this book still available. I agree that one of the best is \\"The Norton Manual of Music Notation\\" by George Heussenstamm."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"This book is filled with bad and ill-considered advice. It is ineptly written, stilted, pretentious, and poorly organized--the worst music notation book I've seen. Among the best music notation books I've seen is \\"The Norton Manual of Music Notation\\".

Here is one:1) \\"Chapter 10 of Gardner Read's book 'Music Notation', entitled 'Meter and Time Signatures,' begins: 'TIME, METER, TEMPO, RHYTHM--musicians often use these terms imprecisely. But the four expression are not synonymous, and only two are interchangeable. The analogous terms are TIME and METER...' The first sentence and the first phrase of the second sentence state a truism; the remainder of the statement vitiates the truth.\\"The more than two dozen dictionary definitions of TIME can be condensed into one synonym, DURATION, which is present in every definiton of TIME. The word METER is derived from the Greek METRON, the Latin METRUM, and the French METRE; in ANY language, it means MEASURE. In music, therefore, TIME means DURATION, and METER means MEASUREMENT OF DURATION. Hence, TIME and METER are NOT analogous or interchangeable.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Resource","review":"The suggestions for restaurants and B&Bs were superb; e.g., without the book in hand, we never would have come upon The Little Skillet in Kinsale.

This book covers a lot of material and even though is misssing the HTML part of the codes, any web designer can figure it out by him/her self.She explains the code and what it does, and that is something most of the visual quickstart guides are missing.What I didnt like about this book is that it assumes that you are going to use a Unix or Linux OS when a lot of people are hosting under Windows NT or 2000 servers. The extra part at the end that talks about basic Unix commands and how to do simple stuff is very useful for the newbies who dont know what an IP is.I really recomend this book to anyone interested on learning Perl for the WWW."},{"rating":"1","title":"A somewhat general guide, not a tutorial or a step-by-step","review":"If you're seeking to learn how to write scripts, this isn't the book that will teach you. It is a guide only to basically understand Perl and CGI (what certain groups of characters mean, how it basically works). It is a beginner's book, but learn html before you buy it. Early in the book Castro uses terms (w/o any explanations) that only someone familiar with code might understand. The more you know html before reading this book, the better.Even after reading it, you still won't be able to write a script on your own. You should be able to use others' scripts though. Although there is no CGI/Perl reference/glossary in the book, it is well-organized and most of the language is simple and easy to understand for the average reader. However, if your vocabularly is a little weak, keep a dictionary on hand. The book is certainly something you should have in your library, but don't be misled as to what it provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After Purchasing Elizabeth Castro's HTML book I figured her PERL book would be a sure thing. It is marketed as a 'first programming book, and is tailored at perl for the web---A great concept. \\"For the essence of space\\" she has left out details, writes Castro. Unfortunately, I am discovering that I am unable to make the leap of faith she assumes to produce results. I think the book has value for learning how to set-up scripts, but you had better look for a second book as a strong reference on the actual perl.If her book had full-blown examples of the concepts reduced for space in the book, I think the book would be more complete.I hope the 2nd revision made marketed improvements.

She also didn't forget to incorporate very obvious ads about her other HTML title in almost every chapter.At last, I have to say she is very brave.

(I can already use a web server, thank you-- she doesn't need six chapters to explain the subject) And it would be nice if she included the HTML form examples along with the corresponding perl/CGI scripts that processed the data generated. As it stands, she has a chapter which tells you how to create a form, and then two chapters later, when she gets to the perl/CGI examples, they don't correspond to anything that's been covered in earlier chapters pertaining to form data.

With its small visual chunks, my eyes had to jump around the page excessively in order to take in the information presented. The font size and colors didn't help readability.Also, it seemed like important points were glossed over while trivial details were belabored. For example, I couldn't find explanations of some of the perl syntax used in examples, yet anchor tags were explained step by step, where the first step was to 'type an opening angle bracket <', then 'type a href= ' ...and so on.

I scoop at least 2 times a day. The ScoopWell Premium Litter scoop does a fantastic job! I have had it now for 10 months and I have had absolutely no problems whatsoever. Since it does a great job of getting everything, I don't use (waste) as much litter. Even when removing litter that has gotten stuck to the bottom of the litter box, I have had no problems with this scoop.

Keep searching . . .","review":"The money I spent on the ScoopWell Premium Litter Scoop was not well spent! Although this scoop has two nice features--the extra long handle and the metal edge on the front end--the design is otherwise poor: litter granules get caught where metal meets plastic and the smaller sifting screen does not catch small-sized bits of waste. I end up using the front corners of my $1.99 plastic scoop to pick up all the little bits the ScoopWell leaves behind! Oh well, the search for the perfect litter scoop continues . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good with Solids, No So Good with Liquid","review":"It's a litter scoop, so there's not a whole lot to say about it.Works great with solids. However, because it relies on a kind of sifting action, it's not so great with solidified liquids. The sifting causes the clumps to break apart. So you're left with either tossing out \\"clean\\" litter or having \\"dirty\\" litter break apart and fall back into the box.I've tried many scoops. This one is nothing special and it's expensive. That expense is what lost it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great scooper but handle breaks easily","review":"This was a super scooper until the handle broke. The metal edge on this scooper was great for scraping the bottom of the litter box, the screen is great for filtering out smaller particles - the litter really gets clean. The handle has a nice grip and is long, but it is weak. After four months of use the handle snapped off right at the scooper. I bought a second and it broke after three months of use at the same handle location. I ended up replacing it with a Duranimals DuraScoop Cat Litter Scoop - it has a shorter handle and doesn't filter the litter as well, but it is solid metal that scrapes the litter boxes well - it will last forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job, but...","review":"2 medium-small indoor cats. Clumping litter, tried multiple brands litter same results.I think the design is flawed in that it only has one \\"sifting\\" surface on the scoop and the metal grating seems to get \\"overwhelmed\\" every scoop and require much \\"tapping\\" on box side to try to free up, which in turn cause considerable \\"solids\\" to just \\"jump\\" right off the front of scoop and back in the box.Seriously, I was spending 3x as long with this chore and went back to my old cheapie plastic scoop, essentially the entire scoop is grated (sides, back, bottom), and tossed this one aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not offer enough information","review":"I was disappointed in this dictionary- it's really not comprehensive enough to be of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough translations of basic words","review":"I bought this book about 1 year ago and found it short of expectations.

It has all the signs of liberal conclusions drawn by rationalist scholarship. Though Cole admits the numbers in the Bible lead to 1446 as the date of the Exodus, he rejects this date and opts for the reign of Raamses II (1290-1224) (see p. 42). Furthermore, he thinks that the \\"sea of reeds\\" the children of Israel crossed was dried overnight by an east wind, thus being only a few inches deep (see pp. 121-122). Of course, he fails to mention how the Egyptians could have drowned in a few inches of water.In the above-mentioned instances, the commentary is more an exposition of Cole's preconcieved notions than of the text of Scripture. Perhaps other parts are better, but the commentary's primary value lies in its presentation of alternate views, and thus it provides discernment practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad English.

It is so poorly written that I must question the educational background of this author and/or the publishers!!Post-script: The author has taken umbrage at my original review. She must, if she is to be an author, accept criticisim as well as praise. In this case it is the former that I give.I too was raised in Rhodesia where I lived, loved and cried as the civil war grew. I lost some good friends. This has nothing, however, to do with love of country but an honest reaction to the author's work which is still poorly constructed and horrendously unedited.

She talks about the elements and how they can be arranged together, and that's as far as it goes. What she fails to address, and more critically, is the placement aspect of Feng Shui - directional or positional, the Ba Gua is never mentioned.She teaches you to arrange something, anywhere, using symbols and colors of the elements. In some demonstrations, I believe she gets her Feng Shui symbolism a bit wrong.I emailed them via their website, asking about their particular view of Feng Shui, about placement, etc., and I never received a response.Unfortunately, I do not recommend this video.

Budge's work was seminal to be sure but is now very dated.

This album lacks most of the sounds that were the true definers of the southern rock movement. Southern rock is defined by high speed boogie riffs with slizlin hybrd rock/boogie guittar licks. Listen to the old skynard albums and the old hatchet albums and you can hear the difference.

This album is a major disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Molly Hatchet?!?!?!?!?!","review":"Fans of the early Hatchet, PLEASE BEWARE!!!! This is NOT Molly of old.

Unlike the last two reviewers, who seem to be living in a 1982 time-warp, I am a Molly Hatchet fan of 20 years, seen 'em, played the music and rate this album as their best yet. Like many healthy bands the music (and, in this case, line-up) has evolved and matured - retaining Southern Roots at it's heart whilst also developing a gutsy but polished rock sound for the 21st Century. I also say this acknowledging full well the important part every past band member has played in the Molly Hatchet story. If you have an open mind and are in the least bit interested in 'honest to goodness Rock n' Roll' give this album a try. Would you trust 'reviewers' who try to define Southern Rock in 11 words or admit to burying their head in a 1985 sandpit? Believe me - the album is fresh and awesome. Keep on Rockin' Molly ! I'm with you guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great record","review":"When the \\"new\\" Hatchet emerged I was quite skeptical. Was not sure if Molly of the latter day Hatchets had the stuff. Mos def was not gonna gamble import prices on them. Lately however my interest peaked and I pick up a used copy of TSROH. Its is a great record. 9 of the ten tracks blaze. Sort of a Judas Priest meets Lynyrd Skynrd type sound. Good singing good playing. The only clunker is the semi aciustic remake of Fall Of The Peace Makers. The big guitar rave up at the end with an almost Moody Blues type of take on things. Cost this effort a star 4 instead of 5. Otherwise a great effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what Christian music should be!!!!","review":"Wonderful music!!

Anyone who sees this or knows the true story would not dispute the need to have used the Atomic Bomb. Even though it is dramatized, it does use people that really existed and something that actually happened to tell the story. The question posed is \\"why were some obviously guilty people\\" given a pass (for political exigencies) while an honest person caught up in the situation punished for following orders. Food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie! Excellent quality","review":"I guess the seller's not responsible for the story on DVDs he sells, but I did love this movie. It was a great docu-drama on a subject of which I knew little, about the Japanese war trials on a small Maluku Indonesian island called Ambon. The Australians held the trials right there. While Russell Crowe did have a bit part, they certainly capitalized on it on the cover...They should've had George Takei (original Star Trek \\"Sulu\\") on the cover, as he had a significant role.

After hearing her earliest work before she was signed up, I can't help but feel she has got a little carried away with clever electrical production. However, this doesn't detract from the brilliance of her song writing. There are some really spine-tingling moments in songs such as 'oh me oh my' and 'rake it in' and I wait with baited breath for her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna be Girl Rocker","review":"Imogen Heap tries to be the next Alanis on this album, but she only succeeds in taking Alanis's worst traits and magnifying them. Lyrics not edited from spur of the moment inspiration, a voice that isn't attractive at all, and wannabe rock out moments. She tries to do it all with her style as well, and fails. The only decent songs on here are \\"Candlelight\\" and \\"Come here Boy\\" and there are moments in those songs that are repulsive as well. The result is a muddled album with no focus at all, playing the forlorn star in her own eyes. There's potential in all of these songs. But she tries too hard copping an \\"angry gurrrrl\\" attitude that it ruins the moment. Skip this album if you can. I'm glad I bought it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fionna Apple anyone?","review":"This girl totally reminds me of Fionna Apple.

She is copying alot of Toris style a bit to much. The songs are dry and thin, with the exception of the final two tracks.

Mature, inventive, electric writing and arrangements, good production, and an honest vocal style. Doesn't feel forced like some of the others (Fiona Apple, for example). A trippy blend of pop, trip-hop, ethnic flavors, rock...somewhat eclectic but not disparate. It ranges from innocent and wispy, to angry and aggressive. A few awkward moments...once in a while it heads into bad alternative land, but definitely a must-buy if you're looking for a different sound that's actually good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising first album","review":"While there are inevitable comparisons to Tori, the most blatant being \\"Candlelight\\", there is enough uniqueness and pop hooks to make this very enjoyable listen. References to Kate Bush are also apparent. However, the edgier cuts sound like how Tori might have sounded had she allowed Trent Reznor to really cut loose on some of the cuts he helped her with. Great guitars sounds and driving rhythms on songs like \\"Angry Angel\\" & \\"Useless.\\" \\"Rake It In\\" is an early favorite for me, with an incredible pseudo-punk breakdown that she resolves in poly-rhythmic brilliance. Looking forward to more from this artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely addictive","review":"I've been listening to this album everyday (sometimes twice) for two months.

After completing the book it is fairly simple to locate each of the constellations mentioned.I did have one problem with the book. The gluing method used to attach the cover on my copy was of such poor quality that the cover came off with just one reading. Of course it can just be glued back on with good quality hot glue, but you would expect it to be of better quality from the beginning.Other than this one caveat, if you want to know how to recognize a handful of constellations that you can use as a base to learn other ones, you can't go wrong with \\"Stikky Night Skies\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"you can still learn at 60","review":"What a wonderful book!!!

The only thing I don't like is the extra external power adapter; however, I beleive it is a must in order to provide the extra voltages for the regular hard drive (12 Volt/5 Volt).

Mastroianni gives a beautiful performance in a film that is somewhat awkward and uneven and doesn't really know how to connect the dots effectively. It throws themes at us and situations that don't entirely gel, and that's a pity because the idea behind the film is compelling and could have been truly moving. The film centers on a widower who makes a strong connection with his granddaughter when she is basically left in his care through the immaturity of her parents. Just when life starts to feel somewhat \`normal', the girl's mother shows up and throws everything off kilter. It just doesn't all work, and the poor production values make this feel very low impact and cheap.

Now, why brunton decided to patent this mechanism is beyond my understanding, since a monkey could have designed a better mechanism, and why the cap is made so that it can be carried by the cap is ridiculous, since any bump will break it.

Poser models are placed in front of backgrounds without an attempt to link the two, and it shows as models float over scenes instead of fitting in.Mortier should have gotten a comics professional to co-author this book and give it better direction.

Unfortunately, Mr. Mortier's book does not fully deliver on this exciting premise. Why are all the comics in this book so infantile? I was expecting something on the lines of a slick Heavy Metal cartoon. What I got instead was silly children stories. Some of Mr. Mortier artwork could be deemed original, but it is not very practical. Why does he have an obsession with distorted and morphed figures? What use would I get out of a character with large ears and a pointed nose? Some of his images also have a disturbing hallucinogenic look. For example, on page 364 there is a strange three-headed bug man. It is interesting for a few seconds, but what the heck I am going to do with it.

For one, I'm sure that Mr. Shamms really likes screwed up alien creatures, but this might also have to do with the fact that warped faced creatures are much easier to make, and require far less artistry/exprience/knowledge then anything photorealistic.

The other guys were OK and had some good material that created a few laughs but no bellyache and u gotta get a bellyache to really enjoy a good stand-up show.

If the wheel of time ends the way this series does, the dark one will be set free, Mat will still be trying to get the daughter of the nine moons to marry him, and Rand will be wondering if now would be a good time to save the world.

The story of Androcles, a Christian who is about to be sent to the lions for being a heretic in the Roman Empire. A cynical, humerous, poignant, and hypocritical story of religion versus humanism. The book is intended with the introduction with Shaw's discourse on Jesus and Christianity. Although I found it dryly written, which some wit involved, he makes some good remarks on the problems of Christianity. Mainly is the devout in which they will surely go to the lions before giving up their gods. Hypocritically the Romans could care less who their gods were or whether they believed in them, so long it was not a Christian god. The introduction acts as a set-up to put one in the mind set of Shaw and to understand his point of view which makes the play that much easier to understand and funnier to read.

I have no doubt that this is true. The pictures are beautiful, and the story engaging. But this is not the version of the story where the old crone is a witch who turns children into gingerbread. Instead Hansel and Gretel, abandoned by their parents, find the house of the old crone in the middle of the woods. The old lady has plans to cook Hansel for dinner. Near the end of the book, Gretel pushes the old lady into the hot oven, locks the door and listens to the old lady's screams until the old lady is reduced to ashes. Then Hansel and Gretel loot her stuff.

I suppose there may be some ardent fans of his or maybe family or friends of Brokaw's that would want to know the minute details of his early life, but otherwise you might as well be reading about any random person from mid 20th century South Dakota. Nothing out of the ordinary at all happens in Brokaw's early life and this book deals with none of the latter half of his life (where he actually became noteworthy), thus unless you have insomnia I don't recommend bothering with this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for small seats!!!!","review":"Be Careful!

Took 10 days to schedule an appointment with a Phillips Technician. When onsite, Phillips Technician was unable to repair it. So he brought it back to the Factory Store. It's over 3 weeks and the television have not been repaired. I called every 3 days and they told me that it's 'in transit'. Since I got my Television on November 29, 2003, half of the time is in the shop. As of now, I still have not gotten my television back.

All the jumpers we found were only up to 25 lbs, this one is max at 28 lbs. So its not a huge advantage, but when you have a 7 month old at 23 lbs, you dont want to spend $75 for him to only use it for 2 more pounds.

He smiles and laughs and loves to do different jumps or just swing himself. It tires him out, too, before his naps or bedtime.

I had two different doorway jumpers and he just did not really get into them at all. I found this one and saw videos of babies using it and they all looked like they loved so I got it for him hoping he would like it and he totally does. It was super easy to put together, took like 10 minutes tops. All you have to do to fold it up is unscrew one side of each bar by hand and then fold it up and put the screw thing back on until you take it out to use it again... takes like 20 seconds.

I would be nicer with a few, carefully selected, exercises.The book would not be nice for an introductory course since everything is presented in such an obfusacted way.

Unfortunately when I applied the cream to my face I noticed my skin became much redder than usual. I tried it again on a different day and the same thing happened. A friend of mine who is a dermatologist told me it was because of the niacin--some people who are very sensitive to it will have a red, inflammatory reaction and should not use any product containing it. When I called the company to ask about a refund, they told me they could not refund my purchase because I had opened the container.Of course, I'm now saying to myself, \\"How else would I know that I couldn't use it??\\", but the woman was very curt, abrupt and didn't have anything else to add.

It has a lovely, natural, pleasant smell which I personally do not find overwhelming at all. The redness that some people may experience is due to the big boost of niacin in the product; continued use will eliminate that issue in most people.

It is the rather un-nuanced account of the adventures had by a group of knights (of the Round Table, of course). There is no character development and very little overarching plot to tie the stories together, but there is something oddly compelling about it. There is a great deal of smiting, and rending helms asunder, and rescuing fair maidens in distress (can you imagine???? The evil giant makes ladies actually do manual labor, though they be of high birth!).You get the general idea pretty quickly, I've read half and feel like I've gotten all I will get out of this book.

The language is a bit cumbersome for the 21st century reader, but one can overcome that. If you make it past the archaic language, there is little/no character development or plotline. Basically, all you get is a series of fights and battles. \\"Sir So-and-So fought Sir So-and-So until their lances broke. Then they fought on the ground with swords until they were both bleeding badly. Then Sir So-and-So prevailed.\\" Repeat this over and over and you've got it. The parts you'd think would be more interesting, like the sword in the stone or Arthur's marriage to Geneviere, are barely mentioned in the midst of all the fighting. I gave up about 1/3 of the way through and I'm going to check out some other Arthur stories recommended by other reviewers of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"much is lacking","review":"There is no personality development of any of the characters! It's basically just a dry reporting of jousts and battles - non-stop slaughter & cruelty, leaving me wondering why it's recommended as a children's version (or how there were any men - or horses - left at all after such goings-on).

If it was performed today, it'd be perfect background music on Dr. Phil's talk show or Anthony Robbins' motivational tapes and DVDs. It has a strong message to it about standing up for yourself. The rest of the album fails to match up to this song. It's mostly paint-by-numbers corporate '80s rock that would have sounded better on Journey's albums. The bombastic guitars, the over-the-top sounds and the unimaginative songwriting are mediocre at best. Think of this, drive while listening to this CD during 112 miles I-95 in Georgia south of Savannah, and you'd forget about most of it one hour later! That's just how average and flat it is. No matter how many jokes people make about the 80s, the clothes, the big, long hair the fashions, the neon lights, they can also comment on how lousy this Starship album sounded.

I have read several excellent historical accounts of the Battle of Stalingrad, but those dealt mostly on a macroscopic level - in the cold, analytical facts (which are fascinating in and of themselves). They always left me wondering about the human side of things.

His championship of Irish Home Rule kept Ireland within the British Empire for thirty more years. This man and his political position kept the radical left from many popular positions.The unfortunate part of this book is that it reads like a thesis.

What makes THIS particular version so exciting is that it is eminently readable and still quite stylized. Chadwick's eloquent translation caputes not only Augustine's ideas and thoughts, but equally important, his rhetorical skills. This alone justifies the purchase of this work. The philosophical nuances that, ironically, have entered twentieth-century thought again are very clearly articulated in Chadwick's translation. Other translations are likely to obfusicate what Chadwick elucidates. Read this great work by a great translator.

I hoped to use this edition for meditation, but because the material is presented in large and undifferentiated chunks, (and needs to be mentally translated as noted above), I see that this edition will not suit my purpose.For those readers accustomed to older English language and interested in the work as a whole, this edition will probably work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Is Abridged!!!","review":"The cover of this book says it is \\"Unabridged,\\" but in fact it is. A number of things have been removed, including footnotes, quotations marks, and section and paragraph numbers. Most quotations in the original text are from the Bible and the footnotes tell where. All of this hinders our class. Our professor is very upset that he had his class order this book based on the \\"Unabridged\\" statement, which is clearly false.

For instance, while wages have gone up (highly unevenly), health care that used to be provided for free (and so wouldn't be reflected in wages) is now very difficult to come by for the mass of Chinese. The heart of socialism - full provision of education, food, housing, medical care - has been eviscerated by Chinese leaders in Deng's mold who think that capitalist economists are the true scientists, and their advice can be relied upon to generate wealth.

It chastises 'right wing' progressives for embracing the market-socialism adopted by the Chinese and tries to make a case for Marxist socialism. As history has demonstrated, socialism won't work for a small group of people, much less a country with a population of 1B+. It is an essay written by a couple of egghead professors in ivory towers from academia who have no concept of what the real world is like.

He also helps her find her way to her family who she has been separated from. In doing this he sets aside his own feelings for his love of Olivia.This book is a fantastic read. The characters are real and the story wonderful. It doesn't take long for the reader to be engrossed in their story and wanting them to have their happily-ever-after.

What was wrong with building their own little cabin over by the woods and stream? Why not live near the people that love her?

I felt that Olivia and Noah's relationship had so much potential but the writer let them wallow in SO MUCH SELF-PITY that one just could not really see where the love came in. And if it wasn't bad enough that the two main protagonists were punishing themselves throughout the entire book, the peripheral characters were, too! In that sense, Darcy was perhaps the most normal person in this book and he was supposed to be a pervert! This book had so much promise, and Noah being a virgin was really sweet, but really there is just too much pain and angst running through it.

Although there are IO courses everywhere, there are few solely devoted to network industries - so it is surprising that the publishers risked producing a paperback.As a consumer, the price of Professor Shy's book is an appealing factor, but I found Hans Gottinger's far more up-to-date, rigorous and analytical book of the same title (Routledge, 2003) more stimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice mic for the price...","review":"I bought this mic when I was browsing for something I could record my demos over.

Hands down. And that's saying something because I love my doc's! :) I wonder how much money this guy got payed to make this crappy film? This movie is a big fat slab of frosting covered, bacon wrapped rationalization. With just a pinch of racism and a dash of sexism. The point Tom Naughton seems to be trying to make is that people have the right to be a fat a** and eating fast food is all American! And that those big bully vegetarians have taken over the government. Com on! The fact that a cheeseburger cost less than a head of broccoli is messed up and could only happen in the US. So if you want to watch a pretty annoying middle age guy stuff his face with gross junk food to some equally annoying back round music watch this film. Or save yourself a few bucks and try exercising and eating healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth anyone's time.","review":"First off, my complaint is not about the premiss of this documentary, yes you can eat fast food and still be healthy, and that yes you do need fats in your diet. The problems that I have with this horrible film is all about the presentation. Our narrator/film maker is a whinny self righteous suburbanite talking down to me then entire film. To be convincing, I have to like you, Tom failed right from the start. The writing is substandard, the facts are thin, any arguments from the 'experts' are at best, a reach and very very poorly threaded together. I could have dealt with the home-made aspects of the film if it was worth watching, but the crummy camera work just grated on me. Sadly the only reasoning that I can see for Tom Naughton to make this movie is not an altruistic effort on his part to make my life better, it seems that for him he just wanted to make a movie to say that Super Size Me was stupid.This movie is not worth any one's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid waste of time","review":"I was told how good this movie was and that I had to see it. I tried. Unfortunately, it is an insipid load of crap. Not funny (I was told he is a comedian - yikes), not factually accurate, and painful to sit through. 100% of the doctors he interviews say a diet high in saturated fat has nothing to do with heart desease?

It was an entertaining watch for sure but the intellectual laziness of the Mr Naughton was offensive. Obviously fast food chains aren't going to \\"force\\" you to eat their food, no one has claimed (including Morgan Spurlock) that they do so to continue to try and play that angle on crappy SD (looked like it was shot on an old Canon Z series or something from 2003-4) with low budget, uncreative editing and a general lack of comprehension for the matter he is speaking against make this a poor watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Logic","review":"Tom Naughton enjoys a month of eating fast food while improving his personal biometrics. He goes on to tell us that eating fast food isn't bad for us. Later he goes on to say we Americans eat out too much and consume far too many calorie from fast food. So let me get this straight...Tom can eat fast food for an entire month and improve his biometrics, but we eat too much fast food as a nation which is why we are over weight. Huh? Tom also shows us how it is next to impossible to take in too many calories at a fast food restaurant. He contradicts himself a lot and I just don't understand his logic. Perhaps my favorite line is one he borrows from author Gary Taubes...\\"We aren't fat because we eat, we eat because we are fat\\".I too improved my biometrics in a very short time, but I took the radical approach of eating vegetables and fruits and cut out any animal products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding entry into the Diet Wars","review":"A very funny and very well made assessment of the low fat (\\"lipid hypothesis\\") vs. low carb diet wars, with side trips into the politics of diets and food production, the unstated vegetarian agenda of CSPI, the political and legal assaults on fast food (and the implicit contempt for the poor and people of color who are \\"too dumb and lazy\\" to make their own decisions) and the questionable accuracy of Morgan Spurlock's Super-size me. The narrative is well done and the research is credible.The only thing that's somewhat unbelievable - how did a (funny and likeable) schlub like Naughton get a woman that attractive (and talented - great animation) to marry him? Hmmm...Great movie, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see for all, whether you've seen Supersize Me or not","review":"Fat Head is a great movie. I recommend it to anyone who has seen Supersize Me. Tom Naughton has put together a brilliant product that proves that you can eat Fastfood regularly and be healthy. He does not do this only eating salad's and chicken products. He opens the show eating a double-quarter pounder with cheese as his first day's food. A definite must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the first half of this movie.","review":"The nutrition info in this movie is pretty on point, but it was almost negated by the downplay of the obesity epidemic and an incessant rant on Morgan Spurlock... Yea, we get it; our government along with media sensationalism has betrayed us. Are we then supposed to pardon negligent business practices?... It seemed like Tom Naughton (the writer/ director of this movie) felt somehow personally attacked by the accusation that the Fast Food industry has played a part in the surging health problems we face in America. How about not turning this into a whiny political movie about your right to eat fries and cut to the chase about finding a solution. Btw, based on the attitude this guy has about food addiction, I really doubt he's even read Gary Taubes' book.Since you can't edit Tom Naughton's meal plan segments and annoying commentary out of this movie, i'd suggest just skipping to the more substance-based 2nd half."},{"rating":"1","title":"1-star","review":"I watched this movie with an open mind. I understand it is low budget or suppose to seem that way. I got the impression that McDonald's sponsored it, as much as I had to hear their name. I know you can get some semi-healthy foods at fast food places, but this movie was so annoying and missing a lot of \\"common sense\\". There is so much behind the scenes in the food industry, and I think this movie tanked on giving me any more knowledge on it. It did not make me want to eat at McDonald's any more than I do now.

I would recommend watching Forks over Knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Provocative, Informative","review":"Amusing, likable, and amazingly informative, \\"Fat Head\\" is both a documentary response to Morgan Spurlock's \\"Super Size Me\\" and a muckraking expose of the lowfat-eating dogma. You think this is a trivial matter? One doctor involved in researching the supposed benefits of eating lowfat called its theoretical basis -- the \\"lipid hypothesis\\" -- \\"perhaps the greatest scientific fraud of the 20th century.\\" \\"Fat Head\\" is also a triumph of self-financed, hands-on, DYI filmmaking, plain-speaking funny-regular-guy division.

Can't listen to that much whining sarcasm at once. Although anyone can lie in a documentary, including Spurlock (whom he demonizes), this guy purposefully ignores the points made in Supersize Me, which were not all about math, etc. For example, when I quit, this guy was talking about how patronizing Spurlock was about the poor. I don't remember if he was or not. But the point to me is that poor people are sometimes fat in part because McDonald's and grocery food that is cheap is also often high calorie food. Good grocery or restaurant food is not an option.

I was surprised by this groups diversity as in some of the tracks can almost be classed as \\"bubblegum\\", while others are much more \\"acidic\\" (mainly those done '68-'69).The biggest kick is that you get to listen to the evolution of a young Steve Marriot prior to him linking up with Peter Frampton to form Humble Pie. Songs like \\"Tin Soldier\\" and \\"Afterglow\\" are simply AWESOME and show the power of Steve's voice and the direction he was heading with the music.

One can really see the evolution of music through time from the Decca years (\\"What'cha gonna' do about it?\\") through the progressive rock of songs (\\"Ogden's Nut Gone Flake\\").

I was delighted when it arrived and giggled at the tale from beginning to end. More so now than as a kid. It was just that good. A good honest tale of a very believeable Christmas Pageant.

If you're a grown up, read it to a kid, you'll both enjoy the time spent and the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's funny and it makes you laugh real hard!","review":"The Herdmans are here.

The idea of grace--that the \\"glad tidings of great joy that shall be to all people\\" included the likes of the awfuller-than-awful Herdmans--is humorously and poignantly conveyed by the narrator, a classmate of one of the older Herdmans. If you have never read this book, you are missing out on a real treat. You will never look at the Christmas story again in the same way. \\"Hey!

The story of the \\"worst kids in the history of the world,\\" who've managed to burn down a toolshed, because \\"it was a Saturday, and not much going on,\\" and how they hijack the church Christmas pageant, is touching, true and laugh out loud funny. When seen through the eyes of kids who've never even heard the Christmas story, the pageant becomes something deeper and more true than any of the more conventional parishoners expect, and the lessons learned in this unorthodox manner are priceless. Not just meaningful, but fun, as when the Wise Men, sensibly reasoning that the Holy Family has little use for Frankincense and Myrrh, bring a useful gift (a ham!)or when the Angel of The Lord yells to all in attendance, \\"HEY!

The reception, clarity, and battery life is quite good. Also, my hearing isn't the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and don't have to strain to hear. My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit.

Even with this slight annoyance, I would definitely buy this product again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most uncomfortable headset ever, bad reception","review":"Avoid this product at all costs!!

Plus, the reception is fine when sitting in a car, however if you stand up it gets crackly and is extremely hard to hear. I repeat: Avoid this product at all costs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you have a very quiet place to talk...","review":"The problem with Bluetooth headsets in general is they are near your ear but 4-5 inches your mouth. Therefore the microphone is reaching a long way to pick up your voice and has little ability to screen your voice from everything else around you. Unless you are in a quiet room, forget the current offerings of Bluetooth headsets.This headset is no exception.On the other hand, it is comfortable and works well if you need it where it excels, a quiet room.However, I'll wait until an offering is available that works outside the quiet confines of the design lab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. There was no notice when it disconnected. Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.Logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant."},{"rating":"1","title":"4.5 Star rating","review":"This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine.

I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written.

They sent me the non-Verizon version, Mobile Traveller. So far, it is an improvement and I haven't dropped the connection to my phone once this past week. As for the tight fit on the ear, with a little pressure you can bend the ear hook piece to widen it and it will fit looser on the ear. I got mine to fit snugly without the pain and I can wear it all day. I had the Jabra BT350 before (until my 3 year old spilled orange juice on it and ruined it) and for the same price, I'd get the Mobile Traveller with the Windstop microphone, a great improvement over the Jabra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"The sound quality and functionality of the headset are fine, comparable with others.

I agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. It's true. It hurts.Sound quality is very good. People say they can hear me just fine, and I can hear them just fine.But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. What good is that?

Even after cleaning the ball and the 3 small supports in the casing. I'm not talking about the initial friction that people experience with the product in the first few hours. That office trackball is about 1 year old with 40 hr/wk of heavy software developer use.

The supplied wristrest is useless (too short for big hands) and feels cheap (not silicone).A shame as the trackball itself has a nice size and feel to it.The ball should be inclined forward, not backward. If that means a smallerball, then so be it. Users serious about their trackballs should look elsewhere.Note to Kensington : the wrist should never bend and the hand should always be in the alignment of the forearm ! Hint : look at the first Microsoft trackball design...What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimal Functionality in Windows Vista","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, Kensington's description of this product as Windows Vista compatible is VERY misleading.

Not any longer. It has four buttons, a ball and a scroll wheel. Only 2 buttons are programmable so 2 are just duplicates or non-functionable. It has excellent pointer speed, but nothing between very fast and almost stop. Most important is that it is so sensitive, the slightest touch can lose what you're doing or working on. THIS IS VERY BAD! It seems there is no calibration made on this mouse--just slap four buttons around a ball and sell it to long time users. If I hadn't thrown out my older one, I'd return this one.I need a good mouse because of manual problems--this is not it, even though Kensington advertises it's ergonomic qualities. Because of these deficiencies price is too high.

The scroll wheel on mine does not have the problems others have described nor do I have a problem placing the cursor. The acceleration panel in Mouseworks allows fine control.

Must admit, my wireless mouse would chew up triple A's and mousepads, and this Kensington wired trackball does none of it. As sure as Jodi Foster is a lesbian, this trackball saves my wrist from becoming a limp rag at the end of a long night of surfing. Note that I have an issue with Windows Vista, as the programmable features of this trackball do not seem programmable. I even downloaded the newest driver from Kensigton. But it still works, just cannot dial in the \\"go-tos\\" from the front two buttons. But the scroll ring around the generous and heavy ball is superb and zippy. I do think the ball has a tad too much wrist-ward tilt, but a small lift under the palm surface makes for an easy bromide. I dig this trackball. I can swing that cursor all over my dual screen extended view faster than you can say, \\"faster pussycat!\\" A joy!

Even after downloading updated software, it is still \\"clunky\\", ergonomically clumsy and much less sensitive than the plain old Apple Supermouse which came with my computer and which can also scroll laterally. The buttons do not fall easily under hand and it does not respond well to OSX type commands. My only regret is that I was so sure that this was going to be a success, I did not save the packaging so that I cannot return it to Amazon.

The accompanying wrist rest did not even come close to fitting the unit, actually leaving a gap of almost 1/4\\" where there should have been none.

Kensington dutifully sent a replacement unit every time while under warranty, but now that warranty period is over and I again have a barely-usable device. Note that I'm not a gamer, nor have I subjected this device to any other \\"hard\\" usage.Kensington charges too much for something that is clearly not meant to last.

I've used most of the trackballs that Microsoft and Logitech sold. I've recently had issues with Logitech causing USB errors and occasionally not working. To solve this issue I decided to try the Kensington Expert Trackball.Some of the reviews are very old, so here are my current observations.1. It feels as solid as a rock and the wrist pad works great.2. The big ball works better and is smoother than any trackball I've used. (It takes a little bit are use to break in, but when it does, it's as smooth as butter)3. The scroll wheel works great (it does make a little noise, but who cares)4.

So I'll use my perfectly good 2 1/2 year old mouse for my backup computer.I've been using an ergo beads pad to brace my wrist but this time, I'm trying the support that's provided with the mouse. So far it's working fine.I have purchased these since they weren't optical. I have to admit, the models before optical wore out within a year. Once Kensington replaced one and I bought two others...one a year.

It is not possible that when ever I try to move my cursor or pointer, I have to wait moving the ball until it finally decides to reaction!I am SO desapointed with this.

I have had surgery for Carpal Tunnel syndrome on both of my hands and was looking for a trackball that was smooth and prevent hand and wrist fatigue. I was willing to spend some money and excited at the prospect of this mouse. When I received it, right out of the box it felt light and cheap. Once I hooked it up the wireless aspect worked fine but the ball was not smooth at all. My hand was really fatigued after 5 minutes. I immediately boxed it up and sent it back. Note, if you are returning an item to Amazon because you don't like it, they are going to charge you for the shipping. Anyway, I am glad to be rid of that junk.

As the Microsoft trackball optical was no longer available I trawled Amazon for similar devices, after extensive research and the reviews posted I decided to go for the Kensington Expert Mouse ModelK64325, I wish I had not. It is an ergonomic disaster, no button falls easy to hand, making a smooth workflow impossible. The scroll ring quality is well below standard and the trackball unnecessarily large and heavy. The number of programmable options was nowhere near that of the Microsoft unit which enabled one of its five buttons to be programmed as a \\"back\\" button, this I found very useful. Modern plastic packaging does not make it easy to repack and return, if it did this mouse would have gone straight back."},{"rating":"1","title":"No software for MAC 9.1","review":"Nothing on Amazon's site gave system requirements of MAC 10 or later. My older Kensington Expert Mouse Pro after many years of hard use gave up the ghost, so I got the new one, it moves the curser sluggishly but all four buttons do the same thing, the scroll ring doesn't do any thing. The ball is smaller than the older one, I can't use my \\"8\\" ball. I have used a Kensington Expert Mouse for almost 20 years and have never had a complaint till now. I can get use to the sluggish and smaller ball, but I wish the software were compatible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous device","review":"Earlier reviews rated this highly for ergonomics but I found that as it's higher in front than the back you have to bend your wrist up in a very strained position. I had to make an angled tray to compensate but, as the ball is not secured, there's a risk of it falling out when properly angled to avoid wrist strain.It's software is disappointing & doesn't seem well integrated with Windows XP - unlike Logitech's Mouseware, the device only shows as a generic HID in Control Panel Mouse. Its pluses: the scroll wheel is very comfortable & having 4 buttons is good. Overall, not recommended - avoid if you have wrist problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete ripoff","review":"First of all, I would like to ask: why does this this trackball cost so much? It is manufactured in China, has a cheap-looking appearance, and it's \\"award winning\\" scoll-ring makes a horrible grinding sound.It is nice that they included a wrist support, but personally I find the incline that it forces my wrist into is almost as painful as using my mouse. (I am in the process of ditching my mouse for a trackball because of wrist/shoulder trouble) I also find the jumbo-sized ball hard on my wrist, as it too forces my wrist into an exaggerated raised position.Compared to the micro$oft trackball explorer, this thing is a real piece of junk, and it costs twice as much.

My last Kensington Trackball got lost in my last move so I tried making do with a regular mouse. I did well, but figured that maybe I am just getting slow and less coordinated in my old age. Then I realized I didn't have my old trusted trackball. I immediately bought the 'Kensington Expert Mouse Optical Trackball' and thrashed ALL of my kids and their friends at their own game!I've still got it, and so does Kensington!

I have found them to be exactly as specified by the Manufacturer and have never had trouble with them. Their ease of use is wonderful and they allow for proper control of the cursor at all times. One thing that I never found mentioned by the people that sell the trackball is that there is a ring around the ball that allows one to move the window slider up and down on the window you are in making it very easy to slide the window info on the screen as you wish during viewing. Jut place you thumb on the ring that is around the ball and move as you view. The set up for this track ball is seamless with windows 7 as well as XP and Vista. I recommend them highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, needs Vista drivers","review":"I was terribly disappointed when I tried to install this trackball on my Vista laptop.

If Kensington writes a Vista driver, I'll get another one, but until then, my hunt continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The Wireless Turbo Mouse would seem to be a good bet, however it suffers from a very poor implementation of the scrolling ring when used on the web.

I called Kennsignton in an effort to tell them my thoughts, and was listened to patiently, but it was a waste of time. The point is, this company had a lot going for it years ago, but now seems to be coasting down hill.

Once you program the four buttons and the movement rates (very easy to do) you will never go back to a regular mouse. The one drawback to this trackball is the slow response with the scroll ring. You have to move it several times to go from top to bottom of a page. It is rather jerky compared to Apple's Mighty Mouse. It will scroll only vertically. If Kensington can come out with a single button horizontal/vertical scroll on this trackball they will have the perfect mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Too much drag on the roller.

It is wonderful. I liked it so much, I recently purchased a second one to use at work on my PC.What a disappointment. The new one LOOKS like the first one I purchased, but it sure doesn't work like that one.The trackball is \\"stiff\\" - it doesn't feel like velvet under my fingertips like to older one. Maybe it just needs to be \\"broken in\\". But the scroll ring, mentioned in other reviews, is simply unacceptable. The new one feels like it has sand in it. It moves very roughly. My older model absolutely glides - like on ball bearings.If this is typical of the quality of this product, it has certainly been compromised since I purchased the original one. I don't think I can live with this. I'll probably pack it up and return it.Acco - are you listening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be amazing, but build quality now sucks","review":"I have used one of these trackballs at work for over 3 years. It's fantastic, and I finally got around to ordering one for home use. Unfortunately the one that came, while identical in appearance, feels like a cheap imitation. Amazon isn't to blame here, Kensington is. The mouse feels about 50% lighter, which is a bad thing for a track ball. The wrist attachment stubs broke within 30 seconds of putting it on. The pegs broke off inside the mouse, so now it's got these nubs on the bottom. I've already packaged it up to return to Amazon. It really sucks, because 3 years ago this mouse was AMAZING, and now it's quite clear that Kensington has cut corners, started using substandard components and made their product inferior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"Trackball users will appreciate the smooth, flowing motion this Kensington Expert Optical Trackball provides.

Believe the hype.There is one unavoidable flaw, however; the scroll wheel WILL stop working eventually. I've now had my third one fail in as many years. Fortunately, Kensington has replaced it each time. My fourth Expert Mouse is in the mail now. Kudos to Kensington for honoring their warranty so faithfully, but I have to wonder why they don't fix the underlying problem.Anyway, this is a great product which has taken me well off the path to carpal tunnel syndrome. I recommend switching hands regularly. I've written an AutoIt script (surprisingly easy to do) which quickly toggles the buttons between right and left handed configurations, and assigned the top two buttons (clicked together) to launch the script. This way, I can switch hands and have the buttons mirrored with a single click. Becoming ambidextrous with the Expert Mouse shouldn't take too long to master and is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trackball I have found","review":"A couple years ago, I bought the Wireless version of this, but it had trouble working.

I've been terribly disappointed. The new mouse is cheaply made and I know because I took it apart to try to lubricate it and make it work properly. The track ball itself is ok once you polish it with some wax. But the scroll ring is hopelessly cheap, has no bearings and is impossible to improve. It's stiff and hard to use.

I'm so used to using a trackball that I have to retrain myself when I encounter one of those little mice. The best thing is that the cursor doesn't move when you let go of the ball - mice tend to creep a bit when you nudge the left and right ears (buttons). With a trackball, everything stays-put. I call them a 'dead rat' 'cause they are like a giant mouse that has gone belly-up. Great tool for all applications, especially CAD.

No trouble with TSA, they just smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable piece of junk","review":"I can easily use either a trackball or a mouse, but prefer a trackball because I have large hands and the trackball gives me greater control and sensitivity in both my work and my personal computer usage. The Kensington USB trackball seemed ideal, as the ball is larger than usual. I used the trackball continually for a year after I bought it, being careful to clean it regularly. Today, for no apparent reason, the trackball stopped working reliably -- sometimes not working at all and sometimes giving bizarre responses to my attempted use.

So this review is from 17 years of happy use. This is just an awful and crappy cheapo product!- Every 50 clicks or so the ring moves when I click. This happens without me pushing the ring by accident. I end up clicking an inch higher or lower of the intended target. This is a showstopper by itself.- This is the first trackball that gave me pain in my hand. I think the angle is steeper. I had to get a wristband and switch with a regular mouse for a long while. Now it's just unpleasant.- The ball motion is not smooth at all like it used to be.- It feels very cheap, made of cheap plastic. It makes hollow clunky sounds, too. Both the ring and the click.- The hand rest does not fit the case so it keeps moving up and down if I lean on it higher up.- The thumb clicking button finish wore out within two weeks.Goodbye Kensington. It was a pleasure while it lasted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kensington Expert Optic Trackball","review":"I decided to give this a try based on other reviews from this site. Overall I am satisfied. I do a lot of video editing in Final Cut Pro on multiple screens, and my favorite feature is I no longer run out of mouse pad for long moves. Second best is the programmable buttons. They really save some time. The hardest part is deciding what combination you want. My only complaint was also mentioned by another review - for some reason they designed this with a tiny magnet underneath the ball inside the case. All it seems to do is make fine motion adjustments really touchy. REMOVE THE MAGNET and that \\"stickiness\\" will vanish.

I found this to be true for mine as well, so this is my second unit. I completely disassembled my old one and tried to repair it, but there was nothing obviously wrong. Tweaking components in the optical path of the scroll ring helped, but didn't get it running fully again (sigh). This new unit worked perfectly out-of-the-box. It gets good use, and it helps keep my wrist from aching (problem with regular meese), so overall, it's quite worth it (we'll see how long this one works for)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Vista Support","review":"No Vista 64 support. their website states \\"do not install software on vista operating system.\\" dont know why that say that. it works fine on vista 32 with the ability to program buttons. 64 bit vista you can use the lower 2 buttons and the scroll wheel. they are too lazy to write the 64 bit drivers. go with logitech trackballs cheaper and work with everything including Ubuntu (Linux)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"My Kensington Expert Mouse (of the previous generation) finally bit the dust and Kensington was nice enough to give me a replacement - only since they didn't make the Expert Mouse Pro (64213) anymore, they sent this one, which replaced it. I hate it. It KILLS my hand, which suffers from RSI. I had no problem with the previous version. I blame it on being optical. Sure, less moving parts, but they move so weirdly. No matter what setting I used (you can change speed, etc. with Kensington's Mouse Works software), it still was like pushing that trackball through molasses. Didn't feel responsive. Plus, they got rid of the extra 6 macro keys that were handy for launching my favorite apps. Still searching for a good trackball that won't kill my hands. Now I'm wary of all \\"optical\\" ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you have a laptop running XP","review":"The mouse was great until I took my Dell laptop out of its docking station (which of course disconnected it from the Expert Mouse). At that point I had no mouse. The Kensington driver had apparently inserted itself in a bad place in the driver stack. To add insult to injury, the mouse was also gone when I returned the system to its docking station. To add further insult, the mouse buttons were not right even after rebooting. I had to navigate with keystrokes to the Control Panel Add/Remove programs to unload the Kensington driver.Too bad.

Installing the new ball in the old unit, which still works some of the time, I observed that is works a little better in the old unit than it does in the new unit.The features on this unit are awesome and it is very easy to use.

However, about 5 years ago something bad happened. They cheapened the fit and finish of the ball and mechanisms. I purchased a couple but quickly passed them down to my kids. I ended up getting a AMicrosoft trackball that felt much better than the crap expert mice. Ok, all that buildup to state that 3 months ago I got my son the KEM 7.0 when his crap KEM gave out. Wow! The smoothness of the ball/pointer movement is excellent. The old feel of what I remember of the KEM is back! If you like trackballs, I can heartily recommend these! Oh, BTW, I just got my new KEM 7.0 a week ago. Every bit as nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to form","review":"After years of adding web buttons and other silly features, Kensington has returned to form with the new expert mouse. Integration of the scroll ring is great, and the software is still unparalleled. The mouse is supremely comfortable, both with and without the included wrist rest. The large ball allows you to change hand positions easily to prevent repetitve strain. The ball lifts out easily, which is great for cleaning (not that it needs much, being optical now) or just to play around with (I fidget a lot). Not to mention the fact that it comes with an unheard of 5 year warranty. I have had to replace 1 Kensington item under warranty before, three years into ownership, and the process was completely painless; their support is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"good hardware, bad support and software","review":"To protect my wrists after decades of keyboarding, I finally gave in a bought a Kensington Expert Mouse trackball with scroll ring and 4 buttons. I figured I could easily configure the upper two buttons for internet forward and back given the vendor's assurances of total configurabilty.Wish I'd read the forums instead of the product listing which said this is Vista compatible. IT IS NOT. Though the trackball, scroll ring and two primary buttons work quite well as a regular USB mouse device, the Kensington software installed on Vista will crash if you try to configure the buttons or access any of the advanced functions you pay so much for on this pricey mouse.Short story: If you have Vista, or plan to get Vista, avoid this product and vendor. Their short-sighted and confusing refusal to support Vista says they aren't a good future bet for hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruby Ball Issue","review":"If you clean the lint and lose one of the 3 pin-sized ruby balls, the whole unit must be replaced.

I hate wireless anything (Mouse, keyboard, etc.) because batteries hate me and die at the worst times but this is one of the last wired trackballs around. So I gave it a chance.Bad points are the ball comes out at the drop of a hat and the 3 points that the ball rotate on get clogged with dirt and you need to clean often. Luckily the ball comes out easy so it's not to bad.....Once you get used to the ball (I used to put the Logitech in my lap and put my hand on it, this is awful large for that!) and hovering your hand over it and custom set the buttons it works pretty good.WARNING! This comes with no software disk, you have to get it off the Kensington website yourself BEFORE plugging in the track ball.

The older model helped with the arm pain I was having, but I hated it because the little plastic pieces that held the little red beads that the ball glides on broke very easily, and then it was pretty difficult to move the ball. I switched to this version at work when it came out and I love it! The construction is much sturdier. The ball is much easier to move. While a lot of people seem to have angle problems, I find it's very comfortable to rest the heel of my hand on the wrist rest and use the ball, scroll ring and buttons. I bought one for home use, too, and plan to never go back to a regular mouse. It really did save my hand and arm, the pain was very bad pre-Kensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball.

I'm actually glad I had to go search for that software because it works much better.Now about the mouse:This thing is amazing. Simply the best mouse out there as I tried a few others as replacements for my Expert Mouse Pro (which is still working strong at work for 6+ years!). The scroll dial is way better than a mouse wheel and helps save my middle finger for other uses.Rub some silicone lube on the rollers and this thing screams. Much more smooth than the Expert Mouse Pro. The positioning of the ball and buttons is almost exactly the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ergonomics","review":"Great Trackball, poor design. Using the Trackball makes you bend your wrist backward too much. The top of the ball is quite a ways above the table making it awkward to use. The Trackball system is excellent. The pad supplied does not raise the wrist anywhere near the right height to use this comfortably. You need almost a 2 inch thick pad. You could raise the area in front of the Trackball a couple of inches, but the unit is expensive and that shouldn't be needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems nice but no Vista support until June","review":"I bought the expert mouse after reading several reviews. My main concern was being able to program the extra two buttons. I was very happy to see the post that Kensington had Vista drivers for this device on their website. This is not the case. the latest driver on the website is from 2006 and does not support Vista. The box the device arrived in specifically said 100% Vista compatible. I called customer support and they told me that the device was Vista compatible but they were still working on Vista compatible software, which would be available in June. Seems like it would be a nice product, but I am not happy with Kensington's marketing which I feel is dishonest. If the device is 100% Vista compatible all features of the device should work, including the ability to reprogram buttons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the Kensington Orbit!","review":"I ordered both theKensington Expert Mouse Optical USB Trackball for PC or Mac 64325andKensington K72337US Orbit Trackball with Scroll Ring for PC or Macand I will shortly be returning the expert mouse. I have trouble with my wrists and thought a trackball might help to alleviate some of the computer stress I get from working all day. The Orbit Trackball is shaped perfectly and keeps your wrist in a nice neutral position. I like its ambidextrous design so I can easily switch between my hands. While the trackball on the Orbit was sticky at first, there is no need to grease it as some of the previous reviewers suggest. I used it for about 15 minutes and now it moves quite freely.My complaint about the expert mouse is that it puts your hand in a really awkward position.

The mouse works without it but you won't be able to program the buttons.The ball is at an odd angle where my hand is constantly strained even with the wrist support.The entire mouse looks outdated, clunky and cheap in my humble opinion. It looks like a mouse you would use with Windows 98 back when it was a new OS.

The first Kensington trackball I received was defective; the scroll ring travelled very roughly, like there was sand in the bearings. After a call to Kensington customer support, where the support rep confirmed that the device shouldn't act like that, I returned it to Amazon and received a new one. Unfortunately, this device really didn't act much better. The scroll ring still operated quite roughly.

Kensington also doesn't support MouseWorks for the Mac anymore and no plans to update it for Leopard. I didn't try to install it. The lower buttons work right as a normal click and right click. The upper left button does something odd with the scrolling that I find irritating. The upper right button... well I don't know what it does.The scroll ring is very nice and it's nice not to have to clean the rollers of the old trackballs (this one uses the red IR LEDs like modern optical mice do). Beyond those two points, there's nothing nice to say here--If you're buying this expecting 1980s/1990s \\"TurboMouse\\" quality, you'll be disappointed.But if you're like me and need some varied input devices to keep your hands from aching with RSI from a single type of input device, this might be an OK purchase.

After all it looks like the old Turbo Mouse (v. 4 &5) and it does have that ingenious scroll ring. But after a few hours I packed it up and returned it.While it does look right, it doesn't feel right. The old Expert and Turbo mice had a steel ball bearing movement that felt great: smooth and steady. While the new Expert Mouse 7 may have better technology (optical tracking) it doesn't feel the same at all. Upon closer inspection you'll see plastic nubs that support the main track ball where there used to be steel rollers. While I'm not advocating that they lose the optical sensor I don't see why they couldn't have kept the steel wheels that gave the unit such great feel.That being said, it does look great and the scroll ring is also very nice.

I wish I had bought a different shape sorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid does not stay on","review":"Not sure if this is common for this toy or not, but the lid does not fit tightly. It is so loose that if you turn the toy upside-down, the lid comes off and the shapes fall out of it. And the fitting isn't tall, either, so it doesn't take much effort to dislodge the top even when it is right-side-up. Kudos for the educational value-- it's just not as durable as I need it to be for my active one-year-old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Design or Ours Came Broken","review":"We received this for my son's first birthday from someone who bought it from Amazon. The lid comes off - it does not attach on, and sits very loosely on top of the pail. My son is playing with the lid seperately from the rest of the toy.

Although he could not sort the blocks then, he started trying. It was amazing to watch him over the next year change the way he played with the toy. Initially he just played with the blocks, then threw them in the bucket, dumped them out again. He would also carry the bucket with blocks around by the handle. Later he was able to put in the round one, then another and within a short time all of them. He still likes playing with it. It was apparent that he had a sense of achievement after each new \\"accomplishment\\".

I guess its a nice size for younger ages but its just not what i wanted not a good bargen in my opinion. Expected alot better from Fisher-Price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too easy to cheat","review":"This toy would be perfect if only the lid would snap on or at least be harder to remove. First thing my kid did when I gave this to her was take the lid off and dump everything out, then proceed to chew on the lid. Which is fine for now, since she's quite not old enough to learn how to sort yet, but still every time I try to show her how, she just takes the lid off, like she's saying, \\"why would you put them in one by one through the holes, stupid, when you can just take the lid off and toss them in?\\" Have you ever been patronized by a baby? It's quite a blow to the ego. I'll still give this 4 stars, though, since she does like to play with all parts, even sometimes finding the bucket and lid more interesting than the shapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a better shape sorter - one that can't be hacked","review":"My baby can't be bothered with sorting the shapes to get the blocks in the box when all she has to do is remove the lid and throw the blocks in.

I sit with her and show her that when you put the blocks in the correct spots it disappears. Although she is stilling learning that process she does attempt to put them in the spaces-more like banging the shapes on top of the box but what are you going to get from an 8month old. Sometimes using the simple toys we had as kids is just as effective. I love it for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"The lid does not stay on very well.

He put the lid in his mouth, like kids do... and when he took it out his mouth was ABSOLUTELY COVERED with blood. Upon inspection I found a ragged sharp spot about 2\\" long along the edge of the lid. After I took the lid away, I let him play with the rest of it, after close inspection - and he likes banging the box about well enough. But that said, even if this one hadn't cut my kid, I think I would have chosen another instead of this one. There are SO MANY nicer shape sorter toys out there for not much more money, and stepping on the razor-thin edges of those plastic shapes really hurts. Next time, I'm going with a wooden model from some company known for sanding all the parts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Top doesn't stay on, useless as a sorter toy.","review":"As a sorting toy, this isn't one to get.

My son loves it and plays with it almost every day. I got it for him when he was about 14 months and he is now 21 months old. Yes, it's true the top comes off easily but if you sit and play with your child you can keep the top on and let them learn how to put the shapes in as well as teaching the names of the shapes and their colors. Now my son does the shapes by himself, but he also takes the top off, puts all kinds of toys into it and then carries it around the house with him. I think it's a very fun and versatile toy for a great low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, could use minor improvement","review":"My almost 15 month old daughter loves this toy, and has had it since she was about 10 months old. Shetakes the shapes in the bath with her, to the park with her, in the car...pretty much everywhere. She likes to hide other toys (and sometimes food) in the bin. The only thing I could find negative about it, is that the top should have some way of staying on unless you unlatch it.

When you close the top of it, it doesnt lock or anything, so when the baby is actually trying to play with it and then accidentally pushes it, it falls and everything falls out and you have to put the top again. Its so easy to take it off. So instead of trying to put the little shapes in , my baby just takes of the top (which like I said is so easy to take of, you can literally blow on it and it will come off) and GAME OVER.I wouldnt recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lid refuses to stay on therefore the toy does not work","review":"What's the point of a shape sorter if the lid will not remain in place? My daughter has zero interest because she'd rather take the lid off (and if you bump it if FALLS off)and hand it to me then play with actually putting the pieces where they go. We received this as a gift and if I could I would return it and get a similiar toy that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't the lid lock on?!","review":"So far, mostly all my 15 month old son has done with this toy is dump all the pieces out. Sometimes he puts the pieces back, but certainly not with the lid on. Why doesn't FP make it possible to lock the lid on so he can spend some time trying the different shapes holes instead of just tearing the lid off (even when I try to hold the lid on)? If the shapes are different colors, why didn't FP color coordinate the shape holes?I'm giving this product two stars because there are pairs of the different shapes and he likes to pick up the matching pairs and bang them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid won't stay on","review":"My daughter enjoyed this for the first five minutes, but once the container was full and we went to empty it, we couldn't get the lid to stay on. It will stay briefly if you lock the blue handle over it, but then kids can't see all of the shapes. There are much more fun shape sorters out there that actually work for more than a few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"We returned it...baby was bored.","review":"Originally I bought these as \\"first blocks\\" for our baby (6 mos old) but ended up returning them since they're not very fun and pretty pricey for how cheap they are. For younger babies who aren't sorting yet, I recommend getting \\"HABA First Blocks Set\\"First Blocks, a bit pricier, but very good quality (safe wood, NOT made in China). These are captivating blocks that are very imaginative. True, they don't have the sorting qualities like this toy might, but are visually stimulating and can be stacked and use to actually \\"build\\" things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, durable toy","review":"This toy is nothing more and nothing less than your typical old-school shape sorter. It's got the plastic bucket with a lid that has cut out holes in the shape of the plastic pieces that the kid it supposed to put in it. You pretty much know what to expect. I like this particular one because it's durable - we got ours second hand and it has endured a year of use so far and it still actually looks brand new. It's still a great value for the price even if you buy it new, though.At first I was kind of annoyed that the lid didn't snap on, but I eventually realized that if it did the baby would not be able to pull it off. Over all this is a good toy that every baby ought to have and that will keep a child's interest for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIlly Me","review":"This toy was actually a gift to my 18 month old twin nephews and they couldn't figure it out so they actually enjoy banging the pieces together lol.

I would recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Fun","review":"The Baby's First Blocks is a toy made by Fisher Price. It promotes hand eye coordination, sorting, color and shape recognition. The blocks came in five different shapes and colors which all come in a bucket with a shape sorter lid. The bucket also has a handle which makes it easy to carry around. Once the child is finished playing, everything can be placed inside the bucket for easy storage.

When i bought this toy he just turned 1 year so may be it was a bit early for him. However, he found lots of other ways how to play with it, including hiding blocks all over the apartment.

I was recommend this toy to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for baby's health!!!!!","review":"It's a decent toy which solves its purpose. My only complain is it's cheaply made so very light(Had this almost 10 yrs back in a round shape and was very sturdy) and also the top doesn't have any lock so my daughter continuously takes it out and tosses it. One more bad thing is there is a block of the shape '+' sign and '*', I am not sure what to tell my kid about the shape once she starts understanding. I recently discovered that this product contains 'Bromines' which can cause damage to organs such as liver, kidneys, lungs and milt and they can cause stomach and gastrointestinal malfunctioning, to read go to healthystuff.org.

Not worth the price, wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid doesn't stay on","review":"My biggest complaint about this toy is that the lid is EASILY removable. I bought this for my 6 month old and the first thing she does is takes the lid off and bangs it against the base.

The thing I hate about this product is the top will not stay on.

At first all she wanted was to take the lid off and dump the shapes out and then she would lose interest. When she was about 14 months old we started working together on identifying the shapes and I would show her how to drop them in the box. Now at 19 months she loves to sit on her own and drop in the shapes. She will take the lid off, dump the shapes, replace the lid and start over again. She can name the shapes and now we are using it to work on the colors. She will frequently ask me to play \\"blocks\\" and carry over the box. This toy is inexpensive, durable, and invaluable in my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsensical design","review":"This item can easily earn an award for the worst design. Seriously, whereas FisherPrice has many nice products, they seem to design this one without any thinking. The flaw is that the lid doesn't snap, so the child just takes the it off and plays with this sorter as with a bucket.

As a sorter, this item is completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"**Major Lid Issue**","review":"The lid does not fix to the body of the basket.

It made them so proud to hear the shape drop in! It is easier than some others we have and thus wonderful for beginners. The plastic pieces are very durable, but I gave the product four stars as the sticker on the box was partially chewed off by one of our boys. I wish it didn't come with the sticker, but I guess if this is a concern you could always scrape/tear it off before a chewer decides to do it.

The lid falls off so your kid will just take the easy route and pull the lid off to put in the blocks.

I'm offended that Fisher Price seems to think that it is okay to sell toys that contain dangerous chemicals to children. Plus, the toy isn't that great!As other reviews mentioned, the top easily pops off of the toy giving babies no incentive to use the shape sorter function of the toy.

While he's having fun with the colored shapes, he's enjoying a sense of accomplishment when successfully putting the shapes in the correct holes.He's also developing the very important eye-hand coordination skills, and problem solving skills that he'll use the rest of his life.We think that the Fisher-Price First Blocks are a good value for the money. The plastic bucket with handle is durable and should be able to endure the roughest treatment of most babies. The bright colors of bucket and blocks, as well as the glittery picture on the front of the bucket, capture Gabriel's attention.The lid fits on very loosely and comes off easily if the bucket is tipped or jarred. I think a tighter fitting lid would be an improvement.The Baby's First Blocks toy is not surprisingly made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lid doesn't snap on","review":"The purpose of this toy is defeated when our babies can easily remove the lid and put the shapes on the basket without the use of the lid.

I thought, \\"It looks to simple to be something she'd enjoy.\\" But I guess the old standards still work. I know this type of block sorter toy has been around for generations and I was pleased to find that my daughter took to playing with it right away. I was shocked that she was so interested in trying to put the correct shapes into the correct holes. She really concentrates on it. The blocks are made so little hands can easily grip them. Only complaint is the lid comes off very easily. It can easily fall off and the blocks spill out when the baby moves it around (carries it, pushes it, kicks it, etc.).Also, since the lid comes off so easily, the baby gets distracted by pulling the lid off and dumping all the blocks out, then putting them all back in without the top...when the point is to put the blocks in through the appropriate hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for a different version","review":"The top of the box doesn't secure on.

Our girl seems to like to play with the blocks alone and likes to take them out of the top. She also likes to pull the pieces out of the bucket and put them back. The top is exciting on its own too - it seems study and she doesn't try to climb it (and topple) so we're satisfied.

Sure, they don't compare with Frank Herberet's masterpiece, but then I never expected them to. On their own, the first two novels were good \\"Star Wars\\"-style space opera; however, this book was just not as good. It was almost as if the authors wanted to get the series done and over with so they could move on to other ideas. I think it also lacks in continuity between the other novels. The first two books featured the same characters and followed within several years of the Jihad timeline. This book jumps ahead several decades and introduces and entirely new cast of characters, with the exception of Vorien Atreides who survives because he received life extending treatments from his father. Near the end, the book seems rushed and falls flat.

But, a few key story elements that I had waded through two books and several years to get to, were tossed out. It was too much, just 1 example here, to bite off as forced plot elements \\"mystical\\" spring water suddenly revealing to one individual many of the key powers of the Bene Gesserit (sp). Others have mentioned the monotony of continuous repetition of the characteristics of 1-dimensional characters. One thing few have mentioned, is the senseless and frequent graphic descriptions of gore- and done so unimaginatively (how many times did the words \\"ruptured tendons\\" appear in the space of 20 pages?).Anyway, hope they didn't leave open the door for more books in the BG period, and will take some serious time in making a masterpiece out of Dune 7.

Unfortunately, it is exceedingly difficult to get through.Plot and characterization are extremely shallow. Many things are repetitious. Not only the story and explanations, but even choice of words. For instance, if you see the word javelin, you just now that it's going to be paired with balista.As it is, apart from subject-matter, to me it has very little to do with the original series. And although it was never to be expected that it would, considering the sheer genius of the original series, it could have had such better treatment than it has got here.Viewed for and by itself as a book of science ficton, it just does not come up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read the two previous (and all other Dune) books, this was disappointing. The characters were more one-dimensional than in the two previous books, the motivations simplistic, the plot less complex and more obviously contrived and directed toward the needed ending. Perhaps most symbolic, there was an unforgiveable error in the year dating the first part of the book; while it should have been printed as 107 B.G., it was written as 69 B.G. This is representative of the thin, poorly thought out nature of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dune book for Star Wars prequel fans everywhere","review":"I just finished reading this \\"Dune\\" book and I have to say I am perplexed. It was mindless entertainment, but I can't count it as good for that very reason. Dune fans have grown up with a series that is steeped in complexities and three dimmensional characters and this is the very thing that keeps us coming back to the series. The original Dune books, while entertaining, all had meaning. This book doesn't. It seems to squander all its potentiality to create real people by limiting their appearences to mere soundbites. In fact the only characters who seem to have been well developed are the robots, simply because there isn't really that much to them. Overall, if you're a Dune fan, you'l act exactly like me. You'll rush out and buy the book, excitedly start to read it-grasping for the sparks of the original series- and ultimatly walk away dissatisfied.AD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Dune prequels","review":"I liked this book best of any of the Brian Herbert prequels.

There were a couple before this that were hard to read but worse came to worse with this one and with Hunters of Dune. I simply cannot stand reading them. They are both so full of grotesque imagery, torture, etc. I am HOPING some of the following books are better because after enjoying the first ten books I purchased the entire set thinking I was going to like them all.

If I could give this series 0/5 stars I would (but can't find a way to do so).I struggled for months simply to get through this book because I thought it might reveal SOMETHING about the main power players in the classic series. Suffice to say, the explanations provided are juvenile, idiotic, and worthless.Take the money you'd spend on these books and start a small fire with it.

I still could not finish it. I made it through about 100 pages but the interaction between Ross and Tessa just didn't work for me. Ross was overbearing and cruel and he justified his behavior because it was for her safety and he had her grandfathers approval. Tessa was young but she had the right to know that she was in danger. Instead Tessa was treated like a simple minded child.I prefer romance novels where the heroines are not teenagers and the heros are not jerks.

That's the way of all followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind Panders to Mindless Readers","review":"Mindless readers are obviously what are making Goodkindso huge--people who love his trash so much that theyworship the man. _Blood of the Fold_ is hopelessly bogged down by an immature writing style that sounds stale, a predictable storyline that offers no unusual twists, and an incredibly stupid protagonist. Goodkind is falling prey to the Eddings Disease: reusing the same plot time and again. Instead of Darken Rahl, we have the Evil Emperor to fight-- how fresh and original! It was stale in Book 1, and it's rotting in Book 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfull","review":"I loved the first two books in the series, could not put them down, even though they were far longer than the Blood of the Fold, I finished them in less than three days. But while reading this book, I find myself reading one or two pages at a sitting, and even then I am skipping over whole paragraphs to get through them (it is allmost painfull to read them). I have no idea what happend Terry Goodkind while writing this, but it is no where near the quality of Wizzards first rule, and Stone of tears. I am still going to get the next books in the series and read them, as I have faith that they will prove to be as good as the first two were (God I hope I am right)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similarities to Robert Jordan","review":"Although I have enjoyed the whole series, the similarities to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series have been an irritant:Male and female magic.Venerable sorceresses pulling strings.Collars which can block magic.Lost tribe of superb fighters.Magical concept of weaving air and spirit.Dreamwalkers.An imprisoned Keeper and a Creator"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read","review":"In reading the various reviews already done on \\"Blood of the Fold\\" and the other two books in the series I was surprised to find how polarized the reviewers are. It would seem that people either really love Goodkind's work, or really hate it. I believe both camps are missing the point. These books are not the ultimate in fantasy literature, nor are they the worst things ever written. What Goodkind's books are, is an entertaining read. To give them any significance beyond this, either good or bad, misses the mark. This is entertainment, folks, not religion! As entertainment, Goodkind's books work very well. Perhaps the best recommendation comes from the people who state they didn't like \\"Blood of the Fold\\", but apparently were entertained enough by Goodkind's work to read 3 relatively long books by him"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine installment, yet didn't hit the mark","review":"I loved the book because of the story. I like the idea behind the series, and that keeps me reading. However, the authors weak style of progressing the novel, and the protagonist's semblance of a reject doesn't help. All in all, Blood of the Fold was a good novel. I await the next installment (considering Terry got paid $1 million for 4 novels) which I hope will forward the series to the \\"Armaggedon\\" style ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real pageturner!","review":"It's interesting to see the types of reviews that _Blood of the Fold_ is getting. People seem to either really love or really hate Terry's work, with very little in between. I have enjoyed his work to date, and found myself eagerly turning the pages of his latest work. I was a little concerned with the scope of the novel, given the number of plot lines he had working all at once. The relationships between plots were foreshadowed one way and resolved another, esp. with the mriswith. Terry seemed like he couldn't make up his mind whether the book was about Richard vs. the Fold or Richard vs. Jagang, or Richard vs. the Keeper. None of these plots was really fleshed out, and the whole Imperial Order and Jagang thing just dies out by the end of the novel.Overall, it kept my interest and had me riveted in spite of these objections, so I still give it a solid 8. Good work, Terry"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing addition to the Sword of Truth series","review":"This book was a certain waste of over 500 pages and hours of reading time. The second book didn't leave me wanting to read this book, and I wish I had taken the hint. The only advantage to reading this was knowing every last detail that occurs in the life of Richard Rahl. The plot was week and the subplots were uninteresting, and Goodkind really showed his weaknesses in his skill, such as superfluous description of setting, weak conversations, and bad cliches such as \\"The Dance with Death\\". Really not satisfactory. Skip right to Temple of the Winds, which is MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the beginning of the end","review":"Just pretend that this book didn't exist. Stone of Tears and Wizards First Rule remain to be my favorite books. This book introduced a new nemesis called emperor Jagang that seems to pop up as an excuse to extend this series indefinitely. No mention of him in the two pervious books except at the epilogue of Stone of Tears. The story plot also becomes a little sloppy starting with this book.If you really wanna treasure this series, don't do what I did. Stop at Stone of Tears and forget about the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Goodkind read","review":"This was my first Terry Goodkind book . . . and will be my last. I bought it at a booksale at work, always looking for something new to read- this looked interesting. I've read the Robert Jordan Wheel of Time series, and realized about 10 pages in that this storyline was similar. I enjoyed the Jordan series, so i thought, okay, this will be good. Wrong. Shallow characters, transparent plot lines . . . I'm ashamed to say that I actually finished this book. It gets 2 stars because I did finish it, but that goes more to my tenacity than to the quality of the writing or the story. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series","review":"Generally I am not one to stop and write a review of a book, but I felt the need to warn others who have limited time to invest in sci-fi series novels. I have read the first two installments of this series \\"Wizards First Rule, and Stone of Tears,\\" both excellent novels. I went ahead and bought \\"Blood of the Fold:\\" which was a great disappointment. Mr. Goodkind degenerates into endless feminist tirades that take away from the plot and spoil the book. I had been looking forward to the next two books. I would suggest readers stop after the first two. I stopped reading half way through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have nothing better to read than this was a good book","review":"This books suffers from ever flaw decribed by the other readers and then some. The thing that bugged me the most was the fact that evil charters in this book and previus two are never explained. The evil emporer simply wants to control the world, wow...thats so amazing. We have no idea why he wants to control the world or how he got in a position to do that. This book, like the rest of Goodkinds is overflowly with sex,blood and magic. None of those things are in themselves bad but when they serve no purpose there just special effects.In closeing the only reason I read this book is beacuse a friend gave it to me and I didn't have anything else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"better than the first 2 but still marginal","review":"Eh.

So I did the logical thing and bought this book. What a let down! Goodkind writes like an amateur and his protagonist, Richard fares worse. Richard behaves like a lab rat jumping impulsively at every provocation but somehow miraculously surviving every unimaginatively plotted challenge.The plot runs like a video game, one long series of inane obstacles fostered by cartoon characters and then brought to an abrupt end without a conclusion.Goodbye Mr. Goodkind.

Goodkind however takes jordans ideas and gives them a new name, or he takes one of Jordans names and gives them differnt backround.

It's just the same stuff all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty world, empty heads","review":"Terry Goodkind's \\"world\\" is just a bunch ofstuck-together cliches without a life of itsown. Some may say that Goodkind is \\"holding back\\" on world details because he is using Richard's viewpoint, but Frodo Baggins knew even less than Richard about Middle Earth at large and Tolkien's world still came alive in the first chapter of the first book. If the author truly has spent time on his world, there's just a \\"knowing\\" quality to the writing...even though there may not be a lot of details, we still feel like the author knows this place well and is taking us on a tour of it. With Goodkind, this feeling is noticably absent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money....","review":"Except for a few spare moments in the book, this was one of the worst fantasybooks I ever read.

Evil..wow what intelligence it takes towrite about that! Love at first sight..what brilliance!Sappiness and preachiness..what a stunning mind it takes to explore these things!

Intelligence is looking at the world in a different way--when goodkind's world isn't even his own, that's kinda difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, that was stupid...","review":"First, I just want to say I only read this book because my friend wanted me to, to try to convince me he's good. Well he's not. I swore off Goodkind after The Stone of Tears, and I wish I hadn't bothere to read this one. Terry Goodkind is horrible. He contradicts himself, has stupid plotpoints, some of the cheesiest dialogue I've ever heard, and rips everything off Jordan. Granted, Jordan may have pulled everything from Dune, but at least he had the entire plot in mind when he started writing. Goodkind makes it up as he goes along. That's why plot points get left out until the last possible second. PLEASE, stop reading him. That he's been published is an insult to fantasy authors everywhere. Read Robin Hobb instead. She doesn't have enough fans anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift of Backwardsness","review":"If Goodkind's novels are a gift at all, they're an invitationto go backwards in thought instead of forward. He makeshis world too simple, and this simplicity makes it boring. Pure good vs pure evil has been done, and its time has passed. Goodkind's characters always claim \\"righteousness\\" and \\"truth,\\" but this sounds like fanaticism to me; to think that anyone knows the ultimate truth about anything is to let the world know you're a fool. The books are fun-- but so is heroin. End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent book","review":"Love these stories. They are well written and also have a message.

When Richard, in the first book, was in Westland, he put his trust into \\"good spirits\\", now, after returning from his captivity everyone he knows now has the \\"creator\\" as there deity. Like Mistress Sanderholt. Also in Stone of Tears he says he has never heard of this \\"creator\\" and I got the impression Kahlan didn't either.

But I really didnt like this one, but I read on past this one because I had really liked the previous two.

Even if you didnt like this book i suggest to read on i garenty that you will be happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the Hell?","review":"I was tempted to rate this a 1, but decided that the sheer gore and brutality made _Blood of the Fold_ readable, if not overly stimulating. The running theme of these books is not truth, but is instead an oversexed fetishism that would shock and disturb veteran purveyors of hard core pornography. Incest, rape, and sexual torture seem to lurk around every corner of Goodkind's universe, reflecting dubious qualities of the author. Terry Goodkind has all the appeal of a letter-to-the-editor from a dirty magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive,.......","review":"I thought the first two books were excellent...and as a frequent reader of series books, I could not WAIT to move on to Book 3. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. All T.G. does in this book is recap the first two books and the entire history of each person, object, place, etc. EVERY TIME it is mentioned. It was so annoying that I couldn't wait to get through it. I will tell you that I only got into Book 4 about one chapter before I returned it. T.G. started the same stuff as he did in Book 3 with repeting and explaining everything. In addition, the characters in the first two books were detailed as far as we knew them intimately. The third book just showed us glimpses of each character. It was difficult to relate to any of them. Overall, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book s-u-c-k-e-d","review":"I kept reading Goodkind to see if he'dget better.

Mark Luuug Raaaach aaarg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodkind progresses nicely","review":"I was quite pleased with Terry Goodkind's latest effort; Blood of the Fold. The third book in the Sword of Truth series, Blood of the Fold shows Goodkind's development as a writer. Gone are the rough edges and occasional pointless scenes that sometimes broke the mood of the first two books. Blood of the Fold is nicely contained, all of the plot lines come together well in the end. I was somewhat disapointed that Kahlan and Zedd did not play a bigger role and the ending lacked some of the punch that it was intended to have. Too many events happening too quickly took away from the suspense of the final battle. Overall, I found Blood of the Fold to be the best of the Sword of Truth series. Goodkind's world is richly detailed and I could easily lose myself in it. If his progress as a writer continues, the Temple of the Winds should be well worth reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"A grand tale from the mind of a genius.","review":"I have read the three books that Goodkind has written and theyjust keep getting better and better. The way he writes has a mindgrabbing persuasion that makes putting the book down almost impossible. The characters have true feelings and characteristics that I find hard to find in other authors. His writing makes it seem like the tale is actually true and not just a fantasy. Goodkind is at the top of the list in his writing genre. The only reason I did not rate him and his books a 10 was because true perfection is impossible. He does come close though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put them down","review":"I find I have become completely involved with the characters.

I really didn't like the first two books, but I have to admit, that this one was somewhat better written. The action is a little better here. but the love theme is getting a bit worn out at this point. This book moves better than the first two, but that's not saying much. I give this 2 1/2 stars, but would have given it 3 except that parts of the ending are so contrived and rushed that its as if the author had had enough of writing and just wanted to tie things up. Since all of the loose ends were neatly and quickly tied in the last couple pages, I'm taking this time to bow out of this series. I've had enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change of readers is grossly unfair!!!","review":"Dick Hill has read all the other SOT books, so I was eagerly awaiting this one to come out on unabridged tape (although I have read the book and enjoyed it immensely). Buck Schriner is a good reader, but no one approaches Hill. For reviewers who complained about the repeated mention of Richard being the \\"bringer of death\\", you should have listened to Hill's readings. Every time he says this, it's like listening to ghost stories around a camp fire. SPOOKY!!!

Surprised, you attempt to vacate the bed. A woman's arm emerges from the turtle's mouth and pins you to the mattress.

I mean sure we had started to hear about the imperial order but no emperor was involved at first.now he shows up and takes control I mean where did he come from why does he want to rule the world.

Characters are either weeping or jumping for joy,are either intelligently saving themselves orstupidly falling into the latest trap in orderto advance the plot.Mr. Goodkind should try to make use of subtlety and a real range of character types in his writing. In trying to avoid the constant barrage of extremes, he woulddo well to remember, as Anthony Lane of the New Yorker wrote, that there is nothing so boringas being excited all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Terry ever have an original thought?","review":"With Wizard's First Rule Goodkind had a little promise. It was not realized in the sequel and it is all but gone in this, the third installment. The theme of rape running through all three novels is also quite disturbing, with the exception of the female lead, every woman in the novels has been in the past, or is presently being raped. It's a very powerful emotional device to throw around so casually. But this is all moot, the plot is trivial - stealing pieces from Jordan and Eddings - the characters are morons and worst of all Goodkind has lost all hope of ever growing as an author. Too many fans (aka book-buyers) are more than happy to read this recycled trash.

There is more action and less talk. In his second book in the series, there was about four hundred pages of too much talk. Here, there is more and better action. His ideas are inventive and I like the twists in the plot. My only complaint that holds through the entire series is that his dialogue is too modern and often trite; it is like listening to characters in a TV soap opera talk. Other authors (such as Robert Jordan) are much more convincing in adopting a style of speaking that fits the genre and the characters. Overall, a nice effort for fantasy fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Adie still could see in Rada'Han?","review":"Adie was blind and couldn't use her eyes, she acquired her vision using her gift.

The second book of the series was just as good as the first one. Blood of the Fold is the third book in the series and it too delivers the amazing detail and imagination that can only be produced by Terry Goodkind. At this moment I have only completed half of the third part, but I can not wait to read this book everynight before I sleep. If you are planning to get this book make sure you read the first and second one first, because the character development in this series is amazing. You can not fully appreciate the book unless you have had time to familiarize yourself with the characters. Join the Sword of Truth Club!!!

Good ones..When I first picked up his first book, it didn't seem too bad at all..His descent started in the second book. It lacks originalty, taken from Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Once started, this guy doesn't seem to stop. He writes like this is supposed to be some cartoon romance novel for 12 year olds. The blood of the fold, sisters of light,dark etc... All of Jordan's original works, trashed by plagiarism, a stupid plot, and stupid names.. And the theme of rape if also starting to get old.. Time after time.. I buy his books because TOR makes nice covers and it looks good on my bookcase.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I would normally give a book such as this a rating of 3 but due to Goodkind's previous work this is pale in comparison. The first two books were well done and captured my attention and my time until the very end. The only reason I actually finished reading this one was because it was so short and I am hoping the 4th book will be better. Goodkind spends half the time reminding us of things we already knew from reading the first two books, if somebody is new to the series they might want to think about starting at book one, I for one don't want half the book to remind me of things I already knew. I hope his next book doesn't dissapoint or I will be done with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say this, but this book is terrible.","review":"The first book was one of the best I have ever read.

I cannot believe it is even the same author. I truly hate to give bad reviews on someone's work, but this book is bad. Please do not put yourself through the torment.

The internal menu can be adjusted to quite a few settings and the t.v. has four pre-set modes for certin things like movies or sports. Although its sound settings can be adjusted. I recomend playing movies and such through your home theater. I have digital cable and the picture is just so clear I really cant belive it. The remote is just a standard deal it controls two other devices. The design of the screen gives you the feeling that the screen is flat, especially when viewing staight on. Quite a nice analog set.

I admit to having only listened to it for few minutes before giving up, but what a mess of an effort. I am sure that when this was originally broadcast there must have been a narrator. Here it is merely a series of voices and it makes things very difficult indeed. There are also some rather rural accents featured on this recording, making it extremely difficult for an American to follow. This is a well-intended, but ultimately a mess of an attempt to render one of the novels of Dickens into drama. The whole thing seems like someone brought a tape recorder down to the pub on a Friday night and hoped for magic to take place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your first Dickens","review":"There are many pages in this book that are still alive, but here is a novel that, I'm afraid, would tend to confirm the suspicions of some readers who haven't read Dickens yet -- that he's wordy. This gets two stars, but that's because this book is being compared to other novels by Dickens. If it were by some Victorian unknown, we'd be whooping about a rediscovered goodie! Mostly I enjoyed it, but I doubt very much I'll ever read the first 200 pages or so word-for-word. I should note that I didn't read an edition that had the Penguin editorial notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barnaby Rudge","review":"Barnaby Rudge is completely unlike all the other Dickens I've read, and that's why I think I didn't enjoy it quite as much - it somehow lacks that quintessential Dickensian quality.My chief grievance was the pacing - the first half of the book was meticulous development of the its myriad characters, and a little slow. Speaking of which, there were entirely too many villains, and they got a bit difficult to keep straight!That being said, when the book did pick up, I found it very difficult to put down. Dickens develops this terrifying, fixating painting of mob mentality. The fire, the attacks on the prison are truly gripping. I just wish we could have gotten to the interesting parts a bit sooner. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 3","review":"Season 3 is wonderful except I have noticed 2 things. On the first episode, it fades to black after Anthony says \\"Bon Voyage\\" and then fades back in on the shot of the condo. If i remember correctly, it didn't fade out when I saw it on TV. Also when Bill is at his bachelor party in the episode \\"Come on and Marry Me Bill\\", Prince should be playing in the background with the stripper but for some reason, there is this guitar music that doesn't make sense at all.Does anyone else notice these 2 things?please let me knowthanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Designing Women 3rd Season","review":"I bought several seasons on Designing Women and at least one disk in each of the boxed sets had issues, either it would skip or some of the episodes wouldn't play at all.

This story was horrible and should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of all Thomas Covenant books.","review":"Covenant finally shoulders the responsibility for The Land's survival and sheds the anti-hero persona that we found irritating. He is a hero in every sense of the word starting in The Wounded Land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Trip","review":"I picked up this book, after having read the 1st trilogy about 8 years ago, and thought it might be fun to revisit this world. However, I put it down with only 50 pages to go, because I plain didn't care what happened. I remember the 1st trilogy fondly, but was sorely disappointed by this. Here's why: 1. Thomas Covenent spends most of the book either unconscious, too weak to barely function, or wracked with guilt to be an effective hero. He becomes whiney, TOO human and a drain to read. 2. I felt that Donaldson was very uncreative in names, etc: \\"the Land,\\" \\"Lord Foul\\" (he's bad) the \\"Sunbane\\" and its creatures- Clamor, Din, etc. 3. Many, many anticlimactic moments, re: the \\"grim that will rend our very souls\\" which turned out to be nothing more than black snowflakes that burst into small flames and that the characters easily dodged.Do yourself a favor: skip this and reread Tolkien."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's another word for Thesaurus?","review":"Apparently Donaldson made an important discovery between the writing of his first and second Thomas Covenant trilogies: The existence of Roget's. I consider myself of at least average intelligence, but Donaldson managed to use a staggering number of obscure words whose meaning I either had to look up in the dictionary, guess at, or ignore. Far from adding to the book, his style comes across as affected - a criticism I wouldn't have applied to the first trilogy.Technique aside, the plot of this book simply couldn't hold my attention. The ingredients were there--a vastly different Land, an impossible voyage, so-called wild magic, even a love interest--but they seem to be nothing more than a re-hash of the previous trilogy. It's unusual for me to say this, but once having started this new series, I do not believe I'll read the next volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I want to start by saying i enjoyed these books tremendously, i felt it was well written well described and detailed. But as luck would have it i found the last book to be most upsetting. I mean you go through the whole series of books learning to respect the main character Thomas Covenant and see the main battles he confronts ,personnel conflicks within himself, and it is all summarised by anew character. Not. I feel as through ive been ripped off. I think the author is a great story teller, but why did he go this way, you are led to believe through the battles he fought ,the self denials, that he would finnally get it he was the one, not some newcomer a doctor. I see where the author was going but a doctor, anew character. No. I really believe he should have lived through the final battle with the doctor in tow, to maybe show him the way to self acceptance i dont know but i read all the books and was gravely dissapointed, he should have won over evil not a doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality Reading","review":"Even if you liked the first trilogy, this one is nearly impossible to get through. It's quite obvious that he makes it up as he goes, and that's fine, but he didn't go back and smooth it out afterwards. It's almost as if he published his first draft. And he cheats, too. If you do read it, watch out for the chapter \\"blood speed\\" and you'll know what I mean. And his vocabulary is absolutely ridiculous. And it's long and boooring. Don't read it. I think Donaldson had let his success get to his head when he wrote these."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling story -- Read it.","review":"I read Slan when I was a teenager back in the 80's. Back when I read about three SciFi books every week. Slan is one of the few that really left a lasting impression. The theme of \\"mutant\\" and \\"outcast\\" is definitely one of my favorites, but there are precious few books that do it any kind of justice. (In most treatments, the theme just becomes a pretense for comic book heroism or kinky sex.) Slan is one of the few that succeeds in really exploring the issue, including the imperative to find others of one's own kind, a concern that we can surely all sympathize with. It's definitely worth reading.In the same genre, I would also recommend \\"Psion,\\" and my personal favorite from the juvenile section, \\"The Girl with Silver Eyes,\\" a real masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slan","review":"I heard that this book was a classic science fiction tale so I decided to give it a try.

A style led by John w.Campbell , and writers like Asimov , Clarck and Heinlin. Those people decided for you what sci-fi should be. Generally , they were right , most of the writers at that time had lower standards for sci-fi stories.But not Van Vogt. Allthough his style is'nt compatible with \\"Campbellian\\" standards , his writing has a different magic. Enormous scope , fantastic imagination , and very special lead charecters , are only part of something that I cannot put into words , and flows free in his works.You should not judge \\"Slan\\" by today's standards , instead , give it a chance and enjoy the magic of the early style science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays with you long after the last page is turned.","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me and I have booted it to my \\"favorite\\" list.

The story of a boy who is struggling in a world full of preconceptions, this book is great lesson to how suseptible our race is to taking rumor as fact and how we can be so quick to jugde.

So essentially, what you're doing is drawing your own conclusions about yourself (which I guess could be a good thing if you've never thought about your personality etc). No wonder they don't want you to give it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals your inner self","review":"An interesting way to reveal your inner strengths AND insecurities.

I've used it for small parties, campfire conversation, and first dates. Kids can even play it. I can't go into more detail without giving it away, but it is worth more than the jacket price.

The first track Metallic Blue is used for House of Lords track and Dr. Love is used for Double Eclipse a master piece album by Hardline in early 90s.Whichever album you start you will end up buying both because both albums are of decade best quality.If you like guitar-driven rock such as Night Ranger or Survivor you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Record!","review":"This is a great record from start to finish.Unlike some of their earlier stuff which can be a bit grating on the ears Ende Neu is both accessible and experimental.

Not even close to the quality of his other recordings. If you haven't discovered Burton and are somehow reading this, check out 'Green Cheese', if you can find it, or the 'One Man's Trash' compilation. Old fashioned rock n'roll, with a dash of country and a big dose of humor. Anybody who can write the line 'I'm lookin for a girl looking for a guy who's sadder but wiser' has something going, but then he rhymes it with 'Orel Hershiser.' True genius.

The start button was stuck up inside after few months and I was never able to stop the device again unless i put some small pin to push it up.Overall, cheap product.

I also purchased thier universal remote and it stopped working after sometime.Logitech, a very less reliable brand! stay away from thier products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant...","review":"I had purchased this product a while back and finally got around to setting this up. The set-up is a breeze, the only thing to remember is to press the small button on the transmitter and receiver till the light glows blue on both and that is that. After that, you can connect the receiver to any headphone jack and you can stream music. I have tried it with my Archos, iPod and currently I am streaming music from my laptop - the sound quality is brilliant. Initially, I had connected it to the Phono input on my receiver and the results were disappointing, but once I connected it to another input, the change was dramatic.

When it worked, it was great, but not a single song went by without the dead air problem for 3-4 seconds then it would reconnect and start playing again. I contacted Logitech customer support and they sent me an email 3 days later with suggetions about a completely different product. Then I called long distance to them and stayed on hold for 14 minutes only to be told that it sounded like it was defective and I should return it. Not very satisfying customer service experience; I had high hopes for this product; I may order another one later and see if my luck is any better then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech wireless system for iPod works great","review":"I use it in my bedroom to connect my iPod to my Bose Wave Radio/CD. I keep the iPod on my nightstand and the bose is located across the room (about 15 feet). The bed is between the units, so they do not have line-of-sight connectivity. The wireless bluetooth transmitter is able to locate the unit without issue and trasmits music clearly. This is very convenient since I can now control my iPod at night to listen to music without having to get up to change tracks, etc. I set both the iPod and Bose radio to go to sleep automatically after 90 minutes. The logitech detects when the iPod is off and shuts itself off after a few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music about wildlands and walking through them","review":"Great album, perhaps one of Jim's best. From \\"Wild Wind\\" and \\"The Old Man From the Mountain\\" with their wildlife conservation messages to the funny, but thought provoking, \\"Food Chain Song\\" this album has something for everyone. \\"Thinkin' Like A Mountain\\" and \\"Morning In The Mountains\\" make you want to throw a pack on your back and get out to enjoy the wildlands. Also, noteworthy is \\"Searchin' for the Road Not Taken\\" which is a tribute to Frost's poetry as well as a reflection on the effect that wild places have on one's soul. A truly wonderful CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"If I could play bass like that I'd...\\"","review":"Tom Jenkinson's WARP full length follow up to 'Feed Me Weird Things' turns up the jazz elements of the earlier albums while retaining the insane drill'n'bass rhythms but dropping some of the more experimental (and possibly obnoxious elements of 'Feed Me...'). This makes for an album that is a more consistant listen, and though it doesn't reach the lows of obnoxiousness that 'Feed Me Weird Things' occassionally hit it also doesn't have the same level of brilliant highs from the earlier record. But that's like complaining about the difference in color of two faberge eggs. No matter how you cut it 'Hard Normal Daddy' is still brilliant, and a great album for anyone who is into d'n'b, idm, or good off-the-beaten-path jazz. And, his patent live electric bass is still present on this record. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Relaxing","review":"I was expecting a drum and bass album but the artist incorporates jazz beats and sounds as well and does it fournately well.

Tom Jenkinson, a.k.a. \\"Squarepusher,\\" has the innate ability to create music that sounds erratic and frenetic, yet comes together in the end. The result is the forming of complex streams of rhythm and sonic rhyme, expanding well beyond the genre of \\"techno\\" into which the music of Squarepusher is pigeonholed. Though anything but mainstream, Squarepusher and the release \\"Hard Normal Daddy,\\" appeals to all of my frinds who are willing to slightly diverge from the norm. The release \\"Hard Normal Daddy\\" provides the listener with all that is irresistably abstract about Squarepusher. This could range from interwoven primitive beats that seem to communicate more than simply play, to melodic grooves straight from the mother ship. Sounding more similar to \\"Big Loada\\" than Squarepusher's \\"Music is rotted one note\\" or \\"Budakhan Mindphone,\\" \\"Hard Normal Daddy\\" proves to be an enduring, exciting, and rare type of recording in the realm of electronica."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top ten electronic albums","review":"This album is superb.

I'd have to say that \\"Genesis\\" falls, with a thud, to the bottom of the list. To be sure, Crace's writing skill is on display here; the guy can write. But, he decided on a cast of characters who were, by and large, neither likable nor interesting. As sometimes happens, it was possible to discern an interesting story at the heart of this novel, but the story was populated by largely shallow and vapid characters.To get a true sense of what Crace is capable of, I'd suggest \\"Being Dead\\", \\"Signals of Distress\\", and \\"The Pesthouse\\" as starting points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Interesting","review":"I had not read the author before this volumn, but did find Genesis quite interesting, held my attention throughout.

Yet I found this book almost completely inaccessible due to the author's inability to portray even the simplest of material in a clear and useful way.This book is abyssmal. The writing is poor, although I suspect that this might be due to poor translation. Worse, the figures are hopelessly confusing and unhelpful. Many of the graphs lack units or labels on the axis.

Unfortunately to all rules, there must be an exception. I picked up the book thinking that Will would be able to answer questions about the game and it's inner workings. How very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had I only known. . .","review":"As a rule, I find most of Mr. Will's writings to be interesting; even insightful. . . Unfortunately to all rules, there must be an exception.I picked up the book thinking that Will would be able to answer questions about the game and it's inner workings. How very disappointing.I was unaware that baseball could be made less interesting than it already is."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Will can't write!","review":"The book does provide some very interesting stories and the premise of the book is a good one, but George Will somehow manages to mess it up. I found the book to be very incoherent, jumping from one thing to the next with little, if any, transition. The book has everything, except good writing. I never thought I would say that about George Will, but it is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowery Prose Masks Fundamental Flaw","review":"George F. Will is better than just about any other author I know in using flowery prose to mask what I consider to be his biggest problem; namely, his failure to communicate with readers and hold their interest.Instead of being the insightful and introspective look into the game of baseball its author hoped for, it comes across as pretentious and muddled. While I love baseball, I found this book to be inane and boring.As far as I'm concerned, \\"Men at Work\\" represents Will's swing at a 3-2 outside pitch. I hope he never writes a book about golf. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated...","review":"Should be RE-titled \\"Men At Work: In The Late 80's\\" There are some interesting tidbits but overall this book has not aged well. About as useful as an outdated textbook. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Behavior Ecology in Clovis","review":"This book was a thoughtful reinterpretation of the existing data pertaining to the nature of Clovis lifeways and settlement in the New World. Rather than concerning himself with the nature or timing of the first Americans, Haynes introduces an ecological perspective to the study of Clovis, a population movement model in which adopting a very specialized adaptive strategy would enable a 'fugitive' culture such as Clovis to spread rapidly throughout the New World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack of the establishment","review":"The info and analysis on the Clovis period is pretty good. However, the emphasis on the \\"authoritative\\" position that the Clovis people were the first settlers in the face of a tremendous quantity of mounting evidence that Homo sap. settled North and South America at least 20,000 years before Clovis, greatly detracts from the value of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Early Settlement of No. America","review":"a lifeless story ... a chore to wade through ...

There are others on the market that do a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children can write better books.","review":"The idea behind this book is wonderful--giving books to children that they can read. The low quality illustrations and text, however, tend to 'turn off' the reader. I used these mini books for several of my groups, but quickly stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blackline masters","review":"I lost this book and I am sad! There are a lot of great books to copy and send home here. They are easy to put together as long as you pay attention when you are copying and stapling them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh! What a lousy book!","review":"This book is so unfunny, so corny, so stupid.I am sorry for not mustering up more intelligent words but this book doesn't deserve an intelligent review. I am only writing this to warn others not to waste their money. The jokes are so not funny. I mean, not funny at all! Sometimes you can't even tell what the punch line is. And lest you say that it is a cultural thing and I am missing the nuances of Jewish humor, I will just mention that I am fluent in Yiddish and grew up around Jewish humor my whole life.One more thing... it is a CRIME to call this an encyclopedia. There is nothing encyclopedic about it. It's not organized as a reference book. It's ridiculous to call this an encyclopedia. Whatever... I am wasting too much time on this review already. Don't buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Behavior and the Social Environment: Shifting Paradigms in Essential Knowledge for Social Work","review":"The book was out of stock and communication was good giving a new date for delivery. The book came faster than expected for the new date. Book was new and arrived fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talking in Circles","review":"This book is as clear as mud. I read this book to better understand alternative paradigms that are all too often missing from others on this subject. Unfortunately, the author focused more on including everyone's perspective than making any idea clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst text I had in my entire BSW program","review":"This book was extremely difficult to understand. Full of big complicated terms that could have been said in simply easy to understand words. If all my texts had been like this, I'd never have made it through school. Not at all appropriate for undergrad work. It's the only text I sold back, and was glad to get rid of it. A total waste of money. I had to buy another HBSE book just to figure out what this one was trying to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money-rent it","review":"I had to purchase this book for my MSW program. Unfortunately, since the book was just released this year, there were no \\"used\\" copies available. This book is AWFUL!! By far the worst textbook I have ever had the misfortune of owning. It's so bad I can't even force myself to read it. Schriver (repeatedly) talks about the origins of words [who cares] and lists 3-4 definitions for each one. \\"Smith says it's this.... whereas Jones defines it as...\\" and so on. Pick one already! Rent it if you can. Not worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be improved considerably","review":"Schriver's is a text whose reach exceeds its grasp. The theoretical premise and the structure for the text are good. Schriver argues that there are biases in traditional approaches to various systems and that alternative paradigms exist. However, the writing is often dense. The classification of some theories as \\"traditional\\" vs \\"alternative\\" can be disputed. Many theories seem to have characteristics of both. On a positive note, many of the readings included in the text are very interesting.As a faculty member who has used the book in a BSW course, I find that I need to guide students through this text. I distribute a guide to each chapter. Essentially I \\"translate\\" Schriver with more concrete examples. Other texts I have use require fewer translations. Schriver's focus is perhaps too sophisticated for the average undergraduate."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRY","review":"I find this text to be extremely dry reading.... I usually enjoy my SW texts... but not this one! I kind of wish the institution would consider using a different textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment, too much advertising","review":"While I'm not necessarily sorry I bought this book, it is disappointing in many ways. It is poorly organized, carries a lot of hash from previous editions that's poorly integrated with the new material, and worst of all the tutorials require you to buy models from a third party vendor, rather than being supplied on the CD as the promotional copy leads one to believe. By the time I finished it, I felt like model supplier Zygote should have subsidized the healthy price tag, given the books total reliance on their expensive models. To make matters even worse, the included CD is poorly matched with the book, and doesn't contain what the books says it does. There aren't many alternatives to this book for the poser student, but ... I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Awful! Awk!","review":"This is the first computer book I regret buying. It is the most useless use of paper I have ever seen. The author has no teaching ability and no skills at Poser. I had some prior experience using poser, and was hoping this book would fill-in the holes for me. Unfortunately, this \\"guide\\" creates far more questions than it answers. Mortimer merely instructs the user to play with the knobs until something utterly useless, and ugly has been created. Anyone with a moderate amount of computer experience doesn't need this, and anyone new to computers is far more likely to be scared by Mortimer's art than learn anything from it.I burnt my copy of this book camping, and no it isn't even very good at starting a camp fire. Crumpled newspaper works much better. And reading random bits of crumpled newspaper is far more likely to improve your Poser skills than this pile of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage...","review":"This book is a complete waste of money. Having owned Poser since version 1, I was looking for this book to contain in-depth data on advanced topics such as: Morph Targets, Textures, Grouping, etc...Well forget about it. This book breezes over these topics in a paragraph or two.Instead, the reader is treated to entire chapters on \\"wacky animal creations\\" or, as a previous reviewer wrote, turning the dials to make useless distortions.Please, until there is a writer who is intelligent and serious about the software, don't waste your money on this book and go online to get better information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The book is awful! The artwork is hideous, and the \\"lessons\\" are useless. Mr. Shamms Mortier is a con-artist, and every book he has written is scam. If you don't believe me, take a look at the reviews of other books he has written; he's left a trail of destruction behind him on Amazon. Thank goodness for free speech!Mortier's use of English in this book is extremely poor. His understanding of the Poser is extremely poor, and his understanding of how to teach is also extremely poor. What I can't understand is why any sane publisher would allow this man to write books. Poser 4 Handbook is basically a republishing of the online material, only more confusing (Shamms can't even plaguerize well). To anyone who wants to learn Poser 4, just read the online documentation for now, and maybe someday there will be a more useful book on Poser available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing!","review":"What is so amazing, well it's obviously not the book according to the one star I gave it. What is amazing is that Shamms is able to write one low quality book after another and still get publishers and people to buy his books. Some how he has been able to get away with writing over 20 different books with only the most basic knowledge and very brief experience of the programs. I would like to know how he pulls it off, I mean if he can write a book on Poser then I should easily be able to write a book on well, anything I know nothing about and still make money off it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"This book is filled with the childish scribblings of a total poser novice whose idea of testing the program was twiddling the knobs. Why anyone would buy a book that tells them to do something they probably already did before they bought the book is totally beyond me.My advice : go buy Richard Schrand's far superior book (Poser 4 Pro Pack f/x & Design) at least with that book you'll learn something, I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PRoduct","review":"This is a great product and its worth the money. Its a great muscle recover and helps take in protein and vitamins better. All twinlab products are good. Take this with the twinlab 100% whey protein, and also a multivitamin.Also I find all twinlab products and very affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus features alone make it a good value.","review":"When the original broadcast of the bonus feature \\"Mars and Beyond\\" was aired on ABC in 1957, Sputnik was the first man made satellite. Televisions were black and white, had 12 possible channels, and no solid state components. Yet there it was, a vision of a Mars landing vehicle almost identical to what became the Apollo lunar lander when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon.In this same 1957 Disney feature, we learn why space exploration is important - \\"over population and the consumption of Earth's limited resources\\" make expansion beyond our planet a necessity.As a lesson in our capacity to imagine and create, and as a lesson in our ability to ignore unpleasant facts, this Disney show is a must see.Roving Mars itself is an enjoyable documentary. Ponder a bit on what humans are capable of. Find reason to be optimistic that we can solve incredible challenges if we put our minds to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roving Mars","review":"The title of this DVD is a bit misleading. I was expecting to see actual images of Mars as seen from the Mar's rovers. Granted a few actual images were displayed but nothing that couldn't be obtained on the net.The dvd largely concentrates on the planning of the rovers up to launch. Animation then takes over with the landing of the rovers and exploration of the surface.Non the less the Dvd is enjoyable with great attention paid to the accuracy of the animation. Obviously it could not be expected to see the actual landing and deployment of the rovers if it weren't by animation.If you are wanting to see real images of the Mars surface forget this DVd and wait until a Dvd comes out that does show the real images obtained from the rovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"I bought this documentary thinking I was going to see images and footage of Mars from the two rovers during their explorations...however...99% of this documentary is COMPUTER ANIMATION! So very little of this \\"documentary\\" is actual images and footage from the rovers I can only say one thing. This documentary is PATHETIC! It runs slightly less than 40 minutes! If you followed the stories of Spirit and Opportunity in the news...then you've already seen more rover images from that source than what you will see in this documentary. AN EXTREMELY HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting","review":"There is less information in this presentation than the average Nova program. Even the Nasa Youtube videos can give a better science than this whole dvd. I expected a lot more from the people of JPL and Nasa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inspirational space exploration documentary","review":"Great documentary for those looking for inspiration in technical and even artistic fields. Great CGI and commentary, good bonus films. Somewhat short but full of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Costly For Such A Short","review":"All the Imax films are great as are quite a few independents, documentary's etc but for a 40min film it should be like $12.95, I don't care if its bluray or not. Blu ray better get their pricing structure in order or they'll never dominate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent It First","review":"First of all I was disappointed not by the fact that there was very little scientific information like one of the reviewers but by the fact that there is almost no actual Mars footage! My guess is 60 percent is about the troubles of building the rovers, and then perhaps 35 percent is CG images of the rover landing on Mars, coming up to a rock, etc, and maybe only 5 minutes of this film (if that) actually contains any actual footage of the planet itself -- the real reason I wanted to watch this film! The movie that I would love to see is one without any narrator, but with just images capturing the sublime grandeur of space (in this case Mars) paired of with some kind of subtle music by someone like Brian Eno.That said, the CG images were nicely done, and some of the scenes of them building the rovers were interesting. My final advice, rent it first (I did) before you decide if you really want to buy it. I'm going to save my money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"connections between languages makes them easier to learn","review":"This book contains a lot of information on the ways european languages are connected, and how to use this to your advantage when learning other languages. The prejudices of the author show through fairly strongly, however, and the book contains a lot of outdated judgements of one language over another. The book contains some outdated information, and his reviews of Esperanto contain some easily verifiable errors of fact. The word lists in the back of the book are helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"a great book for anyone who wants to learn new languages. a classic book that has been around for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Dayton, it's a New Air system.","review":"The system for sale is NOT a Dayton system.

New Air purposefully gave their heater the same model number just so they can try and pawn it off as a Dayton for a lower price.A Dayton will have a large red sticker on the front saying Dayton.

If I had but known the problems it would cause, I would not have installed it. I cannot write to my CD drive now, and after having called Maxis, they make it sound as if I am the only person experiencing this.

The three destinations have different things to do in each. I like the option to buy a vacation home (I still have to find Bigfoot or to learn the Sea Chanty).

The computer ceased being able to boot and required a complete re-installation of the operating system, programs and personal data. I think the sims games are wonderfully creative but most of the titles and expansions are a royal pain in the rear to install with various incompatablities and problems.

Wm. Shakespeare, an enterprising businessmen of the stage, hired the multitudinous young genius Chr. Marlowe to translate these works into English. By some shady strategm, public knowledge of this work of antiquarian scholarship was prevented from transpiring to the ears of the public and posterity.

It opened on Broadway to mixed reviews but lasted 6 months due to the fact that only one other hit musical appeared that season (GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES.) Decca's 10-inch LP covered eight key songs from the mostly forgettable score. The record soon went out of print and by the 1970s was commanding $200 a copy or more. So this might be worth picking up as an \\"investment.\\"The CD is paired with the short selection of songs Johnny Mercer and Gene DePaul wrote for a 1956 movie musical YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT. This was a musical remake of the 1934 oscar winner IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT with Junbe Allyson as the runaway heiress and Jack Lemmon as the reporter.

My skin was noticeably red in the mirror. It used to smell wonderful, like roses, and was soothing and made my skin look firm from the collagen. I called Aubrey about this and they told me the different scent was due to lavender oil they needed to add to denature the alcohol. Why so much alcohol? It causes burning sensation.

Some other nice things: you see it twice in a row, so 1st time you see what happens and go \\"wow\\", 2nd time you can really watch for the critical error. And the DVD is divided into gi and no gi sections.

I found it fun to compare with my own experiences, working in a department store in the early 1980s while putting myself through secretarial school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here Come the Brides","review":"I first read Here Come the Brides in the late 1960's, so this was a re-read for me. It's a fun book, very fast paced and well written. The author is an English gentleman, writing in the first person as an American woman in her 20's living in mid-1960's NYC, working in the bridal department of a large NYC department store. The author makes a few mistakes as to how American women of that time period dressed and talked. For instance, most American women in the mid-1960's didn't wear hats and gloves to work, and on their days off they certainly didn't dress up in a suit and \\"brogues\\" to take a walk and visit a museum. Most young American women, both then and now, have never even heard of \\"brogues\\". They are heavy walking shoes, and no American girl would be caught dead wearing them with a suit. But this doesn't mar the writer's writing skllls and good sense of humor. The book is fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flunk - For Sleepyheads Only","review":"Oh dear. Usually the Norwegian label Beatservice has good bands, but Flunk and their debut American release on Guidance, For Sleepyheads Only, don't quite make the cut. Their cover of New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\" feels lackluster, the female vocals wavy and weak. The male vocals on \\"Miss World\\" don't offer much of an improvement. Although \\"See Through You\\" matches the vocals to the music better, the instrumentals, like \\"Sunday People (Don't Bang the Drum)\\" are stronger -- but not by much. The album as a whole suffers from watered-down trip-hop syndrome. It might be pleasant to listen to overall, it really doesn't make any impression whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing end.","review":"What a disappointment. Domino sounds bland, boring and depressing. This from a band that brought such colour to the music scene from the late 70s right through to the superb Ridiculous in 1995. Apart from the odd exception like \\"In the Morning\\", this album sounds like a group that has lost the the ability to craft a great song.Play, Some Fantastic Place and Ridiculous were three of the best albums of the 90s by any group. Domino is very poor by comparison, and its lack of quality reflected the fact the group was falling apart by this stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"Hans Hofmann's biography is very colorful. And his essay \\"Search for the Real\\" was a good read for any artist. Even if you don't really understand it or agree with his ideas, the descriptions of plasticity and push/pull are very enlightening. I'm sure he was an amazing teacher. This book is a good read for any artist, as well as for people who do not make art (to get a better understanding of the mind of the artist). This book was great! I recommend Kandinsky's \\"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\\" as a wonderful companion to this book.

Although the book is structured as a history of ideas, there's an autobiography being told, too, about a precocious, sensitive kid fleeing grad school to Hawaii (just as I did) only to return years later \\"to finish the PhD thesis I never wrote\\". Along the way, you'd find many great books and films you may never have heard of."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to do with this book?","review":"I may be hopelessly low-brow, but I really don't know what to make of this book. At the end of Chapter 1, the author writes:\\"But caveat lector, those in the know view the process as irreversible. What come out of the hole, the hole of this book that you must crawl into, will not be the same as what went in\\". I have read all the way to Chapter 9, and I still don't get it. I may be dense, but aside from some interesting ideas, I see no hermetic initiation or anything justifying the self-serving paragraph I quoted above. In any case, I certainly was expecting at least an intellectual experience worth remembering. I feel I have been deceived and that the book is nothing more than an example of a kind of intellectuality that attempts to be esoteric and mysterious. Rather snobish, if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major blues star in the making","review":"\\"Confessin'\\" shows that Rusty Zinn is more than just a terrific guitarist - he's also a great singer/songwriter. I've been a fan for some time now, since first hearing his work with Kim Wilson, and this album is a signigicant step forward: the playing is as strong as ever and his ability to work a song vocally has improved a lot. The only reason I didn't rate this album 5-stars is that I expect even better things from him in the future, and wanted to give him something to aim for :-) He's out touring behind this album, and I urge you to try to see him if possible. He's a laid back, low key performer, perfect in a small venue, and the band just cooks! Plus, he's a genuinely nice guy.

The President of the U S was killed the year before, and the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which would escalate the Vietnam war, was just unfolding. We would lose Sam Cooke in 1964. With that historical context, you can enjoy this performance for its role in entertainment where race did not really matter. Even though this was taped during the height of the civil rights movement, the crowd was mixed and allowed to intermingle. The bands and recordings are tight and well preserved. No doubt James Brown is the hightlight, however, all entertainers were at the top of their game. Marvin Gaye is good to look at, being so young. Same is true for The Miracles and Smokey Robinson.

But the actual goods are not delivered. Marvin Gaye sounds ok, the Beach Boys are very good, but James Brown got a lot better as the 60's moved on(see YouTube for the proof), and the Stones are out of tune and frankly, not very good. They got better as the decade progressed too. And the less said about the other acts, the better. This will appeal to aging boomers who rail about the bad music of today and want to relive their childhoods. Sadly, sometimes concert films should stay in the can, as is the case with this. The hype from the industry is of course impressive. At least the acts are live, so I will give it a star......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this classic concert cropped in fake widescreen?","review":"Excellent picture quality, the best sound quality available (not completely drowned out by screams as in past versions), mostly outstanding performances by numerous future Rock & Roll Hall of Famers.But why, oh why, did the producers of this DVD feel the need to crop the picture into a fake 16:9 \\"widescreen\\" image? Did they think the viewers were too stupid to adjust the viewing ratio on their widescreen sets to the proper 4:3 ratio? If you watch carefully, most of the group shots cut off the performers at the shins/knees, and many closeups are awkwardly framed (Lesley Gore). If you don't believe me, check the DVD that comes with the special edition of the Beach Boys \\"Sounds of Summer\\"; it contains the TAMI show footage in it's original 4:3/1.33:1 ratio. You can see their shoes!If this hadn't been cropped my rating would have been 5 stars; it's still an indispensable musical video document of the sixities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT TIME CAPSULE OF 60'S MUSIC LIVE!","review":"Many years ago when a video store in Chicago was closing its doors I was able to purchase the vhs of Born To Rock hosted by Chuck Berry. It is a combination of The T.A.M.I.-T.N.T. Show. They cut the box to fit a vhs case but I didn't mind. I love this video but I am really excited to get this DVD! I can hardly wait. These are some of the best and purest live perfomances caught on film. This film shows you these artists really could sing without the studio trickery of today's artists(not all though). I noticed on my vhs case that the choreography for the T.A.M.I. show was done by the great Toni Basil! I have placed my order and eagerly await the release date.

The original 5 Rolling Stones with Brian Jones who started the group [look it up] is priceless.Hope there's more films like this in the vaults that will come to light soon as we Baby Boomers begin turning into Senior Citizens!I recommend this DVD to those that were there and to new generations who are curious as to \\"what all the fuss was about\\" !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiles","review":"Ok, so I'm 21, and I love oldies......and I'm talking The Five Satins and Dion and the Belmonts oldies. The sad part of this is I'll never be able to see them live, but we have the T.A.M.I. dvd for this! Now I'm not going to lie and say all the bands on the show are great, but most of them are. The thing about singing, mainly what I think it's lost a lot of, is enjoyment. Most singers nowadays don't genuinely look happy when they perform, and I've never seen someone on a stage having a good time and caught myself scowling.One thing I did find misleading is it said it had over six hours of recording, but the show is only 2 hours, and the interview is not 4 hours long, so I took off one star for that.

Long monologs with pretty much same stories from the workers and repetitive journeys to the village with same story on how the people moved out didn't help showing the great idea of the project. I bought it to show to my high school students who are mostly Mexican and was hoping to give them a great piece of art and inspiring story, but I am afraid keeping them focused for 57 min will be hard, I had hard time staying focused, and I am usually excited about everything. Also reading captions takes away from looking at the images, and my students are slow readers. I wish there would be more artwork and less people talking; the workers are not good story-tellers!

Many concentrated oils from plants (essential oils) are caustic but we eat the food they come from such as oranges, cloves, thyme, oregano, etc. It is still possible, though, to to be allergic to almost anything but if using any product of this type for the first time you may suffer a Yeast (candida) die-off reaction (very unpleasant).

However, the ingredient list contains 60mg of Tea Tree Oil. Everything I have read about Tea Tree suggests that it should NEVER be ingested. I did a little research and found nothing to contradict that information. Just to be sure, I contacted a trusted herbalist to get a second opinion. She consulted several of colleagues and they all said the same thing...NEVER ingest Tea Tree Oil. So, although this product may cure your Candida, but it contains an ingredient that if ingested can also be toxic or cause internal bleeding or cause you to lapse into a coma, etc., etc., etc. So, I couldn't possibly recommend this to anyone.By the way, I contacted Solaray to ask why they included something like Tea Tree in a supplement.

Although the coverage on the aspect of creative thinking is very broad and somewhat deep in many respects, with good, useful strategies/techniques and examples to follow, it does not offer much in terms of opportunity finding approaches for the business reader. For that, you need to buy and read Michel Robert's \\"Innovation Formula\\", and/or Edward de Bono's \\"Opportunities\\", and/or & Nigel MacLennan \\"Opportunity Finding.\\" Neverthesless, this book is still worthwhile to be bought/read and kept in your personal library. Reading it is like reading many creative thinking books in one go. The author drew a lot - I mean really a lot - of creativity stuff from other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Dytopian please","review":"I'm hooked on the whole dystopian genre. I wasn't sure about this book but ended up really liking it. Some of the wording (like littlies) annoyed me at times but I got passed it.

I realized how much I loved it and so I could not possibly resist reading ahead.Tally started off as an average Ugly missing or New Pretty friends. Then she met Shay and was lead into a life of, following akward clues, falling in love, betrayal, which made this book an interesting, adventure full, life, story that I recomend for mostly young adults butother ages too. I will be readig the next four books, Pretties, Specials and Extras. I can not wait to find out what Tally Youngblood's life becomes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first time I read it","review":"I remember this book from high school and loved it.

Tally finds a girl named Shay, who knows of life outside of Uglie and Pretty town, Tally goes on a mission to find Shay and finally turn pretty, but when she gets there, her heart starts to change.My favorite part in the book is when Tally learns to hoverboard. It's funny because of how the crash bracelets catch her. You can really feel all that she's feeling, the way Scott gets into it.Uglies is a interesting book, because of the way he writes it. He puts you in Tally's shoes. This book gives me a peek of how I don't want my future to turn out, except the electronics. He gives me better ways to write, myself. He is also a good detailer. Uglies is a book I would reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!!!","review":"I loved this book! I liked the futuristic aspect of it: my favourite part was when Tally and Shay were looking at some 300 year old magazines and saying stuff like \\"But they're all ugly!\\" and \\"Since they didn't have the operation back then, they weren't ashamed of being ugly\\".A real must-read (i suggest it for girls, although some boy might like it i guess)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as it appears","review":"I bought this as a gift...so I didn't read it, but my SIL who is 14 likes it.

I had my doubts at first, but I fell in love with this book. The futuristic society is so interesting and the little gadgets are entertaining. I loved everything about this book. It has many life lessons that can be learned in a fun way. Beauty isn't all it's cracked up to be. I think Scott Westerfeld did a great job at coming up with these fantastic ideas. Uglies is definitely the best in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absorbing read","review":"I bought this for my kids, hoping to lure them away from video games. It hasn't worked--yet--but in the meantime, I read it and enjoyed it. Westerfeld creates a believable dystopian world where all is not as it seems.It reminded me of The Giver, although Westerfeld's character development is not as thoughtful as Lowry's.

That's how it is done now to stop all the name calling and bullying. All children at 16 have a surgery to become beautiful, they all look the same, party together, think the same, and have no cares in the world. That is until she meets Shay an \\"ugly\\" that tells her about a place called the Smoke where you can live without having to have the surgery.

Westerfeld knows how to connect with his readers and make you not want to put his work down for a second. I read this book in two days, and I couldn't believe it.

Characters are a little flat and ending seemed somewhat forced, but I am ready for the next installment nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book","review":"I've looked at this book on the shelf for a long time and finally decided to buy it. This was not one of my favorites nor would I read it a second time. However, it was a page turner and I had serious trouble putting it down. It's the usual theme, what's right and wrong. Tally is a Uglie and she is forced through the course of the book to decide to go with the flow (become a Prettie) or take another path and become a Smokie. The book is full of the meanings of self discovery and the paths we choose. It takes place in a future very advanced, hoverboards, hovercars, operations to completly change you and heal to perfection within a weeks time, turning people into the ideal citizen, tracking your every movement down to the number of breaths you take. It's a very good book. I cannot wait to read the rest in this series. However, I won't keep on my bookshelf for a second reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"ok. well, this book is not that bad but its not super OMG good either. i mean it has a good idea and interesting plot but the style is just boring.. i have to read this becuz im in the reaidng bowl and i literally have to forced myself to read it...i hate it because there's so much descriptions and jsut not the poetic or precise ones, just randomness. blabalabla. the part when tally followed shay's clues to get to the smokies was confusing and too much so i jsu skipped it..and the ending about the escape was too easy and i hate it how david forgive tally so easily -wheres the tragedy????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a teen book","review":"It took me quite a while to get around to reading this book, because it wasn't of great interest to me and when I did finally read it, I'm sorry to say, it didn't blow me away. In fact, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Things people said were ridiculously old and there is a poor attempt at romance. I liked the Midnighter's trilogy, but I gotta say, this wasn't good. I could see younger kids reading this (preteens) but I definatley don't consider it a teenaged book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I had to be assigned this book for my language arts class. it was kind of boring and it just wasn't really interesting for me. I sometimes enjoy science fiction and stories about worlds different from ours (like the giver by lois lowry) but this was boring. Also my friend says the only reason why scott westerfeld wrote this book is because he was ugly and he was jealous of pretty people. Ok, it may have been mildly interesting in the beginning but then things just started to go downhill. This is just not the book for me. A waste of my 8 bucks. I am definatly not reading any of the sequels. Everyone knows sequels are rarely better than the orinal, first book. And if the original first book wasn't very good in the first place, the sequel will NEVER be any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I read this book two years ago, when I was in fourth grade. I found it great at first, but then as I read on, I saw it very unrealistic. The amount of detail spent on the looks of the character made me feel as though I really couldn't connect to any of the charaters. After finishing the book, I promptly threw it across my living room in disgust. I think I really lost brain cells while reading this book.What I actually did enjoy about this book was the overall PLOT LINE! If becoming \\"pretty\\" wasn't such an important part of this book, then I actually probably would have enjoyed this book. But PrettyTown?! Really? Couldn't have come up with a better title for a fantasy land, no, too hard. Do NOT waste any of your money on this book. Please.Thank you.Jenna Boccio"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its actually worse than Twilight...","review":"I thought Twilight was the epitome of bad...but I was wrong. The Uglies is ten times worse because the issues and characters are incessantly annoying and juvenile. Many people who read this book, just end up with the urge to yell at the characters and tell them to get over their looks. It is really only another shallow book for teenage girls. When you step back and look at bad teen books as a whole, you realize that they are all the same book, repeated over and over again with different names and varying settings. Don't read too many these books, it gets boring and repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just for kids","review":"I am 37 years old and found this book to be a great read.

I nearly inhaled this fast-paced story, and could never have hoped to put it down before I finished it.The premise may have been done before, but Scott Westerfeld breaths new life into the idea, and markets it to the fertile minds of Young Adults who can use it.Tally lives in a gorgeously complex dystopia, set in a future that seems all to far off and yet at the same time all to near, that appears very simple up front. 'At the age of 16, you get a surgery to become beautiful', what could possibly be wrong with that? Everything.

When Tally's best friend Peris reaches the age of sixteen and undergoes the pretty operation before Tally, she feels as if she has been left alone in the world.

It takes you somewhere else, you wouldn't ever imagine yourself, but you identify with the characters and find commonalities with them so it's within reach. It's a fun, fast read.

The idea is good, but there is no development or explanations. I dont know what the interface ring does or where the parents of the uglies are since they are for sure pretties. Ant then the obvious stuff: uglyville, new pretty town, dullsville, etc. Come on, Im sure a professional writer could do better.Maybe Im tough because Ive read many YA dystopian novels and I can compare this one to those, I dont know, I just dont like Uglies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ender","review":"I got hooked into the genre with hunger games and divergent.

If I find myself in the presence of people I want to like me I try not to stand out. I want to be cool, to fit in, to be liked. This book really focuses on that. Everyone wants to fit in. But what if fitting in is the wrong answer? What if it causes people to be hurt? Do we do what is right or do we try to fit in? Uglies really stresses these questions on the main character. We all know what should happen- the main character chooses right over fitting in with out a second thought, but then we have a perfect character. A person who does everything right. Then the book is predictable to a fault. We may sometimes choose right over fitting in but it is always more complicated then that. There are more things to consider in life then \\"is this right?\\". In fact that is probably the question most often ignored. This book shows humanity's faults as well as our strengths. It is believable and well-written. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath Taking","review":"This book is extremly good, and makes you think about what life would really be like, if we all became the picture of perfection at age 16.

It was such an amazing idea to go on, but it felt like the author barely scratched the surface of what it could be. Normally I can fall into any book and read it very quickly, but every time I sat down I had to reread because I wasnt truly enjoying it. Maybe Uglies just wasnt my kind of book. The story does not flow beautifully or keep you on edge, it jerks you around and not in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uglies is a NOT and Ugly Book","review":"I loved this book.

A few parts were a little slow but for the most part it was an exciting read. You follow Tally through every decision she makes after being turned down for the operation because her friend Shay has run away.Scott Westerfeld does a great job with scene setting, character descriptions, and describing a believable future.

Sure, I initially picked up the book understanding it is a young adult novel - probably not a literary novel - I can give it some forgiveness.

Would I have the desperation to give up a friendship for an unnatural beauty?\\"For Tally, the answer is yes; she does have the desperation to betray her friend, and one of the only ones she has ever known, using a shallow promise to another friend as an excuse for her actions. Little does she know that her perspective will change as she meets another, a special person who grips her attention.One day as she tries to destroy it, she unintentionally sets off the tracker she had brought with her and ends up betraying not only her friend, but a whole society of people that she had grown to love.

This isn't a book; it's a product.No doubt The Uglies raises issues that are important for adolescents to talk about, but they don't need to read a badly written book to talk about these issues. Why did I, an adult, read it (or try to)? Because my son and his friends were complaining bitterly about being assigned this work.

Read it in two days when it usually takes me a month to get through a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat and dull characters ruins the premise","review":"The premise was interesting, but none of the characters have any personality! Everyone in this novel is 2-dimensional, making them utterly boring. I can't take any more of this, I won't continue with the rest of the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for adults","review":"Some of the young adult books are ok for people of all ages this one however is very juvenile and simple. It is prob pretty good book for jr high age maybe some highschoolesr but any older and you will be bored. Not quite the excitement and drama as the hunger games or twilight or even Harry potter. Not a bad book just very specified age wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book was suspensful and interesting. I loved the idea of an ugly to pretty operation and the real truth behind it. Putting the book in a futruristic \\"perfect world\\" enhanced the way the story worked. When the main chacarcter runs away and ends up getting the operation for the sake of medicine and then the author leaves you hanging... I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I found this book slow to get into at first but once you get through the boring beginning of the book it is such a wonderful adventure. Very well written and very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"Uglies is about a girl called Tally Youngblood who learns that sometimes friends are more important than draems. In Tally's world when you turn 16, you get an operation that turns you from ugly to pretty. In Uglyville, the uglies play pranks, and it's after a giant prank that Tally meets Shay. When Shay disipears, Special Circumstances threatens to forget about Tally's operation until Shay is found. Does Tally betray or stay with Shay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"i just finished reading the uglies and it is definitely one of the best books i have read this year (2005) and once i started reading it i couldn't stop. A must buy especially if your into sci-fi/futuristic societies and utopias."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating read","review":"I understood the concept. It was great. But couldn't stand reading Tally. And the weird lingo. I only kept reading because I needed to know what happened"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears","review":"It just didnt do it for me. I struggled to finished because of how boring it was. The story line is SLOW, dull, and doesnt grasp attention"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is amazing","review":"This book is amazing. One of the best books I've read by far!!!! Definitely in the top 5 truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Dystopian","review":"This is a series made up of 4 books about a society obsessed with beauty, and is on the top of my list. What makes this one great is the fact that on the outside this future seems kind of perfect. Everyone is beautiful and there is no more poverty, but there is a price to perfection. Tally and Shay go on the adventure of their lives and discover a dark secret that brings their perfect world crashing down. This book, along with many dystopian books, is perfect for girls and boys because of the action and adventure along with a bit a light romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard YA novel, but cool tech","review":"This is a pretty standard trilogy of a Young adult novel - young girl in a not-so-near post-apocalyptic future, thrust into the middle of a struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\", in love with boy A in first novel, in love with boy B in second, and choosing between the two in the third. That said, I still couldn't put any of the books down until I was done with them. A nice variation on our possible future and a pretty original \\"end of the world\\" scenario. I enjoyed all three books and recommend them if you liked the Hunger Games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy and engaging read","review":"This series got me back into reading after Harry potter and introduced me to my love of dystopian novels. I finished the series quickly, recommend it to all my friends and even named my cat after the main character, Tally!

If you like science fiction, a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful","review":"i read this book in my advanced english class and though well-this is going to be another stupid book we HAVE to read. i was wrong. after i started reading it i couldnt put it down even though i had pledged to my teacher to stop reading at a certain page. This is the best young adults book i've read in years: the language was beautiful and put together well. i loved the suspense though. the author tricks you and then pulls you in another way. i loved and recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing plot, but just didn't do it for me","review":"I love reading Young Adult Fiction and after seeing this book as a recommendation from other books I've enjoyed, I jumped right in. The plot and characters seemed intriguing, but the book started off very slow. I thought it would pick up but it never did. I just couldn't finish it, I felt like this was too Young adult for me. I couldn't get past the easy read, words like \\"Uglies,Pretties & Littlies\\" and I felt no no real suspense or development. Overall I think I just felt too old to read it or enjoy it. This is a very young read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. How can somebody like it?","review":"I must say for starters that I am 38, so maybe this book is for teens only. I have read other YA novels which I enjoyed (like the Twilight Saga or The Hunger Games) but this was hard to finish. A huge disappointment. Characters are shallow and unrealistic. You don't get to connect with them. There are no surprises, you can tell what is going to happen from minute 1. Just Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too Young Adult","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said this may have been a little too Young Adult for their taste. While I found the concept to be interesting, I found the book to be lacking. The characters weren't likable, and I found the main character to be annoying. While romances in these books are never believable, this one was just awkward and disappointing. I figured I would give this YA book a chance because I really enjoyed The Hunger Games and despite my criticisms for it the Twilight series was actually an enjoyable, quick read. Maybe I've exhausted the list of YA books that I would find enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I know this book is pretty popular, but I don't understand why. I normally love this type of book, but I found this book completely lacking. The characters were dull and not developed. I had no interest in finishing the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful in every way!","review":"I was never bored, and thats saying something. Uglies is a good book to read again and again. I absolutly (I know it's spelled wrong, don't judge me) loved it!If Scott Westerfeld can make the others just as good as this, I will worship the ground he walks on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...","review":"It was a good first book to the series but if it wasn't for the romance it would have nothing pulling it forward in my opinion...I guess I feel it was a shallow read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uglies... A beautiful story!","review":"I loved this book so much I couldn't put it down! At first I thought it was a weird title and that the title was a little odd but it was worth it. I love how Westerfeld shows our society and how we're divided even though there is no special area for the pretty and the ugly. I mean it really taps into society's idea of pretty and ugly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Utopian/Dystopian Read","review":"This book flies by! There is plenty of action to keep the pages turning and the world is strange and intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Predictable story lines, simple characters. For far better young adult dystopian reads try The Giver, The hunger games and The divergent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribile Book","review":"I own all of her books. For years I kept saying she wasn't that bad a writer. Then came this piece of cow pile. This sucks. The writing is amateur and sloppy the characters are purile and annoying. Most disgusting of all is she makes the brother from the previous book the bad guy, and the brother and his wife disapper. What happens to them? I'm not wasting $14 more to find out! This was the first book I ever took back to the store. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book!!!","review":"I used to read all her books, but the last couple of books have been just terrible. What happened to one of my favorite authors? In this book, she makes the brother of the hero into someone I don't even recognize. Maybe that gets resolved in another book but I know I won't be reading it. Devine has lost her roots and have made a book that is poorly written and make you not even care about any of these characters. I'm sorry to say this: Don't buy this book, save your money for somthing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE Ending to a use to be perfect fantasy","review":"I used to love all thea devine's book and satisfaction is one of my favorite. I love the characters Jancie and Lujan, especially the way Lujan realized in the book how much he loves Jancie and happily throw away his jaded ways to be with her. I want to buy Sensation because I would like to see what happen afterward with Jancie and Lujan. Now, normally, I would read the customer reviews on Amazon first to see what I am getting into, but I was in a hurry this time so I didnt. At the book store, I sort of scan through it and flip to read the ending first (hard to break a habit). OH MY GOD!!! I was aboslutely horrified of Thea's revealing of Lujan's character! And the dissapearing of Jancie and Hugan!! I was so horrified that I drop the book right then and there. There's no way I buy and much less read it now. I have just one question to Ms. thea: WHY? WHY? OH WHY???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"Thea used to be one of my favorite authors, but after this last book, I'm changing my mind. This book should have been classified as a mystery, not erotic fiction. Her older stuff used to make me blush. Now I wish I'd spent my $14 on something else. Don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree - Bad","review":"I am one of her biggest fans and this was terrible. What was she thinking with that ending? I guess the hero in the previous book was a bit nasty and cold and it could be believable that he would turn out bad but hey no one wants to really read that when all is said and done. Lujan was no saint, far from it but to make him out to be a villian in this book was pretty bad.As far as this book. Forget it. Boring. Very boring. She lost it with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were YOU thinking Ms.Devine?","review":"I RARELY write or comment on a book. Except for Passion (lisa Valdez) Fantastic book. However this sequel to Sensation if called that was HORRIBLE and SHAMEFUL in it's destruction of the redeeming and healing way Janice love transforms Lujan, the brother of this books character Kyger. To use this book to destroy her,and her life. Was shameful. Kyger, in this story if called that was not even defined or left to grow and flourish. Rather he was hidden in the pit literally of the scam of what is Lujans life. Do Ms Devine make this up to your readers by letting us know that all was not in vain for Janice or Lujan. Who both disappeared in this fiasco of a book. HOW you can bring about the phoenix and restoration of Lujan to his Janice. NOW that's a story. The power of Love. How about it? We readers could use a dose of GOODWILL and PEACE, in these times. DO SERIOUSLY consider to write this tale. I can tell you you'll have alot of readers for this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Note to English Teachers","review":"Cost being a factor in determining books to be purchased by students, I strongly recommend this translation by Leonard Bacon (1914). The lines are mainly in iambic heptameter (seven beats per line) with a clear caesura, which facilitates a student's oral reading of the poem. Though the original French used assonance more than end rhyme, Bacon does rhyme his English lines. Compared to the iambic pentameter of the Dorothy L. Sayers translation, Bacon's is a little faster paced, but one senses the hoofbeats of the horses with two more beats per line, which isn't altogether bad for an epic poem about a military massacre. Though a good choice in terms of price, Bacon's translation lacks glosses of archaisms (e.g., the word \\"eme\\" is not explained as an archaism of \\"uncle\\"). Still, the teacher can supply these as necessary. For [the money], you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Free is good, but the translation is frustrating at times","review":"This is an old translation and it shows in its maddening inconsistancies. For example, rather than simply referring to the protagonist as Roland, he is called \\"Rollant,\\" \\"Rollanz\\";Ganelon, the treacherous Frank, is referred to as \\"Guenes\\"; Charlemagne goes by at least three other names (Carlun?). Other archaic spellings dominate too, like \\"Mahumet\\" for Muhammed, and gafaluns for whatever they might be.The syntax and diction are stiff and unnatural and line breaks are not noted. Here's a taste:\\"His arms to bear has shewn great lustihead; In vassalage he is well famoused; Christian were he, he'd shown good barronhead.\\"So, it is a great story, but the best thing about this version is its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Poem","review":"This is an excellant translation of one of the greatest poems ever \\"written\\".

I thought it was pretty good up until the \\"saving the world\\" bit. Pretty far-fetched & kind of rushed & goofy at the end. I also didn't care for \\"Hunter's Moon\\" for a lot of the same reasons. Her earlier books, \\"Night Magic\\", \\"Walking After Midnight\\" were much better. I think she can do a better job. It will make me more hesitant about reading anymore of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"Gees, I was really let down on this book.

This one was not at all as enjoyable to me as the other three I read (Superstition, Whispers at Midnight and Paradise County). Maybe I'm just not a wilderness or cowboy kind of girl because the romance aspect was just ok to me, and the supense, while some parts were pretty good, mostly bored me. I just didn't care for this one, but I love Karen Robards normally so I'll continue to keep reading herbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh... unbelivable and pretty annoying","review":"First of all I hated how the hero began the book by hitting on the heroines teenage daughter... very annoying! I never found anything that good about him, and she was whiney and annoying. Definitely not one of her best. The subplot was very lame and unbelievable... don't bother!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite and chilling","review":"This is my favorite type of book ~ romantic suspense with a slightly religious element, and a sexy hero that I fell in love with.My friend told me I would love this book and she was 1000% right. It's awesome.Karen Robards wove her spell around me so that I couldn't stop reading. I almost missed a day of work I was up so late reading to the very end.She interlaces story, character, and style with such ease that I didn't merely read the book, I lived and breathed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"I read this book because the author.was.recommended for Karen Rose fans. I was not impressed. Lynn was entirely unlikeable, from her snotty attitude to her unkindness to people and animals, as was her daughter. The whole adventure was unbelievable and poorly researched.

The story seemed like it had potential...if you can pick it out of the superfluous, haphazard teenage babble."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read","review":"Andrea Marr is such a real character.

I did not. The most a accurate and realistic representaion I can think of not only youth culture, but culture in general. Reminded me a bit of the movie Election, in it's painful reality factor.

This is mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the reviews","review":"I was psyched about ordering this book when I saw that amazon compares it to The Perks of Being A Wallflower. I am horribly disappointed. This book is completely inaccurate. I don't know why people keep saying it is a \\"very realistic point of view\\" etc. etc. If anyone accepts that teenage girls are this shallow, trite, and just plain asinine they are sadly mistaken. Not to mention that is this book is horribly written. It's one long, boring, pointless run-on sentence. I hate this book. I recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower of this novel any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was so much better - that's a sad thing for a book","review":"I enjoyed the film 'Girl' based on the book by Blake Nelson. It was cute, funny, and had a nice sense of female independance and self discovery. I was disapointed when I bought the book afterward. I found the narrative style very offputting and I was not able to identify with or care about Andrea. What girl speaks like that? The constant repetition of \\"and then,\\" and the lack of emotional depth made me finally put it down without finishing it. Usually after seeing a film i.e. The Virgin Suicides or The Ice Storm I am so eager to read the book and find out how much richer and complex the written word is. 'Girl' isn't all bad but there are much better books of its genre out there, and as an avid reader of women's fiction I feel like 'Girl' has missed it when it comes to describing what it is to grow up middle class and female in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"going back to his roots...","review":"according to the back of the book's jacket blake nelson used to be a writer for sassy. this is exactly how the book reads: like a contrived and unoriginal article for a young girls magazine. andrea's exploits are that of your average adolescent girl with no fresh angle or any sort of keen insight into life. if i wanted to experience that, i'd go to the local trendy coffeeshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turing, quality coming of age story","review":"I picked this book up in the store because I was attracted to its cover -- 45 minutes later, when I realized I'd been standing there reading non-stop I knew I had to buy it. There's little I can add to the copious praise other reviewers have heaped on this book, but let me say that this man is a very talented writer and we should all support him by buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"i carry this book everywhere","review":"ILOVED this book so much. I have read it numerous times and each time I get something new and different out of it. Andrea is \\"cool\\" her adventures and experiances are so right on that you find yourself cheering her on. Todd Sparrow is a jerk though to be so casual with her about everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best aspect of this book is Cybil.","review":"I had a lot of trouble getting into the book at first because the writing is very i-read-seventeen-magazine-as-a-hobby, and the narrator, Andrea, is perhaps one of the most appearance-oriented, obnoxious high school \\"rebel\\" ever printed. The character of Cybil, however, who enters the story directly after having shaved her head in a moment of indecision and the overwhelming influence of an older, intriguing rock star, made me cry at so many random places. Little things about her really touched me, the way that Andrea describes her picking grass out of her socks... Andrea's character has no bulk, no substance, but Cybil transforms from a semi-popular jock to a completely independent,lost teenager... SHE is who i identified with. I would be in love if she were a real person."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Girl\\" Genius","review":"My own girlhood was little more than a blur until I read \\"Girl,\\" which brought it all back to me. I hate to admit this, but I, too, marvelled that a man could imbue a character with such an identifiably feminine, teen-aged voice.Also, \\"Girl\\" has the one thing missing from so much fiction these days -- humor! A definite must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: AWESOME!!!!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book! For those of you who may think it's just for teenagers, this book can definately be enjoyed by anyone in their teens, twenties, OR people just young at heart. Blake Nelson accurately tells the story of what it's like to be a young, impressionable girl desperately searching for a place to fit in. Andrea's versatile personality gets her into many interesting situations. Each chapter holds some new revelation or adventure. If you were a fan of the television show \\"My So-Called Life\\", you MUST read this book. Perhaps Angela Chase and Jordan Catalano are based upon Andrea Marr and Todd Sparrow of \\"Girl\\"...the parallels are striking! Read for yourself! You'll want to go back to high school once you read this...you'll wish you were sitting in the cafeteria, slammin'in the mosh pit, or hanging out at the mall with Andrea and her friends!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"This was one of the best books that I've read in a long time. I literally could not put it down. I loved Nelson's writing style and look forward to seeing something else from him soon. This book brought back many poignant memories of my own high-school years"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine, funny, and ultimately heartbreaking","review":"The central premise of \\"Girl\\" is as old as storytelling itself: young person comes of age. That Nelson could have done so much to make it fresh and original is a genuine tribute to his skills as a writer, particularly when one realizes that this is his first book. Our main character and diary-style narrator, Andrea, leads us by the hand through a tangle of botched romances, unrequited love, sexual identity crises, and the Portland, Oregon underground music scene. The narration is in turns hillarious, terrifying, heart-rending, torrid, achingly beautiful, and frantic. By the end, one can't help feel like Andrea's older brother, wanting to put an arm around her and tell her that she's good people with a bright future and a fulfilling social life -- but, by the time we are truly tempted to do it, we also know her well enough to know that she'd step away from our arm and say something gen-X'er like \\"Oh, puh-LEASE,\\" anyway. It's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I've read this book like 3 times, the first time I couldn't put it down. I love reading it multiple times, it's like the first time all over again. I experience all of the same feelings. It makes me laugh, and cry. I really recommend this book, it's really great! I wish I was Andrea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interestingly interesting novel","review":"This book I found interesting and exciting to read. It seems like she is very energetic for some reason, like she never stops! I think this book is really for teenage girls or even adults. I think Andrea is the typical teenager (apart from some things in the book that some people might not be doing at that age... if you know what I mean!) But all in all I think this is a very enjoyable story and will get all your emotions up and running. There are some quite humourous bits, like when Cybil shaves her hair off, to impress a boy that Andrea ends up with anyway... OK, I will not tell you ANYMORE and you will just have to buy the book to see what other amazing, exciting adventures happen to Andrea throughout her hectic high school life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable and fits my needs perfectly","review":"I just needed a stick holder for my electronic drumset. I only own 1 pair of sticks but from the looks of it the holder can probably hold up to about 3 pairs of sticks. It gets the job done for me and its cheap. So if you need a drum stick holder that can hold up to a maximum of 3 pairs of sticks, just get this one, the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never ending laughs and fun!!!","review":"I bought this movie three days before Christmas. I knew right away it would be a must-buy DVD because I like Sabrina.

It's sunny and warm, with kind of a Teutonic Beach Boys feel to it. The eponymous track dominates the album, four german hippies take a roadtrip down the autobahn in an old mercedes. The track starts with a steady highway pulse then gets sunnier, almost as if you're entering the country. This Autobahn isn't about speed, it's a stretch of highway with no other cars for miles and cows on the side of the road.The album is devoid of the menance and irony of later releases and the band has pretty ditched the Krautrock muscle of the first three albums.

A few comments about the CD:The remastering repro is excellent. The original Vertigo vinyl LP of Autobahn was banded into 7 separate but continuous sections; would have liked to see that here on the CD. Would be interesting for CD players with random track-order scramblers.The 4 other selections are also vintage Kraftwerk, but I would have appreciated at least a few others to fill up the disc, maybe from the frustratingly hard-to-round up Kraftwerk \\"1 & 2\\" or from \\"Ralf & Florian\\".

It helps make connections between different events in different parts of the world. This has been especially helpful for me when planning units of study for children of all ages. It helps expand the study to a variety of interest areas.The book is also helpful when reading as I often look up the particular time span and find out what else was going on at that time. For example, the year I was born, 1945 was the year that Vitamin A was synthesized, that Carousel played in New York, that Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Guggenheim Museum and that George Orwell wrote the Animal Farm. These connections make the reading so much more interesting and expansive. These connections have been especially helpful for the children. A really handy reference book. I have another copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved thousands of dollars","review":"I purchased a house recently and decided to replace almost all my furniture. I bought The Furniture Factory Outlet Guide for assistance. I saved literally over $10,000 using this book. My one recommendation to use this guide is to shop your local furniture stores, get the furniture manufacturer's name, the group name and/or number of the pieces you like. Then use the guide to call the stores listed in the guide that carry the furniture manufacturer you're looking for, and price shop, one against the other for the best deals. You really don't even have to go to NC, unless you want to spend a couple days looking and figuring out what furniture you like. Then go home and call the stores in this guide. Good luck and happy shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference","review":"I have a native dutch bf. As I want to know more about the culture in Netherlands, I bought this book.

It has an opening for all the ports, including a little window for the camera that opens and closes. Problem is when you open it, you can't hold it with your left hand. I had to return mine.

It's certainly a beautiful case, but not very functional. The front cover doesn't flip all the way under, so that if you're holding it with your left hand, it's difficult to reach the control buttons with your left thumb, as you should be able to. You cannot access the voice recorder button or the slots for the expansion cards unless you remove your zire from the case. Also, the top and bottom are completely open, which provides ready access to the slots, etc, however it does nothing to protect my zire from debris, etc, from the bottom of my purse. Also, the cradle impedes my access to the stylus slightly.I do like the sliding window in the back that opens so that I can take pictures and video, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Plot, not spectacular...","review":"Well the most important issue is that Erika Eleniak never takes her clothes off during the whole movie.

After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!) My daughter is 12 months old & 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap. There is a 3inch gap between her & the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap. The thick padded seat is adorable & comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up. The base is very large & her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well. The buckles are awkward & impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Very Useful","review":"My baby has used this since she was 4 months old It has a sturdy wide base..It has height adjusters...you can recline it..very secure safty belts but I do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when I buckle it thats the only thing I dislike about this highchair.

My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach. When sitting on the regular seat, she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself. This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of...out to clean. A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair. I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly. If I could do it over, I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly.

It's definitely their finest yet. The strong, harmonized vocals combined with complex guitar riffs and a driving bassline make this some intense music to jam to.

He not only lead the Labour party to a critical defeat which not only saw the conservatives dominate Britain for a record period but his loss of office led to the destruction of everything he stood for. That is the union movement, Britain's place as a manufacturing nation and the notion of the labour party being a working class movement.The writer of the book has been absorbed by Callaghan's career and has come to like him (as did most of the British Electorate). His biography thus lacks a sense of the tragedy of Callaghan's life and the failure of his Prime Minister Ship and the desolation which resulted.Instead we get a picture of a man on the right of the labour movement who was a decent man and tried in his political career to stand for what he thought was right.A readable biography which looks to much at the man and perhaps not enough at the political context."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Ray, but this is a terrible cd.","review":"I'm a big fan of Ray, so when I saw this used at a local store, I grabbed it. I only paid about $4 for it, but if I had paid any more, I might have demanded a refund. This is the worst-sounding cd I own. Ray is there with all his genius, but the problem is that both his voice and his piano sound like they're at the end of a long tunnel, while the \\"overdubs\\" sound perfectly clear. The cd says on the back that \\"additional overdubs\\" were added, but it doesn't warn you that they're performed by a man with mediocre (at BEST) talent and that the cd sounds like it was mixed at random by someone who was almost completely deaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad...","review":"These are the beginnings of Ray Charles when he tries to sound like Nat King Cole.The drums are terrible bad!

No one should judge this family and the choices they made. It is not as though they hide Mori.

It is obvious that he only cares about the visuals, but that results into a boring movie, because the \\"plot\\" (so to speak) is utterly uninteresting. Lucky I watched it on 3D, as a 2D movie it would be twice as flat. Needless to say I will not purchase it, I couldn't stand this movie more than once, honestly.

After about 15 minutes I was shocked that a world of color opened up and I was enthralled. The characters were odd but a perfect fit in this outrageous world of \\"Underland\\". Johnny Depp was a character that you thought was crazy and sweet at the same time. Alice was just stand offish enough to fit in the world but then grew her character to become the heroine. All in all, a very enjoyable movie with colors and delights that I wouldn't imagine could exist in a Tim Burton film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trippy fun!","review":"A little bit more for adults than the original, this new take by Disney on Alice in Wonderland is more of a sequel than a re-do.Not surprisingly, Johnny Depp as the Mad hatter dominates the screen.

They have some good, they have some awful, and then there is Wonderland. To me it showcases some what quality actors can do with a bad script, and bad movie. The over the top colors, and cinematography were an attempt to cover up a poor story. I really look at this movie as a 2.5 out of 5. Bad movie, bad story, bad cinematography, but very well done acting, and deliverance of lines.In the end if you are like mnay who simply fall in love with ever Burton/Depp movie, then I am sure you will rate this movie higher and not share my feelings.

I have not been a big fan of the story Alice in Wonderland growing up (I'm 40+) - - but I have to say I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE.

That being said, if you're looking for this on Amazon, you've likely already seen the film and liked it, otherwise you would just rent it. But if you haven't... please, don't bother.

Alice is about to get married, when once again, she spots the white rabbit, and follows him. Once back in Wonderland Alice embarks on her true destiny: end the red queen's reign of power.Overall, I thought this film really did not have a great plot, it was just same old, same old.

She is given cryptic advice by mystical creatures and it all ends in a massive battle between the forces of Good and the forces of Evil. It sounds more like Narnia than Wonderland to me--just with a Blue Caterpillar instead of Aslan the Lion. Still, I enjoyed the movie. Johnny Depp was diverting as the Mad Hatter, and Mia Warsikowska was delightful as Alice. I also found it amusing that Alice kept having to find new clothes because the clothes she was wearing didn't grow or shrink with her! It was nice to see Crispin Glover again. He did a wonderful job as Stayne, the Knave of Hearts.

Although I tend to like most Johnny Depp films (esp Charlie Chocolate Factory etc...) and this film was visually amazing, in the end a good film is based on solid writing and solid acting... which this film sorely lacked in. Bottomline, the movie seemed that it had everything going for it (special effects, the classic story, famous actors)... but it was just plain boring, I'm mean really boring. Out of the three family members who started to watch this film, no one finished it.

Instead it's a rampant tribute to his own ego.He seems to be under the illusion that his imagination and inventiveness are equal to Carrolls.

Beyond that, the character development is shoddy as hell and the whole thing just feels like a poor attempt at using names and star-status to get people to see it.Sure, Jonny Depp is great as always and Helena Bonham-Carter is funny, but as a story, it left me feeling very unfulfilled.You might as well go see another frikkin' \\"Shrek\\" movie, 'cuz this is just as soulless, but particularly disappointing because this man made \\"Beetlejuice.\\"Where did Tim Burton's ability to truly haunt us with his visionary skills go?Check out \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" instead.

Tim Burton is losing his place as imaginative and unique. Alice should be a sweet, young girl who falls under the spell of a dream. She is not the maniac as portrayed in this film.

While at times there is good depth in the image it seemed like the 3D was hit or miss and depending on the scene you either had an excellent image or a crappy one.Everything else I've seen in 3d at home has been excellent (AVATAR, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Resident Evil)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggh!","review":"I have always enjoyed Johnny Depp movies, and think they are fun.

But instead it was boring, a movie that seemed drab even for Burton, every scene seemed like it was covered in dirt. and I could not picture any child sitting through this without losing intrest in the first 15 minutes Big Disappointment from one of my favorite directors. definatly a waste of talent and money. My guess is burton did'nt get the budget he wanted from Disney and fudged this one. it should be swept under the rug and forgotten. dont even waste your money buying it on Blu Rayunlike Avatar there nothing to see here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I went into seeing this movie with very low expectations. Johnny Depp isn't my favorite (honestly, I don't get all the hype around him) and Tim Burton is usually a bit too weird for me.Having said that, I loved this film! The graphics were awesome, the characters wonderfully quirky. I loved Anne Hathaway as the white queen and the rest of the cast was great, too.Favorite scene: the tea party! I giggled and laughed all through that, starting when the Hatter walks the length of the table and breaks all the cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total stinkbomb.","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are some good elements, but it's as Burton played up all the junk and nearly hid the good stuff. Depp is just blandly unlikable. Why would anyone want to make Anne Hathaway look so ugly? Things start out promising, but once the rabbit hole if breached it's tripe central. Things improve slightly as more actual humans enter the story... wait, did I say story? Sorry, none here. A Lord of the Rings style dragon fight? Really. This film makes Dumb and Dumberer look like Kurosawa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not as good as expected","review":"I had high expectations. The movie was good, but not nearly as good as I was expecting. The animations were a mixed bag. Some of the characters turned out really well and others not so much.Only two stars because of the Blu-ray transfer. Disappointment for sure.Upset that the aspect is 1.78:1 and the original was 1.85.1. This blows for those of us with CIH setups.

Being a Diney production the special fx are most entertaining and the plot becomes quickly engaging. While some of the characters are quite mad, like Johnny Deep's Mad Hatter, Alice's journey is highlighted by overcoming all odds to save Wonderland, and in the end realize things about her own reality. Quite a worthwhile bluray to add to one's collection, the visual imagery at times is quite psychedlic and mind bendingly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Hathaway casually out-quirks Johnny Depp and Crispin Glover","review":"Comme Ci, Comme Ca.Anne Hathaway casually out-quirkied Johnny Depp, who was mostly retreading and reusing old mannerisms, and Crispin Glover, who was handicapped by his costume.

Thirteen years later we see a young woman unsatisfied with her situation, and desperately looking for an escape, Alice's discovery of a clothed-rabbit leads her to a world of adventure. Throughout the movie, she faced challenges and enemies as well as developed friendships and courage.Visual: The designers did a wonderful job of bringing imaginary creatures to life. All the costumes are quirky and fun, each well-matched for the characters who wore them.Characters: Although Mia Wasikowska did a good job playing Alice, I loved the evil Red Queen a lot. The writers made her an amusing villain with her quirky demands, which is fun to watch, but not so great for the inhabitants of wonderland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, but not exceptional.","review":"My wife didn't like it, but I found it entertaining and the special effects to create the underground world were great.

At worst, Lewis Carroll's enigmatic Wonderland is transformed into a standard \\"fantasy cinema\\" (extremely CGI) landscape where a standard battle between Good and Evil must be fought and won. At best, Tim Burton gives you a typical \\"Tim Burton film\\" with his trademark touches; such as his creative muse Johnny Depp as a deathly pale, demented, Bozo the Clown-looking Mad Hatter; and his wife Helena Bonham Carter perfectly cast as the tyrannical Red Queen.

The label provides additional important information about this olive oil in that it is extra virgin and first cold pressed.I have read in a number of publications that these qualities are important when one is selecting an olive oil. My wife is our nutritional expert and always specifies this brand of olive oil only.As a husband and consumer of salads and various other assorted foods which benefit from olive oil I can testify that it has a great flavor as far as olive oils go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery Oil - It is anything but olive oil","review":"My wife says that it does not taste like olive oil. She is Italian. She knows what real olive oil tastes like. We put a small amount in the fridge. It would not freeze or thicken for anything. Real olive oil is supposed to thicken when cold. The company even lied to me by telling me that the olive oil tests on the internet which labeled Colavita as fake were because they used old batches of Colavita. I was stupid enough to believe them. Colavita is owned by the mafia. Do not believe anything they tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Blood on The Forge","review":"I was very happy to receive this book in good condition because it is a classic and I wanted a good copy for my collection of novels I wish to keep. My favorite English professor is teaching it this semester, and though I'm not in school, I will do the readings to keep up with the class."},{"rating":"1","title":"oops another generic hc album","review":"If you have made it this far you have wasted enough time, just run head first into a brick wall for more fun. Reckon it to your uncles band wanting to play at your party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"This book was chosen by my reading group committee not myself. It is a book full of great hardship, death, and disappointment for almost all of the characters. I wouldn't recommend it for readers who like Jane Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Colour","review":"Having lived in Hokitika on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand, this book was of interest. Clearly the author was familiar with the weather in the area! The characters were relatively 'normal' and the experiences were reasonably credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"I read Parable of the Sower and I felt overwhelmed with thought and visions of the future and I didn't want it to end. I was so happy to follow up with Parable of the Talents. Wonderful book. Octavia Butler does an excellent job at forcing us to view our patterns and choices and the way we are currently dealing with human and social conditions. I strongly recommend this book to everyone but especially if you are looking for a read that will feed your mind and stimulate you intellectually.....One complaint since the main character Lauren was creating a new way of thinking via Earthseed at times I felt as if I were reading one of those \\"power for living type books\\" and it got to be a bit much at times.... Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Deeply Probing Delightful Parable","review":"I was mesmerized, horrified, grief-stricken, and elated by turns. This book took me through so many emotions, that I was exhausted when I finished. And yet, I desperately ached for the characters and their extremely human conflicting emotions. I highly recommend the book, and its predecessor, \\"The Parable of the Sower;\\" the book that changed forever the way I view divinity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian fascism takes over U.S. ...sound familiar?","review":"I love Octavia Butler's daring,caring and strong people who transform her bleak scenarios into hopeful tales of human potential. The theme of the unresolved oppression that continues to breed slavery is never far from her mind or pen. This book is striking to read because although Butler published it in the late 1990s, the danger of future of a U.S. run by Christian fascists led from the White House seems more more real than ever.For a factual recent history of Christian theocrats in the U.S. read Esther Kaplan's recent book With God on Their Side, and for a trenchant analysis of the philosophy and social base behind this madness read Avakian's Preaching From a Pulpit of Bones, another prescient work from the 1990s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bleak","review":"I would be the first to say that Octavia Butler is an excellent writer. However, I found this particular tale too depressing. My problems actually did not lie with the violence of the book. I was extremely bothered by an impression that every single character in this story was a victim (and that includes the villans). Even the ending did not seem any more hopeful. What is the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!","review":"Presents not only a history of the early days of Los Alamos but builds a wonderful picture of the woman who understood the deeper aspects of the land and its indigenes people.Well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the San Juans","review":"This book is fantastic for people who live in the San Juans. Amazingly clear photographs make identifying marine life easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and well worth it!!!","review":"I work for a West Coast marine lab and I purchased this both for my work and for my own enjoyment. Twenty years in the making, there is nothing close to this in terms of illustrated guides for the region. Being that I work in the lesser known of the invertebrates, I was glad to see that the minor phyla are paid just as much attention to as the more common ones. I showed my copy around the lab, which led at least four more copies to be purchased. Upon opening the cover and flipping to any page, the first-time reader is speechless at the quality of the photos and the overall organization of the work. Yes, reference books like these are a bit more expensive than the everyday field guide, but this has so much more: Common name, scientific name (and limited synonymy), distribution, special remarks on each species... Very recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing resource","review":"Spectacular photography and well organized layout/descriptions enable you to quickly identify unknown species glimpsed during low tide adventures. So far my every attempt at identification has been satisfied. Invariably what happens during my search of one unknown I come across other interesting species that I am compelled to seek next time on the water. Algae/worms/seaweeds/bivalves.....it's all there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For its price, a good find","review":"Now that Amazon has changed the product description and recognized that it is soft cover, I can, perhaps, give a decent review.The text is, as are all Mill's writings, quite good. Regardless as to your agreement or disagreement, it cannot be argued that Mill does not present his points clearly, logically, and understandably. The editor's introduction is nice, though short. It is also nice that Mill's speech regarding capitial punishment was included as an appendix.The actual binding is rather flimsy, but for this low price, I'll not complain too loudly."},{"rating":"2","title":"rightly called a great book","review":"_Utilitarianism_ is, despite the train-wreck of the fourth chapter, one of the clearest expositions of ethical theory ever written. Anyone interested in ethics in general, or utilitarianism in particular, should be familiar with it. But then, you already knew that.As far as specifics regarding this edition: It is offered without introduction, conclusion, analytical remarks, historical context, or any of the other chaff that tends to build up around great texts. I find this refreshing; some may find it disappointing. Unfortunately, like all the books I've ever bought from the Prometheus press, it is very poorly bound. On the other hand, because this little volume is so slim (<100 pages), it is at lesser risk of falling apart, or loosing pages.If you want to read Mill in a solid, cheap edition, this copy is perfect. If you want an edition that will not crumble to powder within the next 60 years, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"While I dont agree with some of what is said, this gives a practical view of Utilitarianism, and is truly a good work of Philosophy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shower door seal","review":"the seal was represented as a CR Lawrence product when i got it it was a cheap hardware store replacement made in china although it worked for my customer i was disappointed with the false representation i would not have purchased if i had known"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Match Picture","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers. The picture clearly shows two T's of equal width (4mm). What arrived was a CRL product with a 4mm upper T and a 5mm lower T.

It doesn't fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was this the real 007?","review":"History may judge him harshly, but this book is an incredible adventure story and worth reading for its coverage of Stalin's purges alone. Fitzroy Maclean was apparently Ian Fleming's model for his most famous creation, James Bond. Whether stooging quietly around the back of beyond in Stalin's Soviet Union, sneaking across the Sahara to launch raids far behind German lines in World War Two or hiking through the vertical mountains of Yugoslavia Maclean is both modest and reticent. But the adventures he has are so outrageous that anything but a self-deprecating approach would seem both boastful and wildly improbable. With Eric Newby and Wilfred Thesiger, this man was the last of a particular breed of Englishmen. The world will be a poorer place for their passing."},{"rating":"2","title":"True History","review":"The adventures that this man experienced comes to few people and could only happen during a period of history in which cataclysmic events occurred over a period of several years. His adventures are astounding and fill you with envy of McClean's ability to be in the right place at the right time.Few fictional adventures can match the true experiences related here. Inside history related from a first hand witness. It brings to life the reality of the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"the truth is stranger than fiction","review":"This is a truly unique book and comparable only with Churchill's 'My Early Life' as an adventure history. Some people write adventure books, some people have adventures but Fitzroy McLean, like Churchill, or TE Lawrence, is able to do both. A rare treat and very easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The myth of laziness","review":"A very excellent book. I learned alot about the myth of lazness and what it's not.

Nice cop-out. There is zero in this book about how to be more productive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recognizing success blocks","review":"Dr. Levine once again shows us how no one wants to fail, but may fail in the face of overwheming obstacles. I just happen to be reading this book when I had a boy in class, Ruben, who failed to complete any class work. It was easy to recognize his lack of fine motor skills. Once the problem was diagnosed, we were able to use multiple strategies to overcome this block and help Ruben find his level of success.As teachers, knowing how to diagnose a learing difficulty and being able to intervene with stratgies to help should be our goal. Dr. Levine, with his extraordinary insight and clinical experience takes the guess work out of this process for those of us in the field.A must read for teachers who want to see all of their students succeed, not just the ones who do what we say when we say it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important book","review":"When I received this book from my aunt I was a little taken aback. Just because I had mentioned to her that I couldn't be bothered writing thank-you letters to everyone for this years Christmas presents! Anyway I started reading this book and found it a very insightful and important look at laziness and its supposed causes and effects. I have to say that I was impressed by the way the author gets to the core of the problem and sheds new light on lack of motivation, loss of energy and other factors which contribute to so-called laziness. It isn't the easiest read you'll ever have but taking up the challenge will surely prove worthwhile. Sadly I didn't manage to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neurodevelopment","review":"After reading this we lined up an assessment at the study center Dr. Levine started, Success In Mind, in Durham, N.C.

But a couple come pretty close. Fist there's the deliciously lewd \\"Bring On The Nubiles\\", the teacher-student relationship, \\"School Mam\\", and the extra track \\"5 minutes\\". While their is not a loser on the album for some reason it sounds rushed and incomplete. The band's in fine form here and Cornwall sounds angrier than on the fist but the songwriting just is not as good. More outrage than seediness. One things for sure The Stranglers realy try to offend you here and most times they do suceed. \\"I Feel Like a Wog\\" is excellent as is the next track \\"Bitching\\". While later releases still are pretty good, this is also their last really great one where they could even be considered a punk bank(or lumped into the same category).

This is a great read for adventure and it is true. It competes well with fictional Tom Clancy novels. A small U.S. submarine under an unlucky Captain sinks the largest ship in the Japanese Navy.Shinano was the sister ship to the battleship Yamato (A Glorious Way to Die) and converted into a carrier, the size of one of our nuclear carriers today. The Japanese intended to confront the U.S. Navy with the tremendous firepower of the Shinano. Instead a lowly submarine sinks the Shinano on her maiden voyage.Regardless of whether the submarine captain Enright or Ryan wrote the story, it is great adventure. Enright is certainly frank in his views, even about his own shortcomings. Both the Japanese and American sides are presented here and this makes it good reading. One understands the fog of battle, after reading about the pursuit of the carrier. A good quick read which is not fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Thornton - You Only Love Twice: a novel of suspense and romance","review":"This was the first novel I had ever read of Elizabeth Thornton's and as a result, I have summarily purchased every other book she has written.

I found out later that the author has an education in history and it shows in her work. All in all, I really enjoyed this novel and not only did I find it entertaining, but I also found it very interesting as well - a difficult combination making this a very difficult book to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great re-read!","review":"Read this years ago....might even have the paperback still!

I'd recommend looking through the book before purchasing, and if you can put up with the manipulated images, go for it, but I just don't see the point in them.

This book, _Compelled to Write to You_ is about that series of debates and struggles, but it is about so much more. The book is actually a series of letters between a college senior and a writer that she admires. After completing one of his books she was \\"compelled\\" to write him. To her surprise and delight, he responds, and the two enjoy a year long correspondence that covers a range of topics from choosing a vocation to choosing a life partner.

He did his routine on Noah reluctantly building the ark at God's bidding. In a subsequent program he did the Revolutionary War routine, in which the two sides tactics were decided like the flip of a coin at the start of a football game. It was immediately obvious that he was headed for great things. He broke barriers as a comic, then as an actor in a primetime crime series.This disk is of a more mature comic, after he was married with children, and most of the comedy is about that. He never resorted to offensive language to get nervous laughter from an audience pretending to be so very hip. This is the vintage stuff, a seamless stream of telling us what was funny n his own life and acting it out. If you've never seen the Cos as a solo comic, this is a good place to start--or a good place to remember him if you're an old fan--like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"I didn't like this that much - parts are ok but in general it's too slow and something about it I don't like - so fast forwarded after 10 minutes and got done with it quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Cosby Himself","review":"Just not what I expected.

Anyways, I stopped viewing this after 30min as I had not laughed a single time. The jokes about the weekend and alcoholics, as well as the much vaunted dentist skit, were all terribly weak.

Its very technical in detail yet it is reasonably understandable to anyone with average intelligence. Dr. Kervran tells how the life processes is maintained by the living organism's ability to create minerals that it needs from other elemental forms by altering their atomic structures. He mentions osteoporosis, among many other conditions, that develops because the body cannot assimilate calcium directly from foods and supplements which explains why persons with the disease are not helped by taking calcium supplements. He explains that manganese and organic silica will transmutate into an absorbable form of calcium that can reverse the disease. Many other life processes are explained as well. A very fine scientific work that is truly prize worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant work!","review":"Essentially, Kervran has postulated that biological organisms can transmute elements as needed, to some extent, and he proves it.

And I was very disappointed. It was, on the whole, a relatively humane treatment of savagery, that is, given the topic: but yet still too violent, and exagerated. Further, the whole plot became increasingly improbable and without much, if any, of the noetic and spiritual insight I was hoping for. I gave up on the movie 25 odd minutes from the end: it is quite long. In short, too much meaningless cruelty, and not enough thought, or even for that matter, plot. I advise staying with the classics, such as Billy Wilder's \\"Double Indemnity\\", Hitchcock's \\"Rope\\", or perhaps one of Brian De Palma's suspense mysteries. Another film of late, that I highly recommend, btw, is \\"Dark Portals: The Chronicles of Vidocq\\", starring French actor Gerard Depardieu."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent","review":"This is a beautifully-shot, intensely-acted film that, unfortunately, has no intrinsic merit.

This seems to be a recurring fault with Asian horror flicks. The flashing blood and gore ho-hum seen it before. The real crime is there is no real build up before killer comes comes out into the open. This film is leagues away from \\" Audition \\" now that's scary. I wish someone would make a horror film on the life of H.H. Holmes and go into his torture and dismemberment rooms in Howard's Castle that he built under everyones noses downtown Chigago doubled as a hotel at one point in contrast to life as a husband buisness man and doctor.

Violence, robbery, and deception of any kind is justified to teach the evil businessman a lesson. That's the subplot that just doesn't hold up.Jimmy Stewart's character, working with Paulette Goddard's character, \\"save the day\\" by staging a lottery, which they have previously discussed was not legal.

To pick a favorite song is difficult - Alfie, the Christmas Tree; Christmas is Coming; Silent Night (this one makes me cry because it's so beautiful); and Rowlf's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Any one of any age should love this if they love Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday nostalgia","review":"I first received this on RECORD when I was seven years old and recently upgraded to CD. Perhaps it is nostalgia what makes me so fond of this \\"album,\\" but it is still a nice mix of goofy Muppets (Twelve Days of Christmas and Little Saint Nick) and some more serious mixes with the late John Denver (Song for Alfie). It's a holiday tradition at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will never get old!","review":"My family has had this wonderful album since I was a child. We would always listen to it while we would decorate our Christmas tree and put out our other Christmas decorations. I am 19 now and still never get tired of hearing the music-I guess it reminds me of my childhood (corny as it sounds). John Denver has the most beautiful voice-and who could hate the Muppets. The album is perfect in my mind, and I recommend it to all my friends. I am sure that they are tired of hearing me talk about it. If you are looking for wonderful Christmas music to put you in the holiday mood, this is the album for you-NO DOUBT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived on time.","review":"This John Denver cd arrived on time, and a definate must have for John Denver fans. Bought this for a Christmas present for a friend and she is a fan. What a sad day when Mr. Denver passed in the tragic plane crash. I recommend for the John Denver fan in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun, Fun","review":"Have this on LP stored away and gathering dust so was excited to see it available as download! Great fun for the kids and some serious notes for adults. Introduce your children to the Muppets amd take a nostalgic trip at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Denver The Muppets","review":"A delightful collection of Xmas music which is as fresh and sparkling as it was the day it was released. Be sure to get the complete collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are never too old to enjoy this Christmas collection!","review":"I am thankful the people reissued this CD with the tracks that were cut from the previous version! It certainly made my Christmas to hear John Denver teaming up with the Muppets. I suppose John and Jim Henson are having quite the time in Heaven since their passing many years ago. This is a wonderful CD for the kid in all of us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Christmas CD","review":"I don't ordinarily buy music by the Muppets or by John Denver, but my recollection of the special was still strong after so many years that I purchased this cd. It is well worth three times the price. Yes, you do have to put up with muppet voices on the songs, but for the most part, the voices work fine and even add to the songs' charms. The 12 Days of Christmas is usually a deadly recording, but the muppets put a life into it that is amusing and very satisfying. There is more here than \\"cute\\" stuff though. \\"When the River Meets the Sea\\" and \\"Noel: Christmas Eve 1913\\" are both great songs. John Denver plays it very low key and everythings works extraordinarily well. \\"Silent Night\\" is charming. This album is an easy listen for the holidays. A good balance of traditional tunes with contemporary songs gives the listener a nice 45 minutes of holiday spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fave Xmas Album","review":"Not only did I think this is this great for adults but my kids have asked me to stop playing it over and over. This is one of my favorite albums ever. When the River Meets the Sea and It's in Every One of Us are fabulous songs. If you have one ounce of kid in you that part of you will love it and it is much about the deeper Xmas experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Denver & The Muppets Christmas Together","review":"Again, another holiday CD that you MUST have for your collection. I still have the LP version of this album, but do not have a record player. Found this on Amazon, and the memories of my childhood Christmases came back to me. Great music!!! If you're a muppets fan, it's a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKIN","review":"If you love the muppets and even just like John Denver, this is the Christmas Album to get!!! I LOVED IT!

I look forward to sharing it with my kids and grandchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids!!","review":"I got the record as a gift when I was 8. It has been long lost, and I yearn to listen to it again this Christmas even though I am 20--to hear the silliness of \\"Christmas is Coming\\" and \\"The 12 Days...\\" along with the beauty of \\"It's in Every One of Us\\" and \\"Silent Night.\\" Because of this album I have always been a John Denver fan and was greatly saddened by his death. I can think of few other celebrities who would work so perfectly with the Muppets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Christmas album I've EVER heard!","review":"This one spans generations. My children (10, 9 and 7) and I can't listen to this enough. The harmonies and blending of voices is superb - both John and the Muppets at their very best - and the songs range from a rollicking \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\" (with Miss Piggy 'hogging' her part) to rare gems like \\"The Peace Carol\\". A MUST for kids of all ages and for any John Denver fan. This is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD","review":"I dearly wish we could see the original special again but this is the one Christmas album I and my family listen to without fail every year. If you love the Muppets or John Denver or both, you need this in your collection. For me, the definitive version of \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" is by Rolf the dog and Denver. The album is a mix of funny and poignant, and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best Christmas albums ever","review":"I have purchased this album over & over in every format through the years. Everyone that hears it playing in my office wants a copy, so I have given it as gifts as well. There are many different songs & variations of the old and the 12 days of Christmas is Classic Muppets (funny)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one, buy the 13-song version!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS 10-SONG VERSION! It is a rip-off of the original album and original CD release with 13 songs. Laserlight realized their mistake and reissued again with 13 songs. Buy that one instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Songs","review":"This CD is missing songs from the original soundtrack. When you select to hear certain songs from this website, it plays the songs that are missing. For example, \\"Little Saint Nick\\" is not on the CD along with some other songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Christmas CD","review":"I have had this alblum since it first came out on tape back in the 80's it is one of my family's favorites. I had it on cd when it came out to but have worn it out to. If you love John Denvers music and have watched the muppets you must have this cd you will enjoy it for years to come even if it is not Christmas time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are my favorite songs?!?","review":"I bought this CD specifically for my father who loves \\"Where the River Meets the Sea\\". I guess I didn't read far enough down on the reviews to find that is NOT on this CD. There should be something to let people know that this is NOT the same as the LP version - there are 3 songs missing! I'm highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money on a whole album for one song.","review":"I bought this album for the \\"twelve days of Christmas.\\" The rest of the songs are annoying so I wish I just downloaded the one song I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! My ears!","review":"Worst holiday sound since the Bradys. Doesn't get much worse than Miss Piggy and \\"Five Gold Rings!\\" I won't even mention John Denver. Spend you money on better presented holiday music (Boston Pops, Trans-siberian Orchestra, Manheim Steamroller)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite Christmas album","review":"We have had this album(now cd) since we had our second child in '79. Every year we play this while cleaning up the Thanksgiving meal...it's the official beginning of Christmas for us. It still means a lot to me, to listen to this while the youngest of the kids hang the ornaments on the tree. And yes, Joni, the painted macaroni tree ornaments are beautiful, and NO you may not have them yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A (Partial) Christmas Together","review":"This is NOT the original version of this album. Three songs have been deleted--a poignant version of \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", a beautiful rendition of \\"When the River Meets the Sea\\", and a rollicking, fun \\"Little Saint Nick\\". There is no explanation in the liner notes why these three songs were removed. What's left is nice, but incomplete. I recommend that you find the original version of the album if you can and buy it. Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Disappointment","review":"I ordered this cd thinking it was the same as the title of the same name that was released in 1979. I was terribly disappointed to discover that this copy does not have three of the original recordings.

I ordered 4 copies of this cd for them now that they are grown, as a special present, and found too late that it does not contain all of the songs on the original album including some of their favorites. I feel cheated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My favorite! BUT...","review":"This version is missing songs...the best ones, too! Don't buy it, look for the full version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas Album Ever","review":"This is the only Christmas Album that I will listen to during the holidays. My brother and I burned through 2 vinyls of this and I have been trying to lay my hands on the CD for years.This album has some of the most beautiful original Christmas music as well as funny and good versions of classics. Recommended to anyone who has children or who watched the Muppet Show as children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh! the memories. What an endearing recording","review":"Pip who is three just wants to play the wonderfully goofy rendition of the 12 days of Christmas over and over and OVER, but we older Denver fans find the sweet memories of many of the other tunes bring tears to our eyes. Now, if only they could get the rights to release the Christmas video so a new generation could enjoy that also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gentle & wonderful","review":"I've been playing this cd for a very long time, trying to write the words down. is there a song book publsihed for this? please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids","review":"I bought this CD because I have and love John Denver's other two Christmas CDs. I really don't like the Muppets very much, especially Miss Piggy. I expected to program my CD player to play only the John Denver songs. I was surprised that I actually enjoy some of the songs the Muppets do. John Denver and the Muppets make a surprisingly good combination.So, even if you don't like the Muppets, or if you've written this CD off as a kiddie CD, think again.Here's a tip to save you some money. If you don't already own John Denver's Christmas Like a Lullaby CD, buy A John Denver Christmas double CD instead of this one. It includes both the Muppet CD and the Christmas Like a Lullaby CD for barely more money than it costs to buy either one alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange","review":"I read a few of the reviews and I am quite baffled.

Excellent quality and just love the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you get the version with 13 songs instead","review":"A Christmas classic. But make sure you get the version with \\"Little Saint Nick,\\" \\"Where the River Meets the Sea\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\" Those may the three best songs and they're inexplicably missing on this version. Otherwise, this is absolutely a 5-star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does BMG music ever read these?","review":"I too, have been searching for the complete CD of The Muppets and John Denver - A Christmas Together, with all 13 songs. We still have the LP, which my children grew up listening to. The first CDs that came out DID have all 13 songs on it, as we bought, but my son lost his.After buying another one in 2001, we noticed that even though the item number remained identical on the CD, there were 3 less songs.I have attempted to email the customer service department at BMG, but never received a reply. At least we can still play the LP when the kids are home at Christmas, but I keep hoping...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great versions for children and adults","review":"John Denver and Jim Henson, although they passed away 7 years apart, died at the same age of 53. They both had short lives but in their short lives they entertained people of all ages. This album is no exception to it as both they and the Muppets put together a Christmas album which is among favorites. As the reviewers before mentioned, make sure you have the full version of this album, as the album is not complete without all of the tracks from the original 1979 edition. The CD is worth every cent for the laughs and the music of this special time of year."},{"rating":"1","title":"10-song version is a rip off","review":"The 10-song version is an absolute ripoff. The newest, third release of this CD has 13 songs as does the original album and CD release. Do NOT buy the 10-song version. It is worth getting the 13-song version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Great album! I have fond memories of listening to it when I was a kid. There are several songs that really touch my heart. John Denver had a beautiful voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"always been a Muppets fan","review":"I'm 53 years old and always been a Muppet fan. I will have to say that Mannhiem Steamroller is my favorite for Christmas music. There are some really good songs on here and the rest are good. I'm not typically a John Denver fan but I do like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"I grew up listening to this album and just bought the MP3 so my children could enjoy it as well. It is a great choice for the whole family; good holiday choices that appeal to kids while not driving the parents crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Together","review":"This CD brought back wonderful memories from childhood as we enjoyed listening to the album version in the 80's.

I cannot recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Denver & the Muppets: it may sound weird but it's great","review":"I've owned this CD for almost 10 years now. I bought it at a special low price thinking that I would probably like just a few songs on it and hate most of it; and the few songs I liked would make me feel that I got my money's worth. Boy, was I wrong! I love all the songs on here.I've seen complaints from people that the CD is missing a couple of songs. The version I own isn't missing the songs in question. Evidently there are two different versions available.If a person isn't already a John Denver fan or didn't grow up with the Muppets, then I would probably have a hard time recommending this CD to them. But most young adults today did grow up watching the Muppets/Sesame Street and are therefore familiar with the lightheartedness and the dry wit of the Muppets. This CD has a special place in my Christmas music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE Laserlight VERSION OF THIS CD!!!","review":"Do not buy this version of the Muppets \\"Christmas Together\\"! Many Muppets fans, including myself, have been tricked into buying this cd thinking it was the original... when in fact it is missing 3 of the most important songs (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Little Saint Nick, and When the River Meets the Sea). Do not support this [cd]! If you grew up listening to this album every Chirstmas like I did - you will be very dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE REAL DEAL","review":"This is normally a 5 star album, but I am deducting a star for each song that was (savagely) cut from the album. I fully recommend purchasing the 13 song version of this album, not the 10 song version. Unfortunately, it is out of print and hard to find. Thus, I reccommend EBAY or HALF.COM and buy it used. It will be worth whatever extra amount of money you have to pay, just read the rest of the reviews to find that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Total Album","review":"I recieved this CD as a gift. I was excited since I listened to this album as a child. After listing to it I realaized that there was 3 songs missing. Little Saint Nick with Animal on the drums, Have Yourself a Merry LIttle Christmas and When the River Meets the Sea. I was dissapointed with this CD. Had it not been a gift I would have not bought it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really takes me back!","review":"I remember when I was a child, seeing this Muppets Christmas special on TV at Christmas time. I always looked forward to it. The Muppets were a big part of my childhood. When I found this album for sale, I was pleasantly surprised. I had never seen it in the stores before. I listened to it as soon as I got home. It really brought back wonderful memories for me. I'm sure I'm just blinded by nostalgia, but I really think this is one of the best Christmas albums out there. John Denver and Rolf singing \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" is my favorite song on the CD. It's one of many Christmas Classics, along with some contemporary songs like \\"Little Saint Nick.\\" It's simply and outstanding album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Christmas C.D....","review":"This is a great Christmas C.D. and well worth the great Amazon price.

This CD is a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"muppets & John Denver","review":"I had this as an album for years. We did an entire Christmas play to it for church when my son was 8. The only problem with the new CD is that it is missing 2 songs, one being a favorite, \\"Merry Christmas St Nick\\". also, Kermit's nephew Robin singing \\"when the river meets the sea\\". They should reproduce a CD in complete state, not leave off songs"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Together","review":"I am so glad to have found this CD-- I used to listen to this sound track on record and not only during the Christmas season but all year round- I'm sure that I drove my mother nuts- but she always let me listen to it whenever I wanted but eventually it wore out- My favorite songs on this album are \\"We wish you a Merry Christmas\\" and \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\"- I don't think that I would have ever learned \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" if not for the album- I'm a big Miss Piggy fan and both of these songs had her personality in them- it was my favorite part- when I listen to this I know the memmories will come flooding back."},{"rating":"2","title":"a favorite","review":"This is one of my favorite Christmas albums.

I loved the album and am delighted to have it on CD.....I'm 50yo and my teenagers call this old man music....I like to play it in the car as I drive, the whines and complaints just add to the experience! Rod croaks it out well and Ronnie plays great! Get this while you can....Paulos"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful insights into Carter, the man.","review":"I have studied Egypt for many years and just happened upon this book. What I found inside was a completely different man than what I had expected. His love for his work, his humility in the face of great celebrity, his reverence for the dead boy king are touching and uplifting. How fortunate is history that two men such as Howard Cater and Lord Carnarvon were entrusted with this amazing discovery and how generous of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to send a photographer of Harry Burton's abilities to record all of this for us. I wish I could find a biography on Carter, for he is a complex and fascinating man."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like being there!","review":"There are two things that make this book special: Mr. Carter's description of not only what he sees as he enters the tomb, but his emotions as well. The other special feature is that the book's pictures have been interjected within his story in close proximity to what Carter is describing at the time.Carter also makes it extremely easy to understand what he is describing by referencing specific plate numbers. This is useful when the reader is not familiar with the name of an item because it never existed in modern times.For a person who enjoys reading stories of true events, Mr. Carter has given us a gem of a book. My only wish is that Mr. Carter had available to him at the time the technology of color film. His descriptions of what he sees and the stiking colors he witnessed in the tomb leave one yearning for color prints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough detail in discoveries.","review":"I did now wish for this book at all. Even though it was written by the man who discovered the tomb, I don't believe it. There must be another Howard Carter out there who wrote the book. It seemed like a kindergarten schoolboy could write this book. The pictures (which aren't even good) take up most of the book because the author probably didn't know what to right. Take my advice and put this book back on the shelf where you got it. It doesn't even deserve a \\"1\\" rating, if there were negative ratings, then I would give it a -13. Horrible is the only word to describe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book for teenagers...","review":"This is especially for those just starting out in their walk with God. The designs and layout of the book are catchy and eye-appealing. This book is made to challenge teens to a higher walk with God. Great insight throughout it all. Was very much enjoyed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Christians early in their walk with God","review":"I think this is an excellent book and would suggest it to many people. Unfortunately, i found it to be lacking in anything that would be help me becasue alot of it is challenging you to do things that many christians more mature in their walk of faith have already done. It would not apply to all teens, but it would apply to most teens. If it did apply to you, it would be a life-changing book I guarantee.Amy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty Funk","review":"This CD is the heezy! I had several Bushwacka releases on vinyl but never a full album until this little gem. This is some very intellegent breaks with a very dark feel to it. Shining throught sets it off and it never looks back from there. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evolution of House","review":"Every so often, house takes an evolutionary step. Sometimes it hearkens to the past, like Daft Punk's lo-fi funk. At other times, it points to the future, like Basement Jaxx' 'Remedy.''Night Works' IS the future. The basslines are direct, the percussion loose yet exact, the melodies moving. They do a great job of combining a live-band's flair with sequenced, thoughtful musings. The whole album resides in the realm of groove, both uptempo and downtempo. 'All Night Long' is the big club hit off the album, and deservedly so, but the true high point is ...I can't say - you'll have to find out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow did I get sucked in: total waste...","review":"This book is applicable to anyone with tons of cash to spare on a party hosted in 1954.

God's Gift to Women was a very good easy read. I couldn't put it down! I agree that it's like Fatal Attraction but unlike the movie the fatal attraction isn't the only thing going on in the novel. This novel goes into dealing with relationships and how to move on from past hurts and put your self out on a limb for a relationship. Again this was a very good novel, I laughed and got angry. I will be reading more of Baisden's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Thanks to Hurricane Frances I was marooned in the house for four days without anything else to read, else I would never have made it to the end. Forget the editing problems, the story itself is unoriginal but if the writing was fresher it could still have been interesting. This book is basically a black version of the movie \\"Fatal Attraction\\" minus the rabbit boiling on the stove. The most promising thing about it was the first chapter, which opens with Julian being shot. Too bad it goes downhill from there. The more I read, the more I disliked him and hoped he would get his comeuppance."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"maybe i'm in denial but it's hard to believe anyone could be so crazy.

The author took you through an episode of one night of hot steamy sex and how Julian paid the consequences of a deranged crazy lunatic who wanted him all to herself. Sadly, Eddie paid the price. It was a cut above the movie \\"Fatal Attraction\\". My only regret is that the book fell short of 5 stars due to many typos and grammatical errors through out the book. It displays a bad reflection on Mr. Basiden that his publishing company would distribute such an excellent book with so many mistakes. I still enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama Galore!","review":"This book was filled with drama. Lots of twists to the plot! The book has real love, lust, sex, murder, suspense...every element of a good book is in this one! Glenn Close in movie Fatal Attraction had nothing on Olivia (the stalker in this book). I read this book in 24 hours. I could not put it down. I gave this book 4 stars because of the endless number of typographical errors in this book. Did anyone proofread it???Other than that it was perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Black Fatal Attraction -- With a Twist\\"","review":"This book was okay. If you've seen \\"Fatal Attraction\\", you know the outcome (but with a twist). \\"Men Cry in the Dark\\" was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I agree with some of the other viewers that said that this story line was predictable.Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down until I found out what the end result would be and I wasn't surprised. I would really give the book 4 1/2 stars.One thing that did concern me was the unsafe sex that Julian was indulging in. Overall it was a good book and I would recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT LIKE","review":"I did not like this book. It started off slow and gets even slower in the middle.

It's refreshing to read about characters other than drug dealers, hoochies, hard living and ghetto fantasies. I read the book in one day. I hope you continue to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Read","review":"Ok, I have read all of Michael Baisden's books and they have all been \\"good\\". It seens as though in each of his books the main character is Mr. Baisden's altered ego. Which is sometimes not a good thing.Julian character was a good depiction of a man who is hard-working, responsible man who is trying to raise a daughter on his own, unfortunately, I did not like how Julian took very little interest in his daughter, he seemed more focused on his career than his daughters activities. Which ultimately lead to the **Psycho Babe** ruining their lives.There were many typos in this book, and unfortunately, it makes the reading a little rough.I will recommend this book because he did provide a storyline with suspense.-Prosperity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Story...","review":"I thought God's Gift To Women was the perfect book to snuggle up with at night.

Highly reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!!","review":"I couldn't put the book down. I purchased it on Saturday, on Sunday I was done! This book will make you think twice about having a one night stand. (Julian) made it clear to (Olivia) that they would only have the one night. But (Olivia) had her mind made up that (Julian) was her man. I loved this book! I laughed, cried, was creeped out a few times, and wished that I was (Teri) when her and (Julian) hooked up! I recommend this book highly! My mother just called me, she wants to borrow my book today! I'll have to make sure I get it back.

He has to start writing some more novels....as quick as Michael Basiden writes them, I'm finishing them....keep doing what you do best!.....WRITING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable!!!","review":"This book was totally predictable, you could just read the book cover, and not bother with the rest. I had such high hopes for an exciting end, but no.. nothing surprising or interesting about it.Not only did the main character not learn his lesson (he had unprotected sex with his next partner) but he failed to even alert the authorities. None of the characters were well developed except for maybe Julian, but neither the \`crazed' stalker nor his Houston love interest had any depth as characters. Since this book was not written in first person this is inexcusable.This was a fast read, but without the twists and turns or any oohs and ahhs, not really worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wham! Bam! No Thanks for the QUICKIE Mr. Baisden!!!","review":"Been there! Read this before...Mr. Baisden has such great potential; I have followed him from book one. This book has all the makings to be a great story but it is just too quick! I keep visualizing Angela Bassett and Martin Lawrence in a movie similar to this story...This story was just too predictable. I am praying that Mr. Baisden's 'broadening' does NOT affect his writing skills so that he becomes another commercialized-money-generating writer that we already have too many of! Want some intrigue? try BLACKFUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HOPE THIS IS A PHASE","review":"THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH IT AND ONLY BECAUSE I SPENT MY OWN MONEY FOR IT. I LOVE HIS OTHER BOOKS AND EVEN WENT TO SEE THE PLAY FOR \\"MEN CRY IN THE DARK\\". I TRULY BELIEVE SOMEONE ELSE WROTE THIS BOOK AND PAID MR. BAISDEN TO PUT HIS NAME ON IT. UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is nothing more than movie plagarism!!","review":"This book is a ghetto combination of 2 good movies, Michael Douglas' Fatal Attraction and Clint Eastwood's Play Misty for Me. What kept nagging me was the arrest/fight scene between the obsessed female and the police. I read it over and over, trying to remember where else I had heard or read this confrontation. Again, I figured it out!! It is the article which appeared in a certain prominent African-American (small-sized) magazine when Lionel Ritchie's first wife (Brenda, I think) first found out he was cheating on her.Mr. Baisden, you should be ashamed of yourself!! You need to improve your writing skills and research your subject matter before you ever write another book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Predictable. Ridiculous","review":"This book was very predictable from page to page. Too much drama! The victim (Julian Payne) could have put a stop to this madness after the 2nd page. The probablity of all these events occuring and this crazy lady not being apprehended are 1000:1. Do not waste your time reading this book. Mantianance Man was written much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I have read all of Baisden books but this one was too predictable. It may be a great read for some people, but this book should have had some kind of suspense. As soon as he met Olivia it was obvious what was going to happen. I read the book in a day, but only because I am a fast reader. This would have been better as a short story for teenagers without such explicit parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down!!","review":"Lets see where I could possibly start with this one. Okay, let me just give it to you guys straight. Predictable plot, poorly written, and under developed characters. Lucky for me I borrowed this one from a friend. I found myself becoming greatly aggravated with the author with each page that I turned. There was a point where even the description of the ...character changed. ... So simply put. I would leave this one in [web] inventory. Check it out at the library, heck borrow it from a friend. To spend money on this one will be a great loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychotic Woman... same ole story","review":"I gave the book 1 star simply because it's probably Mr. Baisden's best written book out of all the ones I've read.However, I suppose I'm dissapointed in the development of the charactors. It may have been better if we hadn't found out what happens to him in the beginning of the book and then have to read through all of the drama, and poor decisions he makes to get there.I do think it's good to get a male perspective in fiction, however it's scary that his protaganist Dr. Terri seems to have almost as many issues as his antagonist Olivia.I'd like to see him use his style on more developed characters and stories and less on stereotypical drama.I only read this one for a book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Suspense Another Michael Baisden Classic","review":"I have every book and the material just keeps getting better and better. the characters in this book are above the rest, I am amazed at the way he brings the characters into the whole story and tells it in different situations. and its great"},{"rating":"2","title":"God's Gift to Women","review":"God's Gift to Women was a joy to read. This was a very good book that was very hard to put down. While stopped at the red light the thought had crossed my mind to pick up this book an continue reading. I was anxious to see what was going to happen next. The book had me sitting on the edge of my seat. This one night affair started out as something to good to be true. She was someone with good looks, great legs, and they both had agreed that no strings attached. There are women as well as men that are mentally disturbed. Olivia was not aware of her problem. We all should be careful when it comes to the feelings of others. Hopefully everyone that was able to read this book will understand Olivia illness. We should think twice before sleeping around. Michael Basiden books has always been a pleasure to read. This book is recommended to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are the little version of Back Street Boys","review":"my vewiew of them is not all that good. even though i do like them a little bit. i think that they can write there own songs and stop copping tha back street boys.

It was interesting at first to compare the characters of the play to the same names we read about in history books. I felt that this is one of Shakespeare's most difficult books to interpret in today's language. Even though this edition does have extensive foot (or in this book, side) notes, the reading process was confusing having to look back in forth. If you are just reading this play to read some Shakespeare, try another less difficult Shakespeare work, like A COMEDY OF ERRORS. Thsi is much easier to understand, and for beginners, you will probably enjoy it more. But if you are a beginner looking for a tragedy, try ROMEO and JULIET. While the language can be confusing at time, this classic story should really be read by all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Boring!

Standard texts have footnotes to help you to understand how he uses certain words, but after looking up a few dozen of these, I find myself starting to lose the thread of the story line. The \\"Shakespeare Made Easy\\" approach has been a godsend for me. Now, whenever I run into a difficult passage, I can glance over to the other side of the book and read the same passage in plain English. A light bulb blinks on, and I say, \\"Aha! That's what this means!\\" Unfamiliar words are instantly translated for me as I see them in the context of a passage which I now understand fully.

I personally disagree with the Editorial Reviews. I don't think it was slackly written. In order to appreciate Lawler's book, I believe you must have some knowledge of the business or have watched wrestling to enjoy his book in any sence.I personally enjoy reading stories about how wrestlers made it into the business. The wrestling business makes the wrestlers seem larger than life, but the trust is they are just like everyone else, human! Everyone makes mistakes in their life, no ones perfect, so as far as the Editorial Reviews go Lawler may have \\"cheated\\" on his first two wives, but like I said everyone makes mistakes, right or wrong?I think that Lawler did a good job of writting his book, and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys wrestling.

It was funny and I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memphis history, sad ending","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, compared to the hype with other recent WWE releases. I was pleasantly surprised, though.Lawler gives us his take on an amazing career, without overly taking credit for inventing the entire business the way others did (coughcoughHogancoughPiper). If you were a fan of some of his wild Memphis angles, you'll love the description he gives here, not to mention the backstory of how Jimmy Hart, Kamala, Andy Kaufman and others got their starts.The sad part of it comes towards the end where he talks about losing Stacy and how he tries to find a woman, any woman to replace her, albeit just for outward appearances. He comes across as a real person, and not the Memphis superhero some may expect, and that's true throughout the book.Not required reading the way Mick Foley's books are, but definitely not a bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this thing","review":"I got this USB 2.0 card and tried with my card reader and mp3 player.

Though many are aware of the title track,( One Nation Under a Groove\\" THE Funk Anthem) much of the rest of the album has been over looked.

The salt-and-sea spray of \\"La Mer\\" is ideally rendered, while the langour of \\"Faun\\" and the subtleties of \\"Nocturnes\\" are likewise beautifully realized. A combination of graceful and powerful playing by the Leipzig Radio Orchestra along with the amazingly clear yet powerful sonics put this recording at the top of a list of many distinguished accounts. I won't be discarding my CDs by Boulez (Sony), Martinon (EMI) or Karajan's 1964 DG \\"La Mer\\", but this will be the recording I reach for when I want to hear these magical scores.

Beyond Samuel Jackson, the only saving grace of this movie is the sexy assassin played by Emily Mortimer. An almost unrecognizable Meatloaf (yes.. the rock singer) also has a small part but adds little to this formula.The plot relies on a very odd and offbeat offering of comedic and at times graphic violence. The plot is old and worn out but the movie however, invokes a few laughs. In many parts you will ask yourself, \\"what the hell was that all about?\\".If you like Samuel Jackson you may like it.

The very important issue that is addressed in the film often gets lost in a quagmire of directorial missteps. Perhaps that's why the film maker attempts to make the same points over and over again in a manner that is so transparent as to be somewhat insulting to the audience. The soundtrack is the highlight of the film and it is actually quite good.

This book is a top notch overview of the history of fat and how it got such a bum rap.I highly recommend this book to readers who are interested in the science of nutrition. I do wish though that there were more recipes in the book but the information presented in it more than makes up for that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad Advice Book","review":"This appears to be a way for the author to justify eating the fatty foods that she likes and to ignore dietary advice provided by the American Heart Association and other medical groups. If she followed a low-fat diet and still didn't lose weight, I submit that perhaps she didn't count calories carefully enough! By the looks of the photo of her in this book, however, it doesn't look like she lost weight even after changing her eating habits. Hmmmm... Could it be that she takes in more calories than she burns, and is consequently overweight?Also, I think any diet as restrictive as the one outlined in this book is flawed and potentially dangerous, particularly when not backed up with decades of well-documented scientific evidence.

Brel devoted 15 years of his live to continuous touring, playing in every possible music hall, from Russia to the USA.

She also finds it amusing to sing about eating fruits and vegetables, and when she is eating them, talks about how Boz would be proud of her.

Though a burglar, he is a gentlemen with great cunning and a suave personality. I laughed at how he outsmarts Inspector Ganimard in the stories (in a way it reminds of of Lupin III and Inspector Zenigata). Lupin is a gentlemen and master of diguise with many aliases and appearances.

Afraid to try now.Thank you for your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traditional music, but too much singing and not enough drum","review":"The songs are in a traditional Egyptian rythmn which makes them easy to dance to and play zills, but I found the emphasis on singing not very appealing. There are few drum solos since most of the tracks are songs, and there is not much variety. As a dancer, I am less interested in this CD than in others that have less emphasis on singing and more emphasis on varied rythms and drums."},{"rating":"2","title":"lot of useful information","review":"I was surprised at the hands on experience you pick up from this book.

I think if you are a beginner gardener you might find some of the Nearing's gardening ideals helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome backpack","review":"This backpack is exactly what I wanted, albeit a little expensive. My wife has a Timbuk2 messenger bag, so when I needed a backpack, I checked out their stuff. Very smartly laid out, lots of pockets to keep things organized. It is hands-down the most comfortable backpack I have ever carried. It's not small, but it sits so nicely on my shoulders that it feels like carrying something much less substantial. I bought it on Amazon because they had the same price as the Timbuk2 website, but I got free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"GORGEOUS SHOES BUT!!!","review":"This shoe is truly fabulous but the sizing is a bit off in my case. Some of the other reviews stated that the shoe slipped off and was too big so i bought a half size smaller which is quite uncomfortable for me. Amidst all that, the colour and style is amazing, it is a very sturdy shoe especially for the height and extremely sexy but i would advise that you purchase your normal shoe size. It may be the best suggestion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ADORABLE! Love them!","review":"These shoes are HOT! I love the scoop on the inside by the arch...just HOT!

I totally agree, and it is one of my most played cds over the years. Now Decca has released a remastered version that is absolutely beautiful in sound quality, not to mention over one half hour of bonus tracks. The original cd does not have bad sound quality, which might make some fans reluctant to upgrade. However, the sound on this version is incredible and a must for at least all Caravan fans, even if you already have the earlier one. The bonus tracks are great and also in excellent sound. There are alternate versions including Golf Girl with different lyrics. There is also some previously unreleased material. Needless to say, with all of these credits, it was well worth the money from Amazon. One of the best, got even better. Fans of early Genesis not familiar with Caravan, may be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same lousy master tape as the previous DERAM release","review":"I bought this because my current copy of the CD has a loud click and missing audio exactly 40 seconds into Nine Feet Underground.Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this \\"REMASTERED\\" version with bonus tracks has exactly the same problem.This is no improvement over the previous DERAM release, and I recommend looking for a copy from a different label."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time Machine Back to my Teens","review":"For any Brit who was in his or her teens or twenties in the late 60's/early 70's and who had a discerning ear, this album probably rates very highly. The two tracks that \\"bring it all back again\\" for me are the title track and \\"Golf Girl.\\" The \\"Canterbury Sound\\", with its combination of whimsy and serious commitment to art, stands out from the banality of much of the era's popular culture. Beyond Hastings' and Sinclair's whimsy are engaging melodies that are replete with interesting time signatures supported by subtle harmony. Although their eponymous first album has a raw creativeness that perhaps surpasses this album, \\"Gray and Pink\\" is perhaps the Caravan album I would choose if I were only allowed one on my desert island. This is a must have album for afficianados of the \\"Canterbury Sound.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A visit from the past","review":"I bought this album back in the 70's when I was 16 years old. A friend recommended it back then as an entry level record for \\"not the usual staff\\" progressive type of music. Although I have not listened to the album for some 20 years now, the music and the lyrics still hover in my head! Since then I lost the album, and browsing through amazon it came back to me as a record I must have in my collection. Really outstanding album, highly recommended to anyone interested in the \\"not so popular\\", \\"jazzy type of staff\\", \\"nobody can dance to\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop whimsey by Limeys at its finest","review":"This remains a funny wee album. Naff lyrics (think Tolkein on acid written on a blotter at Eton) but they kind of work because the music is such good quality pop. What I mean is I can have it on in the background and there is enough going on to make it interesting. Good musicians and an eclectic mix of styles make it a bit of a bubbling brook. It ends with some very dark, rock like boogie (last part of \\"Nine Feet Underground\\"). Can't say anything else of Caravan did the business for me, but this warm bath of an album can stay in the collection and occupy its niche with some pride. If you are a fan of late sixties-early seventies pop that is not bubblegum (although \\"Golf Girl\\" gets close), then give this a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy atmosphere, but bland and boring","review":"There seemed to be a bit of promise with Walled In, especially considering the film's opening sequence and the creepy atmosphere offered up by the building most of the film takes place in, but alas, the film as a whole is a rather bland and boring affair. The OC's Mischa Barton stars as a demolition agent employed to research said creepy building for future demolishment, only to discover the building's (and its architect's) dark secrets and be obsessed over by a creepy teen (Cameron Bright). While Walled In does have a lot going for it, and Barton is actually pretty decent in the lead, the film just plods along in its relative predictability, until finally concluding in a pretty laughable ending. Still, the gloomy atmosphere does give Walled In a bit of redeeming value, but in the end, there really isn't much here to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enteraining","review":"I am not a horror regular, but I found this film to be much more entertaining than most. It had some freshness and style and was not simply a run of the mill slasher film. These can be entertaining too if I am in the mood, and sometimes I am. This was suspenseful enough but had more \\"puzzle\\" in it than blood and that worked for me. I give it four stars for being adequate as a horror film but refreshingly different. I would not call it cheap thrills.Hard core horror fans should give more weight to the details provided by some of the other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum boring snooze fest","review":"Ho-hum boring snooze fest. Neat building is scheduled for demolition, the story of who lives in said building and it's past. The Demo expert Sam (Mischa Barton) who is brought in to take down the behemoth, becomes stroke fodder for teen boy who lives in the building with his nut job mother (deborah kara unger). The teen boy ends up falling in love with the pretty demo girl and it's all down hill from here. Good acting and a cool setting can not save this slow and tired story, as nothing really happens other then you are the one who feels walled in. I just kept checking the clock to see if time really had come to a complete stand still or maybe I had just slipped into a coma from boredom. Do not waist your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was horrible.","review":"This movie was horrible.There was no chemistry between any of the cast members, and although the acting was okay, the writing was ghastly.It was about as thrilling as someone reading a cereal box onscreen. I wasn't at any moment frightened by the haunted \\"architect\\" or whatever he was supposed to be, I was just psychological bored. When I wasn't naturally asleep, that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is great!","review":"I've never listened to bluegrass as I am a rock-n-roll, heavy metal, and alternative listener (along with some occasional, really good blues). I saw a performance on the Conan O'Brien show by Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder doing \\"Walls of Time,\\" and it absolutely blew me away! I figured if the rest of the CD was just half as good as that one tune I heard on the show, then I must buy it. I did buy it & I listen to it everyday on my way to and from work! When not in use, I keep it right next to my Metallica CD...go figure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything a follow up should be.","review":"This cd is great. Every aspect is done in classic Ricky Skaggs perfectionist style. Songs that catch your ear are \\"Pig in a Pen\\" played at a supersonic speed, \\"Canemara\\" with some great solos all around, & \\"Little Bessie\\" that bends a harp into bluegrass mode with perfection. Ricky once again comes through with a stellar cast of performers including the return of an amazing young guitar player Bryan Sutton, Smilin' Jim Mills on banjo,& Bobby Hicks on fiddle. An interesting part of the liner notes tells of Bryan Sutton starting a solo career. That should be an interesting developement. The production of this cd is top quality with flawless fades and a sound that is way better than average for any label. This cd is a must for any country music fan or die hard drum- hating Bluegrass lover like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"must listen\\" Bluegrass album from Skaggs","review":"'Ancient Tones' is yet another instant classic Bluegrass album from Ricky Skaggs, and a worthy follow-up to last year's best Bluegrass album 'Bluegrass Rules'. Fire and lightning from Ricky's ace band, Kentucky Thunder, and absolutely dead-on vocals make this an essential album for Bluegrassers. At times, the musicianship goes overboard - but that's half the fun of Bluegrass music. Parking lot pickers will be talking about Ricky's absolutely roasting hot \\"Pig in a Pen\\" for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, album for those who like \\"old time\\" bluegrass","review":"I was never that interested in bluegrass until recently, but I ordered a Ricky Skaggs CD on the advice of a friend, and now I'm glad it's not made of vinyl, because if it were it would be worn out in the 2 weeks I've had it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pickin', good lead singin', average harmonies","review":"You just can't help but jump around a little when you listen to these tunes. So what if we've heard some of the songs before? All bluegrass albums have at least one \\"TRAD\\" on them. Must be a rule. Ricky Skagg's voice is as clear and true as ever and carries all the emotion it ever has. Seems like he could find a singer whose voice is better matched to his to sing harmonies. Anyway, it's worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ethereal melodies","review":"This single is inexpensive - anyone who is unfamiliar with Type O Negative should try this. Type O fans should also invest in it - add to their collection. This is relatively tame Type O - it's a good way to begin. Start simple, then buy October Rust. You'll be thanking yourself profusely(and me!). ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Type O Negative - Cinnamon Girl","review":"This is a pretty useless single, sorry, but it is. Two tracks, neither of which are exclusive to the CD. I've never been a fan of Cinnamon Girl, I always thought the track was one of their weakest, and the remix is really nothing special. The edit of Love You to Death only detracts from how great the original, full length song is. Nothing new here, for completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good single","review":"I saw this for sale at the local Borders, so I bought it. The next day, I dragged myself back to get The Least Worst Of. If you haven't heard of Type O Negative, you need to get this. If you're a hardcore fan, then both songs are on The Least Worst Of, so you don't need to wase four dollers. Great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy Bears.","review":"Comfortable and warm. Wearing this toboggan will keep you in style, while showing your Bears pride.The hat itself is just a little over 2 foot long.

I couldnt believe nobody mentioned the amazing drum work on this album. AMAZING work on drums, vocals, and well, everything else. This band was WAY ahead of it's time. They definately stack up well against today's bands. I still have this album on vinyl. I'm buying the CD version too so that I can make everyone listen to it while in my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 80's greatest albums (and bands)","review":"This album is quintessential 80's, but is still as fresh today as it was when it was released. It would absolutely be one of my \\"stranded-on-a-desert-island-with-ten-discs\\" picks! Spring Sessions M reeks with super talent, energy, and creativity. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"I have wanted this album for years and finally purchased it. a bit on the expensive side but well worth it. It has all the hits i remembered and a few i forgot. some filler material but what a greast debut album. Too bad that large egos didn't allow them to continue and provide us with more music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhyme & Reason","review":"Ask a diehard Zappa-band fan and you'll quickly recognize that four of the five members of Missing Persons are Zappa alums. So yes - the band is super-tight, disciplined, and bent. However, as another reviewer points out, there is an unavailable MP disk named Rhyme & Reason that, for my money, is the high point of Missing Persons' creative trajectory. Unfortunately, while the songs were pop (per the MP 'mission statement'), they had become a bit too sophisticated for general consumption and the album tanked. Now, you can't even buy the best album MP ever produced! Rhyme & Reason: The Closer That You Get - Give - Now Is The Time - Surrender Your Heart - Clandestine People - Right Now - All Fall Down - Racing Against Time - Waiting For A Million Years - If Only For The Moment. Snap it up if you can find it; it's a 5-Star platter of choice cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive & Amazing New Wave Album","review":"Missing Persons defined 80's new wave. I actually give it 4.5 stars. If a person wanted to know what the 80's decade sounded like you would give them a copy of Spring Session M. This album is amazing every track is good you won't skip on this CD. There sound was very ecclectic Dale Bozzio's voice is so unique with her trade mark hiccup. Terry Bozzio is an amazing drummer. I just recently saw Missing Persons live at a venue in my hometown obviously not the original lineup but Dale still looked and sounded incredible one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Standout tracks Noticeable Ones, Window, the famous Destination Unknown, and Walking in LA but the whole album is catchy. Missing Persons were pioneers of synth new wave modern rock and Spring Session M proves it. Essential album in collection to anyone who truly likes 80's new wave."},{"rating":"1","title":"The death knell of New Wave.","review":"The best thing about New Wave after this album is that there wasn't any. This fortunately was officially the tail end of the scene. I didn't mind the jerky robot singing of Devo but this stuff was just an annoying bad copy of it. They were the ultimate pretentious new wave band ever, they looked like they went to New Wave 'R Us to get their outfits. This woman cant sing, she sounds like a bird being tortured and the band is sickening bubblegum mush. I'm just glad they killed the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Mayhem!","review":"This book is straight out about the things folks want to keep in the dark when they throw their hats into the world of politics. It was real life story and it was the bomb! This book was filled with drama, misunderstandings and true love. I would rate it a '10' if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first real anti-militaristic war movie","review":"The movie focuses on the immense stupidity and brutality of the French commanding officers during WWI. Only since the late 1970s was this movie allowed to show in France - this is in itself a warrant of how disturbing the message of the movie is. I consider Paths of Glory as the ancestor of films like Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the Very Best Films Ever Made","review":"This is a horrifying and nearly perfect masterpiece about murder committed by stupid and brutal old men, enacted through the merciless, relentless apparatus of government and despite the revulsion of humans compelled to the service of that institution. But the subject is not the art.The brilliance of this film is Kubrick's refusal to edit. Three innocent men walk slowly with a priest to their deaths. One cries, one is silent and one is gravely wounded. There are no cut-scenes of cheesy grimaces, no falsely protracted or contracted time and there is no hope or mercy. The firing squad aims and shoots and the men are dead.The subject is murder. The art is so good that we are sickened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gutwrenching! Thank goodness it was only a movie!!!","review":"This movie is about France vs. Germany in WWII, and has some strange irony between it and the war in Iraq right now. 3 Frenchmen are made scapegoats and given needless courts martial trials, just as several of the American Troops have been given unnecessarily. Very emotional, and it will help you visualize how Generals and those who seek power will do anything and everything to get it, and then do anything and everything to keep it. Watch this movie! I can't say it was 'enjoyable', but it was certainly entertaining. It's one of those movies like Schindler's List, that will move you emotionally. It's very moving, and I'd give it two thumbs up. If I had more than 2 thumbs, I'd 'up' them too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paths of Glory is another Kubrick Masterpiece","review":"Kirk Douglas defends 3 men on trial for their lives during World War One.Film is great on all levels.Most of film does not take place on battlefield, but back in the rear.It is more of a study of one aspect of war rather than just the overrall fighting.Its focus is on the ethics of warfare.Macready(General Moreau) orders his own artillery to fire on his own men in order to get them to take the ant hill.The men refuse to advance because German fire too intense(it is a meat grinder beyond no-mans land).Now, 3 men are chosen as examples(to be tried and then executed for cowardice in the line of duty).Excellent, well-acted film is brilliant.(Look for Kubrick's wife at the end of film as German girl singing to French Troops in a particularly moving scene)."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most overpowering piece of cinema I have ever seen","review":"A FRIEND OF MINE,CHANCING UPON THE FILM AT THE SCENE OF THE POST-MORTEM INTO THE ANTHILL ATTACK,UPON HEARING THE LINES OF GENERALS BROULARD AND MIREAU,INQUIRED AS TO WHETHER THE FILM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY.IF ONE FILM PRELUDES \\"DR STRANGELOVE\\" AS NIGHTMARE COMEDY,THIS IS IT.BE IT THE POMPOUS GAIT OF GEORGE MCCREADY AS HE IS SERENADED BY ADOLPHE MENJOU,WAYNE MORRIS'S SNIDE GLANCES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CORPORAL PARRIS AND PRIVATE LEJEUNE,TO THE CREMEE DE LA CREME,RICHARD ANDERSON'S HISTRIONICS AT HIS SUMMING-UP,ONE IS TEMPTED TO DOUBLE UP IN LAUGHTER AND CALL IT A FARCE WERE IT NOT FOR THE ATTACK SCENES AND THE FINAL EPIPHANY,AS POTENT AS ANY PENNED BY JOYCE.SEE THIS FILM,SEE IT AGAIN,AND AGAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Effort","review":"This DVD is pretty bad. The sound is not good and the visual really lacks in all aspects. I think watching the video was the same as the dvd. The only plus is that you get the trailer, but that does not help enough. Kubrick is dead, take his work and make it look as it once did and as great as it could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I'm a huge Kubrick fan, so bare in mind that I'm biased to liking this film. I'll stick to the basics. The high-def presentation is outstanding, and nothing short of what you'd expect from the fellows at Criterion. The audio, is clean and basic, sticking to it's monaural roots. This is a good thing, as trying to make this a multi-channle audio presentation would most likely come to little effect if not interfere with the film. This is a film worth picking up even if you haven't seen it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paths of Glory","review":"I am not a great fan of Stanley Kubrick's most popular movies. But I very much enjoyed Paths of Glory. The impactful moments of treachery and defence of justice in the face of tyranny were more genuinely human than the more typical emotional distancing of Kubricks more celebrated works. Kirk Douglas turns in one of his strongest performances as the tough and gutsy commander Dax who knows as much at how to make an impact in a military board meeting as on the battlefield. He is the voice of compassion and reason in what is a very dark and cynical film about the politics of war. Some of the posturing of the evil French officials might seem over the top and cartoonish, but it works somehow because of the odd interplay of politeness mixed with the cavalier willingness to trade outrageously on human lives to score morale points with the men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film; extras not worth price","review":"Love this film, always have, had a perfectly good copy you can get on amazon for 2.00. I 'traded' my old one in for this new 'pumped up' version from Criterion for 10X the price of the one I sold. What do you get with the Criterion version? A sort of entertaining interview with Kirk Douglas from 1979 on British TV where he says how much he liked this film. An interview with Stanley Kubricks Wife who was the german girl singing in the beer hall in front of French troops in the final scene of the movie. A sort of interesting interview with James Harris the producer talking about having to fire Tim Carey (one of the actors selected for execution), for being difficult to work with. And the most interesting extra, a brief news report on French TV talking about the original event in WWI that inspired the book & film. These extras aren't 'bad' they just don't justify a $20+ cost for this new and impoved version of the film in my view."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a classic","review":"Enjoyable by all those with even a passing interest in World War I. Kirk Douglas is outstanding. However, some might be frustrated with the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different side","review":"Mikhail's books in an incredible collection of poetry.

This is a cheesey American rendition and compilation collection that, quite frankly, SUX!! It's got two good tracks (return to the toxic caves and chaos jam), but as for the others, they weren't great. Infact, they're barely game related, they're mere compositions.! If you're a die-hard Sonic fan then get it by all means, but if you just like sonic (or the music) passively then don't bother!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vapors: Misunderstood & Underrated!","review":"Even in the '80s, I didn't know a soul who appreciated this band as I did in my teen angst, new wave way. Sure, \\"Turning Japanese\\" was great fun, but the Vapors' effect was really a cumulative one. You need to hear a number of songs (preferably taking in _Magnets_ as well as _New Clear Days_) before passing judgment on these guys: Letter from Hiro, News at Ten, Trains, Sixty Second Interval, Magnets... it's purely random that Vapors aren't considered classics of the era.As for the Jam complaints: you'll hear Jam moments here, but that's hardly anything to get pissy about. The overall tone and *style* of the Jam v. Vapors are different enough that comparing them is a bit ridiculous. Rather like asserting that you can't have fun listening to Madness because The Specials were so good. Who cares? They're both good."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated group","review":"I agree with the above review. I think Turning Japanese is a great song, but the weakest one on either of the two albums. They may be Jam-esque, but that should be a good thing, not a bad thing.

I couldnt wait to read it.But alas-- My excitment dwindled. I'm not a literary critic, but I know what I enjoy in a book. I agree whole-heartedly Sen. Boxer is a hobby writer.The book started off well I thought, I was hooked in the story line. I felt the transition from present to the characters past was done poorly and was premature.

I bought it as a \\"bargain book\\" and got more than my money's worth.I wasn't expecting much. It started out a bit too much like \\"chick-lit\\" or romance (all about relationships, too cute, when protagonists were young). In fact, I put the book down.I'm glad, however, that I picked it up again. The closer it got to the Senatorial election, the more that went down (especially in the last few pages) in the halls of the Capitol, the more I liked the book.Therefore, I recommend the book without reservation, but just caution you to be patient with the beginning.

The book promises to deliver on details of his early life, his rise to stardom, and his death in the crushing grip of cancer. However, Mr. White spends far too much time on the small and irrelevant details of Marley's early years and leaves the reader wanting more and getting less. The book progresses with minor details loosely strung together with trival information and little 'meat' in the scope of the life of one of the most influential musicians of all time. Overall, I would have to say that this is one of the worst books about Marley that I have ever read and I think that though he began with good intentions, Mr. Timothy White did not deliver on his promises to fulfill the reader with knowledge about the life of Bob Marley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book about Bob Marley and his people","review":"This is a great book to fully understand bob marley's music, ideas and life. It may lacks a more profound look on his works, but still is THE BOOK if you want to understand the jamaican culture, specially the music. You'll feel like travelling through time and space.

I knew a bit about Marley and his music before picking this up (and the 1998 edition is the most up-to-date), but this really clued me in. And I, unlike some readers, appreciated the solid background on Jamaica, reggae, and Rastafarianism, all of which are essential to understanding Bob Marley. I would have liked more anecdotes, stories, and information about his recording and touring (patriculary during the late '70s heydey), but White mysteriously does not delve much into this. And it did what a good music bio should - further investigate and listen to the music of the subject.

Although there were rare moments when I caught a quick glimpse of Bob Marley, I finished this book with no clear image of him.The author's implication that Bob Marley possessed supernatural powers is silly, and cheapens his memory. Bob Marley was an artist who overcame great odds as a result of talent, determination, and idealistic conviction. Yet I did not find this Bob Marley in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive book on Bob Marley","review":"This book is the best biography on Bob Marley. It talks about his life and his rise to stardom. It also discusses the Rastafarian religion, and Ras Tafari (Haile Salassi).

This book is simply an insult to the man's memory and to his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book EVER","review":"After going to Jamaica, and actually visting Bob Marley's home and tomb, I wanted to read more about his life. What I got was the worst written book I have ever read. The author jumps around so much I couldn't keep up. He mentions so many people, names, and dates my head was spinning. This book was not about Bob Marley- this was more about the politics going on at the time. I was looking for a book that told of Bob's life; his family, his relationship with his wife, his kids. This was not the book that I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Use of Knowledge","review":"It is a regrettable fact that too many music books are inadequate. Biographers tend to review the music and omit narrative. One hopes for flow and encounters just data taken from album jackets and the like.

However, it gave more of a summary of the history of Jamaica rather than talking about Bob Marley and Reggae Music. The book gave too much information on the history of Rastafarianism and Jamaica.

To hear the music at a decent volume (and don't blast my music at all), I had to turn my car radio up quite a bit. These \\"features\\" created a really annoying effect. I'd have the irock set to a frequency where there wasn't a station broadcasting on the radio, then have to turn up the volume a fair amount (so I could hear it), then a radio station signal would get strong enough to show up and blast out and scare me half to death, while driving...

I don't even live in an area where the local radio stations override the signals, but the thing still delivers terrible quality music that fades in and out. There is no crispness and I always seem to be able to hear white noise in the background. The only use that I've found for it is with the DVD player on my computer. On long road trips, other passengers int he car can watch DVD's on my laptop and use the Irock to connect to the car speakers. Good quality isn't as important then.

You select which one you want to try and broadcast to by flipping a small dip switch. They are all at the low end of the FM dial....88.1, 88.3 88.5 and 88.7. Problem is, I live in L.A. and there are stations on 2 of the four presets and the others bleed so I can't really even use this in Metro L.A. It could be different where you live. When you get out in the boonies on a road trip and there's no competition for stations, it's adequate but don't expect CD quality sound. It's more like average FM reception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Price","review":"I've had an irock for about a year and it works really well for me. I had the SoundFeeder before and threw it away. It doesn't lock on to a frequency and you have to keep manually tuning it all the time. The dial feature isn't helpful. It just causes it to drift off-frequency every time you hit a bump. Besides the irock is much cooler looking. It was well worth the extra $5. I use it in downtown Chicago and it works just as well as my FM radio. It's great to be able to listen to your MP3 player over your car stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality is not that good - and get intereference easily","review":"I bought this two days ago at radio shack.

Battery operated and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!!!","review":"Dont buy the iRock. First of all, it eats batteries like a madman! Second, when you move it, it distorts the sound on the radio. Third, it only has 4 stations, and if there is a station broadcasting on any of thoes, it runs over and distorts the sound on the other 3. Fourth, after taking care of it, and using it for about 3 weeks, the wires in the conector from the mini-jack to the transmitter broke, and now they short circuit, draning batteries and distorting the sound even more!My sugestion, if it is for an iPod, buy a Griffin Technology iTrip. They are great!! If not for an iPod, get a cassette adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start, but I love it now","review":"When I first got the iRock, I was very under impressed with the audio quality. I read some reviews here (and other places) and got fairly discouraged... but then on a whim, I turned down the volume on my iPod, and now it sounds GREAT!I guess the iRock has a problem pumping out the sound if the iPod is set too loud. Now I set my iPod to a middle volume, and I turn up the amp on the reciever, and it sounds great. It also allows me to play the same music upstairs as downstairs. Very cool. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"If all conditions are optimal, this unit seems to work OK.

My iRock worked fine for a few weeks. You might want to check for a clear channel to select from, it uses 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, 88.7. Southern Atlanta is problematic due to a 100,000 watt radio station at 88.5 but this is unusual. Apparently there is a bad design in the product that makes the wires leading out unstable and fragile After about 3 months the right channel stopped working, and soon I found myself constantly fiddling with the unit to try to get it to re-establish contact. It gets old pretty quick let me tell you. So if you wanna buy something that will last only a few weeks, you're making a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but...","review":"Like many reviews here, this is a good idea, and it does what it says it will.

It doesn't work! First I thought it was the battery, but oh no... it was the iRock. I couldn't come to terms with the idea that an item recomended by Apple for it's iPod would be such a cheap contraption.I shall rate this... mmmhhh... thing... two stars, because if you're far enough from a city (like driving around Hawaii's Big Island) or have a really expensive digital tuner it does work.For us citizens of the great cities, there should be a better alternative"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"specs claim item has an extensible antenna, my unit doesn't. That might help with the most serious shortcoming, which is, I have to put the transmitter practically on top of my radio to make it work.Apparently, there's a competing product which permits tuning to a wider range of frequencies. This only allows tuning to four frequencies 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, and 88.7, but the local (crummy) classical station at 88.3 stomps all over those frequencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but didn't quite cut it.","review":"I liked the physical design, but was unable to get anything resembling a strong or clear signal in my car.

It's one of the smallest versatile FM transmitters I've seen.Conversely its transmitting strength subtly decreases a while before the battery light goes out. It also has a very small range of FM stations making it difficult to get a clear channel. Its signal range was also very short requiring very close placement to any radio device. I was a little skeptical of the molded wire when I first saw it that was until the mini-jack end started to slide out and finally rendered the device useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless in Major Cities","review":"I bought this product to use in the car.

In spite of the limitations of the technologies, it sounds satisfactory. But, the folks at irock! really blew it with the on/off button. Positioned on the top of the unit is a 'soft-touch' button and red led indicator light/window. The indicator is impossible to see in daylight. And worse, I have not stored the unit in my car's console even once without it jostling around in there and activating the on button. Consequently, everytime I use it I must replace the two AAA batteries. They last a long time in normal play, but the position and sensitivity of the button is unacceptable. My Creative Labs Nomad III has a great feature for saving batteries - you must hold the on button down for a full 5 seconds to turn it on or off. irock! should take note . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its cable broke after being used for about 5 times","review":"I bought it at Radio Shack and after carefully using it in my car for about 5 or 6 times, the cable that connects the audio output to the device, broke.

Well, that was three months ago and of course I haven't heard from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, needs work on the design.","review":"I purchased this item to listen to Audible.com programs on my digital player in the truck I drive. The Irock works great when its brand new, it just lays on the seat next to you and plays away. The problem I've found is the more you handle the device (changing batteries, moving from place to place) the more chance you have of the wires breaking at the point where the cord goes into the main body of the device. Everytime the cord is flexed the wires get weaker until they break right where they are soldered onto the circuit board. Also if you use rechargeable alkaline batteries as I do, plan on changing batteries every 4 hours or so constant use. Also if you're not careful when you put it in your pocket or other purse or bag, whatever - the button is easy to press and it runs your battery down. If these problems could be fixed this would be a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could work better!","review":"The iRock is only moderately useful. The iRock has to be held close to the radio to work well without static. It does work, but not as well as it could. It is a little expensive for what it is and does, it seems to me. Ergonomically, it looks great, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, but needs work...","review":"For the money, this is a nice, inexpensive way to hook your computer to your stereo, or play your MP3 or other portable music player through the car stereo when you're on the road.On the other hand, if you're a stickler for sound quality (like me), you'll most-likely be disappointed. The signal is not consistent, fading in and out with various hisses and pops. In addition, the device picks up interference from just about everything, including the device it's plugged into, so you really have to fiddle and adjust positions and frequencies to minimize the static. It's not so bad if you're using it around the house, but extremely annoying if you're on the road where the sound quality and interfering signals may change every couple of miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irock - it works but weakly","review":"I wanted to play my iPod tunes in my car. I had a cassette adapter but the quality was not satisfactory. I bought the Irock 300w thinking it would be better as there would not be the mechanical problem of cassette head alignment with the cassette adapter.It works. The sound comes through the radio on the tuned channel. The quality is not very good. The signal drops occasionally. I found improvement by moving the unit around the vehicle but since my car antenna is in the rear that is where it worked best. It is a little difficult to control the iPod when it is several feet behind you. It is also not convenient to run a cable back there to have the Irock closer to the antenna.I don't use it. I use the cassette adapter with its own poor sound quality problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but don't expect great quality","review":"I bought the Irock at Radio Shack because I noticed the cassette adaptor for playing MP3s on my car stereo was not playing well through both channels. I took it home, put batteries in it, plugged it into my laptop, and tuned my FM to the needed channel. The sound was fair at best. I had to turn up my volume a lot to get the same sound level as my cassette adaptor. I could hear a high picthed hum, which sounded like some noise from the power source that was not filtering out.If you don't have any other method of listening to your portable device over the stereo, then this may be ok to use. But I took mine back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...at all","review":"I bought one iRock adapter on RadioShack and it was 30 bucks throwed down the garbarge...at first ir did work, but in my city there are a lot of radio stations so it was kind of difficult to make it stay in one frequency and work at all. Then it just died, I changed batteries, etc but it just not work, I turn it on and it turns off in seconds and I can get it to work...I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea Poorly Executed","review":"The iRock might work well in perfect circumstances, but in the real world, it's design really limits its usefulness...first, you need a place in your car for the Irock to sit. Its cable is a few inches long, so on our iPod, it hangs down the side of our center 'hump' and is hard to reach and adjust...there doesn't seem to be a good place to put it. Second, our antenna is on the back of our car, not the front, so there's a long distance between our iPod/iRock and antenna. Lots of static breaks through. On one four hour trip, I had to constantly readjust the station on which the iRock was transmitting because, as we travelled, adjacent stations that would come and go would overwhelm it. Finally, and most problematic, is that the button has no protection or 'smarts'. If you carry it in a bag or pocket, the button WILL get pushed accidentally and you WILL drain your battery. Very, very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it.","review":"I wanted to be able to sit on the ground and have my iBook's mp3s play into my stereo, wirelessly (since I fell in love with AirPort wireless internet).However, in my area, it just doesn't work.

I suggest you find the Transpod if you want the best in FM signal transmitting. I currently have the sf120 and it is a nice option. In the end I will probably have to get a better stereo for a direct plugin for the MP3 players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I suppose if you don't live in a metropolitan area with stations around the frequencies the iRock has presets for, you might get better performance out of it than I have. I have had my unit about one week, and I must say I am disappointed. The idea is great, but the functionality at the power it puts out stinks.I have tried all kinds of positioning, even placing the unit in my ashtray which is directly below my radio. I tried aligning the unit's cord so it is oriented correctly with the car antenna.On top of mediocre performance, it has gobbled through batteries, and despite a lot of empty space inside the unit, there isn't an option for a DC power adapter.Hey iRock, if you are reading this, don't take it personally, but you should have done more field testing before releasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair performance, NOT great for iPod use","review":"Initially, I purchased the iRock to connect a CD player to my car stereo. Sound quality is very good, so long as you aren't in an area where broadcast stations use all the limited frequencies of 88.1 to 88.7 offered on the iRock. (Other products offer a wider choice.) Where I live, college radio uses 88.1 and 88.3, and NPR is on 88.5, with a strong signal classical station on 88.9, so NONE of the iRock's channels provides real clear sound. The connector cord, which fits into the headphone jack of the player, is also too long. It worked okay when I had a CD player, but now I have an iPod, and the cord is just annoyingly too long, causing the iRock's main pod to slide off the car seat and dangle to toward the floor, where gravity eventually causes it to detach from my iPod. What a pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as promised","review":"I've returned this product -- great idea, but it simply doesn't work well. I couldn't get the signal to stay locked on my radio, even when everything was stationary, as in my home stereo. Never mind trying it in the car!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"I purchased this product hoping to be able to listen to my iPod through my car radio, and I found it completely unacceptable for this purpose. I was not able to receive a clear signal on any of the four supported frequencies. There was usually a lot of background hiss. This could be reduced by moving the unit around in the car, from dashboard to front seat, back to dashboard, etc. Even when I managed to eliminate the hiss, the audio was still muddy and distorted. Thinking the problem might have been due to my car stereo, I tried it in a friend's car with the same results. This was in the Washington, DC metro area, where the FM band is crowded. Results might be better in rural areas, or perhaps in a car with a windshield antenna rather than an outside one. I eventually gave up on the iRock and replaced my car stereo with one that has an auxiliary input."},{"rating":"1","title":"newer isn't always better","review":"If you need it for your car, forget about it!!

Everything you gain from a high-qulity MP3 player like the iPod, you lose when you hook it up to the iRock.The iRock has four frequency choices and none of them worked well.

I was getting tired of having the wires trailing everywhere, but it turns out that the old technology works much better.The 4 frequencies they give you to choose from are all pretty close together, and our local NPR station broadcasts on a frequency that its right in the middle of them (88.5). I don't know quite what is happening, but the tuning lock on the irock seems to get cancelled out by the broadcast station, and the irock turns itself off every couple of seconds, leaving loud badly tuned static instead of my ipod. I have tried it in different parts of the city, and on all four of the frequencies they provide but they are all as bad as each other. Don't know what to do with it!

OK, I can't use it in the city but I usually only want to use the MP3 player when I go on hiking trips or longer drives outside of the city anyway. It didn't matter. Even when I was unable to get any FM stations on my radio, the IROCK still fluctuated between sounding OK to having a lot of static over my music. Most of the time it was static.

My main complaint is with the bafflingly bad design - unless you have the space in your car to lay it out flat (and 2 sided tape to keep it from sliding around) it's going to end up dangling from your music player, and will put stress on the product's weakest point - the connection point. Sure enough, about a week after my 90 day warranty expired the connection was stressed and the right channel began cutting in and out.Avoid this tempting little device like the plague - you're much better off spending a few more bucks and getting a solid FM transmitter, and one that you can tune to any station - another downside of the IRock is its limit of 4 distinct tuning settings, each of which in Los Angeles has strong competition from local public radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Range is very limited - save your money","review":"I bought this device with the hope that I could use my Nomad Zen Jukebox MP3 player in my car and hear the music from my car radio receiver.

Hats off to Shulman brothers for their excellent sense of timing and rhythm.Their unique blend of Classical,Medieval and rock music is simply amazing and the interplay of different instruments is mind boggling as can be evident in numbers such as Funny Ways,Proclamation and score of other numbers. It is a real pity that bands such as Gentle Giant were forced to exit the music scene.I feel unfortunate not to have been a witness to this Live performance.Alongside Jethro tull,Gentle giant is the only other Prog rock band that has commanded my respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shoes","review":"I like the way these shoes fit my feet. I took the original pads out and replaced them with Spenco orthotics to deal with my plantar fascitis. This was no problem. I know the shoes aren't very stylish. In fact, they look rather clunky, especially in black. I would have preferred white, but FootLocker did not carry my size in that color. Coincidentally, I eventually found Sears selling 574's in white, and I just took delivery of four pairs. Sears priced them $3 higher (including tax) and did not include free delivery.Maybe a NewBalance expert will discern some significant difference between the 574's and the older 374's for $10 less. I can't.I do like the NB monogram... it matches my initials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm toes in Minnesota","review":"It gets cold in Minnesota! We have a large family room in our older house with a horribly cold floor (it's built over a crawl space). I wouldn't think of sitting in this room without wool socks and slippers. Not any more! The rug buddy as transformed the floor into a cozy oasis where you want to keep your feet. I also believe it has warmed the entire room.The room has a hardwood floor and an area rug. We installed the Rug Buddy between the rug pad and the rug. The installation was easy and except for the cord you don't see it or feel it when you walk on the rug (you feel the warmth but not the thickness of the Rug Buddy). My only complaint is the cord which I felt was too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Used these in Hawaii to purify swamp water in waimanu valley.

Don't waste your money!","review":"As a child, I was there buying Big daddy's model build sets in 1964! Along with other model sets like Dracula and Frankenstein. Ed Roth was not known for any type of music but he did release three bad albums that had great artwork in the covers. And that's why I bought them. But the music contained within was silly, stupid and a waste of time. Certainly not enjoyable by any means. And then the release of the songs on this CD set came and I could not beleive that people bought it. It was so putrid and the artwork was miniature in comparison. It's best that you buy the original album covers no matter what shape the records are in. It's cheaper and more fun to have. And it's still freaks out the young people when they see it. It's great to see their reaction!Three sellers who want to sell their \\"three CD set\\" have given me negatives, but it is what it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"K & N Air filter","review":"This Air filter actually made my 07' Accord v6 run cooler.

It's a direct replacement for the specified paper filter type. It seemed to seal even better than most paper filters i've previously installed in the air box of my V6 Accord. After installation I noticed an immediate change to engine throttle response. Although I have not measured the improvement, I can discern a large enough difference in throttle response and off the line torque. Fuel economy has improved by a couple MPGs also.

Not only did I not hink this was funny, I think it's one of the most UNfunny movies I've ever seen. I expected much more from this cast of actors, but almost all the jokes fall flat. There's a few amusing scenes, but getting to the end of this movie was pure torture. Since a lot of other people seem to like it, I'm not going to tell you to forget it (maybe it will turn out to be your cup of tea), but please rent it before buying it.

Instead I get one of the worst films I have seen in almost a decade.

Its weird then that they didnt pay extra attention to the DVD, and just threw something together instead. Theres no booklet to the DVD, just the scenes, and theres hardly any special features. Its worth the movie alone, because believe me, its one of the funniest movies ever. just pure slapstick and fish out of the water comedy. but this DVD is just... it saddens me that they totally ignored this movie with the DVD and jsut decided to put it out several months after its theatrical release. oh well, get it for the movie, not the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slapstick but made me rolling with laughter","review":"I had a tearing dilemma last month when I was deciding between A.I. and Rat Race. I chose A.I., much to my disappointment. I later got a chance to watch this movie on a VCD and it turned out to be not bad at all, as opposed to previous reviews I get.Some say that this movie is too ambitious in that it is trying to showcase too many characters. I beg to differ! There are only 8-10 major characters, each of them distinguishably amicable and interesting to watch. I didn't find it difficult to catch who is who.Very ingeniously cobbled together and with amazing harmony, the movie seems to push on smoothly with incapacitating jokes-of-the-year at every turn.Watch it, especially if you need something to lift you up out of your blues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rat Race is a must see!!!!!!","review":"I saw this movie as part of a double feature and everyone was expecting a bad movie because it was just after the sneak peak movie hit Hardball featuring Keanu Reeves. Everyone cryed in hardball and they cried from laughter from Ratrace. Rowan Atkinson portrays an Italian tourist who has no idea what is happening except that he is in a race not to mention that he has narcolepsy and falls asleep spontaneously. I'm not telling the rest. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.

At the start of the movie where establishing information is taking place we found it entertaining. Further into the movie the plot seemed to plummet. One scene after the other failed to appear funny to us. More like distressing. Yet, we like \\"Kingpin\\" and \\"Wrongfully Accused\\", \\"Spy Hard\\" so we were expecting to like \\"Rat Race\\" -- too much of the humor and plot derived from material such as WWII and animals and transplants just wasn't funny to us. The ending was entertaining to an extent. We thought we couldn't go wrong with the great cast of \\"Rat Race\\" and unfortunately we were disappointed to discover it just wasn't grade A comedy. Sorry, but the rental expenditure was more than enough for this particular movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of excrement!","review":"Foul, loathsome, tasteless, and stupid -- these adjectives are too kind; they don't do this movie justice. Of course if you like \\"cute\\" bowel movement jokes, unbelievably stupid people, \\"hilarious\\" dialogue about giving birth [...], tongue-piercing morons, and animal abuse, then you should rush out and buy this movie.

As soon as you finish one, you are whisked off to another. The name for the movie is unfortunate. Who wants to see a movie about a rat race. Isn't that what we do all day? Besides, there was another movie called The Rat Race years ago.

Terrible ending. I'm not sure if this is because of my dislike towards the particular band at the end, but I felt like the ending could have been so much better.Why anyone would want to enlist the \\"help\\" of this particular band, other than to get teen viewers, is beyond me.And it's not just that - the end was hardly a culminating moment for this film.Too bad, because otherwise, this is a five-star film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is very funny.","review":"This is a very funny movie,and it has some of the greatest stars in it.I especially like Rowan Atkinson because he is funny,and I have all his Mr.Bean tapes too.

A movie that is humorous, interesting, and well written explodes like the Death Star at the end into an extremely lousy movie.

The squirrel lady, a bus-full of Lucille Ball impersonators -- and an hysterically funny flying cow -- complete with hot-air ballon!Not for the easily offended -- but, as such things go, fairly tame, even in the \\"raunch\\" respect.Certainly not \\"Oscar\\" material -- but, as previously stated, much funnier than expected.

Its packed with great comedy, fun for the familly and amazingly each charactor has a completly diffrent personality to the others!This is a great movie and well worth buying if your into these whacky car race movies!Half the bonues features are worth a look at, and some of them are quite boring, espeichlly the audio phone calls to talk to the cast after the release of the movie...ZZZzzzzzzz, tho you might find it intresting?!

In fact, back in the day, I purchased it on vinyl; I liked it more than enough to decide to purchase it on cd, as well. Melodically, this score does evoke some of his other work. However, texturally it is a bit different, round vs. angular. The orchestration is quite sweet on the score pieces. Overall, this is a fine, somewhat relaxing listening experience apart from the film. Ms. Zadora's singing is pleasant on the tune where she is featured. The great Edda Dell'Orso is wonderful on the one or two selections where she adds her beautiful vocal contribution.

Jim Bouton blew the lid off baseball with this truly inside view of baseball's salary negotions, horny players, \\"annies\\", etc. His timing was socially relevent as well, as this was written during the infancy of the black power movement, the players union and free angency. No other baseball book has ever approached this one in terms of inside poop on stars, political insight, out and out laughs, and historical perspective. This book has given more references to myself and my friends' lexicons than any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first man to brake baseballs code of Omerta","review":"Jim Bouton a former twenty game winner was the first player to brake baseballs unwritten code of Omerta. His classic book published in 1970 was based on his previous decade long experience as a successful pitcher. Reading his work we learn much about the day to day life of the pros. As well as much about their appetite for amphetamines and groupies. Bouton gives us insights into such baseball greats as Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Roger Marris and Johnny Sain.Finally Jim Bouton leaves us with a glimpse into the soul of a major league pitcher. When asked when the time comes when he no longer has the stuff to make the grade; would he still hold onto the ball? \\"I went down deep and the answer I came up with was yes. Yes I would. You see, you spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time (pg. 398).\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT autographed as indicated in the image accompanying the book.","review":"Image accompanying book is misleading.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless classic","review":"If you never knew who he was; he establishes himself as just another relief pitcher trying to sustain a career in the major leagues. But in this journey; using his witt and humor you cant help but to cheer for him. Just another relief pitcher with not so common story telling abilities as Jim pulls you right into his waves of emotional ups and downs.

I read maybe only 1/4 of the ball four section of the book, & was so incredibly disgusted, & appalled!! What a horrible dirty way to live, & I understand he was wanting the reader to know how their life really was, but Bouton thinks the disgusting lifestyle is funny, & obviously enjoys telling about it. The language is so incredibly vulgar & filthy page after page, that I quit reading it because I felt so filthy. It could be that they talked that way, but why would you want to continually repeat that kind of language! I read parts from Ball 5 to the end of the book, & Bouton definately cleaned up the language & the vulgar way of living on this section, but then to continue with Ball 6, & onward? Bouton is definately someone who can't let go with that time of his life. This was definately not worth the .99 I paid for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious inside look to why these are not men playing a kid's game. They are just big kids.","review":"Jim Boutin was a very successful pitcher with the New York Yankees before injuring himself and having to become a knuckleball pitcher for the expansion Seattle Pilots. He wrote a diary of his comeback and it is nothing short of hilarious. The picture he paints of major leaguers is that of young boys who play pranks on one another and get their feelings hurt very easily. The only difference is these kids drive sports cars and pick up women during games. One scene in particular where they put talcum powder in another player's blow dryer makes me laugh every time I think of it. What makes the book so good is Bouton's natural way of writing so that the diary entires are not disjointed like Jim Brosnan's \\"The Long Season\\", but they have a flow to them. Even though I did not know many of the players he referenced in the book because it was before my time, it still remains a timeless classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for fans","review":"This book had me laughing out loud several times. Even though it was written about 30 years ago, the baseball experiences still ring true. Bouton has a great sense of humor, and the anecdotes about both stars and players you never heard of are a treat. I used this book to get me through the last off-season, and it was a lot of fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For academics","review":"Although this may be an extensive and erudite history of sexual humor be forewarned: it is a textbook.

This was a waste of my time and I will never read a book based on Oprah's recommendation again if this is the kind of literature that is on the list!

It has taken me appox. ten months to finish this book, because i have a warped sense of having to finish a book before starting a new one. My New Year's resolution was to read 12 books this year (one a month) I would have had better luck with a diet. The story being portrayed here had great potential, but I think maybe Miss Morrison was cooking or on the phone and forgot where she was and so did I."},{"rating":"1","title":"a two day project","review":"I read this for a book club.

I read slowly, but to no avail. It was like a manic depressive nightmare with not a very good plot. I agree that Toni Morrison does have a way with words but what about the rest that goes with a good read. But that is why there are so many good books out there for us, to keep us looking for a good read and we all read differently. Thank god for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion reigns in Paradise","review":"Morrison's new novel begins, \\"They shoot the white girl first.\\" After that opening statement, it's all downhill. E.B. White once equated fine writing with clarity and simplicity. If indeed these two qualities are the mark of exemplary writing, Morrison's Paradise fails terribly. This tale is twisted and convoluted. There are no turns of phrase that strike this reader (a university literature professor) as exemplary and extraordinary. My thoughts, as I read this work, were thus: (1)if it had been written by a newcomer, it likely would not have been published and (2) Ms. Morrison has probably reached the stage in a literary career when awards and accolades intimidate editors and most reviewers from offering an honest appraisal. In short, confusion reigns in Paradise and, unless you have ample time to waste, it is a book best left on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?????","review":"I had heard Toni Morrison say that you should continue to read this book even if you didn't understand it.

I kept hearing that it was rough sledding, but I finally picked it up and was completely enthralled. In fact, I'd say it was a page-turner. The book is something of a jigsaw puzzle, so it's important not to get frustrated when you don't know exactly who is who. After about 100 pages the pieces start falling into place and that makes it especially satisfying to read. (I recommend keeping a pencil and paper handy to jot down relationships on a family tree as they become clear.) Don't be put off by this, it's one of the great pleasures of Morrison's writing--in addition to her wonderful language and vast imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Considering Paradise","review":"Morrison has truly lived up to her potential as a writer in her most recent novel Paradise. I found the complexity of her lyrical writing to be both intriguing and moving. The novel fits in well with the trilogy comprised of Beloved and Jazz. The feature that stands out the most to me as a reader, a student of literature, and as an author is not just the beauty in the formation of her words on the page but the questions they ask people to consider. Morrison is able to make the reader ask why do people act violently, why do they choice to exclude those people and notions so central to constructions of self and paradise. For anyone looking for a deep thought provoking and beautifully written novel that won't leave you unchanged, I strongly recommend considering Paradise. If you liked Beloved your bound to love Paradise, or if you simply a true Morrison fan, you must add this to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the only books I never finished","review":"after struggling through 90 pages of this book I finally gave up .

Most of these books were enlightening and original. Paradise was original, but also disjointed and confusing.In this fairly slim volume, the characters of an entire town are mentioned. Some of these characters are described. Only one , Connie, is fully characterized. If you want to take a stab at writing about Ruby as a large backdrop canvas against which certain dramatic events later take place, you just have to use more words to satisfyingly convey this town, this black American MIDDLEMARCH, with it's many people and it's amazing history---It really saddens me that Ms. Morrison did not take more time with this book and produce the truly great work of fiction that Paradise could have become"},{"rating":"1","title":"what was the point?","review":"Hard to read. I question whether some of the sentences are grammaticaly correct. Should have been a short story instead of a novel. Last of Oprah's picks I'll be reading. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed,philosophical & thought provoking in spots","review":"The overall theme and many of the issues addressed are very thought provoking and well worth being put in print. The problem is the story it self does not flow. At times it is not clear who is the subject of the chapter and where you are in time and place. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"For intellectual wanna-bes","review":"I love how all of the people who claim to like and understand this book focus their reviews on insulting the intelligence and sophistication of readers who did not like it. If these people were so intellectually superior, they would focus their critique on the substance of the book and not feel the need to attack the intelligence of those of us who did not care for this book. I posted a review two months ago begging someone to explain the ending of this book to me. No one has been able to. After reading such childish reviews, I am proud to be in the \\"simple minded\\" category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I am an avid book reader who plows through at least 7 novels a month. In the past few months I have read at least 20 books and none of them left me feeling the way I did while I read Paradise. Her writing is pure poetry and the images she created in my head enthralled me. Her writing stimulated all my senses and I was left feeling exhilarated. I could smell the lilacs like they were under my nose, taste the steaming potatoes with butter as they slid down Mavis's throat, heard the sounds of children or birds as they froliced in the sun, saw the people and the town like I was looking out my window and felt the warmth of coffee in my hands or the wet tears on my cheek. Paradise was outstanding. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable piece of literature for the experienced reader.","review":"As with most of Toni Morrison's novels, this is an intense, enjoyable read. The reader slowly becomes familiar with the characters as if he/she is a new addition to a neighborhood; albeit a struggling neighborhood both spiritually and socially. As the characters develop, so does Ms. Morrison's theme and intent. I highly recommend the book to the reader who wants a challenge as well as a good story. Although sometimes the content is disturbing, it is always thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was challenging, but it made me think.","review":"It was challenging, especially the first part of the book. I have found this difficulty with other books written by Morrison, which is why I have only read one other book (Tar Baby) by her. However, since Morrison is so well thought of in educational and literary circles, I decided it was important for me to give her another try. This is not an entertaining piece of literature. It makes the reader think about issues such as class, race, and gender. Morrison uses a lot of symbolism and it takes some thought to understand what she writes and to create knowledge from what she has written. This is the challenge. This is what makes it worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complex, Cautionary Tale of African American Community","review":"Toni Morrison presents a complex, cautionary tale of the uses and misuses of racial pride, ancestor worship, chauvinism, and spirituality/religiosity. I wouldn't say this is a must-read, but I did find it thought-provoking and challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"sanity saved","review":"I thought perhaps I had lost abilities to comprehend and enjoy reading as I plowed through these stories.I have read Morrison before too! The style did not spur me on; just diligence. I think I understand it, caught sub ideas, etc.,but mostly bored by her characters, but surely am glad to be done with it. No wonder the owner loaned it and said \\"...don\\"t worry about getting it back to me...\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good\\" doesn't have to be \\"easy.\\"","review":"My book club just finished reading Paradise, and I was the only one who liked it (and one of only a few who finished it.) I was also the only one who took the time to jot notes as I read, so that I could keep track of the characters and story. It didn't take anything away from the reading experience to take these notes. On the contrary, it enhanced it immeasurably. I was disappointed in my clubmates for giving up so easily. I would have liked for them to all have finished and understood it, so I could discuss it with them in the thorough manner it deserves. Yes, it was a difficult book. No, difficult does not equal bad. Have we as a society lost our love of a challenge? Are good things no longer worth working toward? I thought it was a mesmerizing story because I understood it. I didn't understand it because of my intellectual superiority, but because of my work ethic."},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"I am a fairly sophisticated reader. I read a book a week, and was an English major and have read many of the great classics. But for the life of me I don't have a clue as to what Ms. Morrison is trying to say here. There is no doubt that she is a talented and skilled writer. Her descriptions and some scenes are striking. However, she is all over the map here. There are so many unnecessary characters in this book that the average reader will be completely lost. Who is who and how are they related to one another? After awhile, a reader will just give up. I have read two other of the author's books, but after this one I will not attempt any future ones. I think Toni Morrison is one of our most overrated American authors and has been given literary prizes simply because no one knows what the heck she is saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING LESS THAN BRILLIANT","review":"Toni Morrison is a writer who does not spoon-feed you her work. Story lines are interwoven, emotions confusing and startling, and if you're looking for a neat and complete Hollywood ending you've definitely come to the wrong place with any of her writings. The incongruities of her writing is the genius of her writing and she deserves nothing less than a permanent space in literary history for this amazing piece of work. She imagines an entire town and describes every single aspect of it, from the street names to population's bloodlines to the religion that separates them. This is an amazing piece of work that has changed the way I view literature. And for those who are trying to figure out if the women died and which one was white... that very query is the point. It's the intentional hypothetical question that remains the genius of all of Toni Morrison's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful, yet no Beloved.","review":"i fully enjoyed paradise. yes, it is difficult to get through, and yes she can be vague at times. i think that is the beauty of toni morrison's writing style though. you must be patient and you must be able to sit down, give the book your full attention and read it slowly. to enjoy the full meaning of her books you cannot read them fast. they are slow moving books that need patience. it is also definately not a writing style that all appriciate or enjoy. i would not recommend this book to a person who hasn't read a book in awhile or is not used to reading a modernist or postmodernist style of writing. without being used to non-linear plot lines, i cannot imagine being able to follow paradise. yet, if you can get through it, and appriciate it, it is definately worth it. toni morrison is one of the most gifted writers today and every book i read of hers is a different, rich, amazing joy. to all who haven't read beloved, which thus far, is my personal favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Paradise but Purgatory!","review":"My irritation overflows at Oprah for promoting a book with such inthusiasm that is so painful to slog through.

WHILE I WILL NOT SAY IT IS HER BEST NOVEL YET, THAT TITLE STILL BELONGS TO SONG OF SOLOMON, IT IS ONE OF HER BEST. MORRISON CAN MAKE A READER THINK SHE IS DESCRIBING THEM OR SOMEONE THEY KNOW OR ARE VERY CLOSE TO, HER IMAGES OF THE WOMEN OF CONVENT AND THE TOWN OF RUBY AND ITS INHABITANTS ARE DEAD ON. MORRISON'S LATEST NOVEL IS GENIUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was eager to read this novel after hearing so much about it. To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. I was told the book was \\"a hard read\\" and quite frankly I resented that label. I consider myself an intelligent person, capable of following and understanding a novel. However, I am embarrassed to admit that I truly did not understand a lot about the book. There were far too many characters, their lives and names all got mixed together and I had to keep going back to past chapters to get them straight. I kept reading and telling myself that somehow at the end of the book all of this will come together and make sense. Needless to say none of it did. Also, Connie's \\"powers\\" totally eluded me. Somehow I was not expecting something like that to enter into the story. I suppose I should read it again but I know I never will. I resent having to read a novel twice in order to understand it.

Just to see how far it goes and get a good laugh out of the cast confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough read...","review":"The first ten pages where great. Then she lost me. The weaving story structure left me with indiscernible characters lacking motivation for almost everything they did, and a shifting plot I could never get my head around. Toni leaves far too much for the reader to decipher, and this makes the read laborious and slow.There are several points in the book however where her talent cannot be denied. Unfortunately, I did not feel it was worth wading through two hundred or so other pages to find said points. She had the makings of another masterpiece if she had been a bit more patient and willing to bring focus to many of the fog-laden chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not ashamed to admit I didn't get this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I heeded all of the warnings , took this book very slowly, kept track of all of the characters, took notes, went back to previous chapters to understand characters and situations.

Please somebody explain to me what the ending was all about! I am an avid reader and take great offense to previous readers claiming that If you didn't like this book, you're not intelligent. To the charming 18 year old reader who basically said that if you don't like this book you're stupid, soley is spelled s-o-l-e-y not soaly.

But it is clear that Tony Morrison still doesn't understand how to develop a strong plot as well as a clear theme. The story is misguided from the beginning as Morrison jumps back and forth from the town of Ruby and the characters of the convent. There are a million undeveloped characters and a number of confusing family trees. Morrison leaves it up to the reader to follow along with her shaky stream of consciousness, leaving the reader overwhelmed and bored. It is obvious that Morrison has taken advantage of her place as literary master. She has used her popularity and prestige to sell another book. All I can say is that I am glad I checked this book out at the local library instead of wasting money at the university bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What On Earth....?","review":"I am a huge fan of Ms Morrison. IMO she should have won a Pulitzer for \\"The Bluest Eye\\". But I find her increasingly difficult to understand. Beginning with \\"Beloved\\", Ms. Morrison novels have taken on a mystical quality that bewilder and confuse me. Often I have to go back and re-read pages to find out which character is speaking or remembering or dreaming or what. I gave up on this one somewhere in the middle. I am now plowing through \\"Love\\" in which she uses the same tactic and it's a guessing game. I really wish she would return to her earlier style as exhibited in \\"The Bluest Eye\\", \\"Sula\\" and \\"Song of Solomon\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradise Review by Stephanie Hamilton","review":"I read Paradise for a project in my English class. The book was very difficult for the fact that it seems like Toni Morrison switched topics every few pages. With all of the different characters coming in and out of the convent and the town it was hard to keep up with what was going on with who. I just didn't care for the book at all. If i had to tell someone whether they should read the book I would definitely tell them not to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to finish","review":"I hate to dedicate so much time to finish a book that I really don't enjoy but I did finish this book. I was just sure it was going to get better. After I was done my only thought was Hmmmmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"prepare to stretch your mind a bit...","review":"Halfway through Paradise, I was wishing I had had a pen and notepad from the beginning. The book is intricately woven, and the clues that I blew by (which twin drives a Chevy?) and then couldn't find again, bothered me to the end. This is a story that will clarify and deepen with repeated reading, but requires a lot of mental exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a pleasurable reading experience.","review":"I had anticipated that this would be a tough read. Toni has an extraordinary gift of the written word but this novel was a disappointment. The characters were too complex. I could not determine where the story was headed. I tried hard not to put it down before the end but frustration won out. Maybe I will try to read it again later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Her Skills","review":"The author attempts something even good writers would find difficult. Her minimal talent fails her and the reader. The result is even worse than her usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard read, but worht the effort","review":"Altough the first paragraph grabs your attention, the book is difficult to get thorough. Lots of names to remeber and sort out and the chronology jumps around alot. I think this is the best way to write a book though. Everything makes sense at the end, but ther is still questions to be answered with a second and even a third reading that really makes this a great book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read at your own risk!","review":"Morrison's story is brilliant, the characters are beautuful and the description's are breathtaking but the presentation makes Paradise nearly impossible to read. I had to struggle through the first few chapters to even find the strenght to continue reading this book. The telling of this story is confusing at best- and she interweaves past, present, good and evil before establishing any form to the characters Don't belive most of the early press reviews- they sound like they were writen out of the publishers ads and not by somebody who actually took the time to read this book. I stop short of calling this terrible, and only so because Paradise has tremendous potential to be all that it has been promised to be. Unfortunalty, Morrison's genius is blinding to both her story telling and those trying to read this book. I'm ,sorry, but I must disagree that if it must be read over and over before understanding- that does not make it automatically wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not ata ll what I expected it to be.","review":"I found out about this book through the Opra Winfre Show. This book was not at all what I expected it to be. I have tried reading and re-reading the book. This is one book that I feel that I have wasted my money on. I only bought it because Opra recommended it, and I thought Opra has good books to read in her book of the month club. Oh well, you can't win them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Command of the Language","review":"Toni Morrison has a way with words that is unbelievable. However, the plot of Paradise is so disjointed that it is almost impossible to follow. It was a chore to decipher what was happening. The theme of the book is one that should be presented and discussed. It is unfortunate that Paradise was not the vehicle to do this. Still, Morrison's use of words is fabulous even though most of the time they did not enhance the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book.","review":"I am possibly in the minority, but I just didn't like it.

It was not a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFUL","review":"Ms. Morrison's command of the language is impressive-this particlar book is not.

I am not sure that I have ever read a worse book! I did not finish - didn't even get a third of the way through. Talk about overhyped!! What on earth was this all about? I confess that I didn't get it. If this is the level of book that is being promoted by Oprah, then I know why I am thankful I never have time to watch daytime television..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I've read most of Toni Morrison's work and anticipated the release of Paradise. I should learn not to set myself up like that. More complex and enigmatic than any of her other novels, Paradise waits far too long before giving the reader enough frame of reference to appreciate what's going on. The characters are interesting, but lack the multi-faceted quality that made books like \\"Beloved\\" and \\"Song of Solomon\\" so rich. There is merit to this book, I just didn't find that merit to be worth the effort of slogging through the murky depths of the convoluted storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to finish","review":"after two weeks of reading, re-reading, and starting over.

Honey, you'll grow out of calling other people stupid as soon as you hit my age. Wisdom is a gift bestowed upon a few lucky ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I can say I tried.....","review":"From the reviews posted here, Paradise seems to divide people into two seperate camps - those who gush & gush, and those who feel ripped-off. I fall into the latter category. I am truly sorry to say that, as I enjoyed Beloved immensely. I look for books to affect me emotionally & at the last page of Beloved, I was crying. However, reading Paradise felt like a chore. Like so many others, I forced myself to finish it. You can't imagine my relief on finally being able to put the damn book down! Out of pride I finished it, I wanted to be able to say,yes, I read it. Luckily, this didn't dissuade me of reading any other Toni Morrison novels. Immediately after reading Paradise, I read Song of Solomon, probably not wanting to leave such a bad taste in my mouth. Well, it worked and I think I'll pick up The Bluest Eye next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of paper","review":"One of the supremely happy moments in my life came about page 100, when I said to myself: \\"I don't have to read this book, even if it came from a Nobel prize winner, and even though I'm out 25 bucks.\\" Ms. Morrison may have deserved the Novel accolade for her body of work before she won the prize, but the money or fame or something has obviously created an impenetrable barrier between herself and good writing. She should give all the money back, including my $25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Indeed!","review":"Ms. Morrison is unbelievably amateurish and superficial. This book has little to recommend it but hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather difficult read..","review":"After reading all the good reviews and the fact that this book was on some cool people's list mania lists - I really wanted to read it and to like it. But after having bought it, I found it rather difficult to follow and understand.The charachters keep coming in and it's hard to keep track of who's who. You know they are all going to come together in the convent somehow but it's still hard to follow and make a connection. I consider myself to be an avid reader and reasonably intellectual but unfortunately I could not bring myself to finish this book. Maybe in a few years time I'll come back to it and understand it better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise is a great story.","review":"I was almost ready to put this book down after the first chapter. I was completely lost and discouraged, especially after all the good things i heard about it. But I continued on and was very pleased. Im sure everybody who reads this gets a different message, but what I took from the book was a message about judgement. The people of Ruby set up there own town to get away from the judgement and predjudice of white people, but what they found is they could not escape it. They judge there own population and others who they feel are dangerous. This is great book but can be difficult to read at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"I was sorely dissapointed with Paradise.The first page was great, but went down hill from there.I patiently waited for it to get better and expected the last chapters to make it all worthwhile,this novel was my first read of Toni Morrison, will read her again to see if this was just one of her great flops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"I made it through half of this book and said forget it. I had to force myself to get that far. Toni Morrison can't seem to say what needs to be said for the reader to halfway comprehend what is going on in Ruby or at the convent. This makes for a selfish author who has let success go to her head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I made a beeline for this book after Oprah's glowing review and was deeply disappointed. The first paragraph was a grabber, but it soon fizzled. The convoluted prose and disjointed characterizations did not entice me to dig deeper or leave me wanting more. By the end of the book I could have cared less who was killed or who did the killing. Ah well, I guess after having just read the literary masterpiece \\"Cold Mountain\\" anything else was bound to be a real let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Slow - Moving, and Difficult To Follow","review":"This novel moves rediculously slow, with benign details and decoy storylines. I found it very difficult to folow which for me is a first. I would give it no stars if that was possible, but I will give it one star for its title that lures you in and makes you read this very boring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One you start reading, you want to finish it.","review":"This is the first Toni Morrison novel I have read, I enjoyed it. I had to think and to think is good for the brain. I plan to read Beloved and Jazz, because according to book reviewers Paradise is the last of the trilogy where Beloved is the first and Jazz the second in the series. I am a Toni Morrison fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise","review":"This novel had it's moments, powerful moments, but alas, \\"only moments\\". I had heard a lot of praise for this novel but maybe I just missed the point. I know it's about the individuals in Ruby and the convent characters too, but it's being touted as this only happened in a small black town. I don't think so. It could have been anywhere, anybody USA. A small town with its own secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good reading","review":"If a writer can't get me involved in their story in the first 100 pages, I don't finish it.

I didn't like it and will not read any of her selections again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read fiction for entertainment","review":"By the time I got half way through Paradise, I decided to stop wasting my precious time and return the book to the library so someone else could read it. I didn't love or hate any of the characters in the book. I was unable to feel anything for any of them. I'm sure Toni Morrison wrote the book to be dissected by students in literature class. Quite frankly, if I want to dissect a book, it better be nonfiction. I used to be the type of person who would have to finish a book once I started reading it. Paradise has cured me of that. Life is too short to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the lady on the Train: It Wasn't Worth It!","review":"I was sitting on the train home from work, determined to \\"get through\\" the last 40 pages of my new book when the woman sitting next to me glanced over and asked if I was enjoying the book. I paused for a moment, turned to her and said, \\"I don't know!\\". She then explained that she got through the first 2 chapters of \\"Paradise\\" and could not go on. Being someone that feels I would be insulting a book (books are people too!)if I did not finish, I thought everything would work out in the end. It didn't. People had told me this was a brilliant book - I almost felt stupid not feeling the euphoria at the end. That was \\"almost\\"... yeah, it was a hard read - big deal! But gosh, to actually recommend people to read it AGAIN?!?! If I was that disappointed after struggling through the first read - lord knows what would happen if I read it again! I'm just relieved it's over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The language soared and so did my spirit.","review":"I read the book before the hoopla and found it a rich reading experience- a full symphony, a multicourse meal.

It was hard to understand a lot of what was going on- and I am an avid reader with a large vocab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate read","review":"As much as I wanted to like this book, I could not overcome its racist and hurtful depictions of black men. I was very offended by the depictions of black men, and as a black man who has never been to jail or had any ill-will toward black women, I was surprised that all of the black males in the book ar depicted as misogynistic and cruel, almost apish criminals or cretins. This book reminds me of racist literature from the 1890s-1920s that I read in my Whiteness Studies class. Such racist books written by white authors who sought to foment race riots (meaning violence by whites against blacks). The tone of this book is quite similar, which is shameful and all too eerie. To think that a gifted black author is writing literature no different than literature that Grand Wizards of the Klu Klux Klan wrote in 1919 says something very harrowing about the publishing industry, something I had not realized before. I expected her worldview to be a bit more like Mark Twain's than David Duke's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.........it was like torture.","review":"I couldn't even get past the third chapter. Maybe I'm just not deep enough for this one...who knows, but it's awful. I have read other books my Ms. Morrison and found them enjoyable, but this one was so confusing and I just didn't have the patience to muddle on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradise","review":"This book had interesting moments. So far I have read three of Ms. Morrison's books including this one, \\"The Bluest Eye,\\" and \\"Sula.\\"I was often bored reading this book. Her writing tends to be depressive and odd, yet informative of the black culture at times. Each of her books seems to contain some element of horrific incident(s) that will stir the emotions. I am hoping for more from \\"Song of Solomon.\\" I can't help but wonder if Oprah would recommend books that portray the abuses whites have suffered at the hands of blacks. It has occurred, but since whites have never been considered abused by the slave days of old, these stories do exist, even in more modern times."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I never quit reading books. I could see how this story would be confusing and hard to understand. I was able to keep up with the reading and understand it, but it was just plain boring. This book I just wasn't into. I didn't look foward to reading it. So I didn't finish it. Morrison jumped around to much.. once I started getting familiar with characters, she would switch it up. I don't know how it ever ended, but I wasn't patient with the book to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read for pleasure, and this book was truly awful.","review":"I only bought this dog of a book because my mother saw it on Oprah and said how good it was supposed to be. This is my first (and probably only) Oprah selection that I will knowingly buy. If any future titles pique my interest, then I will wait for them at the public library.I don't read to try to decipher garbage, and to me that's what this stupid book was all about. I couldn't stand it and shipped it to my mom after reading up to page 37, wishing her the best of luck in figuring out what it was all about!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I missunderstand?","review":"After reading this book I felt as if I was still waiting for something very big to happen.......It left me wondering whether I was the only one in the world to missunderstand this book. All in all, it left me feeling stupid and very upset that I did not \\"get it\\". It's been a month since I have read the book and I still think about it and wonder what I missed. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because I enjoyed the style of writing and it did manage to keep my interest up although I WAS expecting more from the ending. I felt very let down by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughts are not oraganized.","review":"Having read all of Toni Morrisson's books, this one by far is not her best novel. Her chapters do not flow from one thought to the next, they jump around and you(the reader) have to make the connection. No, I don't think this book is dificult to read, just difficult to follow because you have to work at putting it all together. It started out as a great idea, but somehow it got lost in the rambling of Ms. Morrisson."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't we lose this paradise?","review":"Oh mercy, I wonder how many unfortunate book discussion groups are going to be slogging through this one. Paradise, by Toni Morrison, is convoluted, overwritten and downright confusing. She sets up a smug tone that grits the teeth. I have a mental picture of Oprah chomping happily on a burger, reading Jackie Collins, and snickering to herself at the thought of earnest readers toiling through Paradise. Thumbs down,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things do not improve with age!","review":"Paradise is anything but! I realize that I should probably read the novel one or two more times before I pass judgment, but the thought of having to wade through all those characters and themes, again is agonizing, at present. Of course, I said something similar of Beloved upon its initial publication and over time, came to love, admire and appreciate it as it deserves to be appreciated. Unfortunately, I don't see the same happening with Paradise ... but I'll give it another try when it comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I had to read this book for my Honors English class, and I loved it. It's a classic Toni Morrison novel, and everyone who likes other books by her should read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a success. Book sinks under its own weight, doesn't mov","review":"Morrison's obvious fluency does not serve her well in this novel. Paradise is a quagmire that sucks into itself all that could make it rock: movement, action, a forward-going narration, dramatic tension, tight plotting. Morrison seems to have been too much in love with the book's \\"epic\\" format and her own ability to write expressive, descriptive prose to pay attention to the above requirements. Paradise is full of ideas and themes; unfortunately it quickly becomes an inert mass that eludes our desire to give it our full concentration and praise. Is it perhaps several novels mistakenly entwined in one binding? A huge effort, not a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is 1 too many!","review":"I read this book because Oprah Winfrey recommended it in her book club. After 2 days of trudging through it, I was hellbent on finishing it, just for principle! Secretly I was hoping it would get better...but it never did. The most interesting and (I think) valuable aspect of the book was how it described the members of the small black community's prejudices against others of their town, and how the color of their skin determined their worth in the community. However, I never did figure out how the convent fit into the picture. The words were descriptive and eloquent, but the story was lost on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that book about?","review":"I've never put down a book without finishing it, no matter how horrible it was, until NOW! I did not understand ANYTHING that was going on from chapter to chapter. I think Oprah was out of her mind for putting this on her list. However, Oprah's theme of books seem to be whatever is the most dark and depressing reading she can get her hands on and this is definately one of those. That was clear, even if I couldn't follow along with what else was going on in the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"From one who muddled through it.","review":"After I finished this book I felt angry at Morrison for being so obtuse. I kept asking myself \\"why?\\" What did it prove that she had to make the book so hard to understand and unravel? I felt like she was playing some kind of literary joke on her readers or else trying to make herself look smart and the average reader look dumb.I feel like there was important meaning in the book, but unless you take a literature class that focuses on this book, most will not likely ever get it -- and to me, that is the waste of a book that so many will read and could be elevated by.Toni Morrison, you are too good a writer to waste your time making your book so hard to understand for so many people. I found myself asking, what was your point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't get it, and I'm upset about that.","review":"Disappointed? I am. I really am a fan of Morrison's work--for many, many years, but I thought there was too much going on with too many characters, and the story gets lost, hidden, whatever. When I invest time in a book, I should be able to understand the ending, that shouldn't be a priveledge because I've taken notes during the reading. The plot format and structure was really interesting, but somehow, some way, it sadly didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric","review":"I tried and failed again. I cannot get through Ms. Morrison's books without frustrating effort, and sometimes not at all. Her writing is sophomoric and lacks the finesse of a truly gifted author. She owes a huge debt of gratitude to Oprah for her support. Paradise, like Jazz, was a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"Toni Morrison has too many characters in this book.

Stick to the facts. I will never buy one of her books again. What a waste!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble In Paradise","review":"This is one of the most muddled books I've ever plodded through. I am the only person I know who read this book from cover to cover, hoping to find some justification for its stellar reviews. I could find none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrison's weaknesses overwhelm her","review":"Ever since Sula, Morrison has been developing a penchant for mythic characters and situations, a prose style which is more oratory than specific, and situations and events which are neither realistic nor magical but a way to avoid dealing with real life. All of these flaws are brought together, exponentially, in this text. The faults are too many to go into great depth: the narrative is too fractured; too much \\"poetry\\" (poetry, Toni, is concrete and minimal, not flowery); one-dimensional characters. But the worst flaw is how Morrison dodges saying anything critical about black people or women, and instead, after a brutal execution, everyone is forgiven and lives on in paradise. Toni, this response to the world is too easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please give me more Ms. Morrison","review":"Tony Morrison is an excellent writer. I simply anticipated more out of her before reading this book. Maybe it is my problem as a white male, but I expected more raw emotion from her characters or better insight on the people she wrote about, or, alas the plight of the African-American woman. Maybe that was the point of the book to show that all of these human emotions have been locked up due to terrible circumstance and treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's Poop.","review":"Maybe I'm immature, maybe I am not intelligent enough, or lack the patience it takes to understand Paradise,or maybe it's poop.I"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time and Patience Required","review":"As a freshman in High School, William Faulkner was required reading.

As a fan of her earlier writings and knowing that she is one of the greatest authors of our time, I trust there was a point somewhere...but I missed it. I felt as if I was reading for required academic purposes. I found no joy in the process. I needed an index to recall the various characters. I would argue that in order to understand and enjoy this book, you need at least a week to dedicate solely to reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrison Rated Way Too High","review":"If Morrison had not won the Nobel Prize there is no way that Paradise would have garnered an even adequate review. Paradise is a disjointed and erractic book. Morrison takes the liberty of inventing a 'style' that would have had a new author rejected by any publisher. It is not literature. Paradise is no more than a collection of words. Morrison is a wonder with descriptive phrases but she is not a wonder with a narrative tale. She simply, as another reviewer put it, can not get 'to the point'. Paradise is not worth the time, the effort or the money. If it becomes required reading in any class; it will be because the instructor does not like the students. It is simply awful. Morrison peaked before the Nobel and she is now on a downward slide.If her name did not sell the book Paradise would have come and gone off the shelves quickly.Give me Saramago, Ha Jin or Grass any day. They not only understand literature - they can write it. Morrison can not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beloved vs Paradise","review":"I must say that I am still trying to get through Beloved, however, Paradise was marvelous.

I've read Morrison's earlier novels. They were good. Perhaps the Nobel and Pulitzer went to her head.

Generally, I've been pleased and felt rewarded by these experiences. However, Paradise was a major disappointment. Given the warnings that the book was complex, I actually read each page, highlighted key passages and kept notes on each character. This did not help prepare me for the final chapter. I am left feeling \\"all dressed-up with no place to go!\\". This is not one that I would recommend for pleasure. No, I will not re-read. That should not be necessary for a pleasure-based text.

It is difficult, we are told, but everything worthwhile is. (Subtext if you don't like this book maybe you aren't up to reading it.) Toni Morrison's book is difficult, but that hardly seems the point. The question is \\"Is it worth the effort?\\" I have been slogging through this book in hopes that the answer is yes but in the end the answer is no. In an effort to understand what it is I was missing I checked out the NY Times website and looked for the review of Paradise. Low and behold I discovered that the NY Times had printed more than one review of this book. A favorable review (quoted above) was in the Sunday Times but a very unfavorable one was printed in the daily paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stumbles over its own words.","review":"The story is so imbedded in unnecessary literary gymnastics that I found this book unenjoyable. The women in the convent were not likeable and the town's people were difficult to follow without a family tree. I felt no empathy for any of the characters. There were so many of them that they all appreared shallow. This is the first Toni Morrison book I have read, and I do hope this was not her best as it would be difficult to see how she could be a prize winning novelist at this rate. It takes so long to find the story that it seems to have lost any plot before it even begins. The premise of the book is fine - it is the style in which it is written that seems most flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big puzzlement","review":"The story is one big puzzle, full of flashbacks that are intertwined and developed, leading to even more puzzlement. I never got all the characters straight, even the major ones. I found it almost impossible to follow the story line. And I found myself falling asleep after just a few pages. However, I plodded on. After all, wasn't this book recommended by Oprah? Didn't this book get rave reviews? Isn't Toni Morrison a Pulitzer Prize winner and a professor at Princeton?It's 318 long long pages and I had to push myself to read it. Halfway through the book I almost put it down. Why was I still getting the characters mixed up. Why wasn't I moved by some of their stories? I hoped it would get better after I passed the half-way mark. It didn't.The tone is heavy and depressing. The characters each have deep dark ugly secrets. There is rarely any relief from the long artistic, somewhat poetic sentences. I didn't understand the ending, but at least it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashback Kingdom","review":"A very hard book to follow. I had to push myself through to finish this book.

I could not finish the book, I tried very had, I read it half way through twice then I read a little further and I just couldn't continue. This was the worst peice of literature that I have ever attempted to read. I can not believe that this book was rated #1. Maybe It's just me I thougt until I discussed the book with the few people that I know who were able to finish the book. I am glad that I did not buy the book, it was difinitly beyond me.

I labored intensely through too long chapters for somewhat more than half the book. The characters were complex and moreso their relationship to each other.

It was a waste and I gave it one star because there no options for less than one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and disappointing","review":"I don't like books that are so pretentious that they make me feel stupid.I got about fifty pages into this book, realized that I still had no idea what the hell was going on, and returned it to the library.To the author: why don't you try writing a book for real people, instead of the academics? That's what all real art is about: to create something that resonates with the common man, not just with an exclusive set of art-minded elitists."},{"rating":"2","title":"death metal guitar pedal","review":"The pedal arrived very quickly and in excellent condition.

Original was better","review":"I have the original DOD Death Metal and the original DOD Grunge Pedals (amongst a plethora of others). The O.G. Death Metal had more clarity. Digitech's version is a little too \\"hot\\" and causes more unwanted feedback. I love feedback but it is much more difficult to control with this version. If you can find an old DOD, get that but this one is still a good pedal. For those who say the Grunge is better, it's a matter of opinion and style. The Grunge has quite the nasty tone but the Death Metal is a \\"tighter\\" sound. The Grunge was made to be noisier because it was intended for grunge!! The Death Metal needed to be more precise for more staccato picking that metal has. For those complaining about not having an old fuzz type tone, you can get this but why would you? IT'S A DEATH METAL PEDAL. They make other pedals that are better for fuzz and vice versa."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"This pedal has way to much high end.

The quality control could have been a bit better: The Step2 emblem fell off, which would have been okay except it covered a 3/4 inch hole from the blow molding process. I'll need to cover it before spring to keep the wasps out. The second issue was the tight fit on the curb side mail door. I tried switching doors but the imperfection was in the box rather than the door. I also agree with other reviewers about the exposed lag bolts. It would have been nice to cover them up with something. I also wish the numbers provided with the mailbox were reflective.Overall the final result is pleasing and sturdy. The price was reasoable and Amazon made it easy. Other than the issues above I would recommend this mailbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite literally invaluable","review":"This book contains 21 meditations that you rotate through each day. On Day 1 you meditate on the first topic; on Day 2 you do the second topic, etc. Then, whatever that day's topic is, you try to remember it during your day.When you've completed all 21 meditations, you start over at the beginning. That may sound repetitive but it's not: Every time you go through the cycle of 21 meditations, you get new realizations out of the meditation you did just 21 days ago. It's like peeling an onion; it's like you're getting to a little deeper level every time you do each meditation. It's quite amazing.Since I've been doing this, I really think I've become less of a jerk. (Still got a ways to go.)

I've practised buddhism for more than 25 years, and honestly find the approach outlined in this book among the least attractive, least helpful, and most naive of the many books I've read. The title 'to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful' especially rings false to me. Of course this is a lovely thought but I didn't read anything in the contents of the book and the practice it describes which made me happy or which clarified anything. Instead it left me confused and irritated. Perhaps some of the awkward writing is due to translation difficulties, though the book credits no translators -- a point of suspicion, as an enlightened author always credits his or her translator -- and one that added to the didactic, pedantic tone of The New Meditation Handbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"empty and useless","review":"The people buying this book think its a meditation book. Boy did they get fooled. Most of the book is about paranormal concepts like \\"spiritual guides\\" and \\"karma\\" and praying.

If your looking for meditation you will be gravely dissapointed.

I have been schooled in the wisdom of \\"original blessing\\" as a corrective for the concept of original sin, and well, I'm a woman. So I thought this book would be right up my alley. Reilly goes overboard, however, in rejecting _any_ attempts at self-discernment as negative. There is such a thing as self-assessment that is accepting, positive, and life-affirming, without necessarily approving of everything that we accept about ourselves.In the end, by overlooking the necessary distinction between \\"acceptance\\" and \\"approval,\\" the book limits the possibilities for growth that it can nurture. And that's a shame. It is, ultimately, patronizing to believe that women are too fragile to handle self-critique. We can be our own best critics, but this book won't help.Conclusion: stand by with the insulin shots while reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Depth and Direction of this Book","review":"I was disappointed in the \\"new-age\\", self-indulgent perspective this book presented.

It's message and theme are both important and beautiful. The only problem is that when they attempted to adapt it to the screen, the took a beautiful show, and ripped it apart. The plot, characters, and a few songs (Mein Herr, Money) are completely distorted and absolutely different than the original show. This movie should have had a different title other than \\"Cabaret\\" because this is not the same as the magnificent show. I gave it two stars only because the movie itself is not all terrible. This movie and the show should be viewed as two completely different entities, they truly have nothing in common."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Ray, huh, looks like a vhs copy of the film was used to make this version","review":"I bought this movie cause it is one of my favorite films starring Liza Minnelli. the packaging is very nice but the movie is the problem.

This is the SAME disc as before, with new a label on it.They merely changed the packaging, I guess, so that they could mention \\"Chicago\\" in the description on the back cover and tie it into the heat for that film.

With all the interest in Kander & Ebb at the moment, this was a perfect opportunity to revamp a truely classic movie and address the poor transfer of the original issue. Warner are clearly just jumping on the promotional bandwagon with little concern for the value of the movie itself. This is Liza's finest moment and a critic's dream of cinematic metaphor and construction- it deserves better than this.

Chicago is a glamorous, glorified portrait of decadence without consequence, but Cabaret reveals the garish, disappointing underside of it all. The girls, the costumes, even the orchestra is not exactly beautiful. But they are honest. This divine decadence is literally all smoke and mirrors, it is all gaudy makeup over a dirty and desperate Germany in 1931.While I'm not a huge fan of Liza Minnelli, she is perfect as wild child Sally Bowles. Michael York is equally wonderful as the innocent and effeminate Brian Roberts.

From what I can tell, the entire series is based around world war 2, and there are many good transitions in the series from history to story. I don't read Baldwin's books looking for any deep insight, I read them to be entertained. I thought that this book met that expectation quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Helmsman book carries on the traditions!","review":"The fifth Helmsman book finds Wilf Brim as commander of the space port over the capital planet Avalon. As in the past book, Brim finds many adventures to get into with the help of his friends, the Emperor Onrad, and his enemies in the 'League'.As part of the continuing series, I felt this one was the weakest. As a thinly plotted remake of \\"the Battle for Britan\\" the rescues and adventures are somewhat tired and predictable. As an author, Baldwin has succumbed to the hazards of writting a series. However, that does not mean that it fails to carry the plot to a conclusion that leaves room for the next book in the series.This book is predicatable to anyone who has read the series. But it does carry the story of the Helmsman on to the next with Baldwin's usual mix of technical and piloting skills. Perhaps more interface with politics and the Emperor could have spiced the story line up a bit"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the writing","review":"Nothing wrong with the story, but if you react to writing that is extremely clumsy (George Lucas quality) this is a very painful read. It is adverb-heavy, full of turgid explication, plenty of \\"flashing eyes\\", \\"warm chuckles\\", and lip biting as well. On the other hand, if you like the formula, it is a fun read; nothing wrong with WW II, as a template."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Bill","review":"Go BillAs always...he comes with the action and the ladies the helmsman.Continuation of the previous series with similar results most of you Bill fans will know the plot without thinking too hard but hey it is a good yarn and worth a wander through.Good yarn well worth reading and having a chuckleNote this is the return of the lovely Cartier with the legsEnjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR, POOR, POOR","review":"I waited to start this series until I had the first 7 books. I thought I had something after reading the first one. Not so. Brim was a great character to start with but goes down hill after book 1 I guess Baldwin turns him into what Baldwin secretly wants too be, a Lothario who gets all the beautiful, big breasted women including wives plus the action becomes very predictable and unvaried. Brim flies, fights, takes a lot of damage, kills a lot of bad guys and a lot of his crews.Very uneven, poor continuity, terrible morals. I will not be buying the new book coming out this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing plagarist waste of time","review":"Baldwin takes the battle of Britain and rehashes it in space with \\"Starfuries\\" replacing Spitfires. The empire replaces the British empire, etc. etc.The thing that made me throw the book down in disgust was when \\"emperor\\" plagiarizes the famous Churchill speech. Enough Already!And although I really liked the others in the series before this, I'll never buy another Bill Baldwin book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Comparative Analysis of Hip-Hop Culture","review":"At the time this book came out, Hip-Hop was much more diverse than it was today.

I'm sure the quality of the disc/film itself is good, but I felt that I needed to put this on here for people that might be thinking about purchasing this disc. It is a single disc with a Blu-Ray on one side and DVD on the other. It is advertised as having a 6 part documentary on both sides, but this is not the case. I did a little research and apparently you have to buy the 2 disc special edition to get that. This is seems to be unfair and very confusing. We have a PS3, but my wife watches in the bedroom where there is only a DVD player. Needless to say, it's very frustrating that we now have to buy another copy of the disc. CHANGE THE ADVERTISING--it makes no mention of which disc does or does not have various features. Everything looks to be identical on both discs according to the box, and there is no mention of the DVD side not including the documentaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's called Eclipse, because you'll need to look into one after you watch it.","review":"I watched this movie with a few friends at work one night.

As an Amazon prime member I'm guaranteed to have this movie on its day of release, instead she had to wait while everybody else was running down the street to Wal-Mart and getting it Saturday morning. My biggest complaint though is the packaging of the Special Edition Blu-ray and Dvd combo!! They actually want to charge upwards to $30.00 for a single disc release that contains the blu-ray on one side and the dvd on the other! I and others find this completely unacceptable and just another way cheapen their product while cheating the consumers!!

I am so excited to watch it, but I hate that they put the blu ray disc on ONE side and the DVD disc on the other side. So it's one disc but with two versions. Money grubbers is all I have to say about that. I paid about 30 dollars in stores for this ON SALE and they give me one freaking disc! That's not right, I've paid less for a blu ray disc, dvd disc, and a digital copy disc of other movies. I mean heck, Fantasia set was less than that and you got 2 movies - 2 on blu ray and 2 on dvd. I know that Twilight is a high profile movie and that's why they chose this one because they knew people would still buy it.

I guess it may just be me since i see so many other reviews that love the movie, but come on! Even the scene with Jasper meeting Alice for the first time was terrible. Oh and showing the vampires breaking apart like concrete.... really... seriously... If i could i would put zero, but i did like seeing the background on Riley, since i wondered about how he fell in with Victoria. I expected so much more from reading reviews.
