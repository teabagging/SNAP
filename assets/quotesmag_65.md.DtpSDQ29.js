Also I am a Ram's fan, but if this video is about Super Bowl XXXIV, the Tenessee Titans deserve more credit than they got. There could not have been two more evenly matched teams (each in their own way) in that game than if it were rigged. I'll tell you, the Titans did a great job and sure had me on the edge of my seat.

Plus if this game took place today, Dyson would have got the touchdown since of now its if the ball is over the endzone and before it wasn't then titans would have one in overtime. So they are looking at it like the rams were so great but it was such a close game that it they almost lost and probably would have lost if the touchdown counted so they should add more titans to it but still keep a lot of rams in the move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh air!","review":"I havn't heard the complete CD yet(can't find it around here) but I am in love with Kryptonite.It seems that real rock and roll is coming back around,and these guys are like a breath of fresh air to the current music scene.

It just scrapes the service with what it offers on Woodlawn. No pictures, and very little information. I believe it could have been better written and with more detailed pictures to give a more rounded glimpse of Woodlawn. The cemetery is just beautiful, and walking through it gives one a sense of calm. Sad this book did not give the full history of its making, of its great members or the most elaborate and expensive tombs in America. This book does not give Woodlawn Justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Indulgent Navel Gazing by the Author","review":"I can't believe how disappointed I was in this book.Oddly enough, I thought the focus of the book was going to be about the cemetery - silly me!

Not a particular turn-on for me, or probably for most readers. I'm surprised it's been reprinted (poorly, by the way, based on numerous misspellings and grammatical errors). I'd recommend Parisian Nights for simplicity or something more mature and truly erotic, like The Unmade Bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Excellent Guide for the 1st Time Programmers","review":"Contrary to what some may say, windows shell scripting is far from dead. In fact, with each new operating system that Microsoft unleashes on the world, Microsoft continues to develop and expand Windows Shell Scripting's capabilities.As the title says, this book is designed for 1st time programmers who are interesting in getting started with Windows Shell Scripting. However, the book can also be used by more experienced readers with previous programming experience who want to quickly ramp up on Windows Shell Scripting. The author teaches his subject and makes things interesting by demonstrating how to create computer games. This book is definately not for hardcore System Administrators.... but everybody else should benefit from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Some of this book is helpful but for the most part I felt like it was a waste of time. There are numerous type-Os that are sometimes confusing and misleading. Some major concepts are not explained at all. The chapter ending projects are pretty much all the same. Most only use one or two of the new functions covered and ignore the rest. The code is written in double-spaced sections broken up by paragraphs of explanation. Then the whole example is written out again double-spaced. The material could have been presented in a way that is just as understandable in 100 less pages. It seems like a written assignment done over the weekend by a lazy student with an assignment of X-pages due on Monday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Beginner for sure!","review":"While .BAT files still have uses, especially if you're still using older technology, Jscripts and VBscripts are a better starting point for absolute beginners now.

It looks very elegant. I have to say the real watch looks much prettier than the picture (the situation may be completely opposite for some other stuff). Pros are already in the product description. The only complaint I can think about is the chain works like a wrist lace. It's not easy to hook by yourself because you can only use one hand to wear a watch. This is not a big problem for me though. It's water proof, so you don't need to take it off so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty watch....but","review":"I recieved this watch as a gift for christmas and I wear it every day, so it gets a lot of use. I am a teacher though not a contractor so I am not rough with it. Anyway by the end of january the back of the watch fell off. This is a watch that does not need a battery and yet the back just plopped off. So I had it replaced. By the end of february, the little heart charm fell off when I took off my coat. The face is already scratched up. If you are going to buy this watch, don't do it unless you purchace an extended warantee. In a year I'll at least get a new face for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citizen Women's Eco","review":"I love the watch! It looks very elegant.

Once you decide where to put everything, and are diligent about putting your items away where they belong, your \\"purse life\\" will be greatly improved. (Hint: you've got to make a commitment to this kind of discipline or the purse won't work for you.) The size of the bag is perfect for me - never looks bulky, but holds a lot, including a water bottle on the outside, or a larger one inside. The outside side pocket with the flap holds my cell phone securely. The front zip pocket is my \\"office\\" - a place for biz cards, pens, a pad of paper. The purse holds up very well, although the taupe gets dirty way faster than the black, as you would expect.

I think for the price range its a great addition, especially with the useful macro capibilities. Sure its not as fast of a focuser as Nikon's AF-S lenses, but it's also about 1/3 the price. The sharpest point for this lens is 70-220 at F/8, but thats not saying that the pictures are otherwsie unusable. As for indoor use, you need a flash. As mentioned before it really is too slow to use indoors (thats what primes are for anyways) but for the price, quality of the image, its a no brainer to pick it up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value - for the occasional user.","review":"Good value for the money; just don't expect the features or ruggedness of an expensive Nikon macro. What's primarily lacking is a tripod mount and/or VR. The occasional user who owns a sturdy tripod and a remote release can work around the missing features but some care is required inasmuch as this is a loooong lens at full extension.

Mechanicals are acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four-Year-Old Grandson Loves Reading Dick and Jane!","review":"Because my 4-year-old grandson has a strong grip on the principles of phonics, I wanted to share an \\"old school\\" principle of reading with him -- learning sight words and combining them to make sentences, and with a little luck, a story.We made flash cards of the words used in each story and after quickly sounding out the words and recognizing them by sight, Caleb was allowed to READ. His photographic memory probably helps him in the process, but he enjoys reading the short Dick and Jane stories and has already read the first several stories in this book.After a child has learned the principles of phonics, this book will serve as a great beginning reader.

I've read the other Amazon customer reviews and, frankly, I'm stumped as to why anyone would have a problem with Dick and Jane. The illustrations are lovely, the vignettes are clever and entertaining, and the repetetive vocabulary helps kids to feel good about themselves as they memorize these commom sight words. I'd never find fault with something that makes my 5-year-old feel like \\"a real reader\\" the way her 3 older siblings do. First grade awaits in the fall and I know my daughter will face reading with an even happier attitude because of her exposure to Dick and Jane.

In fact, he laughed and enjoyed every page. Our family joyously celebrated his success with ice cream.

The stories are really dumb and without pictures would make no sense. They do not teach a child to really read. It is just memorizing the way words look.

Next, take off the one screw. (I have an AsusEEE). Take out the old (go easy on the clips but it will come out with a little fooling around). Then put in your new ram with the sticker up. THE IMPORTANT thing is that it goes in on a 45degree angle and then you push down. You will feel it slip in as you push it in on the angle. If you try (as I did) to put it in straight it will just be loose in there. It will click into place. Then put back on the cover. Now people say to press f2.

When I try to do the same thing on my old notebook (Celeron M1.73Ghz, 1GB RAM, Intel GMA950), the performance is much better. So the multitasking performance never depends on the memory only, but on CPU, even if you have the strongest Corsair DDR3 4GB memory, it does not make any difference, because the CPU just sucks!

He's only been using it for about a week and now he doesn't want anything to do with nursing, he screams and pulls away until I give him the bottle. I'm pretty sure it's because the nipple on the bottle is faster than I am and he is impatient. Also although it is a good design idea, the outer nipple is soft so it constantly collapses and I have to pull it out of his mouth until it pops back up, which makes him scream again. Now I have to find something that will help with getting the nursing back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"the BEST for nursing moms!!","review":"This bottle is the best hands down for any nursing mom.

Very high resolution. Smooth video playback. Broad compatibility. DX9, DVI and SVHS capable. Supports Windows Vista. The low power consumption means the Heatsink needs no noisy and unreliable fan.Cons - Is an older design, doesn't support the latest games well. Not inexpensive.This is a GREAT video card for a Small Form Factor system (such as a Shuttle) where total power consumption and heat output are important factors.

On both my systems with the lastest drivers installed, this card had strange glitches when multitasking (chatting, surfing, etc) not only that but your could really tell a visual difference between this and the card rival (Geforce 6200 series). Another bother was when the driver CD was installed as complete, ATI put more junk on my system with their utilities then anything. Everything Windows Media Player does for the most part.

I noticed it also will start up CTI.EXE on startup, then this will startup several copies of itself. I saw FOUR CTI.EXE running at the same time, gobbling up 64 MB of ram!! Since when does video drivers hot that up?!Settings are also tricky for a newbie to figure out, and my computer kept resetting displays as well, and I have only the one monitor.

I paid less for the card and it outperforms it in everyway. I would never buy another of these even if all I did was surf the web. They run hot a cause lockups and ATi when I talked with them said they were aware of the problem and recommended a fan. Why did'nt they put one on I asked, and they said it was due to cost. There technical support is the worst I have ever seen. As for gaming my daughter runs a 64MB 4X SIS 315 made by Elite group and it smokes this card.

Ultimatly I decided to buy it and listen for myself...and I sure was wrong! Not only does the soundtrack live up to the music in Resident Evil...it surpasses it! Every track is done very beautifully holding true to the Resident Evil experience as it plays with your imagination all the way through!

Sure, the Cracker/Camper Van Beethoven combo performance is fun, and the live clip of Air is interesting in a throw-back-to-prog way, but the remainder is distinctly lackluster, right down to the now-boring main menu design. There is a fair bit of content on the disc, but hardly any that's worth a second visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically works, but not in the way you'd like","review":"This was an expensive unit (I paid about $50) compared with others, but I went with it because of the reviews. I put a 120GB hard drive in there, and it -does- work, but I have some complaints. The USB cable provided is a little short (3 feet) for my uses. The AC adapter isn't built in, so I have an ungainly brick tangled with the cords behind my desk. And lastly, and most important, the fan is very LOUD. I have it next to a new iMac, and the noise difference from when this drive is turned on is very noticeable. These are my complaints, but if these things don't matter to you, this drive is decent besides these flaws. I liked the IDE/SATA interface options, and I think the case is sturdier than a plastic shell. Plus the harddrive mounts to the bottom of this enclosure in a sturdy way, so I'm not worried about it sliding all over the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd ever made","review":"By accident I found this cd. It was near christmas and I was looking for presents. I bought this cd as a present for myself. I love the singing of Jessye Norman and Legrand is one of the best piano players in the world. The way they arranged this material is amazing. Subtle and intense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even fun","review":"At least Norman's last pop excursion, Lucky to be Me, gave us the camp fun of the diva singing \\"I Love You Just the Way You Are\\". This disc has no such highlight, and consistently displays some truly hideous singing. Pitches are all over the place; wild skids from vibrato to straight tone sometimes occur on the same note; extremes of loudness and softness bear no discernible relation to the words OR the music. I can't tell what the French songs are about because there are no translations, but English seems just as foreign to Norman here, as she puts lots of interpretive noises in places where they simply don't make any sense. It's too bad--to hear what Norman could have done with this repertoire, go back to her French recital with Dalton Baldwin and those delicious waltzes by Poulenc and Satie; Elly Ameling's Sentimental Me remains my favorite of the diva cocktail-music records."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD IS AN EXPERIMENT THAT SHOULN'T HAVE HAPPENED","review":"I have truly been a Jessye Norman follower for many years. On most of her cds, Jessye delivers a great performance. This cd is far different from anything Jessye has ever done. Her choice of doing material by Michel Legrand was a good choice, but Jessye choose to record material by Michel that was never introduced into the U.S.A. About half of the songs on this cd are sang in French. On the other selections used, there was only 3 titles that i'm familar with. In all and all i think this was a wasted project. We should demand our money back for this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"reconditioned?????","review":"I have used the same scale for several years until I dropped the display and broke it.

It was great. I purchased 3 more from AceDepot through Amazon for my children so they didn't have to borrow mine. The first time they arrived in a broken box in a jumbled heap. They were so badly broken that they wouldn't even turn on. UPS picked them up and then 2 more arrived in separate packages. Finally a third one arrived yesterday. None of them work. I was on Tech Support (foreigners) and they said to take out the batteries, wait 10 minutes and then they would work. I called back 4 times and finally they told me to send them back. Don't waste your time with them. The quality has gone out the window since I purchased my first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT BROKE!","review":"I am shocked to see the scale's inner metal structure snapped.It looks like aluminum but, broke like cast iron does.I don't know anything about metal but, it seems very weak.I do have large packages but, I don't abuse my equipment so, I was shocked and disappointed to see that it had broken.It might be capable of weighing over 300lbs but, the scale doesn't seem to be able to handle that kind of weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Cord Placement","review":"I bought this scale in August 2010.

I use it for weighing small envelopes up to baggage and freight shipments. It is extremely user friendly and ACCURATE!

I ended up buying two of these .... one for the home and one for the office.Excellent product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AC Adapter has major design flaw","review":"Got this thinking it was a great deal, and the scale itself worked pretty well, until the AC adapter failed due to a very poor design. The L-shaped plug from the adapter into the scale base protrudes below the bottom of the scale rather than being properly made to fit in the recess in the base. That means the whole time the adapter it is plugged into the base, the cord is bent at a 90-degree angle underneath it, and in a short period of time it WILL break. There is no way to position the plug-in connector so it does not protrude from the bottom, due to its faulty elbow design(instead of a straight plug-in which would be protected by the recess.) So I am stuck going through 9V batteries to use the scale. I guess they got a great deal on a batch of ill-fitting transformers and decided who cares about quality and functionality. Get the scale if you don't mind running 100% on batteries after a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"I have had very poor service with this product. Bought one about 2 years ago and had problems off and on. Decided to give it another try and bought a new one in Jan. of this year.

Got it home, and could never get it to weigh even 1 package. Remote would finally go to zeros, but then when I placed a package on the scale, it would never weigh it.Finally gave up and ordered another kind today and will take this one back and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure frustration","review":"Sometimes it works, and sometimes you have to try many times to get a weight. Accurate when it works. 9v battery receptacle won't release battery and is falling apart--wish it took AA batteries. Concept good--I like the remote, but just plain frustrating to use, if it decides to work that day.

I am now looking for a better choice of scale--one that works and zeroes faster than 2 minutes--when it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS Scale","review":"I bought this scale from Sams. Apparently there are two versions, the scale version that matches the instructions, and the version that doesn't match the instructions. I apparently got the latter of the two.The on/off switch doesn't work. So I cannot turn the scale on. I'll have to go and exchange this. That being said, the lack of useful documentation only confuses the issue more.

I used it to track the weight of my cat who needed monitoring while taking Tapazole for a thyroid condition.

You can opt for Kilograms on the display, if you want. The manual rates the scale as suitable for masses over one pound up to 315 pounds.It is very rugged, accurate, and can even weigh people in a pinch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design...","review":"I was excited to receive this scale expecially since the display was wireless, I thought this will make my daily shipping jobs easier...It turened out, this is just a badly desinged product. First, for you to weigh anything you have flip the scale upside down and turn the swich on which is located on the bottom of the scale. This is such a hussle. There should be just a simple \\"reachable\\" button to press to turn the scale on, but that is not the case. On top of that there is no indicator light to tell you if the \\"base\\" is on or not. When I put a box on top of it, the \\"wireless\\" display just stayed at \\"0.00lb\\". Did not work for me...

To avoid missteps the artist must have the courage of a lion, and an infallible sense of the direction intuited, that realm or sphere he or she is attempting to lead us to.

Storywise it was not bad, it was the typical boy with destiny meets pretty girl and overcomes obstacles to save all of mankind, but the inner workings of it was quite good and had some good backstorying and subplots. I would wish the english dubs were a bit louder, it seems they were always whispering or had the low resonating voices that i had to at times turn the subtitles on. I would say Yeah on a buy of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A epic Anime Heroic Age","review":"From the editorial Review here at amazon: \\"Long ago, the advanced Tribe of Gold vanished from the vast universe.

A feral boy named Age holds the destiny of their species in his hands and the untold power of the Tribe of Hero within.\\"I can not say it better then that!This sci-fi Anime from the very first episode will keep you at the edge of your seat and you will watch each episode over and over again and again.The story is Awesome, The animation is done very well, The voice acting even in the English dub is done great.

I decided that seeing the aura was B.S. but I bought one more book anyway, just to be sure. I bought this book. It is unbelieveable. It explains things in a scientific way that validates seeing the aura. It gives specific exercises for your eyes to make them more sensitive. Within a couple weeks I was seeing the first level of the aura, and I'm the least visual person on the planet. This book was so incredible it is the only book I've ever written a review for.

If you are a Christian and enjoyed books such as Strobel'sThe Case for Christ, you will likely enjoy this book as well.While this book may sway some undecided agnostics who are on the fence about Christianity, it is doubtful that it will have an impact on serious skeptics. This needs to be stated, since the introduction of the book says that the target audience includes such skeptics.As a quick example. Lutzer's own science has a problem. In chapter 5, Lutzer, in reference to the Milky Way, says, \\"Its diameter is about 100,000 light-years\\". According to Genesis, the stars were created at least two days after the earth. Unless Earth is at least 100,000 years old, the light from these stars could not yet have reached our planet (a light year is how far light can travel in a year, in a vacuum). If Earth is less than 6,000 years old, then every star we see has to be less than 6,000 light years away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and empirical, an amazing find.","review":"Lutzer appeals to many audiences, just about every religious background has a reference here. He begins with his purpose in writing this work, to answer fundamental questions that anyone might have, such as \\"Is there a God?\\" and \\"Doesn't science contradict the Bible?\\" He also explains important concepts in understanding the Bible, like dual authorship (God and man), and way to interpret prophesy. I recommend this book for anyone searching to find truth behind the Scriptures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super heavy duty---not!","review":"The tarp arrived with a 4\\" long scrape on it, and the tarp was so thin that the scrape was enough to have produced a cut right through this \\"Super Heavy Duty\\" material. Thank heavens I bought it through Amazon, because they provided for an easy and prompt full refund. The label on the tarp from the manufacturer indicated that I would've had to pay the frieght to send it back for a replacement. I then went to Home Depot's site and ordered one. The Tarps Direct tarp I got through Amazon costs about $50, which I paid because it looked to be an especially durable product. The same size tarp from Depot costed only about $35--but it actually turned out to be a better thicker tarp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"solid tarp","review":"I've had mine for 3 months covering a boat when not in use over the Summer. My boat has been protected from the elements with this tarp, rain and sunrays. Its the thickest one I've found to date. It's worn some, faded mostly, but held up well under the grueling Virginia sun. Using bungee cords to tie it over the boat a couple of the grommets have bent with extreme pressure from the bungees. Overall, a better tarp than any of the other's that I've used over the years. Please remember it's a plastic tarp and with any heavy use they are going to wear, and eventually wear out.****I've now had this tarp for 6 months and over the Summer it has covered my pretty, white ski boat. Unfortunately it has started flaking/chipping off tiny, dark brown pieces. I mean really little tiny flakes and they are a pain to get rid of, especially on a white gelcoat. It's still holding up well in other ways but it is flaking and fading.

This was on an area on one of the inside folded surfaces so you cannot even see it on the outside package. Looks like hole exist during fabrication. Would rate higher except for quality.On existing 12 X 20 frame, tarp is a little large so you will collect water when it rains.

Gilligan's thesis that men develop their independence before women and that women are more attune to their relationships (and hence develop a sense of self much later than men) makes a lot of sense to me. It rings true for many of the women and men I know. One very big critique though. Many have hailed this as a modern masterpiece, which in most respects it is. But I was struck by the tiny samples on which Gilligan builds her theories. In most cases she only sampled a couple dozen people, a paltry number by any standard for a book that professes to inform readers about the differences between men and women. Other than that though, I loved this book and I highly recommend it. I also recommend Howard Gardner's Extraordinary Minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"There are few books I would recommmend more than this one.

Perhaps my expectations were too high after reading the latter book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indepth look at how women develop differently from men.","review":"Dr. Gilligan presents an authoratative look at the psychological development of women, giving particular attention to the moral development course that women take. The work stems from her work as a research assistant to Lawrence Kohlberg in his seminal study of stages of moral development.Dr. Gilligan demonstrates that men and women grow up speaking in \\"different\\" voices. The book presents Dr. Gilligan's work with women and compares that developmental course with that of the males that she and Kohlberg studied in Iowa.The conclusion that males grow up and take on a psychology that is legalistic and logic centered, while women grow up relationship oriented has formed the basis for much of the works such as Gray's Mars vs Venus series."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Else Can Be Said?","review":"For various reasons, I just picked up a copy to re-read and I'm keeping this one on my bed stand. I'm well aware of the controversies surrounding this book but some people need to just relax and not search for precision in a book dealing with human beings' behavior. Gilligan has opened my eyes to so much in the world of gender and made me think more critically, methodology schmethodology. Is that so wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking Research -- still relevant","review":"When Carol Gilligan's book was first published, it stood the male-dominated world of psychology on its head.

Gilligan's book did not \\"move\\" me whatsoever, I found not a single good quote or anything insightful in anyway. Her statements and thesis'es were something any one with an IQ over 50 would come up immediatly when thinking of feminist theory. Her form of writing dissapointed me, giving hypothetical situation A, person B, a man, said this, person C a women said this. It is as if she is giving her report about her lab rats.

The way that Charlie sings and pronounces the words of the songs is very relaxing. I truly enjoy listening to this cd. If you enjoy soft, calming music, then you will love this album.

What a piece of crap. The script is flat, the acting is unbelievably horrid (oh the accents!), and the \\"Last Chance\\" song is like a lingering fart in the room that just won't go away (in episode 2 even the characters are complaining how they want a different song). As usual, the writers didn't know what to do with Dodo, but she is particularly lame here. She must have Stockholm Syndrome, because she's doing her captor's hair and runs after them after they leave her to herself. Character's actions are absurd, but not in a particularly entertaining way, rather they just kind of do stuff because the writers need something to happen.I'm a big Doctor Who fan, and there is no way that I would have made it to the end of this without feeling a strange urge to see every Who episode. That said, it isn't the worst (that's Delta and the Bannerman), but it might make my bottom 10 and those bottom 10 are stiff competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker!","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that The Gunfighters is an unintentional hoot.

William Hartnell really seems to be enjoying himself and is in fine form, there are some tongue-in-cheek, laughable moments (seriously, some scenes are *meant* to poke a little fun at typical Western movies) and there are some great extras included; such as a behind-the-scenes look at the show, as well as the pop-up info that I always enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the world of Filk","review":"A great many of the best Filk artist produce their music onindependent labels, and folks not in the know rarely have the chance to pick up this type of music.The point of most Filk music is to tell a story to a live audience, it doesn't always translate well to cd - Heatheris a star on the Filk circuit and this is a wonderful introduction album to the genre, and it translated beautifully to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reference I have found on the subject","review":"I first used this in a college library reference section.

I don't understand this type of stuff. First of all, it's been done already and secondly, here it's not done all that well.For a real Ribot album try Filmworks 8 or Circle Maker by John Zorn. Ribot tears up the fret board on those - or look for Los Cubanos projects he did for Atlantic. All are great. He even did some great things with James Carter on \\"Layin' in the cut\\" - and his \\"Saints\\" album isn't bad either... Pass this one up though. It's not likely I will listen to this album again in the near future. I couldn't even get all the way thru it the first time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible was written to ordinary people, like you and me.","review":"No book of the Bible has as its subtitle, \\"For theologians.\\" Every book of the Bible was written by men under inspiration of the Holy Spirit and it was expected that ordinary men and women would be able to read, understand, and follow the commands in it. However, it was written in another language, another culture, and another time. Jackson and Henrichsen have written a well documented, well laid out book that explores the basic principles of how to Observe what the Bible says, Interpret what it means in any culture, in English, and to apply it in the 21st Century. They do not tell you, per se, what it means. They teach you how to discover that for yourself -- not through just one method, but through several. This is a basic, easy to follow book that is good for anybody who wants to understand the Bible, or understand it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I had to have this for a class I was taking, so I probably would not have ordered it otherwise.

The ergonomics are also very good, and despite being heavier than some of the alternatives I've found this headlamp very comfortable even for extended use. However, I use the flood LEDs more than the spot, and run up against the problem apparently found in all 5mm LEDs: ugly bluish light. The spot has very nice light but is too narrow for most purposes. The floods give good area illumination, but I'd rather them a bit brighter and the bad color rendition is just highlighted by contrast with the much better light from the spot. I lost my Apex a few months ago and very nearly bought another one, but was dissuaded by the bad color of the flood LEDs. That said, I'm perhaps overly picky about such things and in all other respects this is an excellent headlamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!!","review":"This seller would like you to think you are getting 6 when in fact you are only ordering 1.

Though she does go over curves and some belly dances moves, her focus is on club dance and the club sceene. Her outfits are so tacky and cheesy. I hated this video and I hated the music. The DVD was a waste of time to watch (I was fast fowarding the whole time). Don't waste your time, if you want to watch a belly dance crash course video,[...], it is so much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto! You can bellydance","review":"This is more like a fast demonstration of certain belly dance moves than it is a crash course in belly dancing. There aren't enough repetitions for beginners. If you are truly a beginner, Neon's You Can Bellydance! is much more approachable because it moves at a reasonable pace and you even learn two fun routines. This DVD seems to be geared toward teaching some moves really fast. I suppose if you just wanted to quickly get a belly dance overview and pick up a few moves, this would work. But if you really want to have fun with belly dance, get some of Neon's other DVDs. She has quite a few out there that are much more in-depth, such as Sensual Goddess - Bellydance for Total Beginners. Learning belly dance can be a great way to get a low-impact workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I got this DVD as a gift, and I am thankful I did not spend my own money on it. On the plus side, the instructor does seem to be a gifted dancer, and the moves are broken down in an intersting way. There is an on-screen geometric reprsentation of each move, but I found it to be terribly distracting.If you are interested in actually learning to bellydance, steer clear of this DVD. It is focused on moves to use in the club to spice up your usual dance routine. If you do want to learn bellydance moves for the club, try[...] instead. The instruction is better, the music is less annoying, and there is a better emphasis on freestyle dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It cures insomnia....","review":"It's not entertaining, it's not informative, it's simply a waste of money.

That's what's it all about. There's no thrill. And by the way...I've heard that's not only the gamblers who are trying to cheat. What's my protection against being cheated? That DVD is not telling You the other side of the story. Is it a \\"Powered by casinos\\"-DVD? The joke is on me...I bought this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't what I thought it would be...","review":"I thought this would be a movie starring James Woods about cheating casinos. It is, in fact, a boring documentary NARRATED by James Woods about mostly very high tech methods used by cheaters and casinos to perpetrate and detect cheating.

The activities in the book are basic strip charts, hundreds counting charts, and multiplication charts. All things that I can easily make myself and don't need a book for.Of course, I mainly purchased this for the multiplication songs. The rest of the book contains the lyrics for the songs that are on the accompanying CD. My daughter is a very musical girl and she loved the songs because they are fun. However, they are not very useful at helping her memorize her multiplication facts. The lyrics are tricky to remember and then only contain each multiplication fact twice, which is not enough for memorizing. Even when we replay the songs daily she's not learning her facts.If you are looking for a book that has the facts repeated over and over to music, this is NOT it.

The gas-only simplex is a beautiful tea kettle, well made and nice to look at. After using it for a while, the only drawback I can think of is that it takes a little longer to boil water than your average kettle. The instructions say to only use low heat, and on my stove low is very low and water doesn't boil for over 30 mins! I've since been using low-medium heat, and have gotten the boiling time to 14-16 minutes. Much better than 30+ but still 5 minutes more than our old kettle.All in all I really like this kettle and the extra 5 minutes it takes to boil water really makes no difference to me since the appearance and design is far superior to our old one.

Excellent and I'm sure I'll have this for many years to come. My whole family has tried other kitchenware, but we keep coming back to Pyrex for the \\"best\\". Can't do better than this. Just don't throw cold water on a hot dish! Seems like common sense, but I've known some who have done this and then wonder why it breaks. lol :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indentations in bottom, defective glassware.","review":"The large roaster had slight indentations in the sides but the main problem was the bottom next the the pyrex stamp it had a huge indentation inwards and some scratches off to one side between the corners.

What we get in the book is a series of shorter trips over a few years where the author is not even going in the same direction. As soon as any discomfort is looming the author heads to the nearest B&B, boat or lighthouse to scrounge a place to sleep for the night and a meal. She always introduces herself to strangers as paddling from Alaska to Washington which seemed to be a bit of an ego trip when in reality she was on a 1 or 2 week paddling trip. There were endless descriptions of seaweed to pad the book out. I ended up skimming the book faster and faster looking for something interesting to actually happen but it never really did.

Often pristine and wild, sometimes developed or abused, always interesting, sometimes scary. This is not another machismo assault of man-against-the-elements, this is Jennifer-and-the-sea. And she knows the sea well. This book is a good read. Inspirational and informative; enjoyable for knowledge gained (filling the plate at the \\"intertidal table\\") and emotions evoked (\\"At 2 A.M.

The film packs it's jolts, and is not entirely predictable. The acting is passable. It doesn't dig to deep into backstory, but why should it?

(In a good way!)","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this little gem from Australia, but I was really surprised and pleased with \\"Rogue\\" had to offer. Greg McClean (Wolf Creek) did a great job directing this film for a number of reasons. The first and biggest is the fact that we don't see the crocodile that much. I know, sounds like it could be a let-down, but like the shark in \\"Jaws,\\" it really adds to the suspense and enjoyment of this film. The other is the breath-taking cinematography. The Aussie landscapes never looked so good. And the special FX are great; by far the most realistic crocodile I've seen in a movie yet. It blows \\"Lake Placid\\" and \\"Primeval\\" out of the water in this department. Overall the acting was moderate, but nothing you wouldn't expect in a \\"B\\" horror movie and the story is fairly believable.

The key to prosperity is economic freedom. Those countries with the greatest economic freedom have the least amount of poverty and the highest standards of living. He doesn't seem to realize that if you take money from the rich, you are also taking it from the people whom the rich buy from. He seems to be under the impression that if you have a million dollars, and give it to the poor, you are somehow reducing poverty more than if you hired those same poor people to build you a million dollar house. Poor people aren't poor because rich people are rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"I'm pretty tough to please but I've been listening to this disc over and over since I got it last week. Tommy does have a great sense of humor, and I find the lyrics so fresh and unique. I love this type of roots rock music, with the jangly guitars and the wailing vocals. It sounds like they would be absolutely awesome to hear in a bar, everyone would be up dancing. My favorite track \\"tellin' you what you want to hear,\\" opens with a great guitar lick but then the best cowbell rhythm you've ever heard kicks in and they're off and running. I also like the little snippets of tracks that are only 30 seconds long, reminds me of Let it Be, how they spliced together all sorts of stuff. Buy this disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Review for a CD thats not Out?","review":"Gee.. Now how strange is it when people make a review of a Single that has not been released yet.

All anyone has heard of this new Song is the Demo that was leaked on the net over a month ago. Now sure it says this was to be released July 18, but since it was pushed back till August. I highly doubt they have listen to the actual Import Edition of this Single.

He identifies for us the tough questions we need to ask ourselves about this major crisis, and gently leads the reader to some difficult answers. It is an important book for our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise--Difficult Read","review":"Civilization and its Enemies has a very interesting premise and one that seems logical and reasonable. The author, Lee Harris, maintains that when a society becomes too far removed from the struggle for its existence, a kind of amnesia sets in that erases the concept of \\"the enemy\\". The enemy, he says, \\"is just a friend we just hadn't done enough for yet.\\" This is what happened in America before 9/11. He goes on to diagnose how the attitude of the enemy has evolved and how our present attitude could jeopardize our future.The problem I had with the book is that it is too cerebral-too philosophical. It is too steeped in ancient history and, while this would appeal to some, in my opinion, it is not written for the ordinary person. I ended up having to skim parts of it just to get through it. The author had a great premise but needed to bring it down to earth and make it more relevant to modern day."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY","review":"The title of this book disguises the fact that it is not a scholarly work and is heavy on opinion.

This book is a reminder that not everyone has such attributes. It's a reminder that what we have is hard won, and that it is always threatened by the barbarians at the gate. Harris tells us that the barbarians are getting closer and we will have to fight or be destroyed"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of perfectly good paper.","review":"I had expected an insightful analysis of the motivations behind modern terrorism. Instead I got a diatribe against western liberalism. Lee Harris is the poster child for the modern John Birchers, people who believe our way is not only the best way, its the only way. In an increasingly global economic and political system, his view of the world can be said to be outmoded, at best quaint, at worst pathological for if we are truely to address the problems facing humanity over the next 100 years, we will need tolerance and inclusivness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided Nonsense","review":"History is replete with empires who thought that they had all the answers, that their view of the world is the only one that mattered, that their narrative was the only one to which all of \\"civilization\\" should subscribe. In trying to impose their \\"truths\\" on everybody else, all they succeeded in doing was causing death and suffering for many. And their view was eventually defeated and gave way to another myth. Those who believe in the end of history are as stark raving mad as all the misguided fools who led their empires to ruin. The tragedy now is that modern technology has made weapons so destructive that the coming battles that will inevitably be fought if we go down the insane path heralded by Harris will cause suffering and death on a scale heretofore unseen, and the possible extinction of mankind from the planet. The book that needs to be written is \\"Homo Sapiens and its Enemies.\\" Harris and and his fool ideas could be a prime exhibit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egocentric, ethnocentric propaganda","review":"I agree with some of the reviewers that this book is well written. However, the premise is about as realistic as Bush's statements after 9/11 regarding the \\"hatred of our country's policy of freedom and equality.\\" It is ultimately an extremely simplistic and dangerous viewpoint. I say dangerous, because this line of thinking is what has gotten us attacked in the first place. Either this author is an overt propagandist for America's aristocracy or is simply blind. It is our self-involved, murderous, imperialistic and careless foreign policy that has earned us a terrible reputation abroad, not simply a dynamic that eternally exists between \\"civilized\\" and uncivilized.

The observations were haphazard, and some sounded like the author was making them up as he went along. He has a kind of puppy-ish enthusiasm, but he goes off half-cocked a lot. It's also full of repetition. There are much better books out there, both on nutrition and on these illnesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fluff and filler","review":"The modest amount of solid, useful information contained in this book can be gleaned almost entirely from the well written reviews on this site. The actual book itself is full of fluff--mostly about such poorly defined concepts as \\"stress\\" and \\"supernutrition\\" and \\"excercise, the best medicine.\\" I disliked the poor organization, the repetition, the overall childishness of the writing (it reminded me of a Richard Simmons infomercial). The author did interview (by mail) people with IBD, but the sampling was small and the conclusions he draws from these comments are dubious (I've never had problems with chocolate, and I've never had a flare-up set off by stress either. Sometimes flare-ups have their own mysterious logic) . The book, published almost 10 years ago, is also badly out of date as to medication (it doesn't even mention mesalamine, now the front-line treatment for these diseases)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great self-help guide for IBS sufferers","review":"Although this book does not focus on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) exclusively, this is an excellent book for IBS sufferers to start with when trying to ease their symptoms through dietary restrictions. Not only does \\"Eating Right\\" give a fairly thorough list of possible \\"trigger\\" foods, but it also includes an important chapter on how to supplement a restricted diet with vitamins. Whenever I have a question on what I should or possibly should not eat, I take a look at \\"Eating Right\\" to create a baseline. It's a book that can be used over and over again as a reference. It's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT think this book will tell you anything about IBD!","review":"Dr. Scala is well known as an arthritis expert and in my opinion, he should have stayed in that arena. I have never read a book referring to Inflammatory Bowel Disease in its title that said less about the disease! This is basically a nutrition book, which is fine, but why market it as something specific about colitis and Crohn's?

Released in 1990 it was Petra's phenomenal keyboardist's one and only solo venture. Although it does have Petra influences it has a sound all it's own due to the fact that Lawry uses practically all keyboards for the whole album. Think 80's era Genesis but much more rockin'. He has a great voice as well. I remember the first time I heard it being blown away because his BGV's always sounded great in Petra songs and he can certainly handle lead as well. My three favorite songs are the title track, \\"Video Logic\\" and \\"Radio-ology\\". \\"Video Logic\\" has a very cool message about being tuned-in to what we let ourselves consume as Christians. Every Petra fan needs to have this in their collection. The prices here are unbeatable so pick one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW HEAR THIS!","review":"A big amen to Mark's review. This is a must of you are a fan of Petra. This cd showcases the incredible talents of John Lawry, as a keyboardist, singer and writer. It is the ultimate 80s ccm lp, and sadly it did not make it to the top of the charts.The lyrics are up front and full of conviction. Title track Media Alert, Video Logic and Radio-ology exhort us to be discerning at bwhat we allow to enter our minds as believers (and this was before the internet!).Other tracks call us to action such as The Whole World Is Crying and Stars in the Night. Decalogue runs thru the Ten Commandments in a totally techno wzy.

THIS IS THE SEAT!","review":"We were not sure we really wanted to spend the money but after buying the Evenflo Titan and having to return that for a defect that severely compromised safety and reading so many scarey reviews about other seats we just gave in and bought this one. WE ARE SO HAPPY WE DID! This seat is AMAZING! It was VERY easy to install and it is clearly not moving! It is VERY secure. TEN STARS FOR BRITAX!!!! Our little girl used to scream and cry every time we'd put her in her carrier but she is all smiles when we put her in this seat and start to secure her in it. It is so soft and plus I've been tempted to crawl in it and try it out myself but I just know I'd never fit. We are extremely careful spending money and are always trying to save money so I have to say we have NO REGRETS. There is no price tag on the life of our children and this seat will NOT disappoint you. There are no substitutes out there. Just GET THIS SEAT! IT IS AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away if you have a two door car","review":"I drive a '03 Sunfire and this car seat fits HORRIBLE in it! It's nothing but a 100% pain and so I am returning it. I haven't had it for over 24 hours and I already want to throw it out window. It's hard to tighten the straps because the car seat in rear facing is jammed into the seat. Even the firemen that put it in for me told me to take it back because it was not going to make me happy. Sure enough they were right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to use Straps","review":"I really liked this Car seat especially the print and would recommend it but there were 2 things I didn't like.The straps are very hard to loosen and tighten & the car seat is large. You can not put this car seat in the middle of the back seat because it blocks both front seats from reclining. My husband is 6'2 and needs to have one of the seats far back to ride in it, so we had to put it behind the passenger seat for when he drives."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible!!!","review":"This was the third car seat I purchased and the only one I will ever use again.

Was she serious. I told her \\"Ma'am I highly doubt there are many parents out there TAKING off clips from their car seat.\\" Whatever the clip is being sent UPS ground it will be here in 7-10 days...until then she assured me it was safe.

Britax made that possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good car seat","review":"This car seat is very comfortable and very secure. The only drawbacks I've noticed are how difficult it is to tighten and release every time we put our baby in it and that it is a very big car seat. We read other reviews that it fits fine in their sedan car... Not so much. It fits in my Passat, but the front passenger's knees hit the dashboard. Maybe when we turn it to forward facing it will be better, but it's not very comfortable for passengers in my car right now. I'm not terribly bothered by that since our other car is an SUV and when we go out as a family we go in that one, but if you only have a sedan car it might be more of a problem. I consider both of these things minor and would buy this car seat again. Our daughter seems very comfortable with all the side pillows and securely snugged in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with a different Britax Seat","review":"I had this seat for about 2.5 years. At first, I loved it. Then the straps started getting harder and harder to adjust. It would take both my husband and I pulling on it to get them to budge and even then we could not get them tight enough to really be considered safe. I called Britax (they have the best customer service), I explained my situation and they agreed to replace my seat free of charge with either a Marathon or Boulvard. I chose the Boulevard and I am so happy that I did. It is a fantastic seat and I would highly recommend that anyone looking at this seat consider the Boulevard instead. It is only slightly more expensive but it is much nicer. I also have the Regent which is another fantastic seat and I would highly recommend that seat to anyone with room in their car (because it is huge) and with a child over the age of 1 - it is forward facing only. Britax is the best but unfortunately there is a design flaw in this seat in the way that the buckle is made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carseat, but I prefer the marathon","review":"We bought the Decathlon as our main carseat, and a few months later needed another carseat and purchased the Marathon. The padding in the Decathlon is nice especially for the smaller infant. I love both carseats but find the harness tightening mechanism much easier on the Marathon. The button mechanism just isn't as easy on the Decathlon.The Decathlon requires an amazing amount of strength and several pulls to get the harness secure around my child. Also the straps are supposed to be non-tangling but I find that every time I put my child in the seat I have to untwist the straps and follow the strap all the way around to ensure it isn't twisted. For some reason my Marathon straps never twist and the harness mechanism is much much easier.The Marathon has replaced the Decathlon as our main carseat."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good...........","review":"just started using the seat last week...everything seems fine...the only thing i am concerned about is the crotch strap. my son is 7 months old and is 30 inches and is already using the furtherest slot of the crotch positioner (there are 3 slots). just hope to get some good use out of the seat..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Car Seat","review":"I loved this car seat so much that we bought the exact same one for our second child.

My son is a big baby. This chair has the capacity to hold up to 65 lbs vs. a lot of other chairs which only hold up to 45 lbs. It is a bit pricey but well worth it!! This is a great car seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat...but rather large","review":"After buying two cheaper car seats with no luck (my son would SCREAM when we put him in them) we decided to try a Britax since they had great reviews. We chose the Decathlon because my son is 5mths old and already 22lbs! He's in the 98th percentile for his age and the other seats didn't adjust to fit his size comfortably. The Decathlon does this quite well! The crotch adjuster is the best! I don't know how we lived without this before. AND he LOVES the seat! The only Con I have is the size. We have a Toyota Corolla and it is quite a scene to watch my husband put the car seat in. We can't put it in the middle seat due to it's size. So we put the passenger seat all the way up and I sit in back when we travel together. Which is ok...but I would prefer to have the seat in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good seat but not for infants","review":"No doubt this is a great seat, but it isn't made for infants, no matter what the description says.

One car seat went in quickly, about 30 minutes. The second seat was a mess. The hold down straps were reversed. It took a little while to figure this out, but the left side strap was on the right side and the right strap was on the left side. The only way we were able to figure this out was because we had another seat to compare to. In my opinion, this is a major flaw in quality control and would have been an easy catch on the assembly line, IF SOMEONE WAS PAYING ATTENTION. I don't know how many other straps are out there that are reversed, but if we didn't swap them, I would have had to twist the straps to make it latch. This would make it difficult or impossible to tighten snug. We bought our seats because they were highly rated in Consumer Reports, but based off of our personal experience, half of the seats out there could be defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scheaffer pens are wonderful writing tools.","review":"If this is the pen I think it is, I had one while in the University.

I actually had two pens of the same model, only one turned out to have a nib that was too broad for me.By the way, in those days a fountain pen cost much less than it does now and more people wrote with fountain pens.

If you like the jazzy side of things well Chris Wood will give your CD dollars worth on Glad as he is screaming thru his sax like there is no tomarrow. Freedom Rider good little jam here too with Winwood expressing his views. Mason's Feeling Alright before Cocker snagged it, good and very impressive.

At the core is a talented group of musicians, led by singer and multi-instrumentalist Steve Windwood, who combine these disparate musical elements to create music that is sophisticated, yet accessible. In the late 60's and early 70's Traffic's music was heard primarily on FM radio-back when FM radio took chances and played songs like \\"The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys\\" which clocks in here at 11 minutes and 42 seconds. Although the first two tracks (\\"Paper Sun\\" and \\"Hole in My Shoe) are a little dated, the rest of this CD is a great introduction to music that ranges from the hard rock of \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" to the quiet folk of \\"John Barleycorn\\" and the moody \\"Forty Thousand Headmen.\\" A great introduction to music that is of the best type-experimental yet tuneful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good","review":"does not contain Light up or leave me alone, which was disappointing, but most of the good stuff is on here. definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost all the Traffic for a casual fan!","review":"If you are a casual fan, then this is about all the Traffic you would need.

It glossed over many of the basic facts of her life that make her who she is. This is why I read the person's own biography on many occasions before I watch the show. In the last few years, Biography Channel has leaned a little more to presenting a more choreographed version, instead of the facts. Presenting years of the individual's life in one sentence, is not the way to go. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Suspense","review":"Canby weaves an intriguing pscho/mystery, taking the reader on a well written journey to a surprise climax. His characters, especially the hero, are believable and pull the reader from page to page as the plot twists and turns. Canby sprinkles his story with local descriptions that enhance like Michael Connelly's Los Angeles. Definitely a recommended read for mystery buffs and I will watch for his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"duh ??????","review":"Half of this calender really makes no sense at all - I am sorry that I purchased it for myself and as a gift.

The 60 minute program addresses the issue of cheating in modern casinos. The casino scams exposed in this video are those committed by outside cheats who work for themselves. Although all the cheating techniques are valid (except a bit outdated) I wish that it told more about the understructure of certain scams.I almost wish that this video were more controversial. It would have been interesting to expose some of the other facts about casino cheating. Many times cheats bribe casino personnel (or even seek employment in casinos) in order to execute certain scams. Other times cheats are hired my casinos' upper management to get some tax-free cold hard cash straight into their pockets. These facts were not mentioned.All in all the video is informative and gives a good overview of the issue of outside cheating in casinos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't try this at home.","review":"American \\"edutainment\\" is a poor medium indeed. Producers often make great efforts to make their subjects seem more dramatic or more interesting by adding corny music or passe dialog. Cheating Las Vegas suffers a little from this but, thankfully the subject matter shines through with the help of some fascinating real life CCTV footage and the remarkable experiences related by it's interviewees. If you have ever been into a Casino, this may open your eyes on some accounts but, even if you've never gambled, this tape is worth a spin. Fascinating stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slippery","review":"I have bought the sugar floatie flip flops in the past.

There are five expansive pieces lasting the best part of 15 minutes each, and the long, flowing melodic lines are given real space to breathe. The performance by the Tallis Scholars is of the superlative standard we have come to expect from them with their characteristic scholarship, precision, fluency and emotional engagement, so that you can either listen carefully to the perfectly clear, crafted polyphony or simply lie back and wallow in the wonderful sonorities as wave after wave after wave of the most beautiful sound washes over you.The Tallis Scholars have been one of the world's greatest choirs for twenty-five years and more. This is one of their very finest discs - and that is really saying something. An absolute gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suncast poor quality hose mobile","review":"Suncast is still the most prevelant brand sold in many retail stores; I have bought two garden hose carriers because of their availability. The large hose mobile barrow broke with 100' foot of hose attached (well under the 225' capacity it validates).

The Philip Glass-esque soundtrack is fascinating to listen to while consuming the images on the screen. On its own, t's also a great collection for meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful even if you haven't seen the movie","review":"I have purchased four Desplat movie scores here on Amazon even though I haven't seen the movies. The music is beautiful and touching. As I've discovered, you need not have seen the movie to thoroughly enjoy the music. Unlike so many other movie scorers, the music of Desplat stands alone as a collection of emotionally stirring pieces of artistry. After seeing the film The Ghost Writer, I was instantly hooked to his unique style. I wanted to hear more of his work and my exploration brought me to this gem. The suspense of The Ghost Writer reminded me of Bernard Herrmann's work for Hitchcock. But Herrmann also wrote some of the most emotionally drenching and romantic pieces for film. One of the songs in this score to the movie Birth is highly reminiscent of Herrmann's score to The Ghost & Mrs. Muir, his crowning achievement. I would highly recommend this soundtrack if you like music that is lyrical, enjoyable and emotional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Lenses...

This last chapter focuses on the harsh realities of modern baseball which to me is like looking at yesterday's papers. Watching Bonds, Mcgwire and Sosa reminds me of the excitement and ultimate dissapointment of the sport. There is nothing romantic about that, the baseball strike, the steroid epidemic and the bastardization of time honored statistics. It is a chapter I will ignore in the future and stick to the original box set which is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every copy has a data error!","review":"The first copy of this I ordered had a data error in Disc 1, right around 20 minutes in.

That said, let me qualify the statement. I have hundreds of documentaries from the BBC to Errol Morris. \\"Planet Earth\\" (BBC) is photographically brilliant and David Attenborough is a very good narrator. Errol Morris can make the most mundane subject fascinating with his superb editing. Ken Burns' series on the Civil War was good, but his \\"Jazz\\" documentary was cursory at best. The recommendations, on Amazon, about this documentary (Baseball) were spot on! It is, in every way, the standard by which I will measure documentaries from this point. I recommend this to any movie lover. One does not have to have an interest in baseball to enjoy it. One may, however, have such an interest after watching this delightful set of DVDs.It is not only Burns' best documentary, it is the best of the whole genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tale of Two Cities","review":"Ken Burns appends his 9 part PBS masterpiece.

HOWEVER, when I opened the package and unfolded the mattress it wasn't NEARLY the size of a twin mattress!!! A twin mattress measures 75\\" long .. this was 48\\" (and the description says 54\\") I'm not even sure an infant would be able to sleep on it! After doing some research, it turns out that this mattress is for a CHAIR!!!! I have no use for this item, so it has been put back into it's box to be returned tomorrow.

I hope to see the continuation of the series with future releases for other Doctors, since one may be surprised about the talent that has worked in Doctor Who comics in the pass would make a amazing set of documentaries.Again this is story that should be in any fans collection, but I wouldn't use the story as a jumping point for fans drawn in from the modern series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revere 10-inch Cover","review":"I ordered this because I had a Revere 10-inch skillet but no lid.

We ran through it once, giggled a little, grimaced a lot. Eventually it got to be a game.

We had the essential Bruce that you had to buy to get the bonus disc. Next we have the Seeger sessions, and now an updated version of it with some new tracks and video just a few months later. How about \\"Born To Run\\" ? An aniversary edition of it with a DVD of a London show in 1975. THEN a 2 disc audio Cd of the live show. Geez, if you have the DVD just record the audio portion. I know property taxes are high in Jersey but does he really need the money that bad? We're all supposed to run out and buy whatever he sells? So much of what he's been doing lately is BORING. I love Bruce and have from the beginning but enough is enough! My rule now is that if it's not with the E-Street Band it's not getting my money. Sorry if I don't share Bruce's artistic vision lately but I know I'm not the only one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, Springsteen is fun!","review":"This is not a record, this is 100% fun! I keep on listening this cd on and on and on...So why not five stars in rating? Sorry, but like many other people I don't agree with the rereleases with bonus tracks 'cause it's only a way to have more money for the record companies. A cd like the original one don't need that. However, the bonus tracks are beautiful.The only songs I don't like very much on this cd are \\"Froggie went a courtin'\\" and \\"How can I keep from singing\\". And now I expect an E-Steet Band cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"Nice music but pointless second release. What next? Deluxe edition, 2 CDs, five more songs? No end to greed in sight is there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milking the fans again...","review":"First off, let me say that I absolutely love this CD. I am, however, so tired of artists taking advantage of fans by putting out a product and then putting out a bonus CD so shortly thereafter. Enough of this practice. It is a total let-down for an artist who claims to be so connected to his fans to keep doing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-traditional performance style disguised as traditional music.","review":"Springsteen is a quasi-folk singer with poor diction that doesn't know what the meaning of traditional music is. Excuse me, but throwing in everything from the kitchen sink doesn't make the music more interesting. It only makes it weird. Nothing sits right with this album. The traditional instruments are mixed with brass instruments and a cheap drum-set that add nothing to the traditional songs of American nostalgia. Nothing needs to be added to the songs if one really appreciates traditional songs as they are traditionally sung and played. This album has tried to popularize traditional music so as to make it palatable to the general public who generally doesn't appreciate the real thing. It might make your toe tap while you listen to it, but so does any rhythm in the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeger? Not Really........","review":"I'm a bit at odds with this work because these are not songs written by Pete Seeger. Does it not seem just a tad suspicious that Springsteen deliberately did not use a single song that was actually written by Seeger? Instead using songs \\"made popular by\\" Seeger to avoid paying royalty fees while freely using songs in the public domain waste bin of lapsed copyrighted material. Then, after using these lapsed songs, he went out and ascertained his own copyright for the arrangements. Therefore, if other artists would like to do these songs, they now have to pay Bruce a royalty fee! You know, for a socialist he's one heck of a capitalist by commandeering these songs for free to maximize his profits. Isn't this at odds with his own well crafted champion of the underdog image? This American Land edition is aptly titled because even though Bruce despises the American capitalist economic system of free markets, he plays it like a fiddle for his own accumulation of wealth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay Me My Money Down","review":"Shame on Bruce. Who would have believed Mr. Springsteen would be gouging his fans like this? Pay me my money down alright - and again, too. Stay away from this rip-off!Like the 'Boss Fan' says in his review: \\"It's only a ripoff if you buy it\\". Right on man. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is too much!","review":"Bruce Springsteen is an aging rocker that needs to check into Shady Acres, and quietly sit and watch the birds sitting on the porch sill and listen to them chirp all day! I'd rather listen to them chirp all day than listen to this C R A P! The Boss(of what I don't know?)has gradually been going down hill since the mid 8o's and his glorious Born in the USA album and tour. I hate it when performers totally change up their style to try and get curious morons to buy albums. Of course these die hard fans would never put down the Boss, he's the man, yeah right! Folks, don't waste your hard earned money to buy another depressing CD, from another washed up Rocker. Don't do it! Those who did are mindless rabble, that probably bought Bon Jovi's latest? Boy those jersey boys sure are losing their touch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Springsteen- Always Evolving, Always Interesting","review":"First off, have to admit that I am a solid Bruce fan. First saw him in the late 70's and have seen him in every decade since. Have every album from his first one to this one, and have enjoyed all of them. So having made that clear, let me say that I really enjoyed this set. The music is fun and it seems like Springsteen is having a good time with this. It is a departure for him as it is the first album he has done that consists of songs from other musicians. This version has extra songs on it and a wonderful DVD that has a nice documentary on the making on the album and four terrific live performances. A couple of highlights from the album include \\"Pay Me My Money Down\\" and \\"American Land.\\" Take a listen to this album and, long time fan or not, this is one to enjoy for everyone. The DVD and the extra songs on the CD make this a terrific buy. There are classic American songs on this album sung by a classic American singer. Really a strong performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with this version","review":"I have no problems with the release of this expanded edition, since the original dualdisc wouldn't play in my car cd player, and I have worked in recording studios and think that mp3s decrease the sound of the original mix.The album itself is excellent. Innovative is the word that comes to mind. The acoustic thing has been done, but the use of the horns and organ, mixed with the rousing reworkings of the material, make this album a joy to listen too. It is different from what most artists are doing today. Instead of doing the whole bluegrass thing, which has been done a lot recently, Springsteen mixes the style of each track, incorperating them into \\"gutter music.\\" The rawness of the takes create a ferocity that professional producers cannot achieve with countless takes and overdubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over yourself","review":"For all of you giving the negative reviews regarding the expanded version of this cd I say GET OVER YOURSELF. All 5 of the new songs are availabe or will be available to download. So if you do not want to buy the cd again you can download the 5 new songs for less than $5.00. Nobody is holding a gun to your head to buy this cd. For the record, the new cd version is excellent. The five new songs are great and fit in well with the original. The Bruce original \\"American Land\\" is a must have. The expanded dvd with bonus concert material is also excellent. The concert I saw this summer was my 12th Bruce show and quite possibly the best even without the E Stree Band. In fact the E Street Band better take notice. Bruce showed he can put together a hot band without them. I think the reviewer that called Bruce a dried up old prune who uses his fan's money to smoke \\"week\\" and drink beer must be a GOP mole with a grudge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love this CD.

It's a great product overall though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the sixth edition if you can.","review":"I bought the seventh edition because it was required for a class. I borrowed the sixth edition from a friend that took the class a few years ago and was floored by the differences. The seventh edition is exactly the same, except they removed some entire sections, removed some very useful examples and information from some other sections, and rearranged some problems and some section numbers to make the sixth edition unusable for homework assignments.If you can get a key that tells you which sections and problems correspond between the two editions, or you are just buying the book as a reference, get the sixth edition (significantly cheaper and better).I am constantly appalled by the practices of these text book publishers. They charge outrageous amounts for the books, make easy and unnecessary changes, release a new edition and force students to buy the new ones so they can make more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"easily understood.

The content is too brief and most topics are not covered adequately. Perhaps the older longer editions were better? The treatment of PDE's is very brief and the book has more of an emphasis on formulas and their applications rather than explaining concepts in depth. The presentation is short and jerky and very superficial. Kreyszig or Zill are much better book. Stay away from this book, at least the seventh edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so advanced engineering mathematics","review":"Might be a satisfying undergrad text, but as grad textbook is not great. It tries to cover every math subject that an engineering might come across (linear algebra, PDEs and complex analysis) but by doing so it ends up covering only basics without rigorous treatment of the topic. If you are a math guy or a PhD student from any field, do not even think about buying it, if you are an engineer it might be good enough. For linear algebra I personally suggest Shilov's book, old style but rigorous and complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH THE MONEY!!","review":"The book is very well laid out for engineering students.

From those sections, I can safely conclude that this textbook was the most useless textbook I've ever had to use. Every example is of only the most basic cases, which makes it impossible to solve problems that are remotely different from those shown. The only thing worse than the textbook, was trying to make sense of the professors teaching the course. I'm sure that there is a more useful textbook out there, so buy that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute outfit","review":"Purchased this outfit for my son's christening.

This fully described and illustrated one potential approach requiring sending a combination fuel generating plant and return module to the planet prior to sending a crew to Mars on a direct landing vehicle.in Addition, certain exterior scenes appear to have been shot in the dessert with a red filter and actors wore good representations of a martian space suit.

It is approximately as long from heel of hand to longest finger as a quarter.

Overall, I still really like this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Compact enough to fit into small gig bag. Does not support from the neck the way larger stands do.

The other guitar I have is on a full-size stand. For my purpose this stand equals the full size stand. The mini-stand is very stable for my purpose, folds up small for travel, and is low-priced to boot. I am very happy that I bought it. Of course if I needed to use my guitar on stage where lots of people go back and forth I'd probably use a full size stand, but for my room in a corner I could not ask for anything more practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand for my small guitar","review":"I have a small guitar theCordoba Requinto 1/2 Size Classical Guitarthat I love.

Nice job, Fender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for a full-sized stand","review":"I've owned one of these for about a year and a half, and frankly wish someone had warned me off before I bought it. It's decently constructed and has held up ok, but it's inherently less stable than a full sized one. The biggest problem I have is that my guitar strap frequenty hangs up on it, knocks it over etc. When I'm trying to switch instruments quickly it's a bummer. And, not surprizingly, it doesn't work with my banjo at all. I've not had the guitar knocked over yet, but I'm always a bit nervous that it will be. You are better off with a full sized stand, even if, like me, the small size and portability are what attracted you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fender Mini Acoustic Guitar Stand","review":"I have my classical guitar wresting on this Fender guitar stand.I feel that it leans back slightly too much for 5 stars, but it is quite compact and portable with no screws to worry about.

Of them all I rate this (and the similar one for electrics) as my favorite. I'm not a big Fender fan but this is probably the finest thing I have ever used with the Fender name on it. I am currently using 5 of the acoustic design and three of the electric design. They are small, sturdy, light, and do exactly what I want; hold my guitars and stay out of the way. The price compared to other stands is also a factor in my rating. For the money they stand alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"This stand folds into a pretty small package, but supports the guitar very solidly. You would almost have to INTENTIONALLY knock it over, I don't think a casual bump would do it. The only complaint I would have is that the guitar leans back a bit far. My other stands are pretty standard, with a vertical riser to support the neck, and I'm used to a more upright stance. Maybe that's just a matter of taste, but otherwise this is a great stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unobtrusive","review":"Not your average Giant Clumsy Guitar Stand, but it works. The only drawback is that it is literally not big enough to provide a very stable base of support.

I think the organ hampers his style, which might be why he never tried it again. REVELATION BLUES has a churchy feel to it and showcases Garland's famous locked hand chordal displays. I'LL NEVER BE FREE is quite long and slow, and seems an odd place for a drum solo, brief though Taylor's is. BACK SLIDIN' is another blues, and Sam Jones gets a taste on this one. On some of his earlier albums Garland played more tunes of shorter duration, which I think works better over all than the longer program here on just a few titles.

This portrayal of the trials and tribulations of an infantry company entering combat at the end of the North African Campaign and then into Italy is about as perfect as it gets. I was particularly impressed by the film's use of combat veterans of the Italian Campaign. Watch the way in which a 57mm anti-tank crew places fire on an enemy position in support of the company's fight through an unnamed town. You could never get actors to duplicate the smooth, cool precision of that gun crew. The ending scene of the movie is a true tear jerker. The scenes of mud, rain, and filth are impressive. This is a film well worth purchasing and watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story of GI Joe","review":"Until Saving Private Ryan came along, this film was considered the sine quo non of all war features. I saw it when it was first released and agree. It was on NY metro TV for a few years and then withdrawn until a few months ago. The problem was in copywright and ownership rights but that appears to have been resolved. Mitchum's breakthrough role, it has a toughness and reality of what an infantry rifleman's existence is all about--fear, terror, horrible living conditions, and the awful feeling that living long enough to get home is not an option any longer. Unknown to many, Mitchum plays the part of an actual infantry captain named Henry T. Waskow of Texas and several scenes depicting his death come from Ernie Pyle's book \\"Ernie's War\\", pages 195-197. Read the book; buy the film. You will be shaken to the core as Captain Waskow's men say their farewells to him as he lies next to an old stone wall.

The entire plot for this book is thick, and the people who you believe are innocent, could really turn out to be either! Despite the fact that some of these Mayan names could be a little confusing, it was definitely worth it. A genuine X-File. You know, the cases filed under X.

It is very, very good for something from the '80's. I would've loved to see one of their first concerts in those days. My mother and oldest sister saw them perform in '89 and they were just a new band in a gym. Nobody would get up and dance to the music. The days when they were nobodies. Weird, huh? Of course, they don't have to be begging the crowd to dance these days. Anyway, please enjoy this record! It really rocks!

Perhaps the desert storms were responsible for some major equipment dysfunction. It is pretty obvious the actors were a little confused - their acting is stiff and mechanical - I've seen elementary school plays with more flow. Maybe it's because the story is going nowhere and does nothing. The characters are so empty you really don't care for any of them - except maybe Ben Cross's character who you sort of feel sorry for since he obviously is a villian on the wrong set.

The girl chosen to play Diane Shannon was a poor actress. I did not believe for one second that she was in love with Rashid. And where did she meet him before? I felt like there was another story there that we were missing all together. They spent too much time on Adriel and Leon and didn't interconnect their characters into the movie well enough.The whole movie seemed choppy and slow.

All the music and most of the playing is excellent. I'll even put up with Steve Katz's bizarre fast vibrato to hear the powerful, poetic \\"Morning Glory\\", a Tim Buckley tune that becomes deeper and more meaningful with each listen. Al Kooper is not the singer that DCT was, but this music overpowers any vocal shortcomings. Kooper's \\"Modern Adventures...\\" is a masterpiece of modern music. Who cares what genre it is. There's only two kinds of music, good and bad, anyway...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly average","review":"With all due respect to those who wrote glowing reviews of this CD (and there were many), this has to be the most average CD I've ever heard. While there really is nothing bad about it that I can think of, absolutely nothing sticks in my mind either. The singing is competent, but it doesn't stand out for me. There are some good instrumental breaks, though.

He made one classic LP with them, then left/was pushed out, they hire a singer and BOOM, they explode commercially. Talk about irony. Unlike many, though, I don't put down the Clayton-Thomas version of the band. In fact, I think that the self-titled LP was a classic of a sort. The material (all covers, right?) was well-chosen, the arrangements were tight and imaginative, the production was incredible, and Clayton-Thomas did a great job. It only lasted one album, but it was a great album.But this is the real McCoy. A groundbreaking stunner. Had it not been for Kooper's vision, that second BS&T; album could never have happened. This was the child that was father to the man. Though it has escaped grandiose status for almost 40 years, it is a stone cold classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"a most underrated album","review":"as someone wrote...no this is not the second album.this is an al kooper album and the rest....well thats bs&t as the world came to know them after kooper's departure.in my opinion kooper is one of the great songwriters of all time,rivaling mccartney/ lennon/brian wilson or even mozart for that matter.unfortunately i believe his discography has many weak spots,but this album is not one of them.it is perfection in every way including album cover,production,originality and you name it.there are many people who should hear this album who have not."},{"rating":"2","title":"B.S.& T. is Only Good with Al Kooper","review":"This is an exceptional album.....not your typical Blood, Sweat and Tears commercialized garbage that was created after this album.

While I do think vols. 1-6 are all must haves, let's not forget 7&8, both of which are excellent. Vol. 9 is widely considered by most Cafe Del Mar fans to be the weakest in the series (just avoid it all together) and vol. 10 seems to be heading more in the direction of the last volume. One of the reasons why I (and most people) listen to this type of music is to transport us into another world...to make us feel transcendent or alive in a way other music just doesn't. Besides the last few songs, most of this lackluster and boring comp. is repetitive and just not very interesting. Bottom line: If you didn't like vol. 9, you will not like this one either. If you're new to the Cafe Del Mar cd's and this is your first purchase, go back and buy vol. 5 (the best IMO) and then move on the the far superior Hotel Costes or Buddha Bar series."},{"rating":"1","title":"way to spacy... what happened to the warm summer feeling?","review":"The Cafe del Mar series quickly seem to loose their warm summer vibe feeling... As one of the best compilation series around, They magically used to reflect the sun, sea, warmth, and sexy smooth ibiza feelings. Helping you to relive your summer holiday in Greece, Spain or Italy when you were enjoying your HUGE cocktail. But halfway volume 9, continuing in volumes 10 and 11, the series lost this feeling. They become WAY TOO SPACY... sounding too much like ultra-clean techno studio mixes without any mediteranean passion. The earlier cafe del mar editions used to give you that great vibe. I suggest you stick to the previous volumes 1-8 (maybe 9) and spend your money on other compilation instead. Believe me, you won't regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I've been a die hard fan of the Cafe Del Mar releases, but in my opinion, since Jose Padilla quit compiling the compilations (Vol 6), the series have suffered. Cafe Del Mar Vol 5 is my favorite, but since the release of Vol 8, the music has been to new age sounding, and been lacking the soulful down-tempo grooves, which is what originally attracted me to the series. I listened to this CD at a local shop, but didn't end up buying it. I think the Man Ray series would be a better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment...","review":"I'm pretty dissapointed.it seems that volume 10 had lost contact with the special emotionally charged sound,that was caracteristic to this compilation until two years ago.I felt on volume 9,that something is wrong,though I really liked it.it was different than the previous,it had its own personality,just that I wouldn't called it cafe del mar.Volume 10 is far away from the \\"cafe del mar\\" feeling that was typed in my soul through the first eight albums.it's a good product,can't deny it,but I just simply wouldn't call it cafe del mar...something else maybe.I really misses that little extra,that bonus,which was offered on almost every volume,an \\"outsider\\",wich made it special.I'm talking about names like Thomas Newman with Any other name,or Stan Getz,even a cover of Gula Gula from Jan Garbarek(yes,volume 8 is my favourite)...where is Talvin Singh?it's not bad,but certainly not my Cafe del mar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could use a bit of fact-checking or editing","review":"This book is really the only one of its kind, so it may be an OK resource to start.

There is an error on the map as well, with two locations labeled \\"12\\".Unfortunately, one of the most lovingly-described campgrounds, Orr's Island, is in fact an RV-only no tents allowed campground.

You would think they would had at least put the remix of \\"Let the Music Play\\" on this collection. Secondly, The sound quality on the song \\"One Man\\" is awful. There's distortion threw out the song. I guess there was problems with the remastering of this track, but all the other songs sound excellent. and finally, there were many of her tracks omitted from this collection such as \\"Stop the Noise,\\"\\" Dancin',\\" \\"You Put a Spark in my Life,\\" \\"It's Over Love\\" and \\"Believe in Me.\\" It was nice to see some of her newer material here though.

Well I bought the CD and I was bitterly disappointed. The sound quality is good but not excellent. They could have at least remastered it.And also there was a MAJOR blunder.

Specifically, this book provides detailed information on spacecraft performance, mission operations, tracking and data acquisition. This book also examines and evaluates the collected data and presents the latest findings about Venus for late 1960's era. Finally, because this spacecraft was built from spare parts for the Mariner Mars 1964 mission, the engineering behind this process is also discussed.Due to the age of this book and high desirability by collectors, it is difficult to find a nice used copy of this book which around at least 50$ or more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice toy but pretty useless in low light conditions","review":"I love my A500 Samsung phone!

The band consists of two guitarists, a bass player, and drummer. However, each track emphasizes a different quality in the bands repetoire. Good Sons and Daughters and Too Many Twenties rock n roll with abandon while Different Rub has a great bluesy feel. To The Hum utilizes the accapella and Remember Me By and Skin are nice acoustic numbers.Other tracks emphasize vocal harmonies while others a stunning guitar passage or even a crisp balance between the rhythm and lead. And the drumming styles are quite unique. Furthermore, the lyrics by Bob Walkenhorst are touching throughout this record.Sometimes, a record does not have to be a commercial sell out to make its mark. The Rainmaker's Skin surely succedes on all accounts and those looking to broaden their musical horizons can start right here with this gem.

The plot: a comic illustrator joins an artist colony (run by Yvonne De Carlo!), and discovers that her work calls forth a demon that kills and eats the other colonists. Now, I know that makes it sound like a masterpiece, but trust me, it ain't! First off, the demon is an overly-cute, seven foot pile of rubber. It inspires no fear, and gives hell itself a bad name. The only reasons I bumped this one up a star are 1- it contains the most idiotic, ridiculous piece of \\"performance art\\" ever filmed! And 2- The ending veers wildly from eye-rolling wimp-out, to downbeat, \\"twist\\" ending. After witnessing this, I'm surprised it made it onto VHS format.

The writing was alway far superior than Days. They did not have to repeat and repeat the same lines over and over. The stories are more believeable than Days. Days continues to support bad people always winning out. Another World's characters are far better than Days. The lines and expressions used are so funny.

This story revolves around the race he did many years ago...to catch a horse. It, also, introduces a family feud. Fine performances all around.

It is a smooth, concise, and exceedingly enjoyable listening experience. Even the A&R; department took a little time to make sure the transition between cuts is smooth and makes sense.There are absolutely NO duds/fillers on this project. Alex has submitted an earthy, soulful project showcasing again his keyboard mastery. There are no gimmicky experiments - this is simply quality music - for grown folks.If you are a follower of Alex Bugnon, this is nothing more than a promise fulfilled.

Although he doesn't get the nuances, like Hispanic cultural awareness (even between 1st generation and 2nd/3rd generations in the U.S.), we are glad to see them represented. Based on the different levels of thinking presented in the stories, we anticipate him enjoying it for a few years, as he will discover new things going on.

His philosophy was there are so many wonderful women, why settle for one. Until he met Dr. Rebecca Knight. She's a former child prodigy just learning to embrace life outside of academia. Rebecca knew Shane's history and was too inexperienced in understanding her own emotions to allow him to see her true feelings.

To top that all off, Rebecca isn't even likable, let alone relatable. When the male character says \\"we're going to have sex because I said so and you'll just have to get used that\\", I have to stop. That isn't happily ever after or true love.

I read other reviews for this Anza Numb Cruiser before buying it - all indicated it was sturdy. My father confirms this. He has been VERY pleased with it - says it feels very sturdy and well-balanced. He is especially pleased with the fenders - he says they are sturdy, as opposed to the flimsy ones he has seen otherwise. If you want a bicycle for exercise and/or casual riding, particularly on dirt roads, I recommend this model.

I would put it in the near-great category, along with Nancy Collins' IN THE BLOOD. Though Somtow is a good writer and does an admirable job of weaving a complex story, by the end, it all seems a bit hollow at the center. It doesn't help that the novel ends in a predictably bloody fashion. Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that the vampire is stuck in the body of a 12-year-old boy and therefore, despite assertions to the contrary, cannot see things from an adult perspective and make full sense out of his 2000 years of experience.

They make her bland, unoriginal, and so perfect you start siding with the queen character. This book is no exception. The short stories of Jane Yolen and Abigail Rouse's books are much better. I opened it up expecting an epic full of strong women. Just because women are the main characters does not make them strong in any way. This book just seemed so bitter at men and tried to make passive-aggressive insults at them, completely ignoring Snow White."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Fantasy Indeed","review":"I was disappointed and disgusted with this book. The goal of the book was to create a darker retelling of the Snow White tale. I thought the characters were completely unsympathetic, which is why I disliked it so much. If the characters were more lively maybe it could be better. For all of the violence and sex the book was strangely apathetic. Well, I now know dark fantasy is not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror, not fantasy","review":"Having loved the previous novels in the fairy tale series, I had great hopes for this novel. I thought that using the Demeter/Persephone myth was a great idea. Unfortunately, the characters were seemed to be empty caricatures and the story much more horror than fantasy - I wish editors would stop linking the two genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much for me","review":"OK. I must not be a fan of dark fantasy. Maybe that's my problem with this book. However, I am a fan of Terri Windling's Fairy Tale Series. I bought this book in hardcover because it was a part of the series--although the fact that it was written by Tanith Lee gave me some serious qualms.I can admire that Lee is a talented writer than can truly mine the depths of darkness to write a fantastic story. However, even while I recognized Lee's talent when reading this book, I was repelled by it. One of the professional reviews stated that she explored the sex and violence of the Grimm version of \\"Snow White.\\" That's true. However, this book simply went too far for me. If memory serves me correctly there were at least 10 separate acts of rape. Very likely I'm underestimating that number.If you like dark fantasy and/or Tanith Lee, you'll think this book is fantastic. If you're at all squeamish about reading about rape, I recommend walking away from this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritating and disappointing","review":"I've loved several books in the Fairy Tale series, especially Tam Lin. I started reading this book ready to really enjoy it, but my assessment kept dropping as I went, and finally I put it down unfinished less than 2/3 through. The characters were completely unengaging, every relationship (and all the sex, including the stuff that was supposed to be fun) was depressing and sleazy, and the slightly adjusted mythological names were annoying (if you're going to use them, use them). I didn't care about any of the characters, and everything they did seemed like just another bit in a string of events, rather than a personally shaped life. Parts of the book seemed promising, but overall it struck me as a lengthy and pointless ordeal. I'm sorry to have liked it so little, and hope other work of Lee's is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!","review":"This book was an absolute waste of time. I have to agree with memoryanddreamddd and Eva-Lise's reviews, the characters were entirely without personality. They went through this story completely brain-dead...it was really abnoxious. I felt that the imagery was trite and the story line was poorly put together. I read the story hating every single character (well actually hate would involve some feeling, I should say I was completely indifferent to all the characters). More over, I hated the authors writing style. Her sentences were choppy and confusing. Practically every other sentence I had to read twice in order to simply understand what exactly was being said.

The mixing of the two stories, Snow White and the Persephone & Demeter story of Greek mythology was interesting conceptually, but didn't seem to work well overall. Actually, it seemed more the latter than the former, when it was supposed to be the other way around. I wanted to sympathise with Coria, but she was written so distanced that I just couldn't. Everyone acted crazy and cruel. Maybe that was the point, but it failed to reach me in any meaningful way.\\"Jack of Kinrowan\\", by Charles de Lint is of the same fairy tale rewriting collective as \\"White as Snow\\" and was a much more enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough of 'The Nanny'","review":"Because I love 'The Nanny' this book was a Must have.

VERY misleading by Amazon. They should immediately label all of these products with a \\"Brazilian\\" label. I am very surprised they didn't do this after the very first compliant.In reading the first reviewer, I am shocked to see they contacted Rosetta Stone and they didn't even offer standard Portuguese!

A vast majority of the expensive DJ headphones that are on the market are so cheaply made that it should be illegal.

So intend to buy them once a year. Like the Sonys, the plastic piece that holds the earphone on to the headset is cheap and cracks, then eventually splits in two. It's the most strained part on the headphone because it is constantly being pressured by taking them on and off. If they just use a tougher material, like aluminum, titanium or something it would solve the problem and they would be useable for a long time. I think it's the manufacturer's way to consistently get DJs to buy them again and again.

Skousen then smears St. Augustine of Hippo - blaming him for the division of Christianity. He lambastes Alexander Hamilton - almost to being a criminal.Skousen's scholarship is poor at best; he will make statements and \\"support\\" them with quotes that are out of context or completely wrong.Some chapters are based almost entirely from a single source; one chapter - on the revolutionary war - is completely without reference (and filled with numerous factual errors.)Finally, Skousen suggest we may be lucky enough to undergo a \\"cleansing\\" that will lead to the loss of numerous lives, and eventually allow the dawning of \\"God's Law\\" - and the establishment of an agrarian society.

The book would benefit from some copy-editing - thus only 4 stars; however, the directness of the author's voice and the clarity of the world she describes is worth any amount of typos. She describes the people and the setting so well that I surely recognize my colleagues as cousins to her colleagues.If you are interested in Sierra Leone, international aid initiatives, volunteerism, or the practice of medicine in impossible situations, you would do well to read Green Oranges.

I guess if you're looking for a travel guide that details places that may or may not be haunted and you like listening to \\"ghost stories\\" that may or may not be true then this is great.

I guess there's never anything better than the real thing like frozen water, i.e. \\"ICE\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Recommend This Product","review":"The gel pac is fine but the cover is cheap and flimsy nylon that pills and tears when it makes contact with the compression straps. Retains heat or cold well, but is overpriced. I recommend the Caldera products as an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"review for elasto gel wrap","review":"After reading the instruction booklet that accompanied the knee wrap, I was so disappointed. I expected the gel wrap to stay cold for 3 hours...... I didn't even get 1 hour.I'm back to using a bag of frozen peas and that stays cold for a long time.I no longer have the box or insert that came with the wrap --- you would have heard from me if I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold as Cool?","review":"I am 47 years old and have moderate to severe arthritis in both knees. I had been using an old fashioned ice pack to ice down my knees after I was on my feet for an extended period of time. This worked well to reduce swelling but the drawback was that I had to stay still, usually lying down on my back, and had to secure the ice pack in place with a wrap. I bought this product because of its flexibility. It does come as advertised in the sense that it wraps around my knee very comfortably and stays in place even if I am moving around. What a great thing - right? Wrong. As at least one other reviewer mentioned the problem is that it is not very cold. I would call the temperature only 'cool' at best and it does not maintain this level for long. I wish that they would make one that held a colder temperature but as it is now, it's not as nearly effective on my swollen knees as a simple bag of ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old after awhile","review":"Saw the first season video tape of this BBC comedy at a friend's and laughed and laughed. So I decided to purchase the entire DVD set. What a disappointment. The second and subsequent seasons showed that the writers had given it their best and all in the first season. The funniest segment in each episode really was the delivery of a joke at the end of the episode by the vicar to her airhead/incest-bred assistant to see how she would react to the joke. But the jokes got even worse than the writing of the episodes, and that's when I decided to shelf the set until I get really bored enough to watch the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by canned laughter and childish jokes","review":"Really loud fake laughter, terrible dialog, I lost interest in the first episode. After several more episodes, I thought boy, this is really not for me. Very weak TV, nothing like Fawlty Towers or Ballykissangel in terms of quality. How many boob and pooh jokes can you take?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish the first show.","review":"I got a DVD from the library hoping for something along the lines of \\"Keeping up Appearances.\\" Unfortunately for me, the first episode was filled with lewd jokes. Lesbianism, sex with animals, and a long conversation about why there should be gay vicars. The actors were okay, but I'm not willing to sit through all the crud for a couple of laughs. I'm really turned off by entertainment using their medium as a soapbox for preaching homosexuality. It's soooo boring to keep seeing the same type of thing over and over again on television!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite","review":"I probably should buy a replacement copy of this now. My husband and I have watched it repeatedly. What characters! If you enjoy British humor, this series is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This series will convert you","review":"If you need to laugh and see God in the ordinary and very peculiar, then this is the ticket.

'The Vicar of Dibley' follows the misadventures of a quirky & vivacious female vicar in a quaint English village... Dawn French is superb as the vicar Gerry who valiantly 'shepherds' a flock of lost sheep (her colourful bunch of parishioners) while keeping her sanity & humour intact. Witty script gamely supported by excellent ensemble acting from a lovable cast ~ absolutely hilarious!! This box set contains all the episodes & specials, definitely worth getting if you are a fan of Dawn French :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vicar is wonderful!","review":"We were given this set as a gift and absolutely love it.

This is everything except one of the red nose specials with Jonny Depp and Madonna- includes the Christmas and New Years Holy Wholly wedding of 2007. Dawn French at her best with good British Comedy. Writers are famous for their work in Wooster and Jeeves and the Black Adder series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vicar of Dibley","review":"This is one of the funniest shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Dawn French plays a perfect contemporary Vicar that has to put up with crazy parishioners while keeping her cool. Her Verger is a simpleton but sweet and innocent who finds her exact match in a soulmate. I have never laughed so hard in my life. I will miss this show and hope, in the future, they make a movie based on this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"We All Need a Vicar!","review":"My wife and I have spent the last ten years getting to know the Britcoms of BBC. The Vicar of Dibley is a cornerstone for any collection. Dawn French is wonderful as the trying to be sensible lady vicar. The outrageously funny people of Dibley provide all the comedic relief. Owen, Jim, Frank, David, Alice and Hugo are unforgettable. Only wish there had been more episodes. Love the specials. Save yuorself some time and money, buy them all. you will before it's over. Dawn French you rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even I would go to this church!!!","review":"I really watch very little TV outside of PBS and even less \\"fiction\\" shows. V.O.D. is my all time favorite, or should I say favourite comedy show ever. This set is great to own because quite often there's nothing on and this always appeals. The characters are all colorful and funny as can be, well, except for maybe Frank Pickle, but he's supposed to be very drab. But he is funny at it!!! I love Emma Chamber's character, Alice Horton (nee Tinker). She's so stupid and sweet- ya gotta love her!!! The more you learn of U.K. culture, the funnier it gets. Don't be a \\"bugger\\", order it you sod-off nit!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun","review":"This is the second \\"Vicar\\" collection I have purchased. My first set is trapped at the bottom of my storage unit, and I really wanted to watch it again. I was happy to see there was a more complete collection available. This one has ALL the episodes ever made. I loved seeing ones I never had before.If you enjoy British humor and aren't so stuffy that you can't appreciate a little irreverence, \\"The Vicar of Dibley\\" will give you many hours of fun, laughter, and a couple good life lessons. Enjoy!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"vicar of dibly","review":"I love Brit comedy, the Vicar of Dibley is one of the best productions I have ever seen. I saw the series on PBS and was HOOKED from the get-go. If you do not understand some of the Brit words, look them up on the internet and you will understand what they are saying. Once that is done you will understand Monty Python also. A must have in your collection. Watch and enjoy, you will laugh your arse off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam's review","review":"I love the Vicar of Dibley, it is an incredible collection. This came at a time when The Church of England had just started ordaining women priests. Many people especially male vicars were upset and very angry. This collection is funny and offensive, it shows the human side of a female vicar and all the crazy people she puts up with. We have all known someone on a committee who is a bossy boots pain in the buns, another who can not make up which side of the fence their on, and the one who is so boring you actually avoid them. This cast of characters is absolutely incredible, and so well done, I have watched my collection twice. Warning if you are a religious conservative please avoid it will really offend you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable printer","review":"The HP 4315 is nothing special. It is a disposable printer. It is cheaply made and bound to fail within a year; at least that is my experience. After my first one failed I bought a second in order to use my stock of ink cartridges. Now the second one is experiencing frequent cartridge jams. You would think that since HP makes good money on the ink, they would build a unit that would last. I am buying cartridges one at a time from now on. I never found the ink to go very far. I don't do much printing but buy cartridges 6 to 8 times per year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died quickly","review":"Within three months of moderate to light use there were error messages flashing on the screen of this unit and the printer was inoperable. I went through the time and expense of buying head cleaner products and replacing ink cartridges, per the advice of HP customer service, but the printer would simply not work. The scanner does work. Customer service told me it is not under warranty which I have not been able to comprehend. I gave up and bought Cannon model that I had earlier avoided only because of its bigger footprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper jams constantly","review":"I've owned 4-5 HP printers over the years, and this is the only one I've found to to completely unsatisfactory. The paper jams constantly, and when it does, you can't delete the print job -- I usually have to reboot the printer AND the computer to clear out the printer queue. When it does print, the machine is s-l-o-w. However it does one thing very fast: eat through print cartridges. So...it's cheap to buy but very expensive to run. On the positive side, I can say that the print quality is fine. I guess this printer could be OK if you have very low volume requirements. To be fair, I have overtaxed what it was designed to deliver. But there's no excuse for constant jamming. Bottom line: this machine wastes hours of my time each month. Or did. I've just ordered a n Officejet 6310 to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, dependable. easy to use.","review":"I previously owned an earlier model of this printer/scanner/fax and it lasted more than 3 years before it went bad, which, I am told, is a good run for such an inexpensive item. I prefer this to a flatbed scanner type. For a small home office it is perfect and easy to use. It has settings for better printing, like photo work, which looks ok. I was unable to find this printer/fax at any local stores. My last one was from Coscto, for $130. So, I was amazed at the omline price of 89.99 with no tax and no shipping, delivered to my door. Yea!Amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink runs out very, very quickly. HP no help whatsoever.","review":"I bought this fax about a year ago and do not recommend it. It runs out of ink in a heartbeat. This last black cartridge I purchased gave me about 40-50 pages before the low ink light started blinking.And of course calling HP support is no help. I described my issue with the fax and they just tried to sell me more ink. On top of everything, they claim cannot give me what an approximate page count for a cartridge. How can they not have tested their own product? This is a nightmare! I am stuck with a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"I've had this product for about a month now, and it out performs my old Lexmark printer by far! Right now I only copy and print, but the pages come out beautifully, and it's such a money saver you can use the cartridges for all four functions. Not to mention the cartridges are the most reasonably priced on the market. If you're thinking of buying this item, you will not go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mystery Fax Machine","review":"I bought this product for only the fax function. It was cheaper then other just fax machines. The Mystery was how many pages of a fax I sent would actually arrive. If I sent a 5 page fax 3-4 pages may actually arrive. Sometimes all of the pages might arrive and the machine would print out an error notices. I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they sent a replacement machine in under 24 hours. (Have to love that about Amazon) That machine had the same problem and was also sent back. I went to Office Depot and bought a Brother Super G3. It works great and my faxes are no longer a mystery.So much for cheap fax machines"},{"rating":"2","title":"hp officejet 4315 all-in-one","review":"this is the first printer i installed and it worked on the first try. easy to use and no problems so far. i have used it about 2 dozend times and the inkcartdrige is still 3/4 full.

We use it very sparingly in a home office environment. It isn't moved and again, used only occasionally It has been awful to work with - it quite simply quits printing whenever you switch between scanning, faxing or printing.. just quits! I can't tell you how many times I have had to uninstall and then reinstall this stupid thing to get it to print simply because we used it to scan something - the latest issue is a print cartridge error message which keeps you from even establishing a diagnostic. UGH!! I had a Dell all in one for years easy to use, never a problem.. EVER - this piece of crap has been nothing but trouble since the moment we brought it home. This HP printer is NOT user friendly, the ink is extremely expensive and runs out quickly with minimal use.. This printer is TRASH!! Don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I hate this product so much I went out of my way to write this review. It is definitely thebiggest lemon I have bought since I have been buying computer products over the last 30 years.Unless you enjoy exercises in frustration, just buy another brand, I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"It prints okay but don't try to fax, copy or scan !","review":"I purchased this HP all-in-one new from Amazon in Feb 2007 and it worked great for about two months. Then I started getting a half inch wide black strip down the side of every page I try to scan, fax or copy. After spending 45 minutes on the phone with a nice young lady from India and jumping through numerous hoops and maneuvers she finally transferred me to the hardware support people who never picked up the phone. I give up. I guess I'll use this to print and receive faxes and use my old Epson 4490 Photo scanner to scan and send faxes. What a waste of time and money! Don't buy this piece of garbage. Better to spend a little more and get something that works more than 2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vista users beware!!","review":"I even called HP and specifically asked them before I ordered this item if it was compatible with Vista.

So now I have to go through the hassle of returning, fighting to get shipping reimbursed, etc. Don't do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wxman","review":"I have had very good service from this machine. Copies are very good and the machine is fast. The only problem I have with the machine is that it goes through printer cartridges kind of fast. It would be better if the printer cartridges were larger. Otherwise, a great machine. Have been using HP products for several years, and all have been very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last Long","review":"I liked this printer - while it worked. Its lightweight and easy to use. The one complaint I had with it was that the ink gauge was always off significantly. It would suggest I replace the print cartridge several weeks before it actually ran out of ink.My main complaint with the printer was that shortly after the warranty ran out the scanner malfunctioned. This prevented using it for scans, copies, and outbound faxes - the only thing I could do was to receive faxes and print. I only use the printer a couple of times per month, so was very disappointed with the short shelf life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Value","review":"The seller shipped this super quick, product came in excellent condition, easy set up, working in no time at all. Great deal and value, just what I was looking for. Did not get the full five stars because of the scan speed, but other than that very good product...."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality, All-in-One, HP Officejet with fax","review":"HP Officejet All-in-One with fax. Usual HP quality, Vista-compatible. (If you have just a slightly older printer that is not Vista-compatible, I do not think the remedies offered by HP tech support will solve this problem. I spent literally hour after hour with a slightly older HP All-in-One trying to get the scanner to work using HP tech support without fixing the problem. These were problems due to Vista incompatibility that HP could not fix.)This new Officejet 4315 has exceeded my expectations and has worked very well. After a very negative experience with my HP All-in-One C-3180, I took a chance and ordered another HP product stating it was Vista-compatible. My faith in HP printers has been restored! I was almost to the point of buying another brand. Would definitely purchase this item again. Thanks HP for finally getting your act together for Vista compatibility upgrades in your new products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"paper refused to feed ever.","review":"Bought this brand new. Only one of the two paper rollers worked so the paper would never feed. Called customer service ahd they said they could not helop me other than to encourage me to return the unit.

Will not buy HP again."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst printer ever made!","review":"My poor grandfather owns this printer. Every other week he needs my help with this horrible printer. The cartridges slide back and forth noisily with any requested task -it takes forever to print, it jams every time. The yellow light flashes signaling a paper jam of which there never is, this is just a piece of crap . I helped him to order another thinking we maybe just had a lemon...the second one was just as bad if not worst. Don't waste your frustrations on this one. I would recommend a HP laser jet printer and separate scanner and fax. This is by far the worst all-in-one I have ever used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star - BEWARE","review":"This is a joke...there are constant problems with getting it to print and scan. The only function that works is the fax...so if you want use it solely as a fax, then by all means buy it. The cartridges are used up with a few photos.

The printer seems to work ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fix far more than print...","review":"The HP 4315 All-in-One printer is aptly named if by All-in-One they mean frustration, anger, and wasted time ALL rolled into one. It frequently locked up in a print queue when I ran it on my old XP system. Now that I'm running it (or attempting to) on my Vista system, it does the same thing. Only difference is under XP I could occasionally get it to work. Under Vista, I've uninstalled and re-installed the driver and the diagnostics. Nothing has ever printed. DON'T try to use this printer (or any HP printer?) on Vista. Also, it's in a circular hell of sorts. The hung file can't be printed but it also can't be deleted. HP help (across the pond) was of no help. I'll try Kodak -- save some money, some ink, and a whole lot of frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Printer, Small Cartridges, Small Price, Big Headache!","review":"OK OK - I know I got it cheap but I expected more than this as I ALWAYS buy HP Printers and have always loved them. I bought this printer because it could do everything and was small - I could take it on business trips! That part is good. I am now done traveling and it is in my home office. Not up to HP usual standards - the cartridges run out after 10 - 15 pieces of paper printing and I am not kidding. It is costing me a fortune in ink. If you should mistakenly jam a piece of paper in there and you have to turn off the printer to clear it - then turn it back on, you then have to reboot your computer to get it to connect to the computer again. It's frustrating and I wish I had spent a bit more to get a printer that can keep up with my business. I guess it is good for someone who does a lot of scanning, but not a lot of printing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good For The Long Haul","review":"At first, things were great. After awhile, the rollers loosen and you really have to baby-sit the machine to do much of anything. I would say this machine is okay for extremely light use, but if you do alot of scanning and/or faxing, this thing is likely to give out on you after about a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ink?","review":"This printer is terrible for ink. I regret buying it. Between the color and black, most times I print it is warning me one or both are low. I would say before I have gotten half the life out of the cartridge, the warnings begin. I have tried to turn them off, but I can't find a way... I will not change the cartridge until the print quality suffers.Maybe I should just use it as a scanner and fax machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP Officejet 4315 All-in-One","review":"Good size for home office, east to use. Only wish copy function was from a flat screen instead of having to feed the document to copy via feeding rack.

I didn't like half the stories. My favorites were one about a French soldier fighting nazi forces. The other was about the problems of a returning prisoner-of-war's dealing with his unfaithful wife after returning home. Of major concern to me was the lack of notes, since I used the book as a learning tool, not a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, shipped quickly.","review":"I needed a few additional lenses for my Canon Powershot while on vacation recently. The whole package with camera (minus the large tripod) fit into my backpack with room to spare. Lenses were easy to replace and remove, and the little travel tripod is actually pretty handy. Zoom isn't amazing, but pretty darn good. Ditto with the wide angle lens. The lenses do deflect the flash, which will affect the picture, so in low light situations you'll want to keep that in mind. All in all, helped me take some pretty good landscape shots and details of temples at Angkor Wat. Not as good as a nice SLR set-up, but my budget was more for the travel! This was certainly worth the cost. Seller shipped quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice gift","review":"I received this locket from my husband and absolutely adore it. I own several lockets that have been acquired over the years,but this is most definitely my favorite. The only reason I've given a four star rating is that I felt it needed a sturdier chain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking on the outside...","review":"When I first received the locket in the mail (gift for my girlfriend) I thought it looked beautiful. However, upon opening it, it seems that there isn't much possibility for insertion of a picture. Most lockets have an insert in which one could trace the outline upon a picture to cut it out and fit right inside the locket. This one offers no aid in fitting a picture inside and the bracket on the locket is quite loose. I don't recommend buying it if you plan to put a picture inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great product overall.","review":"I'd say its a glorified sticker and not worth the money put into it. I give it a 2 because they didn't lie about the product, they just didn't tell you the whole truth. If you ever take it off, it refuses to stick on the ds, so it is not a re usable skin. And it is fairly cheesy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've always wanted to be the bad guy","review":"This is a rare game. Just for the people that have a little evil in their hearts.

We are captivated with the incredible events during her escape from a stern mother who beats her and a father whose affection is limited to a grunt when she offers to wash his feet. Although the girl walks through miles of desert, untouched by scorpions and snakes she is victimized by lecherous men, drug addicts and criminals. With the kindness of a musician, and her perseverence, she finds the strength to triumph. Larson paints the desert landscape she lives in with beauty and richness, tainted only by the blood and fluids of human weakness. We want more about how she evolved to become a successful teacher and author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying Sparks","review":"A truely compelling story of survival and the reality of being a young girl alone and unprotected in an era we thought was a time of \\"innocence\\". Ms. Larson has unflinchingly shared her life experiences with honesty and without self-pity. Her courage is an inspiration. Her prose is as pure and honest as the desert. I could not put Flying Sparks down. I eagerly look forward to her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"horrible neglect","review":"An interesting story of casual, unthinking neglect of children by the honest working class. The odd contrast between the often wise words of advice given by the mother in this story, and her absolute blindness to the real life of her children is the crux of the book.The book ends somewhat abruptly. I wonder if the author is planning a continuation of some sort. As it is, we have little knowledge of how or why the young girl in the book changes the direction of her life.Truly the book chronicles a time when children had more freedom, but clearly things were not as safe as parents believed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a striking story","review":"This is a gorgeously written text that navigates a girl's early adolescence with grace and beauty, even when the story itself is harsh and unrelenting. The prose is both sparse and striking. Larson has a way of cutting to the bone without sacrificing a single detail.

NO IT DOES NOT and there is no clinical nutritionist involved either that I could find. So you are taking information from someone that does not have an intimate knowledge of nutrition to begin with!There is no significant information on maintaining an alkaline diet!

(It might provide more information than some people want.) Even though it is very readable, I wish it had been edited a bit. There was quite a bit of repeating points. The boxes and charts were helpful though, and nothing was too technical to understand.Also, I tried to put together the supplementation Kessler advises. It isn't easy to do without taking a lot of pills.Overall I would suggest this as an excellent book for women especially who are concerned about osteoporosis. It can inspire readers to do something about the possiblity of being hit with this disease--to take charge instead of just hoping it doesn't happen. I'm glad I read it. Even if a reader only does one or two things learned in the book, they will be better off for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am very disappointed in this purchase.

Other than the nice hefty block of marble, it feels like something I bought at the dollar store. The arm, plastic handle, and wire all seem prone to breakage and just feel cheap. There is a note on the bottom telling you how to align the wire with the slot...it says to simply slide the arm in or out of the block as needed. There's no adjustment screw, or notched settings or anything...nothing to keep the arm in the right place once you have the wire aligned.Cheap cheap cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great!","review":"This is a beautiful cheese slicer. However it does have some draw backs. Cheese sticks to the marble top, so sliding it around is not possible. With that its hard to get consistent pieces of cheese. The wire cuts through easily, but mine seems to drift a little and does not want to end up in the groove. Maybe my handle is bent. Also that grove is a pain to clean! You need a brush to get in there. One month after Ive owned it, one of the legs broke off. Its a simple fix.... Looks like the manufacture used super glue to put them on.

I often take frozen LeanCuisine or similar frozen entrees to work.

This CorningWare 23\\" oval dish is perfectly sized to pop your typical frozen entree into before heating in the microwave.

I thought I would read it and critic it. Instead, I was caught up in the first chapter and wanted to get all the facts. This book really makes you question the fact that O.J. just may not be guilty and if not, who really could have done it. As compelling as the book is, I really am beginning to believe Mr. Dear about who did commit the murders.This book is really worth the time to read and to put some light on what really happened.

The information you put in the book took a lot of guts! The amazing evidence you have not only found, but PUBLISHED would have me fearing for my life!

I just assumed that OJ was guilty, but after watching an E! TV special recently, I became interested and bought this book because like Mr. Dear, so many things just didn't add up. What Mr. Dear discovered was there for the finding, and I believe that the prosecutors certainly missed the obvious. Mr. Dear certainly addressed and answered all of the questions that I had, and it is so obvious who should have been the primary suspect, yet this person was apparently not questioned. It took a lot of cuorage to publish these findings."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Twist on the Simpson Case","review":"Most everyone knows the details of the Simpson case and all the \\"major\\" books written about it. This one easily got lost in the shuffle. William Dear spent years researching the crimes, the victims and the suspect (Simpson) and his family. His book is well written, clear and concise. He offers up a new suspect, one never previously discussed before. His supporting evidence is good and it will definitely give you food for thought and pause about what you think you know about the Simpson case.I found \\"Guilty\\" an interesting, and even quick, read. I went into the book convinced that the right man was tried for the crimes and basically got away with them. I don't know that Mr. Dear changed my mind totally, but it did make me realize that there were a lot of twists and turns in this case that weren't previously mentioned.A nice literary effort, and definitely a worthy job of research. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"OJ's Son Jason...","review":"...is who William Dear pins the murder on, and it is even more ridiculous than all of the other non-OJ murderer theories out there. I think the same people who are SO SURE OJ didn't do it would be just as outraged at this alternative theory. It's a shame, because I enjoyed Mr. Dear's previous books and marveled at his detective work (albeit Mr. Dear's ego is a bit overwhelming at times, and possibly clouds his judgment in this case). This is an expensive book, so I felt it my duty to at least let a potential buyer know where the direction of the investigation heads and therefore you can just for yourself whether or not you want to spend your hard-earned money and time on this interesting, but thoroughly implausible theory. I just wonder what dirt Mr. Dear has on Charlie Sheen to get his glowing review. No offense to Mr. Dear, I highly recommend either of his previous books should you be able to get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd.","review":"In my opinion the theories in this book are totally unbelievable.

When it does, it's moderately interesting to watch it \\"fly\\". Please note that another reviewer gave it 5 stars but a negative review (citing an injury!).

The sound is barely better, certainly not worth the cost. The sound is HORRIBLE for music. AT VERY low volumes it is ok, but at a level suitable for music there is a horrible crackling noise. If you're looking for travel speakers, get some with depth. These are tall, skinny, and pretty flat. Speakers with more depth offer better bass response than those that are flat. These don't have any bass to speak of. I will say that I love the size and portability. They're small, and the clip together. It runs off 3AAA batteries, which is great for travel.

I stared using them speakers for my Macbook Pro (because they even sounded better than my laptop speakers), and I was going to buy an adapter, but they didn't have the 7.5 adapter I needed at Walmart. So I bought these Sony speakers instead.The sound of these speakers is not good. Yeah, they can get you by, but it's so light, and it really made my music sound really high in treble.

They may not be the kind you'd want to use with a tv or stereo, but for their size, I think they're really nice.They fit together and run on 3 AAA batteries or the AC adaptor that's provided.The black ones look classy and match my player, too.I'm very pleased with my purchase, and I'm glad I bought them."},{"rating":"2","title":"speakers","review":"Nice speakers for camping and traveling.

It took my dog all of 2-3 minutes to finish each one, so she obviously enjoyed it. However the ones I get from Costco usually take her about a half hour to get through.

When I saw them advertised on Amazon for about half the cost, I immediately ordered them. I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED to open the box and discover that the two packages of Bully sticks contained a few (like 4 or 5) thick 12 inch sticks and the rest were either 6 inch sticks or skinny sticks that were only about 1/8 inch in diameter. I have a 100 pound Doberman who loves these but I had to send them back - he could easily choke on them or injure himself running with one in his mouth.

Both packages I received from Amazon did not compare in quality (based on my prior experience with the product, I bought a second order just be sure the first was not a packaging error). The majority of these sticks are so thin that they disappear in less than five minutes, whereas the Costco sticks each gave my medium-sized dog two or three days of serious chewing and were consistent in size. There was not even one in this package that was as thick as those I used to buy. The photo that is shown is totally deceptive and, in my opinion, could be considered false advertising. I have been very happy with my purchases from Amazon, but if this was the first product I ever bought from them, I might never order from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the picture!

With half the items being short, this becomes a very pricey product."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Large\\" Bull Sticks Sickened my Dog","review":"These bull sticks carry the same name brand as the Costco standard, Cadet Bully Stick, but are not as uniform in shape or nearly as large. Instead of smelling like dead animal, these bull sticks smell like dirty underwear. The smell didn't bother my dog... at least at first. My dog threw up each time after chewing/consuming the bull sticks. Her dumb owner (me) wasn't sure what was making her sick at first, so we had three opportunities through the week to chew and clean up.

When my dogs chew them, we can't stand to be in the same room, because the whole room stinks. I don't know why the sticks from the bag I sampled were evenly sized and smelled fine and this order was so different.

My friend also ordered a bag with the same poor results and won't be buying from this company again either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bull sticks now much thinner/don't last","review":"My dog LOVES this product and it does help keep her teeth tartar-free, BUT the stick is much thinner than in the past and my dog can now chew through one in less than 1/2 hour as compared to 2-3 days in the past.

My doggies may have to do without. I may take a chance again in the future but if I receive the same incredibly skinny ones I will never buy them again. The shipping was fast and there were no other glitches.

I feel the large bull sticks are a great value as previously I was paying $7-$10 per bull stick - purchasingLarge Bull Sticks, 1 Lbcomes to around $2 per bull stick so I will definitely be a repeat buyer. The smell is intense but I'm used to it.

Some have a funky smell. These are the worst smelling bully sticks I have ever smelled. With other bully sticks, the funny smell goes away after the bag has been open for a few minutes. These bully sticks really stink. They have a very strong smell that you can actually smell from many feet away. And it does not go away even after the stick is gone. Not only in the bag but hours later and the smell goes wherever they go. My puppy now has stinky breath. My family room where he has been chewing reeks of funky bully. But dogs being dogs really love bad smelling things. I am not returning them but I will never buy these again.

Exactly half of them were 6\\" tall and the 12\\" tall ones were completely anemic. I myself, if this was my business, would be embarrassed to sell this product. There's clearly no quality control.

I don't like to put down bands in this manner, especially one as sonically capable as these guys, but that feel of 'almost there' that I get from this LP is way frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find.","review":"An amazing album from a new British band.

I had hoped to cut thin slices of block chedar cheese. Alas, this slicer does a very poor job.Worse yet, the wood is covered with what appears to be a plastic coating which is separating from the wood and makes the Prodyne cheese slicer look like it has a bad disease. I have no idea if this coating poses a health risk. However I am very concerned ingesting any of coating. I will not buy a Prodyne product again.I have owned this slicer for maybe 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cheese Slicer","review":"I have had a Prodyne Cheese Slicer for years and have always loved it. You can purchase new wires for it when the old one breaks, which makes it a product that lasts a long time. The new Prodyne BB-120 is even nicer than my old one. I purchased two of these for Christmas presents this past year and the recipients love them as well. They slice the cheese any thickness you need and effortlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"A wood-slab cheese slicer such as this one is a must-have item in my kitchen. So when the wire broke on my old one after many faithful years of use I was anxious to replace it right away. This model looks attractive, but right away I noticed that the wire was not nearly as taut as that of my old one. It did not do a very good job cutting cheese. Moreover, the more I used it the looser the wire got, so that it would \\"bottom out\\" before finishing a slice. Eventually I found an extra one (of a model that is no longer available) in the attic that I'd forgotten I had, and I junked the Prodyne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I had a marble version of this same product, made by a different company, for years. Eventually, all the wires broke and I replaced them with thin picture wire. Then, however, the handle cracked and fell apart and it was time for something new.I decided to try something different since the marble piece had been a little bit cumbersome. Initially, I bought a really cool handheld piece with a wire and roller, as well as the ability to adjust the thickness of the slices. It was horrible. The wire wouldn't stay taught, it was unable to finish slices smoothly, and in general was a giant step backward.So, I thought I'd go back to what I new in the form of this product. However, I chose this one because I thought the wood board looked better than a marble one and I was hoping it would be a little lighter. I wasn't dissappointed. It looks great, works very well on all types of cheeses, and due to it's light weight stores very easily. Great product, I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Wonderful and Convenient Cheese Slicers!","review":"I haven't used this one, but purchased two at the same time.

These are pleasant Peter Pan recordings that exude the Christmas spirit. However, around seven of the songs (#3 and #13-18) are accompanied by what sounds like an inexpensive keyboard. Moreover, the singers on those seven songs are really bad! \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\" is listed as song #18 but is actually #3 on the CD. No big deal if just listening to but if you want to \\"rip\\" to computer, you'll have to manually retype most of the selections. It would have been better to have 15 great songs rather than 22 with seven annoying holiday selections. If you can find this CD at a very low price, it is worth it for the 15 notable Christmas songs.

The movie opens at the point of her death. Christopher Plummer (Dolores Claborne) is a cop named Henderson who tries to unravel the mystery surrounding Elizabeth's homicide. We are taken along as things grow increasingly uneasy and disturbing. Henderson himself must come face to face w/ evil, and forces he cannot understand.

Obviously they needed jobs, as this dull and muddled film lacks any true artistic merit. While director Harvey Hart tried to be original in his dual flashback style, it doesn't help when the script overloads itself with confusion and awful dialogue. The movie opens with Karen Black hurtling from a high apartment building, and Plummer is the detective out to solve the death. Black was a prostitute, and somehow gets mixed up with a wealthy patron, who obviously has more than sex on his mind. That's about it..and the climax which reveals the reason behind Black's death is as muddled as the rest of the film. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you're research","review":"Did a ton of research before I bought this vacuum.

Shannon Whirry, Shannon Tweed, and Monique Parent films should be on Disney compared to this. Zalman King, the publicly accepted king of American softcore, is put to shame by this film. I don't want to get too graphic with my descriptions--I CAN'T--but let's just say that this is the closest I've seen an American product get to duplicating the great euro-sleaze genre typified by Jean Rollin and Walerian Borowczyk films.

It's a good mixture of Band and non-Band tracks that truly captures the feeling of Danko live. On Breeze Hill, long after the heyday of The Band, Danko still has the greatest and most unique voice in rock and roll. He will tear your heart out on Sip the Wine and It Makes No Difference, and leave you feeling triumphant on Blaze of Glory and Chest Fever. But the prevailing feeling I get from this CD is that here is a man doing what he loves. A long time ago, Danko sang the words \\"I'd rather die happy than not die at all.\\" After listening to Live on Breeze Hill, I think you'll agree that that is exactly what he did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs and a killer horn section","review":"Probably the best live recordings of Ophelia, chest fever, and shape I'm in.

When I discovered this I was a little dubious, thinking here the go again picking the pennies from another dead mans eyes ? Rick has never let my musical soul down,and even now this live concert (except track 1 studio recording) touches parts of me I cannot explain. The horn section is reminiscent of the Rock of Ages concert and for all followers of THE BAND buy this album you will not be disappointed. I don\`t like categorising music, because it can? what ever you call it present barriers and categorisation is for the AD men. If you love it call what you like.Most of the old standards are here,delivered as if THE BAND are here in my house.

That was not true, at least not of the one I received. We needed it to go to 375 (which is it's top temp) and it did and we checked it with a candy/deep fry thermometer. It cooks food nicely.The fryer does take a large amount of oil (a little over a gallon just to get to the minimum fill line) but after we use it, we strain it back into the bottle and I was amazed that it nearly all comes back.I would definitely recommend this--as it is a great deal for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is a great product. It was purchased just for deep frying but it is used more a a steamer! Great Great Great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Presto","review":"We purchased this item to make fried sopapillas. The recipes we found online all required the oil to be heated to 375. Also, the cookbook that came with the fryer says to cook some of the items at 375 degrees. When we began frying the sopapillas, they were not cooking correctly. We checked the oil temperature with our electronic cooking thermometer to see if it was hot enough. The temperature would never get above 340. My wife called Presto today to ask if there was something we should be doing to get the oil heated to 375 degrees. The customer service representative from Presto told her that \\"The machine goes up to 375, but the oil will never get above 340\\". In disbelief, my wife asked if she was understanding correctly, to which the representative again said, the oil will only get to 340. So, if you're thinking about purchasing this unit and you need the oil to be hotter than 340, Presto does not guarantee this unit will get your oil hot enough to cook anything above that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to modify it to get it hot enough","review":"Sadly, mine will only heat oil to 350 degrees, even after I modified the temp sensors.

Oddly, I put the cover back on and when the thermostat kicked back in it heated the oil to close to 400 degrees with the top in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a relief!","review":"This is so much safer and better than using my stove top pan and basket! I was a nervous wreck while deep frying before I bought this product and so did it very rarely. I've used my Presto ProFry for fish and chips, twice now, since purchasing it about a month ago, and I just love it. We have a family of 6 and really need the larger size. I find it so convenient to do all of the fish in one batch and all of the fries in another...at least until my little boys get big!The reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 is because it has a somewhat slow temperature recovery time. But this could be true of all of the various fryers for all I know, since this is my first one. But it would be perfect if not for that.

There is no divider in the middle of the baskets, so you have to use tons of oil-even if your just using the one basket. There is a cover but it's useless because you can't open and close it while your frying. It also feels cheap and flimsy-very light. We don't use it. Should have sent it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect product for my needs!","review":"This unit heats quickly and maintains the setting even with a full load of chicken wings. It is a good size for four to five people. Well-designed for ease and safety in handling. Clean up is not difficult after use, altho some effort typically required to scrub the baskets where residue may stick. However just filling the oil container with warm soapy water and then placing baskets in to soak for a few minutes makes this cleanup chore tolerable. There is no charring of oil on heating element and thus may be reused a few times before it discolors. Recommend buying the SS funnel w/strainer insert to accompany this as it makes transfer of oil to a container for subsequent refrigeration safe and efficient and helps to clarify the oil after use."},{"rating":"2","title":"works, a little too simple, but works","review":"This fryer is very easy to set up, but on the downturn, I wished it was digital.

I know they can be purchased but for the price it would have been nice if it had been included. Clean up is easy and it's not too heavy as I had feared given it's size.

Grease always got stuck in there and I could never clean it. I have to clean this one for the first time and I must say it should take half the time as the others due to the simplicity of the design.The oil heats up in about 20 minutes.

I also, went to presto website and purchase the one large basket which works great as well.The only problem I have is I wish it had a oil filtering system.I recommend for everyone wanting a deep fryer to invest in this.

However we didn't realize the things that our old one had that helped alot. The lid that latches with a filter is very important, if you don't want your whole house to stink like fry oil. This has a lid that just sets on top but it doesn't filter anything. After we made fried chicken one night all of our coats that were hanging in the back room where we fry had to be washed they stunk so bad. Our back room is even separated with a swinging door but the smell filled the house and the bedrooms smelled like grease when we went to bed. Also a downfall is it is hard to drain the oil our of this one. But without the lid snaping tight on it, if you leave the oil in it, it smells all the time. Another downfall is there is no timer on it, which our other digital one had. All and all our old smaller digital fryer had many other pluses that we didn't even know were important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnetic cord problems","review":"Had problems with the magnetic cord staying in place, the first time I used it.

We thought it just needed to burn it off and be seasoned.......but no it just kept doing it. We figured we would live with it until one night after using it my eyes started to burn from the smoke, and an asthma attack like I have never had before followed a few hours later. I haven't had a single problem with my asthma since we stopped using this. We even again took this outside and tried to burn off whatever it was that was causing the smoke, but 2 hours later it still smoked.

Features that should be added include:1. A temperature gauge to show what the actual temp of the oil while cooking. Temp of oil drops when food is added, and the product \\"turns back on\\" automatically, but user never knows what the temp as dropped to, or what it recovers to, if it does.2. Ability to store the oil tightly in the unit itself. Otherwise the user is transferring oil to storage containers and cleaning the unit to avoid the used oil smell from permeating your home. This requires constant transfer of oil and cleaning of the unit, which results in a messy operation.That all said, it is a pretty good product and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto Fryer","review":"I replaced my old deep fryer with this one.

I was excited about the two basket design, but a bit turned off that the handles don't fold down to make more space.When we got it and hooked it up, I was AMAZED at how bad our old fryer had gotten! This fryer cooks our food beautifully. It is a bit bigger than I expected, but it's hardly the manufacturers fault I didn't measure first. For those of you with limited space though, I highly reccomend measuring your space before ordering.

They obviously had a vision for this record and didn't compromise anything, and the final product shows that. The songs switch from mellow, but never lazy, to upbeat, but never clutterd.

I did enjoy a number of the songs on this record though. There is that mix of mystery and style in most of the songs that I am accustomed to hearing from the Whigs but from a \\"good tune\\" perspective the album sounds flat at times. I know this album was not meant to be a Whigs album and it is supposed to have that quiet, laid back, smokey room kind of sound. It accomplishes that but the songs just aren't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Dulli","review":"In a word: Boring. As a huge Whigs fan and someone who respects Greg Dulli as an artist, I am really surprised by how disappointing this CD is. Fila Brazilia does come through with some really nice beat work, but the songs are almost universally subpar. With unusually weak lyrics and song structures that never change, the album feels like exactly what it is: a second rate outtake that should have been left confined to Dulli's notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dulli in a new setting....","review":"While not as loud, rocking, or aggressive as his work with the Afghan Whigs, Twilight definitely finds Dulli in his element. The soulfulness, the swagger, the poetry, and the sexuality are all present here. Highlights are the Twilite Kid, That's just how that bird sings, Clyde, and Annie Mae. The little trip-hop flavorings here and there are very welcome. It's good to hear Dulli's voice trading verses with Harold Chichester and Shawn Smith.

Dulli never fails to impress","review":"I hate when people write \\"reviews\\" that simply gush (or vent) over a record without saying anything specific about the songs.

Think \\"Step Into The Light\\" and \\"Faded\\" from Black Love, \\"The Slide Song\\" from 1965, and their cover of TLC's \\"Creep,\\" but with no guitar.

Two tracks earned three stars and only the second track (Red Sun 4) earned two stars.This is definitely a quality CD for those who appreciate diversity of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"One is not supposed to stray from form in Indian classical music. Can one, then, capture the form by dashing away from it, returning for a bite, tossing it into the air, playing with it and yet remain deadly serious? \\"Rise\\" shows this creative play with the classics is not only possible but enjoyable.There are some lyrical songs here (such as Voice of the Moon) and powerful ones such as Mahadeva (my favorite, written by Ravi); both Mishras are, well.... the song takes me deep into a dark temple with brahmins about to perform a ritual sacrifice :)What impresses me about this CD is the love of music and Shankar's talent for experimenting with instruments, musical forms, people's talents and song-making. She's an Indian Bjork. The pieces show a sense of humor, earthiness, seductiveness and power and, at least for me, represent an experiential antipode to Anoushka's equally talented peer, Sheila Chandra and her monastic, out-of-this world sound.Excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL DONE ANOUSHKA","review":"THE SHANKAR NAME LIVES ON AS ANOUSHKA CONTINUES TO COME UP WITH BRILLIANT INNOVATIVE MUSIC.

Bettencourt also shines as a lead vocalist, which any Extreme fan already knew, but he very much manages to not sound like \\"the guitar player is singing,\\" and he sounds more like Gary at times than he could in Extreme - the influence is clear, and not unwelcome.A lot of the Population 1 stuff never caught fire with me, and even though this is essentially the same project with the same players, it hits more with me than the previous efforts.

I also think in the story it shows feelings about forgiveness, responsiblity, and blame. Hansen's style of writting is not \\"beating arouns the bush\\" so to speak. It takes him only a few words and sentences to say what the real meaning of his work is. Overall I rate this book at 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible writing, thin plot.","review":"Very well written, in particular Scott's diary. But I found the story to be lacking somehow. It had a beginning, a middle and an end, but it lacked meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, even if implausible","review":"This was a very enjoyable read, though the string of hunches and coincidences that led Atticus to discover what had happened to Scott overstrained my credulity and the Reinhardt Schmidt character seemed a little thin.

The plot was thin, the characters either too canned or too ethereal to be believed. I couln't \\"feel\\" them at all. I like to get lost in a book and I couldn't even get interested, even when I guessed the ending correctly half-way through. It was like icing on a store-bought cake...it looks great when you see it, but it tastes heavy and greasy. What a disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or Hate it. I choose the latter","review":"This was my first time reading a book by Hansen, and frankly I was not impressed. The book is about a Colorado rancher who leaves for Mexico after the suicide of his son. There are so many different characters to keep track of, it is hard to keep it straight. There is also much information that just does not need to be there, for example references to the book \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The worst of it all just about half way through the whole story is retold from a different viewpoint, I was not exactly ecstatic about the change. On the other hand, there were a few instances of great descriptions, that is what gave this book the two stars. Overall you would not have wasted your couple of dollars or $0.74 if purchased used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atticus","review":"I read this because of a recommendation by a person in my book ckub.

But I knew the outcome before the end. Predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The twist and turn","review":"After forcing myself to read this novel by Ron hansen titled Atticus, i found it to quite the heart racing page turner, after the first few chapters. The novel begins off rather slow, giving the reader an overveiw of the characters as well as the location and some history of the family involved. As one moves forward into the novel and reads how Atticus goes to Mexico to bury Scott, he finds some situations rather odd, Renata being one. She seems a little distant emotionally. As well as Stuart. So atticus begins to suspect murder, but does not know where to begin his search. Once i had hit this area, i sought to read further to discover the culprit. Once the novel pushes the reader further into the plot, one will not know who to blame and for which part of the plot. This novel has many twists and turns around each chapter. I suggest this book, if it wasn't already forced on you to read by Jesuit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atticus, the Exhilarating Shocker","review":"With strong, detailed character development, Ron Hansen creates an incredibly detailed story full of many shocking twists and turns. The story, which revolves around the unconditional and ever lasting love of a parent, is about a father who tries to investigate his son's mysterious, obscure suicide. It begins in Colorado, and moves to the perfect setting of Resurrección, Mexico. The great character development supported by the minute yet later important details are the strong points of the novel. Scott Cody, a former mental patient, is the ideal choice for the focus of the novel because of his complicated history, alcoholism, lack of communication with his family, and difficult to decipher personality. Although very slow in the beginning, the novel turns out to be what the reader least expects. While the ending involves many almost impossible coincidences, the novel is one of the best that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful prodigal son story","review":"I read many novels, but my husband does not.

A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of forgiveness.","review":"When you wear a life jacket, you are doomed to remain on the surface. Many have commented on Hansen's less than desirable ending. Frankly, I'm confused. The book I read was ultimately satisfying and deeply moving. Anyone concentrating on the surroundings, imagery, events or suspense has missed the boat. Writers do not write to show off plot formations or simply link images together, they write to move the reader, to touch a vulnerable spot, to cause one to feel. Feel love, feel pain, feel something. Hansen can rest assured that one reader has felt. I find it amazing that a person could read lines similar to- \\"I will never forgive myself for pulling away when his hand touched mine.\\" If you fail to see the beauty of this story, it is truly not due to the failure of Mr. Hansen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mexico, a good place for a US mystery.","review":"I wanted to become an expatriate with the others in Mexico but there were some questionable plot devices for adding characters. It was easy to get into the pattern that Atticus was following and I was anxious to see the next twist. The flashbacks brought enough meaning to the present action that the coincidences didn't seem forced but that they could have happened just that way, at least in Mexico"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atticus: An exciting and suspenseful mystery.","review":"Ron Hansen's \\"Atticus\\" starts off slowly in the Colorado area. Atticus Cody is a Colorado Rancher and the father of Scott Cody, who is now living Mexico. He hears that his son has committed suicide and immediately decides to go down there to see what has happened. However, when Atticus arrives in Mexico, he begins to suspect murder. He uses his time wisely, while in Mexico, and begins to find some clues to his son's murder. Many suspicious events are tied together and later on the truth is unraveled from one of the interesting characters. Although this novel started out slow, it became more and more exciting as you read on. This story of a loving father and a troubled son was written beautifully. Hansen showed us, in this novel, just how well he can write and I plan to read another of his suspenseful books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that went on and on and on...","review":"I started reading this novel with anticipation; however, I ended it with disappointment. The story of Atticus going to Mexico to pick up his dead son only to suspect murder intrigued me.However, when I was reading the novel it just seemed to go on forever. It didn't interest me until the middle of the novel where the reader can actually start to suspect murder. Just a couple of pages further my interest was immediately lost with the author's \\"suprise solution\\". The other half of the novel consisted of an extremely long and elaborate explanation to his solution.The end of the novel was abrupt and explained nothing, as if the author got tired of writing and just finished the novel right there. I did like the themes that the author chose, they were strong and hard-hitting. Perhaps this is a review of an ignorant teen-ager who has just finished his first mystery novel,but it is just a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atticus-Love for a son","review":"Atticus Cody, a cattle rancher from the Rocky Mountain state,Colorado, and his youngest son Scott have been at the heels with each other ever since Scott's mother was killed in a car accident. While Scott is away in Resureccion, Mexico, Atticus recieves troubling knews that his son has commited suicide. Atticus travels to Resureccion to retieve his sons body, and in doing so finds clues which lead him to believe that his son had been murdered. Atticus is filled with great suspense and keeps one guessing what could possibly happen next. This book is told from both the father and son narrative helping the reader understand the events of the story. I enjoyed reading this book as it kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to find out who the murderer was. Although slow at times i would reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for suspense and great mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing suspense/mystery novel","review":"Atticus is a very well developed mystery/suspense story about a Farmer named Cody Atticus. Atticus goes to Resureccion, Mexico after he learns that his son, Scott has suddenly committed suicide, and that's when the plot begins. The story takes the reader through an intriguing tale of murder and a father's passion and love for his son. Ron Hansen depicts the quest of Cody Atticus excellently, to the extent that it is as if the reader is actually in the story. This book is full of suspense, twists and turns. All my predictions about the outcome I had established turned out to be false, because of Hansen's brilliant writing. Although confusing and boring at sometimes, I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of suspense and mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very rugged steel tool box.","review":"This is a great tool box.

So why is it terrible? Because it is NOT a game - it's a movie! Most of it is long, long, long cutscenes and dialog. The few puzzles it has are really bad. The exploring is extremely linear despite open-looking geography. The game essentially tells you what to do in most situations and, worse yet, it often actually does it for you! This game is nothing like true adventure games (such as the Monkey Island series, or the old King Quest series, or any good old Sierra game.) If you want to watch movies, fine. But if you want to play an adventure game, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing but Good","review":"This is the second game in a series, and even though I never played the first one, I was intrigued when I saw this game.I thought that the graphics were very good, and the concept is interesting. The only complaint I have is that the controls are sometimes hard to use, and require a long time to get used to them.I appreciated the length of the game; I find that too many PC games are over before they really begin.I also enjoyed the character shift in the game. You get a chance to play as each of the main characters, which I thought was cool, and I liked seeing the multiple worlds the story takes place in.Overall, I liked the game and would recommened it to anyone looking for a good role-playing game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamfall","review":"Was waiting so long for this game to come out and it's finally available ! The final product is different from what I expected having played the prequel: The Longest Journey. But different is also good, and maybe even better !Pros:* Mindblowing storyline* Incredible soundtrack and voice-acting* Excellent visuals* Great controls (using a gamepad)Cons:* Multiple loading screens for each location (luckily waiting time is only a matter of seconds)* Some puzzles are rather easy* Simplified combat scenes"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story goes on...","review":"And that is what you mainly get out of this game--great story. Very well written dialogues, imaginative plot that built upon the epic scope of The Longest Journey, and solid, believable characters aren't that easy to find in the world of video games, and especially sequels. But Dreamfall has all of that in spades in addition to being a very pretty game. But it is the \\"game\\" part that is spoiling the mix for me. Or I should say, the lack thereof is. Dreamfall plays too much like an interactive movie, and the further you get into the game, the longer all the cinematics/dialogue scenes get, however ingrossing they may be. The Longest Journey was not a terribly difficult game, but the puzzles in Dreamfall are just too easy, as well as scarce. This has greatly detracted from my enjoyment--too often did my hands drop from the controls, because I wasn't the one driving. 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Controls ruin this gaming experience","review":"I was so excited to play this game. While I think the storyline is good and the graphics awesome, the awkwardness of the controls makes this game a chore. I can't count how many times my character has gotten killed because I couldn't smoothly navigate out of danger's way. This control clunkiness has kept me stuck in certain sections of the games for hours (if not days because I've had to \\"walk away\\"). On two occasions already (I'm only half way through the game), it's taken me 10 plus minutes to get up a staircase. Ridiculous. Several times now, I've considered abandoning Dreamfall because of the frustration factor. Don't buy unless you have a gamebox or the equivalent or a joystick for PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time !?!!","review":"I know this wont be a long and full review sorry, but I have to say something.

Don't Bother without a NEW graphics card.","review":"I eagerly purchased this game, despite the negative reviews, and high price, because I have been a big fan of the series. I waited through the lengthy installation with anticipation of playing a great game. Now mind you, my computer is only 3 years old and meets all of my needs and requirements so far. Now I click on the icon to launch the game and get a fatal error: \\"Failed to initialize Direct3D. Aborting\\". So I search the internet for help, only to find that other people have had this exact same problem, to my surprise, and have been unable to rectify it without purchasing a NEW graphics card! So I'm here to alert all of you Amazon.com users to avoid this game unless you're willing to upgrade your graphics card, because the game won't even play a little bit without one. I guess I'll have to save this game for a later date when I buy my next new computer. This game really better be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY PC VERSION","review":"I really wish I hadn't pre-ordered this and waited to read reviews! I just installed it onto my PC last night and couldn't wait to start playing. I gave up after 10 minutes. 10 MINUTES! It's impossible to maneuver on the PC. They say you can use the mouse to move the characters, which is true enough, but that means the characters are ALWAYS moving. It's extremely difficult to actually view anything, and it takes twice as long as a normal game to do something as simple as walk out the door.

There was practically no game to play; it was really just a series of whichever character walking from one conversation to the next. I do NOT consider a puzzle to be finding a single object for 5 different people who need the SAME thing simply to give it to one another. I ALSO do not consider a puzzle running into an obstacle and overcoming it simply by touching a few matching symbols.I hear people talk of the wondrous graphics of this game. All I seemed to notice were boxy, repetetive 3-D renderings that were fairly dull.The original game on which this farce was based blows it out of the water.

My computer runs The Longest Journey and Chessmaster without a snag. If Aspyr has imposed more restrictive system requirements perhaps they should warn buyers before they buy.It may be a good game but I will never know.

The fighting is slow and sloppy, moves are highly circumscribed and lack creativity. There is little in the game to challenge an experienced game player. You know where to go and what to do because that is all you can do - no exploration of the worlds is available, no side quests to be had, no weapons changes for any of the three characters you become. I found the entire game to be fairly one dimensional. The story was entertaining, but I never became a part of the story. The game was simplistic to play - it took me less than 24 hours to reach the end of this game (as a comparison - the original shadow-man took me over three months of play time. ) - and the ending was the final and ultimate disappointment. I do not rate this game very highly as a game for those who enjoy challenging and engrossing gameplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I bought this game originally looking for a long rpg or puzzle game, and the name was the appeal.

I can't believe how far this sequel has fallen. This game had very good voice acting, adequate graphics, and terrible gameplay. Aside from the constant retracing of your steps (meanwhile putting up with multiple load screens), the terrible camera control, and the absolutely despicable fighting / sneaking aspect of the game, Dreamfall was for me - simply boring. And that is the worst sin a game can commit. The opening in Casablanca seemed to hold promise - it had that open, cosmopolitan feel that I loved about TLJ. But then the rest of the game was spent wandering through stereotypical Roleplaying/Sci-Fi locales completing predictable, dull little chores. I personally don't mind extended dialogue (in fact I found that the most interesting aspect of the game) and yes, the story was intriguing. But after such a long wait, Dreamfall fails so miserably as a GAME that it can only be considered a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT an Adventure game.","review":"I LOVED The Longest Journey. I was so excited about Dreamfall that I was checking web-sites constantly for the past year to find out the release date. I was so disappointed that I wanted to cry when I started playing this game. I don't have stealth skills or fight skills. Big monsters and folks with weapons should be in other games, NOT adventure games. The interface is impossible to control. I run, I crash into the wall, I die. This is not my idea of fun. Where is the humor of the first game? Where are the quirky characters? I have not finished this game and I'm pretty sure I never will.

Although in Longest Journey, there were many long long conversations, the storyline was enjoyable and movement uncomplicated. Unfortunately, Dreamfall is disappointing. First of all the movement through the game is difficult using the computer controls. It is easy to be trapped in a situation because of this movement. Also, there is combat. I was looking for another game which utilized strategy and puzzle solving. Unfortunately, there are silly combat scenes which distract from the game playing and are frustrating to a player like myself who is not interested in an arcade type game.The positive aspect of the game is the graphics which are superb.Apparently, from the other reviews I have read, they have left the story hanging at the end in order for a sequel to be made.

It is like watching a long movie, and then, 20 minutes before the end, the screen goes blank.Is this a shameless attempt to sell the sequel? Someone's idea of a joke? Developer ran out of money?

It is a real story telling and exploring game. The best part of this game (and what makes it great) is its engaging story that make you have the feelings you get from an intense and heartpounding movie. It's a must have. If you can (better say you should), buy the first game too, The Longest Journey, which is one of the greatest games ever made. Play TLJ first, and it will increase even more the great experience you get From Dreamfall.This game is going to have a sequel where the history will be finished. This was said by it's autor and director Ragnar Tornquist on his web page.This game is very flexible too, i installed it on my laptop which only have a 32MB ATI Raedon 9000 and runs ok at 600 X 800 setting and normal details.

Dreamfall played out more like a movie, with at least half of its game time being devoted to extensive movie and dialogue sequences. Granted, the story was great, but if the developers wanted to make a film, that's what they should have done... this game offers very few puzzles of the kind you would expect of a top-rated adventure game, and any choice leads directly to a singular conclusion. The end of Dreamfall would be great for a movie, but, for a game in which you have invested 10-20 hours, it is very disappointing. I definitely do not recommend Dreamfall to classic adventure gamers... or anyone, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real adventure game","review":"I really like Adventure games. But this is not really it. Those of you who remember the old interactive movie games, will know how Dreamfall plays. It has a really good story to it, though, and that is its most redeeming quality. Very sub par game, and not a proper sequel to The Longest Journey, and I marvel at the awards it got last year. Worth 20 bucks or so...but not much more. Few puzzles, little combat, or gameplay. Mostly you spend the ENTIRE game going from 1 person to another and talking...and talking...and talking. Occasional item crafting, but again, you spend the game going from point to point and talking.If you really want to see the Longest Journey's story progress, you can get it.

There isn't a genre he won't twist to his own ends, frequently with large dollops of genuinely witty humor thrown in. The miracle is that he succeeds each time with even the most improbable concepts and premises.

They said ring was damaged in shipping, e-mailed me pictures of torn package and the ring, which we could see no damage, and the ring I sent back had tags on it, this ring did not.

I dont own this CD though. As I took a glance at it on Amazon I noticed it had no reviews so I thought I would quickly drop one in to help out the potential Byrd fan. What can I say? It has a mind bendingly strange song selection to start with. The Byrds changed line up a lot and for a compilation this size there is no need to include anything from beyond 1968 (not 4 out of 10 songs). The other 6 songs are all Byrds classics but to choose only 6 songs from their first 6 albums (let alone singles) gives a rather confusing insite into their constantly evolving sound for first time listeners. To go from the jingle jangle summery sounds of Mr Tambourine Man to the drug soaked jazzy leaning of Eight Miles High in the space of 2 songs is a bit steep.This is a budget, short, unthought-out compilation that does no justice to the Byrds.

While the bible is often said to be one of the finest fictions ever created, I beg to differ with this mainstream view.In a nutshell, the beginning was boring and it has no real ending. One assumes the author(s) were hoping for another sequel after the New Testament. It is clear that the author(s) felt themselves restrained. A vast improvement would be to simply NOT gloss over the various begatings. Let the reader live with the characters, get into their skin.

The track selection is quite good, including \\"Blood of the Sun\\", from Leslie West's \\"Mountain\\" solo album (produced by Felix Pappalardi), which led to the formation of the band, as well as highlights from the band's heyday. This disc is a good pick for anyone, showing the band at their best, and delivering good music at an exceptional price.

This disc features the best of Mountain's studio work, the the added bonus of \\"Blood of the Sun\\" from Leslie West's excellent solo album \\"Mountain\\", which was produced by Felix Pappalardi; this led to the long and artistically fruitful collaboration between Leslie and Felix, which lasted until Felix's untimely death.

Their influences are so right on and so worn on their sleeves that they COULD have made a real statement. A shameless nod to the Cars and to 80's synth pop plus a modern sensibility. Instead they hint at it with so much of a self-conciously \\"home-made\\" sound that it loses me by the third song. They obviously went with a producer by name value instead of with someone who realy undertood them and the result is, sad to say, generic.I still think they are a special band under all this; but this is not that special record they could have made.

It seems that the writers have had to repeat themes (the singing and hockey competitions between the rival villages) and descend into parapsychology to finish the series off (which it literally did). The whole thing could have been done so much better. I'm not surprised this was the final series nowhere near the same high class as the first two.

I love Donald Harington, and I will probably re-read this novel down the road, but it isn't for everyone. After everything our main character goes through, you are utterly devastated.

Much of the info is also outdated or seen through the proverbial rose-colored glasses. Often deceptive or misleading--I wasted more time trying to use the info during my move, than I would have just trying to figure things out on my own. Just one example, the author says you can open a bank account during a \\"preliminary visit\\" and recommends Banque Transatlantique. Then you find out on your own that you HAVE to be living in France with your green card in order to open an account AND that BT's required [high account balance].

This is an amazing book that allows you to reach down deep into the minds and souls of the police officers. Just like Sutton's \\"A Cops Life\\" I found this book to be amazing.

Ok, I don't read much for enjoyment, I read mostly for knowledge, but I really enjoyed this book. While reading this book I experienced and (almost) expressed every emotion.

I've never had one hair fall out of these, and they are so soft I've never been \\"stuck.\\" I use them every day and have had them for 3 yrs.

I bought them for my son in blue, thinking they'd stay on better than the plastic shades he had. Turns out the band slips, so they don't stay on at all unless you make it tight and position it just so. But, making them that tight makes the lenses stick to the baby's eyelids, causing goopy eyes. We noticed this happening time and time again: We'd put the glasses on our son's goop-free eyes, go for a walk, come back and find them stuck to his eyelids and his eyes full of goop.

While Cornwall's earlier Sharpe novels were quite a good read, his later ones showed a marked deterioration in plot, characterization and just generally poor(er) writing. However, any of them are preferable to \\"The Horns of the Buffalo.\\" To put it bluntly, Wilcox sounds like a modern day Englishman trying to sound like his great-grandfather, and not suceeding.The plot is paper-thin (no pun intended), the character development pathetic and, as another reviewer has pointed out, the deux-et-machina \\"solution\\" at the end is the characteristic hall-mark of bad writers. Why two stars and not one? Because one-star is for the truly abysmal writing such as Flint's 1632 series. While Wilcox is bad, Flint is even worse.If you haven't already discovered the Flashman series, do so and find out how historical ripping-yarns should be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome addition to a great series !

The benefits for me are not really about the cost savings (so you save $3 per month... big deal). Rather, it is a much healthier and comfortable alternative to paper products, and keeps my internal ecosystem balanced. I did completely cut off the stem because I found it uncomfortable. To remove, I bear down and pinch and grasp the bottom, which helps to break the seal, and it comes out easily.It does take a few months to get used to it. And for those reviewers who did not have a good experience, the company offers a very generous 3-month trial. If you don't like it after 3 months, send it back and they will give you a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, but painful for me...I love the Diva Cup!","review":"I tried this and it hurt me a lot.

I wasn't a virgin when I started using it either.A few years after giving up on it, I decided to try the Diva cup. It has been amazing...everything I'd hoped the keeper would be. It is nice and soft, so it doesn't hurt. It is nicer to insert than a tampon."},{"rating":"2","title":"actually, a review for a similar product ...","review":"I've been using the DivaCup (google \\"divacup\\" to see the differences) for two years now, and I *love* it. I don't know how it compares to the Keeper, but, in general, it's a terrific idea. I only have to empty mine twice a day and love the fact that, other than for those few minutes in the morning and at night, I can *completely* forget I'm having my period! I never really liked tampons, so a menstrual cup is a HUGE improvement over disposable pads. Not to mention how much money you save and how much cleaner you feel - all while contributing less waste to the landfills! I seriously had my doubts at first - that it was going to be difficult to use and, certainly, it would leak, at least at night?!? And, to be honest, the first couple months took some getting used to, but it was *so* worth it!! No leaks, either. If you're thinking about it, go for it and take the time to get used to using it - you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"This product gave me severe cramping and bleeding, it wasn't until I removed it that I realized that it had been this cup causing all the issues. I was also raw from insertion and removal, I literally cried from the pain. Maybe it's too hard a plastic, I don't know, but I use Insteads with no problems, no cramping and now I know that that is what I will stick with. I wish it would've been a better experience as I like the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the Keeper- not sure if I should buy another menstrual cup","review":"The material of The Keeper is unpleasant, smells funny, and frankly is just plain ugly looking. At first I had a really hard time inserting it. After a lot of practice I finally figured it out, but it was pretty uncomfortable. While it was in I could feel it and did not like it. I also found that it ended up leaking. Getting it out is also scary, because it travels up and it feels like you are never going to be able to get a grip on it.I wish I had bought the Diva cup to begin with. Now after my experience with the Keeper I'm not sure whether I should even waste my time and money seeing if the Diva works. I am disappointed in the current choices available- the Instead cup doesn't work for me and isn't reusable. The other menstrual cups are reusable but not comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I used my first Keeper for about 6 years. It does take little practice to make it fit right, but it is worth it and it works so well! One gets used to how often it needs changing, depending on the amount of flow. It may leek if it is not put correctly in place or needs to be emptied - but hardly any! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't pee","review":"I wanted this to work out so badly. However, I literally couldn't pee so long as I was wearing it. I would become uncomfortable, and have the constant urge to pee, but couldn't. After taking it out, I could pee freely. I decided that I didn't want to play with the cup all day long just to go pee. I don't know, maybe the softer silicone cup would work out better. From a toxic perspective, I'm not sure how I feel about putting silicone in my body. I was more comfortable with using natural rubber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"Easy to get more improvement with great recomment training ideas,from easy to extremely hard, from beginners to elite cyclist.Get its, and make you fit!Good books for person who interest in cycling sports"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What They Used To Be!","review":"I bought a set of these years ago, and used them almost daily...freezer to oven to table, on the range..never a problem, and wanted to replace the same sized casserole.

For people who have never had the original it's fine I guess (if you don't mind having chinese made cookware in your kitchen - which I surely do; THAT wasn't in the description either.).

No one could duplicate it. Many illustrators used a realistic illustration style. It didn't work in the universe Ditko established.Since Ditko's departure; the title went by the wayside of many of the horror magazines.

Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.This is particularly true of the first Doctor Strange stories, which had utterly fabulous artwork: you *think* you're reading the stories in this format, but you're really not. Not by a longshot.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books...

Those of us who are gay AND autistic need a book, too. Still, this book is a step in the right direction. Too many books imply - not always on purpose - that autism is a childhood experience. This book bravely tackles issues of autistic puberty and adulthood with sensitivity, recognizing that autistics will read this book. Even though I spent my often unhappy childhood wishing to move to Antarctica - at the time I really wanted to be alone - I have come to terms with humanity, and wish to be part of a monogamous partnership. So while this book isn't exactly what I need, it has helped me understand the principles behind romance and how to deal with emotions I thought I could never have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed book","review":"I appreciate the fact that there has been a book written on this subject especially for individuals on the Autism Spectrum.

And believe me after the first 20 or so pages I started finding the book thoroughly disgusting.The plot is miserable - the protagonist never even had to move as much as her nail to solve the mystery. Everything falls into place automatically as if by magic. The characters get added till the last few pages for the convenience of the characters trying to solve the mystery - if there was any.If you find it hard to believe me just go by the simple fact that the cover of the book doesn't have a single review excerpt from the acclaimed book reviewers or news papers.

I won't recap the entire thing here, just issues this review as a warning and suggest you read the May 2005 issue of Harpers. Sawyer-Laucanno, while he wouldn't exactly admit that he stole material from the oprevious book, he did admit that he couldn't explain how the similarities occured... and Sourcebooks also refused to take any responsibility.

It took over and hour to work it down far enough to fold and many bruises from it popping open because I lost my grip many times after that on the textureless surface.

Now, we looked at reviews and comparisons of the brands and she decided that the Mooncup (from a brand originating in the UK) would be best for her. Unknowingly I purchased this one, which has an almost identical name. It is similar in structure to the Mooncup UK, however my wife was intent on having the other brand's cup since it has a softer and shorter form. She could not use this one in fact, and we had to buy the other brand. This would not have occurred if this brand did not have a misleading title for their product. Hence, I give two stars for our experience with the product and its apparent deception, but also because we can no longer send this, now attempted to be used, product back for obvious sanitary reasons, though it was not the product we intended to purchase in the first place.+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to use","review":"... at least for me, anyway. I am new with menstrual cups, so maybe that could change but I found this cup *impossible* to fold down to a small enough size that I could insert it. It was really painful. I have tried the Meluna Soft and Divacup, and those seem to work a bit better for me (although I haven't \\"used\\" them yet per se, just tried inserting them and it's much easier) so maybe a smaller, softer cup is better for me. The Keeper Moon Cup is also very firm, so I can't imagine how firm the regular Keeper is (although that does mean that the cup pops open easier)Something else I don't like is that this cup does not hold as much fluid as, say, a medium sized Meluna... and Melunas are REALLY small! It's just something I found a bit odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use & not worth it","review":"I ordered this after months of consideration, and I shouldn't have wasted my money or time. It is NOT easy to insert or take out, not even with time--I used for two cycles and it was still painful and uncomfortable to put in and take out (even using the Before Childbirth size). The cup was somewhat difficult to bend and put in, and hurt. Taking it out was even worse--the instructions say to pinch the cup to get it out, but that allows everything to spill out, and it hurt on its way out.Even though it is environmentally conscious and cheaper than pads and tampons over time, I would not recommend this item at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon Cup","review":"I really liked this at first-now I'm not so sure. I find myself using tampons even though I've got this. It is really tough to get in just perfectly so that there are no leaks. Perhaps I haven't figured out the method yet, but I always have to have a pad or liner while I'm wearing this and I don't love that. Because the stem isn't ribbed or textured it can be difficult to take out. The first time, I spent no less than three or four minutes just trying to remove it! I'm glad I have it, but it hasn't been a game changer or anything"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Diva","review":"Because of the harder silicone, this cup is better than the Diva.

Inserting it is possible, though I've yet to figure out how far up it's supposed to go, but when it opens I feel as if I am being ripped up on the inside. It's terrible.

This would seem to place it as a popular work for the ornamental design of the previous decade (Victorian, etc). The second edition of 1933 was made over by an author named Amor Fenn who rearranged some chapters and added more about borders. The basic concepts of pattern design (i.e. wallpaper, rugs, etc.) are explained in that endearing early 20th century patter that turned everything around so they could say 5 words in 20; pre-entertainment-overload days! I took these drafting examples right into Photoshop and Illustrator and created several rough MacIntosh like Victorian wallpapers in a short time... copy/paste, flip, and snap-to made this an easy trial.

Brett's wife writes about the Favre family charity fund which helps disabled and less fortunate kids in both WI and MS. His mom writes about the Favre family obsession with football (Brett's dad is a coach) and how she spent her life going to EVERY one of Brett's games, missing only one when she couldn't get a flight.

We were horrified to find an entire block of bait, with bar, sitting at the bottom of a closet.When using the old paper bait boxes, you know to keep them under counters and away from pets. And the worse you're going to have to deal with is a small pile of pellets stored away before the mouse dies. With this?

It does the job, but is exceptionally hard to open. It comes with a strange, two pronged key to \\"unlock\\" the station, so it can't be opened by mistake. The key is about two inches long, and must be pressed hard into the lock (you don't turn the key, you push it in). The two prongs are supposed to move the plastic clips out of the way so that the top opens. My key never worked. It also requires a great deal of finger strength. I finally just took a screwdriver and pried the station open, which wasn't bad when the bait station was new, but was disgusting when I opened it to refill it (when it was full of rat poop and bits of poison). I cussed the whole time.... There are better quality, and easier to use stations out there, like the ones from Protecta that open with a small allen wrench (included).

This is supposedly useful for opening the plastic box. After numerous unsuccessful thrusts at the plastic box with the \\"key\\" I was torn between using a sledge hammer or a pickaxe. However, I decided to go with a small pry bar which worked quite well. Not having received the pictured bait and having read the review that racoons can remove it from the plastic box I decided to use bait trays that are larger than the openings in the plastic box. A wise racoon, of course, although unable to remove the bait tray can still shake out the bait itself.So, I am left with a falsely advertised black plastic box, a non-workable \\"key\\" and a tray full of bait which can be shaken out.

This is the only problem I see with the pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump has very low pressure","review":"I lost the box or I would have sent this back. It is not worth the money. The flow is poor. My mistake! I had a 3GPM that was too much so I chose a 2 GPM. This pump is probably a 1/2 or 1 GPM pump. I use this on my tractor to water my plants and add fertilizer. I wanted a low flow pump so it wouldn't destroy the plants but this is way too low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pump so far","review":"Received the Fimco pump today and installed it on my spray tank. The pump looks fairly sturdy even though the entire body is made of plastic. I didn't like the hose fittings as they just press into the pump, sealed by one O ring and held in by a sliding plastic plate that engages a groove in the fitting. Three fittings came with the pump, one 3/8\\", one 1/2\\" and one threaded. I really needed two of the 3/8\\" fittings, but had to make do with the 1/2\\". I felt that two of each should have been included. If a person was to break one of the fittings, they are specialty parts not available except from Fimco. Aside from the fittings, the pump primed it's self immediately. It sprays strong, there are no leaks, on demand switch works great. Absolutely no complaints with the function of this pump. While I find the fittings pretty flimsy, the function of the pump makes it worth the money. I'd have to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats, Cats and more Cats!","review":"I love this calendar! I purchase one every year for my office and I find myself laughing at most of the pages.

However, the book's \\"scientific\\" authorship are precisely what makes the book dangerous in that it seems to promote drug abuse as safe, although when read closely the data does not appear to support this conclusion so clearly. Perhaps the jury is still out on long-term adverse effects of MDMA. When the drug in question has potential to alter and damage neural structures of today's youth, perhaps a more cautious approach is in order. A great read, but the authors' presupposition of the drug's safety appears unfounded, even given information cited."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader from Boston","review":"A provacative, thought-inspiring work which focuses on timely and important topics. However, the danger exists that this book in presenting itself as a \\"scientific\\" work will promote drug use. While many chapters were fascinating, the book's overall premise seems to be that moderate MDMA usage is without potential adverse effects. I found data supporting this premise to be largely lacking from this book.

It's is not everyone who can successfully blend a first soprano range into popular music, but Runga does it effortlessly. When I heard \\"Sway\\" the first time I was mesmerized, and I bought her cd on a whim and lucked out. It is some of the most unique, beautiful and prolific \\"popular music\\" I have ever heard. I wish there were more vocal and songwriting talents like Runga out there. So Bic, keep on crankin' out the beauties and hittin' those high notes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars","review":"I can't understand why this album wasn't huge.This is the most impressive debut from a female singer-songwriter in a long time, far surpassing the Jewels or Sheryl Crows dominating the airwaves. Runga is blessed with a unique and dazzling voice, and a terrific ear for melody. \\"Suddenly Strange\\", with it's dynamic shifts, is gorgeous. \\"Sway\\" is a perfect pop gem, and the understated \\"Bursting Through\\" and \\"Drive\\" are sublime. This is a solid CD, deserving of your time. To add even more accolade, her sophomore album, Beautiful Collision, far surpasses this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Listening","review":"If you are looking for a CD with good, clean lyrics and soft backgroung music DRIVE is definitely for you.

She has a Chinese mother and a Maori father and talented sisters too. I heard Bic singing Sway and Drive live one morning during a radio interview,on my Walkman,while watching a netball game. The purity and exquisitness of her voice made me cry. I then went off to the shop to buy her CD. She deserves to do well in the rest of the world as she does in New Zealand;just needs the promotion and backing."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who liked \\"Torn\\"","review":"I've seen a couple people online who have compared Bic Runga to Beth Orton, but I don't hear much similarity between them at all. Bic reminds me of nobody so much as Natalie Imbruglia. If you liked \\"Torn,\\" here's more of the same. If that song got on your nerves, consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swaying me crazy","review":"I have not listened to this whole album, so can not offer a completely fair review. All I know is that where I work we have \\"MUZAK.\\" They have played the song off this album called \\"SWAY\\" almost everyday for the last 14 months. It has become like Chinese water torture. It is a very repetitive and whining song. The \\"clear vocals\\" many people talk about in their reviews of this album took our office staff over 6 months to figure out. Guess we are slow. Sorry for the partial review based on only one song, but \\"Sway\\" is supposed to be the best song on the album. I don't want to hear the rest. Apparently, Bic has a cousin at MUZAK?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This woman is talented. Don't forget this is her debut!","review":"I was disturbed when I read one of the reviews, below, of Bic Runga's wonderful CD.To set the record straight, anybody who has really listened to this disc knows that Natalie Imbruglia is an inferior talent beside Bic. I know this CD intimately and I see no similarity to Torn! None! I just want to counter-balance what I believe is a mistaken assumption. I bought Imbruglia's CD and I never listen to it any more because it was mostly dull pop with a few good moments.On the other hand, I still listen to Bic Runga's CD all the time because it has staying power. \\"Sway\\", her hit, is the weakest song on the album, in my opinion. It's okay, it's just that the others are much better. Some reviewers have only ever heard that one song and they have based their assumptions about Bic on it.I say this. Don't sell her short. Do yourself a favour and listen to the whole CD many times over. It's engaging and memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go the All Blacks","review":"I would just like to set the record, laid by Patrick Burnett, staight. Bic Runga, though her mother is Malaysian, is a New Zealander (that's the land further ander for those of you that are geographically challenged). If you liked Drive her new album \\"Beautiful Collision\\" was released on Monday (July 1, 2002), and if you like the voice one of her sisters, Boh, is in a cool band called Stellar*, with two albums available. I would also have to agree with the large number of revieweers that think Sway is not her best song, it pails in comparison to her others, listen to the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Live Show","review":"I haven't actually heard the CD, since it's not out yet, but I saw Bic Runga live at a little club in LA and she was fantastic...just her and a guitar.

You won't regret ever buying this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"she's great","review":"i am not a fan of her actually but manage to hear her song in the american pie soundtrack, and waas mesmerised by how clear her voice is, sway is a wonderful piece of song and i love it so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One repetitious song got this going ..................","review":"She has a good voice, but a very mannered vocal style, and pretentious diction that is sometimes not easy to decode without a lyric sheet in front of you. She pronounces \\"one\\" as \\"h-one\\", and \\"time\\" as \\"tum\\" to give a couple of egregious examples.The cd sounds like it was recorded in a dungeon - very bass-heavy and echoey.

In this CD, Oscar plays tribute to cuban legend Benny More whom he says was his influence in the track' Que bueno baila usted', and he also plays tribute to someone whom he doesn't really want to admit to the great puerto rican sonero Andy Montanez in the track 'A MI MANERA'.

There may be better philosophers, but Caputo is a fine communicator. This book is no exception. While I have always been fascinated by Derrida, I have found much of his work impenetrable. But Caputo has built bridges of understanding, so that something of Derrida's genius is open to all. The lay out of the book, along with Caputo's lucid style, greatly assists the project. Thanks to Caputo, the postmodern notion of \\"deconstruction\\" makes good sense. For example, Caputo's discussion on Derrida's understanding of \\"community\\" is very helpful. So, if you want to see what all the fuss is about in relation to Derrida, then Caputo's book is one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tensioner & idler pulley.","review":"Dayco 89008 Tensioner & Idler PulleyGood price for a quality Tensioner & Idler Pulley.

If you are only teaching one grade you will be finished with the book within an hour- except for coming back to the helpful references. (More references are listed at the back of the book.) Most of the references look good, also the suggestions are good.Each chapter or grade level, lists the subjects your child needs to know at this level and then goes into detail of what he/she should learn, and then gives suggested curriculum, websites, etc.The book did not give as much information per grade as I expected.It is a good base for planning your homeschool year, if you do not already have a scheduled plan and the references are valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Learning","review":"Excellent!

As a Christian home educator, however, I was disappointed. Many of the recommendations in the book are not especially helpful to those whose goal is to raise children with a Biblical world view. It's not that the recommendations are for \\"bad\\" things, but neither are they for distinctly Christian resources. For those who are not Christians, this may be a very good resource for you, but I will not recommend this book to other Christian home educators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"I was looking for a book that had just checklists of what to teach when- for example, when a child is finished with first grade in a public school what do they typically know.What I got was a book that had this information and much more. It lists one thing that kids should be able to do (identify colors and mix them to make new colors) and then provides some resources or books that will help teach this concept.To get the information I wanted I am forced to wade through the references and suggestions. That is why I rated it four stars. I think I'd like to have a checklist at the end of each section that has just the expectations of each grade. However, I'm not sorry I bought this book. I have a feeling that as time goes on I'll refer to it more and more.Great resources. There are a variety of books and webpages that are given in this book as places to look for more information.

I've seen a lot of scope and sequences, but most of them are so vague, they don't tell me anything. Home Learning, on the other hand, is extremely detailed. It also has high standards, rather than being watered down education. I know that if we cover what is listed in Home Learning, that we'll be right where we should be and doing even better than what is expected in the public schools.It's not the kind of book you read once and pack away. It's a book that you keep pulling out again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Source of Info!","review":"As a homeschooler, I felt I need a book to help guide me to make sure I wasn't leaving anything out of my kids education. This book covers a lot for each grade level. It's a great source of guidance and referrences.

Alot of the books they site as resources can be found at the library - so if you are on a budget like me and don't want to have to buy alot of textbooks, this book is great. My kids will be in the first grade and preschool this year, so we are pretty new to homeschooling and this book gives me a good idea as to what I need to be teaching and at what level my child should be at in each subject. Right now the only textbooks we own are ones for math and reading and I am supplementing with books from the library and worksheets off the internet. Anyway, this book is a bargain and if you don't want to buy a $1000 curriculum, this is the way to go!

It's secular and thorough and goes well with her more in-depth book (also similar in content) \\"The Complete Home Learning Source Book.\\" I gave it 4 stars only because I was looking for a Christian perspective.

I like that it offers guidelines on where your child should be but remember that these are guidelines and you may want to check with your state's requirements.Also, I agree with the reviewer who said that some of the resources/info may be a bit dated-hence the four stars. (Looking forward to a revised edition.) Don't forget to look for online resources as well.

Even the artists I used to enjoy have started putting out any old junk expecting fans to buy them. Well I was so disappointed in this release I don't know if I will be wasting money on Chico's music anymore. Or next time I will have to hear it before I buy it. CD's cost too much now-a-days to waste money on albums that seemed thrown up in a day. I hope Chico revaluates himself and goes back to the good songs he used to make. I was disappointed with Maxwell's last album too. Chico used to be sensous and soulful. Now he's turned just as ghetto as the other people. Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK EFFORT!","review":"Chico just lost a fan. He tried to write and produce this album on his own and it's terrible.

(Keyboard, Bass guitar). From the start you hear its one of those cds that you play in chill mode. He ends itin a nice way by adding No guarentee \\"The remix\\" which is one of my favorite songs by him. Now to the cd whats good?:*Its cool*Style*Virtious*Questions*Availability*Not 2 gether*No Guarentee (remix)Overall you couldnt ask for anything more here.

The small screw holding thetomahawk head to the shaft appeared to have been stripped while being installed.I was able to salvage the head and a carpenter friend made me a new handle out of solidoak...without splinters.

The head is attached to the shaft by means of a tiny, tiny, TINY screw (which on my particular model, had been screwed into the shaft so far that it no longer even grabbed the axe head), which is a horrible solution to an easy problem. Thus, this axe can't be thrown (as the impact severely damages the shaft, mine split because of the screw), used in medium duty camping situations (buy a proper camp axe, you'll be glad you did)(it's also too heavy to pack), etc.The shaft arrived unfinished, and very splintery.Buy this (buy the trail hawk, it's much lighter) only if you want to make your costume a bit more realistic, or to hang on the wall, and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last an hour","review":"I an totally unsatisfied with the items.

The only thing I've done to improve it was to wrap some rawhide around the head to insure it stays tight, not because it was loose but just to be on the safe side. If it ever does become loose I plan on using 550 cord to resecure it in place.

The strings/piano combo is awesome. Needless to say, I bought the CD because I couldn't find a single. I'm glad I did. My favorite song on the album is the opener, \\"Outerspace.\\" It's melancholy pop and rock into one great track. The pop tracks (\\"on the bus,\\" \\"from my head to my heart\\") are as good as the folky ones (\\"wouldn't it be nice to be proud\\") to the ballads (\\"i could fall,\\" \\"the distance\\"). these guys wrote and produced the bulk of the album and their artistic merit shows.

If you are still bent on buying this CD, I highly recomend you go to a music sampling site like ..., or even download 1 or 2 songs off ... just to see if you agree with me, or don't.

There is only one good song: \\"Crazy for This Girl\\". The others are not terrible but they do not deserve the good reviews or being put in the same category as GooGoo Dolls and Third Eye Blind.

The story helped me see that I'm not the only woman who went through this \\"patch\\" in her life. Nan feels the same way that I did about a lot of things that happened. The only thing is that some of it is a bit unbelievable. For example: stopping at the farmhouse and having tea with the elderly woman.

They recruited a punk singer that would butcher everything by the name of Neils. His faith no more vocals work totaly against the music and as much as I try to listen to the music , I cannot simply due to to horrid singing. There are occasional female vocals by Martine Van Loon that provide some temporary relief.I often think to myself: \\"what if Anneke sang on this album ?\\" - it would have been a great warmup to the Mandylion album, heck even no vocals would have been good enough.I can only recommend this one to die-hard fans of the bands early period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Beats - Lacks Meat","review":"This is a good secular album.

I love ya T Bone but choose gospel or secular, not a watered down mixture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"T-bone really shocked me on this cd being as though much of the material on here sounds a little too mainstream. T-bone is still an awesome rapper but here, He seems like he's trying to win radio airplay. The beats aren't really that great on here neither. Although there a few effective songs on here [''A few good men'', ''Shake ya body'', And ''You can't win''], The album runs out of steam before the final track comes. The only interesting things about this album are really the guest spots by Mack 10 and Chino XL. While this is not a totally wack effort, It definintely needs some work. I truly hope the next album from T-bone is much better than this one. Hope the review helped. Be blessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reiki Everyday","review":"It is through another article that I was led to this publication....I am ever grateful to Amazon for their vast library and ability to unearth rare finds.As a Reiki Practioner it is refreshing to be reminded of the basics. What a fantastic tool to aid in honing in one's abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out-loud funny","review":"As others have said, definitely read other Thompson books first (\\"The Killer Inside Me\\" or \\"The Criminal\\" would be excellent choices), but this is a great book. By modern standards, it's tame. The title seems an exageration, given Thompson's self-censoring repression of anything truly ribald, profane or shocking ... though maybe this is more a reflection of where pop culture has come today than of Thompson. That said, the book is extremely funny in places & a great insight into the writer. For the truth behind Thompson's stories, try Robert Polito's excellent biography, \\"Savage Art,\\" which is a must for anyone who gets really interested in Thompson anyway. If you read many Thompson books, there's a good chance you'll get seriously interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Thompson's autobiography of his youth - not so good...","review":"'Bad Boy' by Jim Thompson is essentially his autobiography, detailing his life up until about age twenty. He had a horrible, crazy life. The reader is paraded through his dozens of menial jobs, illegal hijinx, and nasty episodes with classmates and his family. While the early part of 'Bad Boy' is indeed interesting when we don't realize the narrator is Jim Thompson himself. However soon the author gets a bit self-indulgent in describing his wasted youth. I found myself more annoyed with young Thompson than feeling any pity.Bottom life: Jim Thompson had an absolutely rotten childhood. Do you really want to know the details??"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY are there no answers to MC???","review":"What's the point of the MC at the end of every chapter if a) you cannot find the correct answer and b) your prof doesn't give them to you??

However, I wanted to get ideas for residential design: doors, columns, ceilings etc. The book is a compilation of photos taken across a myriad of environments. The vast majority are exterior shots. I wanted many interior shots. Very disappointed that now I have to pay return shipping for a product that was not well described. I suggest Amazon develop some type of categorization system to aid the buyer to determine suitability of purpose. If Amazon could do that, pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny but some long slow scenes","review":"This movie is so funny! The ghetto slangs used to dub over the real voices are hilarious! It has an east coast vs. west coast conflict; making a spoof out of the east coast vs. west coast thing w/ rap music. Also one of the character's name is Tu-Pac, and his character is funny as hell! I love this movie, I don't know why some people don't like it. But then again, I also love South Park, which some people find offensive rather than funny. I guess if you love South Park you'll also love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Buy It For Rudy Ray Moore!!!!!","review":"If you're buying this film because you're a fan of Rudy Ray Moore, or you're expecting to watch another Dolemite film, skip it! This film can only be appreciated by kung fu film fans.Shaolin Dolemite is comprised of footage that wasn't in the film released on DVD as 'Ninja The Final Duel'. Apparently the full length of 'Ninja The Final Duel' is supposed to run for over 10 hours!!! But only the edited version was released. 'Shaolin Dolemite' at least gets you an hour and a half closer (minus the Rudy Ray Moore footage) to having the full version.So, like I said, DON'T BUY IT FOR RUDY RAY MOORE!!! Buy it if you are a fan of Robert Tai's films and you want to get more footage from 'Ninja The Final Duel' that isn't on the Crash Cinema DVD version of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak effort -- not up to Dolemite standards","review":"I'm a big fan of Rudy's other movies, but this one isn't even in the same league. Basically they bought a lousy kung fu video and spliced in goofy sound effects and a few scenes of Rudy making faces and commenting on the action. Rudy's barely in the thing, and the tedious fight scenes go on forever. Trust me, Rudy's made much better movies. If you're not familiar with Mr. Moore's work, check out Dolemite, Human Tornado or Petey Wheatstraw instead, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricked","review":"I was expecting a new Dolemite movie, really this is a badly subbed Asian film with Rudy Ray Moore thrown in to \\"watch.\\" LAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather drink antifreeze","review":"This movie was really painful to watch. Rudy Ray Moore was only in it for about four minutes alltogether. There was a \\"Davy Crocket\\" ninja, some gold robot dudes, and a topless ninja that actually attacked someone with her boobs. Incredibly stupid and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible movie","review":"This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. That's part of the fun. I'd seriously recommend watching it with a group of friends, shouting out snarky comments to the screen. Trust me, it's the only way to get through it, but it can be fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like your life depended on it","review":"I don't actually own this film (Thank GOD!!) I did rent it however, and it stinks! Rudy Ray Moore is past his Dolemite prime in this one. The action part of it is slow and there is no recapturing the glory days. My suggestion is to stick to the orginal and not this cheap imitation to reap money from the Dolemite name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but it ripped quickly","review":"This is really cute and fits the player well, but as another reviewer stated the clip is poorly designed. It was so hard to get on and off, the silicon ripped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"This is a great case for the m200 Sansa. I would recommend it to anyone who owns a m200.One thing I would warn, it does not protect the screen, but the screen is strong enough it really doesn't need it. also does not protect the computer connection, but in the 2 years I used this case, I did not have a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandisk Sansa Silicone Case for M299 players (pink)","review":"I bought this for my daughters 10th birthday and she loves it because it was pink! But it's a nice little case and fit very well.

But all in all it's great for 10-year-olds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Protection","review":"I bought it to protect my player and learned the hard way.

It is nice that it has a clip, and it fits the mp3 player snugly, but... Would be nice if it has a clear \\"window\\" to protect the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great. Should be called \\"clip\\" instead of \\"case\\".","review":"Bought it for my wife - the pink just didn't match anything in my wardrobe...She uses her player for the gym, and treats it somewhat rough. This \\"case\\" doesn't protect the screen from scratches (see most other reviews), but it hasn't fallen off while she's worn it, either. About 1/2 useful, really.On the other hand....it was cheap, right? Right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice radio but . . .","review":"If you want a nice little radio to listen to while you work out this product has it! If you're purchasing for the MP3 player, save your money and go buy a $20 GPX from the dollar store! I bought this from Amazon and was really disappointed. As I stated, the radio is great but the MP3 player will not play the songs. The songs downloaded into the player and it acts as though the songs are playing on the screen but there is no sound. I've tried deleting and reloading, etc., ect., with the same results. Can't send it back because it's past the 30 days for return. What a bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead","review":"My player was 32 Days old and it Died. It will not Start.

Smith, Vietnam War veteran, and some poignant insights into political America, John Nichols (not to be confused with the writer for the Nation magazine- though the mistake would be easily made) shows us the evils of war, during and after. Nichol's understanding of the human condition, and the need to expiate our \\"sins\\" simply by telling them, simply by having someone to share with, is deftly interwoven into the fabric of very believable and graphic human lives. In an unspoken way, John Treadwell Nichols shows us that the personal is political, and that though we may deny it at certain times in our lives, love is not only the higher ground, but the only ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"I keep having to buy this book because eventually I end up giving it away to help a friend. More than anything this book teaches you how to appreciate life and that makes life easier to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Narrow","review":"I was disappointed in this product. I expected this to be 2 yds of fabric. It was 2 yds of a strip about 8 inches wide. Just a warning to purchasers that you may probably be better served by going to a fabric store and buying what you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for making cheese","review":"Ok, call me old fashioned, but cheese cloth ought to be good for making cheese. This is a fairly wide weave which means that you have to fold it over a few times. Also it is fairly narrow. The end result is that while it does a good job of collecting the cheese curds, they end up being caught in several layers of fabric and have to be picked out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loose weave","review":"I bought this to use as a shade cloth over the lettuce section of my garden. Its a good value, but as others have stated the weave is very loose and only filtered maybe 10% of the sun. The openings appear to be about 1/16\\" or so wide. Obviously it all depends on your application and whether or not you need a more tightly woven cloth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep! It's cheese cloth!","review":"Got what I think it a great deal here as I couldn't seem to find cheese cloth in my usual shopping locations. I agree with other reviewers that the weave seems a bit large, but it works for my basic baking/cooking needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really happy","review":"This is a VERY loosely woven cheesecloth, and it's also a long, thin strip. Yes, it's a double layer, but the open weave makes it near impossible to open up and rearrange.I'll be giving it to mu husband to use with his Halloween decorations, and then searching for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for good quality cheese cloth","review":"There is not much to really say about cheese cloth. If you are buying it then you probably know what it looks like and how it should act. This is perfectly average quality cheese clothe (meaning it is no better or worse than any other cheese cloth). The price for this cheese cloth is good and cheese clothe is a very versatile product that can be used in the kitchen or in a variety of other circumstances where you would need to filter liquids or clean delicate surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps going, and going, and going....","review":"Part of the reason Dickens uses his \\"flowery\\" language, despite the effectiveness in creating vivid imagery, was that he was paid by the word. Therefore, his wordiness should not solely be considered an artistic choice, which makes you a bit more sympathetic to how long winded this book can seem. It is however a classic for good reason, with a compelling plot, even without very memorable characters. Still a good book to read for its historical context, and if you can handle the language it, for its good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Rammstein","review":"Amazing and powerful. No one in the world today puts together a stage show like Rammstein. Till Lindemann's lyrics get better with every album and the band constantly add new dimensions and musical depth. In a world filled with vapid commercial music \\"product\\" like Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears, et al, it is refreshing to see something orginal and powerful, and not meant to please the masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a Rammstein Fan","review":"Understand when you purchase this that it's a BIG BOOK with 4 discs attached to the inside of the cover. I was really surprised. However, I'm an obsessive Rammstein fan, so I was glad for all the stuff. The concert footage is really good, and gives a glimpse of the new gimmicks for the recent songs. The book is just pictures, but if you're into that it's lots of fun and really good quality. If you aren't a Rammstein fanatic, I'd still recommend Volkerball, just a lesser version of it (Regular or Special)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan must-have!","review":"This collection is a must-have for any Rammstein fan. I have been a fan of Rammstein for ten years and I have to say that this is one of the best live collections they have done thus far. The photos are powerful and moving. The music is great, as always. I reccommend the limited edition 100%!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live bands shows their stuff","review":"Rammstein is one of those bands that sounds and looks amazing live. I had the chance to see them on their Mutter tour a few years ago, and it was the best show I've ever gone to.The DVD highlights some of their energy on stage. I reccomend it to anyone who is a Rammstein fan, it's just fun to watch, these guys put on a great and entertaining show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is music pricelss?","review":"I believe whomever is incharge of pricing the band's music needs to rethink who they are selling to.

I could somehow work with that but this amount of 171.99 is too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"*COUGH*","review":"The price may have made me cry, but the cd itself is pretty amazing.

Saw clips of this concert on the internet, makes you feel like you're there, very powerful show. It is in German so you better brush up or do like I did and just jammed out and didn't care.

I really wish Amazon would requlate their sellers better, because this happens to me a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired","review":"This CD feels tired. If you were down with the first attempt, you'll understand. The cameos on this CD feel gratuitous. On \\"So How's you're girl??\\" having Miho rap Dr. Octogon lyrics on \\"Metaphysical\\" was genuis. Don't listen to the Johnny Come Lately's on this one. Save your money or buy the first CD. The only good track on this CD is \\"Rock and Roll never hip-hopped like this, Pt. 2\\" - and that owes its pedigree to the first CD. The combinations are forced. These guys were the first to really explore the rock/hip-hop mash-up. It's too bad that they were content to do the same thing with newer names, and not develop the steez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what I didn't expect from HBMS, 2 generous stars","review":"I thought I knew what to expect when I heard there was a new HBMS project coming out. I was pretty excited for a follow-up to \\"So How's Your Girl?\\", one of the best albums ever released in my opinion.So when I read the list of guests for this project I was pretty disappointed, especially when I saw Cat Power and Linkin Park. But I still kept an open mind, figuring if anyone can pull such a line-up off, it was Automator and Prince Paul.But as I listened to the cd, I found myself skipping tons of the content to try and find something worthy of being on a HBMS release. The cd has a very boring feel to it. If you were into \\"So How's Your Girl?\\" and expect this to be anything like it, don't.I can definitely say this isn't for hip hop heads, or even for myself, whose musical backround spans from rock/classic rock to underground hip hop. A very disappointing release. Download it before you buy it, then buy it if you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grown-up Hip-Hop","review":"I'm really into the concept behind the Handsome Boy Modeling School...being a gorgeous male model myself...anyway, this album gets 5 stars for creativity and breadth of sound, but for musical content, it gets 4. The high point of the album is Dre's track \\"First...and then...\\" He absolutely rocks it! Paul & Automater's production behind him is nothing short of excellent. That track is so good, it almost gets the album to 5 stars. The first HBMS album had a similar feel, a wide array of musical styles, I highly suggest owning both.As far back as this album reaches to hip-hop's roots, (thus the title, grown-up hip-hop) it reaches way out in front as well towards what we may come to see in the future. Amazon.com is also offering the instrumental version of this album...(my local recond store did not.) I'll be ordering it in a couple days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip the Linkin Park track, and it's a great album","review":"I'm giving this album 4 instead of 5 starts because of the whiny Linkin Park track that's on it. It doesn't fit at all with the rest of the album and those guys suck anyway. Who did they blow did get put on the same album as Del, the RZA, Prince Paul, and Dan the Automator? Skip this track. You'll know which one it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good","review":"I bought this album on a whim after hearing one of the songs mixed up on Pandora, and I am glad I did. HBMS really hits a sweet spot for me with this mix of hip-hop, electronic, trip-hop, and rock. I know that a lot of other reviewers have testified to the unconventional nature of this album, but I have to echo it just one more time: this album is different but it really does work well. The lyrics are smart, the production is enough to get my head nodding, I thought the skits were funny, and I truly enjoyed listening to the CD straight through from start to finish. Thats a win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Album","review":"This album as well as the non-instrumental are absolutely great. This is a great mix of music.

With the exception of a few greats (most specifically Outkast) I find most of it pretty tedious. There are some good beats, maybe a few good rhymes, but all-in-all it's just too damn commercial and self-aggrandizing, with little real musical merit. Just like their alternative rock cousins, hip hop artists come up with one great beat then put 10 other junk songs or skits together and call it an album. Then something like the HBMS comes along to remind me why I still keep looking through the hip hop bin at my local record store. The beats are graceful and strong. Cat Power, Jack Johnson, De La Soul, and a bunch of others make their beautiful marks, while Dan the Automator and Prince Paul keep it tight. This disc is so good, and consistenly good, it pretty much makes me want to get out on the dance floor and shake my skinny white a--, which is saying something, as my a-- is quite skinny, and quite white.A must buy for all beat heads out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good filter.","review":"What can I say.

I came across it in a little record shop that specialises in electronic and underground dance music and was intrigued by its description on a label on the front. It read \\"Portishead-tinged electronica\\", and thats pretty much correct.The Portishead influence is evident, yet there are elements of Tricky, Hooverphonic, Lamb and even Moloko in there. Their singers' voice is mesmerising, and the band's trippy eclectic feel brings to mind Maxinquaye-era Tricky.There is an occasional dub-style rap which ties in nicely with the female singers' dreamy vocals and adds a fairly upbeat feel to the songs.\\"See\\" is definitely worth checking out. If only they could obtain a bit more publicity then they would have the recognition that they deserve"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY SECRET \\"EYEDENTITY\\"!!!","review":"I discovered this group on James Hardway's recent \\"Over Easy\\" CD. I was instantly floored by the floetic rhymes and vocals of Diana and Krishna Booker. On Eyedentity's debut, \\"See\\", there's much of the same with droves of hypnotic vocals and Twista-like rapping, embellished with haunting dub-wise grooves and orchestrations. The lyrics are fresh and original, and the mood laid back and at times melanchonic--but in a good way. Eyedentity's style can be likened to Portishead, DJ Cam (Mad Blunted Jazz) and even a little bit of Jill Scott, only with their own unique blend of \\"ethno\\", spoken-word, trip-hop and acid funk. Eyedentity will probably go unnoticed by the masses, but if you're tired of what's out there now being overplayed, you'll find \\"See\\" to be a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"Pretty good WWII novel from a Japanese author, didn't find it \\"pro-axis\\" like some reviewers.

Yes, it probably could be a fun and educational game, but because of the lack of clarity on how to play and score it, I can not recommend it at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could make for an interesting show","review":"I really enjoyed the concept of this show. I do think the pilot was a little slow, but since it was introducing us to the plot, I think this may be why.Living 2 lives not know which is real plus, intertwining them together could make for lots of twists.

It promotes the idea that Mormons are a \\"cult\\" -- never mind its a world religion with some 13 million followers.

They make it sound totally ridiculous, but when you go to Mormon sites they refute much of what these guys say. Bruce and Stan also tell you the Mormons will say that. So who do you believe?I did like this book though they did not tear up every religon or belief they did make some sound pretty good which surprised me actually.So, even though I got a biased view on other religons I do have the tools to \\"dig deeper\\" myself and see what the other side of the story is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and Closed-Minded...

I really only read the first few pages and bits and peaces as I skimed through the pages. It's just as poorly written as the first (In His Image - see my review there) and just as BORING. The only reason I even started this book was that I spent my $6.99 on it - thank goodness I didn't buy the third book in the triology. Mr. Beauseigneur has a LOT to learn with regard to writing - perhaps he should take a couple of courses on creative writing! He could do with some instruction on how to develop his characters.

The Tribulation has begun. Beauseigneur's portrayal of the first trumpet is breathtaking in it's scope and devastation. The second trumpet judgement is also powerfully and frightfully delivered. An intriguing plot, and well-developed characters combined with pain-staking research combine to make this perhapse the finest End-Times novel. This book (as do the others in the trilogy) reads like a mystery, a techno-thriller, and a science fiction novel all rolled into one. I'd give it five stars except for the mild profanity. You'll probably want to think twice before using the Christ Clone Trilogy in a Bible study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not a writer","review":"I'm sorry, but while the concept has promise, these books are very, very tough going. The writing is unbearably monotone, plodding along, making it unduly hard to stay focused on the story (which wanders all over the place). If you are looking for a quality read in this vein, let me suggest a copy of Frederick Forsyth's Fist of God--now that is a quality novel that approaches writing as an art, rather than simply laying out reams of information like a journal. These books are about as interesting as reading the Congressional Record, and just about as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review Scam","review":"All the glowing reviews for this series and the author are a scam.

The action cuts between the two main characters at the worst possible moments. Plot points are timed just right, and the storyline holds together so well.

However, most other areas of discussion are unoriginal, superficial, and at times devoid of support. The statistical support for his information on welfare reform (ex. Tommy Thompson-WI) and the success of advancement in the military for non-whites has merit. His exploration into the ills of our educational system becomes a crusade as the evidence for his claims is nonexistent. He would have done better to eliminate it from the book because it is much more complex than what he portrays. He mentions that the failure of our schools can only be changed by parents; but those parents spend less time with their kids, are more concerned with grades than acquistion of knowledge, and at times omit the Hard symbol of accountability.

Most everyone gives it such rave reviews, I had to put in my two cents. I really dug the first one so when the second one came out, I was really psyched. It was really disappointing for me. Where his first was a departure for him from what the Screaming Trees were doing (which I really dug too), this second one just seemed trite, like he and whoever he was working with was able to make it sound like Poco or a depressed and depressing Neil Diamond. I guess it depends on what you're into, but I personally prefer any of his other records over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why in heck did he leave the Trees???!!!!???!!!!!","review":"Why in heck did this jerk leave the Trees? That was the most happenin' band in Seattle, we all loved 'em. \\"Nearly Lost You\\" was the best song of the '90s, by far! Now Lanegan leaves Queens of the Stone Age and what are we left with - nothin'!!!The Trees were a top Seattle band that kills the morbid junk on this dusky album. Again, I don't see why Mark Lanagen left the Trees to join Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, then later Q.O.T.S.A. Those bands had something to offer, but Lanegan as a solo artist is Dullsville, U.S.A., as you can tell by my low star rating. In fact, I only gave it 2 stars because one of the songs on this CD sort of reminds me of the Trees.For reviews on all top albums of the day, keep checking in on my site.THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BESTWAY - DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"We recently purchased a Bestway Inflatable pool to replace an Intex pool that we used for 4 years. We did not realize it was a different manufacturer (not Intex) when we purchased the pool. After setting it up we noticed a small leak in the seam and contacted the company to replace the liner. We did not want to waste the 900+ gallons of water in the pool, but wanted to transfer the water to the new liner. After 2 weeks of email and telephone calls (which were not returned) they have just advised me they will send me the new liner. I am not holding my breath!!! I am sure I will have to keep calling them. This is the worst customer service I have experienced.My advice - BUY INTEX if you are looking for one of these inflatable pools -- Quality product that was well worth the money!!I will never purchase a BESTWAY product again!!!Bestway 15' x 36\\" Fast Set Pool with Free Beach Balls"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANTOHER ONE...","review":"Take the combat logs from squadrons then all fo a sudden you've got a book to publish.

In addition, he puts other toys in his wagon and pulls them around. I'm glad I found this neat wagon and blocks for my son. (This particular one came with about 90 blocks, so I guess whoever owned it before simply added to the collection.) My son really likes his new toy wagon and blocks!

Thank you Lumpkin and Dujardin for writing a book that does not get caught in repeating itself over and over. As a warning though, about half the book is quotes from various sources. It's not a continuous string of thought like most books of its kind. The chapter on creeds kind of drags but is worth reading. Especially for those who have never thought about what they really believe. I found the book to be a breath of fresh air. It cuts out so much of the crap that gets stacked on top of what Jesus said.

Being a runner helps you enjoy it, but my wife isn't one, and she loved it too.My question is which version this is.Mr. D.

It was instead a \\"heavily edited broadcast TV version.\\" Well, I bought that one on VHS, and have enjoyed it. That's why I'm only interested in picking up the DVD if it's the original release.Can anyone help me out with this? The DVD is rated PG, which would seem to indicate that maybe it's the original.

Finally look closely at the infield of the track at the '64 Olympics which were held in Tokyo, you can see the yard markings from the football field where the movie was shot in Southern Cal.

These guys just got scratched up in my coat pocket, and I didn't have anything else in the pocket!Otherwise the ability to adjust these is extremely good. My buddy liked it so much he wanted a pair too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these glasses","review":"Very comfortable, the arms adjust up and down and forward and backwards, so they are very adjustable. They are lightweight and the lenses are very clear. Awesome glasses for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is the best protective goggle I have had. I use it at work (as an EMT). They fit perfectly and are not ugly lab types but at the same time professional. what I like the most is the many adjustments you can make to make the glasses sit exactly where you want on your face. definitely a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very scratch resistant.","review":"When I received this both the left and right lens in the same spot were already scratched. It looks like the clamshell packaging it came in was rubbing against the lens and caused the damage. The lack of proper delivery packaging probably caused it or made it worse, because the box it was delivered in was with a bulk purchase includng other items. The box was too big and everything must have bounced around during transit encouraging damage.Concluding the glasses are not very durable to resist scratching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to all the reviewers!","review":"Just can't understate the value of the product reviews that people take the time to write. It's truly more than appreciated.Bought two pairs of these safety glasses to replace all the dinged, dented, scratched, hazed things we've been using but put up with 'cause the better ones in the stores around here are just too pricey. Only been used once, so far, but have already outperformed over 50% (or more) of those we've purchased previously.These sure do seem to be \\"as good as reviewed\\".They fit, didn't slip, didn't fog, didn't scratch up after several good whacks from tree branches, and best of all ~ they didn't give me a headache. They wrap around just enough to do what's needed to help keep wind and smoke from all the burning we're doing from messing with, or drying out, your eyes. That was an unexpected, but oh so nice, surprise. The best thing about them, however, might be that we won't be as inclined to decide safety glasses are optional when they really aren't?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice glasses","review":"Very comfortable, the frame is a little flimsy but you really can't expect more for the price. Overall I am happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY.. 2 pairs","review":"You're on this page for a reason. Buy 2 pairs. They're worth it.I almost gave 4* because they will FOG when using a dust mask. However, they're far and away the best safety glasses I've ever worn (that list isn't considerably long).Both frame arms are adjustable. Frame arms are coated with rubber (not cheap plastic which scrapes the skin). Middle nose piece is rubber too. Comfortable.I have a pair of cheapy's and when I misplace these, I'll look around for 5 minutes before settling for the other junkers.Buy these and you'll never go back. I might've talked myself into buying another pair.. yeah, I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, adjustable safety glasses for dentistry, and deficient nose bridges","review":"These safety glasses are adjustable at the hinge area and at the length of the arms. The nose pads are large, and combined with the adjustability make it more comfortable on my face (Asian with no prominent bridge at nose). At regular tilt, the lenses hit my cheek bones but I can tilt the entire lens up for a comfortable fit. They feel pretty good after 4 hours of wearing, and I have a somewhat large head. The glasses are some anti-fog properties, but it amounts to slightly blurred vision when breathing hard or sweating. When you're wearing a face-mask, it may cause some condensation that looks like your vision is a bit blurred rather than fogged. It is a similar effect to spraying anti-fog solution on a set of lenses. However, the price and versatility make this a great product! I'm ordering a second pair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"masterpieces / only a pamphlet","review":"Spent $13 (Amazon) on what I thought was a book / It's only a pamphlet / not pleased at all !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace flag","review":"Very impressive and received in perfect condition.

Thunderbolts was a product of the old administration and was a real Marvel book in style and substance. However, its now to be replaced by a hip (= embarrasingly dated within 5 months) version of Supervillain Fight Club, with zero connection to the original idea (and zero likeability).

However, even without the shock of this revelation, the series is a superb example of good solid storytelling. The twists and turns will indeed keep you wanting more.

There's nothing much wrong with the book, it is short and readable, but it is seriously outdated. The consensus of opinion on many questions has changed a great deal since the early 1990s, and much that was taken for granted is now rejected or questioned.For a more up-to-date picture, the 2004 edition of Sally Foster's Picts, Gaels and Scots is worth considering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointing.","review":"We love period dramas.

It was both interactive (many things for the child to feel and do while you go from page to page) and informative. I thought it was too much for a 4 year old, but she liked it much and had many questions to ask. We read this again and again and now, I have to show her the real moon in the night. It shows the movement of the earth and the moon, information on the planetary system and fun facts on the moon expedition. I believe it would be very educational to somewhat older children and it will definitely create good first interest in the science and astronomy where they will learn more at school. Great book. Well written, having the inquisitive child in mind. Fun book for adults as well (my husband is a physicist and he enjoyed it very much)and parents can enjoy this book with their kids at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book for Kids","review":"I found The Moon Book to be fun and informative. The pictures were vibrant and themes interesting. I enjoyed Ms. Seymour's use of scientific, social, and mythological themes to demonstrate the important impact the Moon has had on humanity.

ABC1 show this constantly, so just switch on the TV! However, what a really pleasant surprise, having put the DVD in, to see that it's in widescreen. ABC1 live in the past and broadcast in 4:3 format. Plus they seem to show them out of sequence a lot of the time. This is a great show; a perfectly cast comedy with \`serious' parts intertwined, that only US TV does well. Having said that, this is possibly the closest to a UK family comedy I've seen from the US.

Tipped with a rolling wheel, these fabic markers lay down a thin, line of powder to guide your cutting, sewing, or whatever. The mark has more staying power than a pounce pad, but yet easily dusts away when you are ready to get rid of it. Because the tip and wheel are so narrow, this marker can be easily used to make a straight line right next to a ruler or in the longer, thin cut-outs of a marking stencil--for example to put in a quilting border pattern. The silver color is great for both very dark and very light solid fabrics.

I found this pen to be pretty good and do recommend it, my only \\"sort of\\" complaint is that it only seems to work in one direction. Perhaps this is just a flaw of this particular pen and not representative of all of them, but I can roll forward with great results - a line that is crisp and clear and doesn't distort my fabric - but if I try to reverse and go back over my line, it pulls on the fabric and won't lay down a line.As I say, this is a minor complaint because I don't *need* to go back and forth with the pen, but still, it would be nice if it rolled backwards as smoothly as it does forward. Nevertheless, I do love this pen and plan on getting more colors soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilbert O'Sullivan","review":"It was lovely to hear all three CDs, having heard them many years ago on LPs (that have disappeared or worn during all these years).

This book thankfully downplays that. The troop movements are covered in this book but not to the point of numbing the reader. This is an excellent read and extremely informative and entertaining. U.S. Troops ingaged in pitched battles with regular Russian troops on Russian soil, AMAZING!!! Why isn't this covered in school, why don't we hear more about this. Because we pulled out before completing many of the stated goals. I can not praise this book enough, it is a fantastic book it's 4+ stars.

I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful router and very reliable","review":"I have used this router for years to make panel doors and these bits require a LOT of power to get a clean cut.The router uses 15 Amps by itself, so if you try to use this on another circuit or an arc-fault breaker it will not work as another reviewer commented. But that is NOT the routers fault! It is not a kiddie router that you get a Wal-Mart, but a professional grade tool.I would give it six stars if I could. I leave the router in my table and never use it free-hand.

From what I understand 1 sone should be equivalent to about 40 decibels. Well I measured our decibal level and it is 65-70 which is still pretty loud. It is marginally quieter than our previous fan but we are very disappointed in the sound level. I don't see how they can advertise \\"whisper quiet\\". We have the fan in the toilet closet with high ceilings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet only when not attached to vent pipe","review":"We installed this fan in our upstairs bathroom. We tested it when we first got it fixed to the ceiling joists and wired. It was very quiet. So nice. But then we attached the vent pipe and piped it out the side of the house. It is only a six foot run, one 45 degree turn and one 90. Suddenly the fan rattled and groaned as if it were 30 years old. We ended up taking out the internal flap and are trusting the wimpy little external vent flaps to stop back drafts in the winter. That helped the noise. But it is still disappointingly fragile sounding with some rattles and speed variations. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does anybody like this book?!","review":"This book was not a thriller in any sense of the word. Besides page after graphic page of instuctions on how to euthanize an animal (or person), the entire book consists of boring conversations between people, with only occasional lines to spur the story along. About a third of the way through I just started skimming the pages because it was too boring to read. And the ending... ugh. But at that point I was beyond caring, I was just so glad it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting \\"why\\"-done-it hampered by patches of bad writing","review":"Let me begin with the caveat that I seldom read mystery books. This book illustrates the problems I have with most mysteries. This book is not the usual who-done-it. We know the central character did it. The issue is why. More than 90% of the book consists of dialogues (Hence, the title). Unfortunately, Mr. Spignesi suffers from the problem of many second-rate writers -- he can not write dialogue that rings true. Much of the time the language of the main character (with the ridiculous name, Tory Troy) sounds like something out of a Hardy Boys book, save for the occasional profanity. Also, the book uses a tired gimmick as the resolution. It is, however, an easy, if uneventful, read if you have nothing better to do with your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I bought this and two other Praise Baby CDs for use in our church's nursery & Children's Church.

One would think that is an obvious statement, but apparently the folks at Conair didn't really think about that in creating this bit of \\"home relaxation\\" equipment. Unfortunately, you also need to place your feet in at a rather odd angle in order to get them to fit under the guard at the top - that is, unless you have little teeny feet. And I mean teeny - mine are size 7s, and they don't fit very comfortably.Still, warm feet are good! So if you're looking for warm feet, this is the spa for you. If you want to relax though, perhaps a good set of headphones would help."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this product!","review":"My daughter and I both enjoyed soaking our feet. I guess the previous reviewers had overly high expectations. Yes, you do have to fill it with hot water. Big deal. Then it's ten minutes of relaxation. It does splash over the sides if you overfill.

This book does not have a single page dedicated to the topic.Having purchased and read several books in this category, and joined several custody for fathers organizations in search of information that would be helpful to my crusade to provide a better environment for my children.I've also used the author of this book as my own attorney.

I have used various methods for cutting drywall, but this has become my favorite. The ability to set the depth of cut to exactly that of the drywall, makes for a much safer endeavor when cutting out portions of wall behind which are many electric wires. I also use it when cutting pieces on a workbench, as it's so quick and easy. I chose this one rather than the 14V version because it looked like it would get into tight spaces more easily. It's worked fine. If I were a contractor, I might look at the other.

It reminds of mid 70's bubble gum pop, and is certainly not up to Vince's usual standards. Vince is one of the most talented singer/songwriters in Nashville, but this is really a terrible CD. Alan Jackson produced what many considered his worst CD \\"High Mileage\\" during the saddest time of his life, but was able to redeem himself with his last effort. Vince, evidently produces his worst work when he's happiest. While I certainly don't wish him sadness, it might be a good idea to hold off on recording again until some of the sappiness wears off. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although not a total waste - this cd is way below the usual high marks we set for Mr. Gill. If this is ANY indication what love and marriage to Amy Grant do for him - beware to his career. I just hope his marriage lasts - because with this effort and the fact it is getting next to zero airplay - his career is not exactly soaring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend \\"tojalida\\"","review":"Product-VINCE GILL \\"Let's Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye\\" CD - sold by tojalida. Product was listed as NEW online when purchased. It arrived with cracked cover, no celopane around CD, and some songs skipped the first time played and there on. I e-mailed \\"tojalida\\" and they're repsonse was that the CD was not cracked upon shipment and it is a recording! Tojalida did suggest that I could return CD,however; it wasn't worth the postage. This certainly is not what I was expecting as NEW!This also was my first ever purchase with AMAZON. Because of this experience I will NEVER recommend tojalida, and I am most reluctant to use AMAZON. I had higher expectations of AMAZON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye-Sweet but no classics here","review":"While its nice to hear Vince so happy, this latest effort should have been tied up in a ribbon and given to Amy. His voice retains its superior quality,and the music is pleasant enough. However halfway through you crave something more substantial than sweet ballads and constant admissions of love. No doubt his talent as a musician saves this Cd. The guitar solo on Look What Loves Revealing is a definite highlight. Anyone who has seen him in concert knows this man can play! True fans wont be disappointed but others will dismiss this Cd like a valentine card received the day after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's make sure you pick up this CD someday...","review":"Not being a huge country music fan, I was a little weary of buying this CD. I heard one of his singles on the radio last summer (2000) and decided to pick this CD up. Vince Gill has always been one of my favorites in the country genre b/c he can play his own guitar and write his own songs. This CD finds Vince, reeling from his new love/new marriage to Amy Grant. Every song is about his deep deep love for Amy, his daughter or his family and friends. The first five songs can be played over and over. It's a great disc just to unwind to and to play in the evening. Vince is more Contemporary Country instead of Nashville Country. If you're a fan of Amy Grant or Steve Wariner, this is one for you. Pick it up. Well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shot of Insulin, Please","review":"After reading the editorial review and several of the listener comments, I decided to borrow this CD from the library prior to buying it (which is not my usual Vince Gill habit). Thankfully, I saved [my money]. Although Vince's voice and guitar playing are as always beautiful, the song lyrics and style are monotonous, sugar-coated drivel about his new-found love for Amy Grant. I agree completely with Amazon's editorial review. I hope that Vince has now gotten the need to proclaim his new love out of his system and will go to writing better songs and making more interesting CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"To mushy not enough solid lyrics","review":"I am sad to say but I cant stand vince's latest CD. I have been a pretty big Fan of his over the years but this CD just does not do it for me. Unlike his \\"the Key\\" album this one is filled with WAY to many love songs. That is all the CD is except for the last song. I do like the Duet He does with Amy Grant and I think she really adds to the CD, but still most of the songs are to fluffy and light with no substance.

I think it is exciting to listen to considering what has happened in VinceGill's life lately. I am referring to his falling in love and marriage to Amy. I think his voice sounds beautiful as usual. I also loved The Key and even though this album is very different from The Key I love it also. It is very upbeat and each and every song seems like it has been precisely fine tuned to that Vince Gill smooth sound.

She lives in Chicago so she can't always go out when it's too cold so this is great for her to have something she can practice with indoor (given enough space).

This book will last with you long after you have read it. I find the perseverance of Paris to be outstanding.

Yes, there is lots of sex: if you like that, this was a great book. And, there is a witty portrayal of hell at the end (but you must wade through hundreds of pages of five-dollar words and four people who think about only one thing -- guess what? to find it). There is little plot -- if you took out the sex, thinking about sex, thinking about the next time you'll have sex, and the last time -- you could read the book in thirty minutes.

Called Comp Cams technical support and never got the same answer twice when I asked how to use it. Went ahead and attempted the seal job on a BBC with teflon seals. Managed to ruin two seals before I finally mastered a method of installing them. Ended up using the butt of the tool to push them on (don't forget to use the installation sleeve), inverted the tool and pushed the seal on. Removed the installation sleeve and finished the job with a 12mm deep socket. The tool works and it is cheap, but I have to believe there is something better out there.

We enjoy dancing together to it (though it is very slow paced... more like tender and slow worship dance.) The images of children, babies, nature, animals are also very well done.

It does require 2 people to use it, one to hold the hair at first, and one to operate the wrap. My daughter (8 years old) was a little disappointed she couldn't do it alone, but she soon forgot all about that once she saw the wrap appearing before her eyes. Takes a little practice to get the wrap neat, learning how fast to move it down the hair. It actually helped when I held her hair in my left hand, the wrap in my right, and did it alone.

That's OK for a low-cost router, but there are a couple of other weaknesses. First, it takes two wrenches to loosen/tighten the collet -- there isn't a lot of room in the housing to fit those two large wrenches... Also, there are three adjustable plunge stops -- this is implemented by three machine screws with jam nuts. A third (small) wrench is included for this. The thread on the machine screws is a little coarse, and between the coarse thread and trying to control the screw/jam nuts, it can take several attempts to get the plunge stops exactly where you want them. All-in-all, this is a tough little router without a lot of frills for small and medium-sized jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOOLING THE AUDIENCE ..","review":"Horrible.

Two small screws inside the reservoir are rusting after one use. I used it about 2 weeks ago and it still has water in it. I called Conair customer service and they told me you have to use all the water by steaming it out. There is a small plastic cap device and that's the only means of putting water in or taking it out.

Some small wrinkles still remain after and if not, the shirt looks a little chunky and wavy and not exactly smooth.The things that I like about it is that it's really easy to fill the water compartment since you just pull off the small cork and go to the sink to refill the water.

It also gave us some interesting tidbits about George W. Bush, limited, true, but enjoyable. This is NOT a book about Mr. Bush, however; it features him no more and no less than the other men in the book. And while these stories are flattering, they reveal embarrassing moments as well (President Andrew Johnson comes immediately to mind)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faux book","review":"I have not read this book so the star rating is not accurate. I did however, watch the Brian Lamb interview of Chris Wallace on C-Span's Booknotes. The book sounds interesting and should have some historical value. However, on several occasions during the interview Wallace could not answer Lamb's inquiries as to the source of one story or another which was detailed in the book. Wallace was forced to admit, more than once, that the content came from his researchers. Wallace was woefully unprepared to hawk his own book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious ploy to elevate Bush","review":"What Andreya Dela Cruz doesn't seem to quite fathom is that George W. Bush doesn't belong in this book in the first place. If one is to write about about exceptional presidents who displayed remarkable courage, Bush 43 would not even rank within the top 40.

In this book, Wallace the younger pays lip service to the concept of character. Unfortunately, his recent public chastisement of his own father speaks with much greater volume than the words in his book. Sadly, the author of this treatise on character has shown that he lacks perhaps the most fundamental underpinning of character, which is embodied in the commandment to \\"honor thy father.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Wallace Needs A \\"Character\\" Lesson","review":"I am completely disgusted with Chris Wallace after he publicly humiliated his own father.

The Book is a monumental mouse.BTW, the person the writer calls Demon King, that is Lord Ravana, is revered as a God in some parts of India till date.

The imagination of the author seems to know no bounds as he actually tries to pass off 20th century Hindi as ancient Sanskrit and portray the King of Lanka as a Demon-God!!! Had he spent as much time researching the original epic as he had spent in describing the sex life of Dasharatha, the book might have even been readable.Ultimately, this book has been a major letdown.

Using 'bombayya' Hindi words, American slang Banker goes on and on and on 'borrowing' heavily from recent westen fantacy/adventures. What, were you writing for a video game, Mr. Banker?

It has a little of everything: thrilling parts, emotional parts, supernatural stuff, and romance.A girl, Rachel, has to live through a summer where her couisn, Julia, has to stay with Rachel and her family. Julia's parents died in a car wreck. But Julia's weird. She takes over Rachel's best friend, her boyfriend, and her clothes. She goes to the dance that Rachel was supposed to go to but couldn't because she had hives. Julia goes to the dance in the dress that Rachel made herself for herself. Rachel's dog bit Julia once, and Julia she yelled at the dog. Next thing that happened is Rachel's dog is sick. Rachel eventually thinks that Julia is a witch.I thought this book was good. It's very creepy and gives you chills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Fear (Hahahaha)","review":"Lois Duncan's book, Summer of Fear, is suspenseful and mysterious. The book begins when Rachel's family hears of the death of Aunt Marge and Uncle Ryan. The relative's daughter, Julia, was going to come live with them. Rachel, who likes to be called Rae, is excited to hear that there will be another girl in the family besides her mother- so she takes it lightly.

But, wehen Rae's life began to twist with not normal acidents- such as her boyfriend dumping her abruptly- she began to wonder..... and found out the horrifying secret of her cousin......

Lois Duncan put readers on the edge of their seats yet again with this \\"witchy\\" novel. However Lois gives a little too much away too fast; not the big twist of course, just that something was off with Julie. And there was barely any action until the end. However despite all of that, it is still a descriptive, thrilling, and, at points, hilarious! Well done Lois!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun to read for the whole family.","review":"\\"Summer of Fear\\" was one of my favorite short novels I read as a kid. I was so happy to find a \\"modernized\\" copy for my 11 year old daughter. She loved it as much as I did. By modernized I mean that the version I read (in the early 80's) did not include cell phones and video games.

Summer of Fear stands up nicely along side the author's Stranger With My Face; I Know What You Did Last Summer; and Down A Dark Hall.

A young reader in my family is going to love it. 5 stars***** (Thank you to Hachette Book Group for my review copy.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Readable!","review":"Summer of Fear is one of those rare page-turners that you neverwant to end.

She is dangerous because she very effectively cons those that cannot think independently. Very subversive, very dangerous lady.

How could the police and court system of an entire county be so biased against a certain person? If Wendy Titelman was such a great mother why would she lose custody of children in the first place? Why would she move so far away from her children. I certainly would not. There are things that we are not hearing. It sounds like the babble of a crazy woman.

Also- why did the author move so far away from her children?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!","review":"Wendy Titelman sheds light on the lack of protection for our children in the justice system. I work in child protection and know what happens to kids who disclose abuse. Something is very wrong with our judiciary, and Ms. Titelman's book, Let My Children Go!, clearly describes what is wrong. Judge Bodiford, one of the main characters in this book who refuses to protect abused children, should be hung from a tree along with the father, Andrew Titelman, and others who abused these girls, such as guardian ad litem, Diane Woods, and Dr. Elizabeth King. It is common knowledge that children who disclose sexual abuse and are not protected will recant their allegations. The negative comments that have been made on this book can only be made by the guilty parties. I recommend this book to every person who is concerned about child abuse and the protection of children. It should be mandatory reading for professionals who work with children, attorneys in family law, and judges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating","review":"Hmm. Was the reviewer who wants to put Tierney Gearon in jail really so shocked and appalled by this film? He seems to have still had the \\"nerve\\" to watch the whole thing. His puritanical view is really more shocking than anything you'll see in the film. The movie is a sensitive portrayal of a photographer mining the precarious terrain of her own life and her own family--brave and unsentimental art that is captured without judgement by the unobtrusive filmmakers. A brilliant and enlightening documentary on one person's life and creative process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disgusting and Disturbing","review":"DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO SUPPORT CHILD PORN AND ENDANGERMENT.

You would expect the book to go by quickly, but there are times you need to re-read it to get the full grasp of what's being said. The language is choppy, the presentation is so-so (several misspoken cliches), and it is just a little TOO fantastic. However, this book was very interesting. It has lots of mystery and keeps you guessing until the every end."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unconvincing argument","review":"The author does a decent job of presenting a historical overview of the Assassins and Templars, but then spends only a couple of pages trying to convince the reader of the connection between the two groups. In the end, no evidence is offered to convince the reader of his argument. At best, his explanation is that the teachings of the Assassins are similar to Western esotericism, and since the Templars were in the Middle-East at around the same time, they must have brought the teaching back to Europe. No evidence is given regarding any interaction between the two groups, any similarities in ideas or practices, or that even the Templars had anything to do with Western esotericism. Where's the evidence beyond the author's blind speculation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The smartly selected title suggests a much better synthesized essay studying the common points and the differences that exist between the two extremist groups of Islam and Christianity - the Assassins and the Templars.The book is unfortunately a collection of information copied from various sources and pasted in badly organized paragraphs.I personally do not advise this book. It should be better to wait for a greater specialist in the Islamic and Christian hidden religious societies to delve into the intricacies of the Assassins and the Templars and get out with a much better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"The title doesn't infom you, but this odd-ball book was written for the occult reader.

The author clearly has the occult background to understand the often cryptic and Byzantine connections between the groups and the philosophies that they espouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but keep in mind...","review":"This tale of conspiracies and secret societies are not always based on solid scholarship. Most of the information in the book was good, but some of Wasserman's assumptions and theories are a little far out. The author also liberally blends opinion and facts. Should not be used as a beginner's book. Should be read by those with some experience on the topic who can judge what is fact and conjecture/fantasy.Keep in mind that the endorsements on the back of the book are made by members of secret societies and not scholars, authorities, or academics.

Secondly, it is huge, so if I had installed it, it would block out my vision out the normal rear-view mirror.

It is an autobiography, yes. It is an insider's view of the Nashville music scene. It is a masterpiece of psychological examination. Most of all, it is completely human.Masters isn't gentle with anybody in this novel: but the best part is that Masters isn't gentle with herself. She knew exactly what she did and what she wanted and she offers no apologies or excuses. That kind of honesty is unsettling. It makes this book impossible to put down.I have never before read a book like this one. I got it a week ago and since then I have been reading it again and again and again!

The second symphony is a tough listen, and the rather harsh sound here makes it tougher. The third was music rearrangedfrom another project and sounds it. The 6th symphony, in my estimation, should rank up with the much more performed and recorded 5th, and the Chout suite is typical Prokofiev. Gergiev, Rostropovich and Rozhdestvensky all do better performances in better sound, and aren't that much more expensive than these.

River?Where was the Self-Defence Test?Where was the Human BBQ?Where was the shock collar? Or the Poo Poo Platter?What about the Poo Hug? Or Ehren McGhehey's No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service?And how could they have left out Eddie's Auto? Come on!It's not like they left out some obscure clips... these are some of the all-time classics!It's like releasing a Beatles Greatest Hits CD and not including She Loves You, Hard Days Night, I Am the Walrus, Hey Jude, etc.So, MTV, what gives?That said, for the $40.00 odd bucks that I payed for it, well, I had some laughs, but the let down of not seeing those clips (and most of those were the ones I was really looking forward to seeing again) just left a really bad taste in my mouth.Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"if it was complete it would be better","review":"i like the box set,its most off their antics but some is missing,like the first show where knoxville tries to jump the river and breaks his ankle or foot,if you have watched the show from the start you will know some is missing but its a great buy for all the stunts and pain"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it promises","review":"This box set delivers everything it promises: the complete Jackass.

Moreover, you have to watch the skits with the annoying beep in every bad word which is something you don't expect.On the other hand, they didn't include the best skits of the series so I don't understand why they call it \\"the box set\\". If you'd watch it in the \\"play all\\" option you could see there was no link between some of the skits because some of them were missing.

It is intended for the intelligent reader to gain a good insight into the scrolls, their history, the significance of the texts, and the work that is being done. In this respect, it achieves its objective.I like this book because it is possible to pick it up without any great knowledge of paleography or patristics, yet still be able to make sense of it, and gain some perspective at the same time.If you are interested in finding out about these fascinating texts, and if you want an intelligent yet readable work, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exercises","review":"The book gives exercises at the end of each chapter, but does not give the answers to check by.

And SS2 just didn't cut it.Awkward play control (especially when fighting), lousy attempt at techno music, bad graphics.

The story is quite entertaining with some predictable AND surprising twists in the plot. This game allows you to play as a Marine (weapons), O.S.I.(psionics/mind power), or Navy (cybernetics/computers). Each branch has its corresponding (strengths) but having superior computer skills make the game somewhat easier to proceed through the challenging levels. There are LOTS of high tech weaponry and gadgets throughout the eerie decks of the von Braun including a \\"red lights\\" district in the crew's recreational area. It was more fun for me to solve the levels myself rather than resorting to online walkthroughs. If you enjoyed Half-Life and Thief, then you'll have a great time with System Shock 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting Game","review":"System Shock 2 is the most riveting game that I have played in a long time. The plot design and mechanics remind me strongly of Half-life. Like Half-life; the visuals, the sounds and the plotting all emotionally attach the player to the game.But where underneath Half-life sat a simple first person shooting game, underneath System Shock 2 is a complex character development system. As the game progresses, players must choose how to evolve their game persona. And how that persona is evolved directly affects the tactics and strategies that the player uses to make their way through the game.System shock 2 is a compelling title. Engrossing and engaging, I recommend it strongly. (And I am disappointed that Looking Glass -- the developers -- have closed shop.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful gameplay, and will scare you.","review":"This game is great. The sound is terrific, the graphics are good, and the interface is very easy to use. The best thing about it is the creepy feeling you get when you play it. Try it with the lights out, late at night, when no one is home. One minor problem that novice players should note. This game can be very hard. If you are used to Quake-type games, be prepared to change your style of play. The guns in this game degrade and break VERY quickly, and there isn't that much ammo to go around anyway. You should find other ways to get around this problem. It is more realistic in a sense, because who in the hell is going to want to take on all of these zombies and killer robots anyway? Part of the fun is avoiding and getting away from these nasty monsters.

I can' t believe I paid so much for this little pamphlet. Caveat Emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective CD","review":"Just a note to those folks who might be considering ordering this CD. I ordered it twice from two different Amazon vendors. Both copies were defective. The sellers were very gracious and refunded my money immediately. The problem with both of the CDs in this set is that the CD simply \\"replays\\" the first symphony on the CD over and over again - i.e., you get one symphony on each CD rather than the eight CDs total that are indicated. While I really wanted the CD set, I finally gave up as I figured that the whole batch of VoxBox CDs were defective. So, buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible display, bad customer service","review":"I purchased the German model of this. The display was not readable and it crashed often. Etaco customer \\"service\\" was awful, and they are charging me shipping and restock fees even though the unit was defective. Buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"electronic translator ECTACO PB-SpEnFr B-3","review":"I had to send it back because of it's limited application. I wanted a product that enabled me to add words and phrases and this product did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Rehash of Junk","review":"If you suffer from insomnia, by all means buy this book. It is the worst rehast I have ever seen of old, recycled early 20th century theological garbage. If it were even well-written, it could be tolerable, but it's a collection of ponderous sludge. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"my 3.5 yr old daughter loves it.she played it for a week, excited but after about 3 weeks...... left it on the box :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Engaging","review":"I got the My First LeapPad and several books, including The Wiggles one, for my daughter, who was 2-going-on-3 at the time. She really had no interest in it. Maybe it wasn't appropriate for her age level? Who knows. But she still has no interest in it, and I'm just waiting for the next garage sale in my neighborhood so I can sell the whole thing. There's nothing inherently wrong with it. It works fine. It just doesn't spark with my kids, and I am not going to enforce MANDATORY FUN rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Technicolor Horror","review":"A lively mix of gothic melodrama and fast-talking Warner Bros. verve, \\"Mystery of the Wax Museum\\" is great fun. Strikingly filmed in two-strip Technicolor, the 1933 production benefits from Michael Curtiz's directorial craftsmanship and Anton Grot's impressive set design. Some truly horrific moments build to a serial-style climax. Lionel Atwill's classic villainy is complemented by fast-talking Glenda Farrell and the inimitable Fay Wray. Decidedly superior to Warner's 3-D \\"House of Wax\\" (1953)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recordings of depth and guts","review":"This set is even finer than Barenboims earlier cycle with the ECO, which is also excellent. The sound is crisper, and the performances radiate joy and exuberance. If you want Mozart played in a romantic style but without oversentimentality, this is the set for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Chai","review":"I absolutely love this tea. I usually mix the black and white chai teas together. White tea is really good for you..However, to my disappointment.. Everytime I order this tea, I get sent the wrong one. Instead I've received two boxes (containing 6 packages) of \\"Organic Premium White Tea\\".. Which, is not the same at all.. Huge disappointment with my order, though no hard feelings to Amazon - they did all they could. I still absolutely love this tea and would recommend it to any chai lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This product may be exactly what is described but I don't like the taste. For me it has too much clove taste and is almost medicinal in its strength. After steeping three minutes I couldn't finish the cup. With a two minute steep I could tolerate it but I know I won't finish all the boxes. I wish I could have found it at my local store to try first before buying so much.I like Chai flavored creamers so I should have just ordered plain white tea and added that. The positive ratings made it sound good but for me the spice flavor is overpowering (like euclayptus menthol)."},{"rating":"1","title":"white chi tea","review":"When I ordered this I thought I was getting plain white tea not a spice variety, don't really care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rocks!","review":"Fishing from your living room..aaah yeah. Definitely get the fishing controller it is well worth it. The graphics are great and your friends will love it! Once the season comes I will be ready!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Hooked Now!","review":"Sega Bass fishing is the best game I have ever played! The graphics are unbelievable giving you in depth details of nature. You can actually hear the birds chirping and the crickets cricketing. The many different lakes, tournaments, and lures pull you in. After I played this game for the first time I have been hooked ever since! This is a must buy game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Game, But A Little Short","review":"This game is definetly one of if not the best fishing game on the market. The graphics are absoulutly stunning, especially the fact that the scenery is reflected off the water. This breathtaking fishing trip takes you through 3 different modes of play including 5 fishing tournaments and all the while gaining 6 extra lures to add to your starting collection of 7. The fishing controller really adds to the mix I wouldn't recommend playing without it. The only problem I have with this game is that the gameplay is a little short. You can play arcade mode which is four levels and origanal mode which is 5 tournaments, but after that theres nothing. It just doesn't hook you and keep you coming back for more. In conclusion though I would recommend buying this game if you are a fishing game kinda person it is the best fishing sim on the market, but if your a serious gamer you'll want to buy the fishing controller too, without it it's not all that fun."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],O={key:0},N={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-2c010647"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/65.md","filePath":"quotesmag/65.md"}'),W={name:"quotesmag/65.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
