Callas is more characterful but squally, Tebaldi is more Italianate but things get unpredictable at the top of her voice. Price has that glorious shimmering top (weird that a reviewer wrote that she has little pianissimi - Price's piano notes are famous), the strength, as well as the tenderness. Some criticize her strength but we forget that Aida IS a princess. Equally FANTASTIC is Jon Vickers who gives an un-Intalianate but highly individual and unforgettablly heroic reading. I have to conclude by adding that I'm shocked that DonAndrea's racist review has not been removed. It's no surprise that the hick comes from No'th Carolina."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST PERFORMANCE OF AIDA ON CD.","review":"Leontyne Price was BORN to sing this role. Her Aida is powerful, moving, and magic. Her voice is rich and beautiful, and she truly ACTS the character through the music. Vickers and Gorr are excellent. Solti has been criticised for conducting \\"Wagner's Aida\\", but this is the one Verdi opera that calls for a monumental presentation, and Solti is right on target with this performance. Bravo, Solti. BRAVA, PRICE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, it's too Wagnerian","review":"This Callas basher obviously lies. First of all, I do think Leontyne Price has a very odd mannerism with her voice- pinching it to make it sound thick. Second, del Monaco was one of the greatest Radames of the century, his singing of the role superior over to that of Jon Vickers. Vickers is taking the role too technically. Mario, although not a bel canto specialist or a Wagnerian tenor, specialized in Verdi, Puccini, and verismo. Then, the lying Callas basher contradicts himself by saying that the E-flat is not written in the score, so Callas shouldn't sing it. Well what about Joan Sutherland's Lucias and her Sonnambulas and the rest? They shouldn't be proper either! He's obviously uneducated about opera, seeking war with others to create tension between the diva factions.And I agree, this is too Wagnerian. Except for Price, the whole shebang of this Aida is represented by Wagner specialists."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ritorna Vincitor\\"","review":"I can only say, that this recording of Aida, is the best I have ever heard. Solti, is great.After listening this, he became one of my favorite directors. He makes you listen, every inch of the orcherstra, leaving it with a great majestry, that is required in this opera. Price, is considered to be one of the greatests Aida's of the century, and here she shows that. Her \\"Ritorna vincitor\\", is great. Vickers is fantastic too, he never lets you down in the entire opera, his \\"celeste Aida\\", is beutifuly sang too. And Gorr, and Merril, diserves, some words too, they makes the perfect Amonastro, and Amneris. Well, if you want to hear Aida, follow my advice, and try this recording, is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verdi - Aida / L.

The music notes are in English and German. However it lacks lyrics. One can definitely feel the Wagnerian influence and Solti has managed to pace the music just right.

The trimmer head on this model feels loose, making it difficult to judge cutting path when edging, and seems to wobble when in use.

It is worthless. As others have noted, the automatic string advance feature does not work.

It is not efficient and it is a pain to use. The automatic feed is a good idea in theory, but in reality the bump and feed is the way to go. I would recommend taking the time to learn how to use the traditional bump and feed trimmer because in the long run, you will save yourself money and prevent the stress caused by the automatic feed's poor design. Also, I am not a fan of corded landscaping tools. I'm a service member living in Germany and I have to use a 1500 watt transformer just to use this weedeater. Additionally, I dislike the limitations of an extension cord. The cord limits my range and I am constantly forced to navigate around obstacles in my yard. I would much rather be able to be free to move about without having to worry whether I will knick the extension cord, costing myself more money and frustration to maintain a tool that doesn't perform well in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Easy Product to Use","review":"I have tried and tried to use this tool.

His old performance of #2 with Ormandy is even livelier, but its sound is obsolete; these newer recordings offer very good (albeit remastered analog) sound. If you will spare no expense to have the very best performances of #2 and #4, you should seriously consider this set.But Pascal Rogé and Charles Dutoit do a much better job of extracting the maximum musical merit from the lesser concerti--see the reviews of that set, where several reviewers actually conclude that all 5 works are equal. This applies particularly to #5: little profundity, but plenty of fun. It helps that Dutoit generally gives the orchestral parts more verve than Plasson, whose Toulouse players do create a gorgeous sound. While Rogé doesn't match Entremont's vitality in #2, it's not a bad performance. Overall, I'd put Rogé ahead of Entremont. I haven't heard the Collard set (portions I've heard on the radio sounded very good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"The case was/is too small. I can barely fit my bag pipe into it.

It is a sequel to McKinty's Dead I Well May Be which came out in 2004. That book was praised for its menacing tone, snappy dialogue and complexity. This one has those elements but also an understated dry (Irish?) wit which serves as a counterpoint to some of the more horrific elements in the quick paced narrative. It is the story of an undercover operative in a sleeper cell- not that original in itself, but then what story is? The selling point rather is the way McKinty tells the tale. His voice is completely original: dark, poetic and (for a crime novel) beautiful. The last third of the book moves very quickly (maybe too quickly) but the last chapters and the ending itself are very satisfying. A great book that lingers long in the memory. Look for The Dead Yard in many top ten lists in December."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book by a rebel who wanted to bring a new perspective to almost universally accepted notion.

The quality was as expected (not sure how we can rate music quality unless it's really bad).Such goodies as \\"If You Love Me Let Me Know\\" and \\"Let Me Be There\\" showed her original light country origins and \\"Please Mr. Please\\" and \\"Have You Never Been Mellow\\" are still classic--she had a forever teenage pop vocal that those of us who got to hear it in her prime were just fortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic","review":"Great CD to listen to, brought back lots of memories from her early years.

Although we have been inundated w/ several greatest hits packages, I would love for RHINO or her Aussie label, Festival, to be really brave and issue a compliation that pulls great songs from subsequent recordings since 1983. Olivia has given us many wonderful songs since TWIST OF FATE. Where are songs from WARM & TENDER? The RUMOUR was an excellent album with virtually any track deserving of attention. GAIA offered an very personal experience w/ Olivia. BACK WITH A HEART was probably one of the most underrated albums of 2001. The closest thing to a definite collection is Olivia's LIVE album.

This is actually the third novel I've read about a disfigured, eye-patched leading male character, but still Ms. Hatcher was able to write a gut-wrenching, compelling story. And it's refreshing to see secondary characters have conflicts of their own, and find their own happy ending too. It was just a little too predictable in the end, and maybe the kids should have had a bigger part -- poor Becca was practically non-existant. But these are small details.

This performance has been willfully distorted to accommodate the talents of Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne, neither of whom is a singer in any way suited to this blood and guts opera. Pavarotti is only slightly better in the power-driven role of Manrico. The old warhorse does not deserve to be beaten in this manner.

De La Iglesia, who is known for his subversive, wildly imaginative and unconventional movies, is saddled here with a tepid script that takes a familiar premise and adds little that is new or interesting to secnario. The plot basically revolves around a stash of money that a woman finds in an apartment building and how she tries to get that money out of the building while the scheming tenants try to stop her.

This book wasn't about Steve Yzerman the person/hockey all-star, this book was about all the things that happened around Yzerman over the last 3 decades. I was also horrified that the author never even interviewed Yzerman. Makes me think I should write a book. I know Gerard Gallant would talk to me and I know that I would remember that he coached the Summerside Hemphill Pontiac Western Capitals who won the Royal Bank Cup in 1997. Which leads me to the comment that not only was this book a huge disappointment because it gave us nothing about the real Yzerman, but it was replete with errors. Essentially it is wrong to have this book in the non-fiction section of the bookstore because most of the information is so inaccurate that the novel is fictional. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rebellion to remember...","review":"I have watched this anime on adult swim and I have loved it ever since. This is the story of a man who wages war against an empire ruled by his tyrannical father. Lelouch at a very young age was discarded by his father along with his sister and mother. Now he fights as the infamous Zero in order to bring down the empire and restore Japan to its former glory. Any anime fan should pick this set up because it has many fantastic characters with unique personalities rarely seen in recent anime.

The drawing is amateurish. The animation is cheap. The English voice-over actors are pretty good. The writing is grade school quality. The storyline is faulty.

This is not an artistic work but rather a job demanded by a bookkeeper to make money and nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting story turns and fast pace.","review":"This is one of very fast paced anime stories in all of animes. Yet, its story keeps holding up without going into some fancy story thread that makes no sense. Yes, it has unexpected twist and turns and some times these turns seem improbable but this is anime and you have keep that in mind. This anime is not trying to mirror a real world. No, it wants you to go into its own world of riveting characters and their anguish and triumph.You can't wait to get your hands on next DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Code Geass Part 1 limited Edition","review":"Perfect for those who truley love the rolor coaster of emotions that is Code Geass.

I figured that those were atypical results because we had purchased a Creative Zen Neeon for our son last year and had had nothing but success with it.Unfortunately, we had the same bad result. Our 12-year-old daughter, expecting an IPOD, opened this on Christmas morning. When told about all the features (the radio was definitely a plus, in addition to the photo capabilities, etc.), she was thrilled. Well, she was able to get about 5 hours of listening in before charging and after that, NOTHING!! One day after Christmas, the Zen Plus went COMPLETELY DEAD. I tried rebooting with the tip of a pin, as one of the reviews suggested, but to no avail. We returned the item to Amazon and will be buying an IPOD.

It went from working fine to not working without any dropping or other abuse. The display froze up and multiple resettings would not help.

Our daughter was not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but the software doesn't","review":"The product documentation does not mention anything about Windows Vista. I installed the software from the CD and it sort of worked but would not recognize the player when plugged into the USB port. Some googling got me to Creative's web site but it wasn't clear there either. Eventually I found a support forum that said not to install the software. They want you to use the built-in Windows Media Player. The Windows software works fine but I wasted a few hours finding that out.The player itself has worked well and I think it is a good value for the price. I've only had it a month so I can't comment on reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen bettter than Nano and cheaper","review":"Even the 12-year-old (who has a Nano)was jealous. It's smaller-therefore cooler! It comes with a necklace length strap. It's able to download music off any music site - (Nano is only compatible with iTunes.) It has FM radio, and an organizer/contacts feature. You can record (via the included \\"line-in\\" wire) right off your CD player - no computer needed to record. The video is easy to load and very easily viewed. The menus are easy even for my older relatives to use! The earbuds are of good quality, but don't fit my ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never buy a Creative MP3 ZEN again","review":"As I emailed Creative, the product should work out of the box. The one I got had a battery that could not be charged. The other thing I noted was that it came with a large amount of memory resident proprietary software. This means that you can only synch the Zen on a machine that has the creative software installed. I sent the whole thing back and feel fortunate that Amazon issued a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the Best MP3 Value","review":"I could not be more pleased with this purchase. It is packed with features, easy to use, has a terrific sound and a great feel in the hand. The only negative, that prevented a 5 Star Rating, is the random play. I had read on a previous review that the randomization was below par. Well, it certainly is. It is disappointing but I am so pleased with everything about this unit that it is easily overlooked. I purchased mine at $119 for the 2GB. This compares with $149 for the 2GB I-pod and most other name brand 2GB units. This is a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...WHEN IT ACTUALLY WORKS...TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!","review":"Purchased this on March 27, 2007. Stopped working in July, 2007. The little reset button on the side was unresponsive. Plugging it into the computer didn't do anything either. With all troubleshooting options exhausted, called customer support. Turns out there's only a 90 day full warranty. If I wanted someone to help me it would cost $12.95 for the call. I could send it in and if they can fix it, they'll charge an additional $25.00 for the labor. Why would I want the same defective one patched up and sent back to me just for it to break on me again?I also have a SanDisk Sansa m250. It also stopped working, but at least with them, the tech call was free and they sent me a brand new one...no hassel AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!!!Stay away from CREATIVE ZEN...they are a company full of EXTRA CHARGES."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lemon","review":"We bought two of these.

It was tested by the hearing organization...so you can adjust volume to 18/25 and its scientifically safe to not damage your hearing...Cons====1. Bad video compression (files get larger than original when transferring, like ten times bigger than a common mpg file)2. Creative media source doesn't sync mp3/wma tag changes (you have to actually delete the file from the mp3 player)3. Voice recording wont be understandable if you want to record a class or something (you have to be very close to the person who talks)4. When recording with line-in theres a back noise in the resulting recording... (I'm not really sure about this)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than an IPOD","review":"This is the second Creative MP3 player I've purchased (the first was a Creative Zen Micro Photo), and I'm very impressed. It's small enough to fit easily into my pocket, but the color screen is still quite easy to read. Both of my Creative players require me to reset them once in awhile, but it's easy to do and therefore only a minor nuisance. What really makes these players better than an Ipod (which was the first MP3 player I bought) is the ability to copy/paste music to and from the player just like you could with a thumb-drive. I don't have to use Itunes, I don't have to work hard to get my music off of my player, I can simply copy and paste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good unit, but has a design flaw","review":"I have one of these as well as a 1 GB unit. They both perform well, as expected - I use them to make Old Time Radio programs more portable.However, both units showed the same problem. After a few months of service, the plastic cover that goes over the 5-way navigation button splits in half. The pieces may fall out, or stay inside jamming the nav button. It lasts long enough to outlast the 90-day free service, so it then costs $25 to send it back for repair (they actually send you a new one).Based on this, I wouldn't buy another one. They have just released a 16GB unit at about $250 but the design is the same - so BEWARE, the nav button wil break in about 4 months or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This thing claims to be 2 GB, but it's not. It's 1.7 GB. Then you find out that all standard movie files have to be \\"converted\\" to work on the player. The \\"conversion\\" process takes a very long time. After that's finally done, you discover that your 166 MB movie file is suddenly 618 MB--almost half your space! None of this is mentioned in the product's false advertising, but I'm here to let you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music Device","review":"I love this tiny little mp3 player. It came with a chord, so I can hang it around my neck when I go walking or exercise. (My niece's did not, so I had to put it in my pocket or carry it in an awkward pouch.) The battery life is very good.My only problem is that I can't get the video I purchased to download to the program. I've tried to find help, but I came up empty handed. This could be the fault of the device or maybe my own. I'm usually pretty good with electronics though. (BTW, if someone knows how to get a WMV video to upload, I'd love to know too.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom line: Buy the Sony Walkman.","review":"After initial set up this thing just did not cut the mustard.

For my money the Walkman is a better buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd one I've had","review":"My 1st Zen somehow got fried when I charged it after 2 years of excellent service, so I bought a second.

It didn't work right from the time we took it out of the box. As soon as we installed the software and plug in the MP# player, the computer wouldn't recognize it. It would freeze up and then the next day after charging, it wouldn't power on at all.I read a LOT of reviews before purchasing it and was very excited about the product, but when it came time to replace it and stayed away from the Creative Zen. I just don't have time for trouble. If I had all the time in the world I would purchase another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than iPod!","review":"This is the third Zen we've bought for family members and I'll be purchasing one more in the next day or two. We started off with iPods, but soon discovered the difficulties they have with loading music onto them. I hate iTunes and iPod requires it. The Zen products are MUCH easier to load and use.

The player has frozen several times (corrupted file?) and the battery gives up after 6 or 7 hours, then takes at least that long to \\"fully\\" charge again. Very disappointed with the overall performance of this player -- bought specifically because it supports DRM e-audiobook files downloaded from the local library. I intend to return it and try something else -- from another company besides Creative Technologies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - Display issues (check creative website)","review":"I have owned my creative Zen V for less than four months and the display stopped working. When I checked out Creative's website, there were a slough of customer comments indicating that they had the same problem and decided to either throw the player away or wait months for repair. Two additional problems: Creative Zen V's only carry a 3 month warranty on labor. The 12 month is for the parts only and does not cover the labor involved in repairing/replacing/shipping the item. Creative customer support does not exist (for the most part). You are able to use telephone support for a very short while without cost. After that, the only means of communicating with Creative is via e-mail. Moreover, if you lose the original book that came with the player, you can no longer access the customer service telephone number (check their website and try to find a number to call).

This one and the Mathematical Thinking book. Prof. West is not very competent in writing textbooks. He gives incomplete explanations of the very basic terms. His path to explain simple things to hard things is usually very random with completely random thoughts and observations in the middle of explanations (sometimes this creates a problem because you cannot always see \\"them\\" as a beginner). His explanations and proofs lack one thing that mathematics always preaches: parsimony, clarity, and elegance. Even his colleagues at UIUC criticizes the way he writes textbooks. If you are new to graph theory and if you buy this book, you'll definitely need to check definitions and explanations from either another textbook or from the Internet. He makes a mess out of the subject matter he is trying to introduce.

This is particularly so given its presenting the full uncut musical text of the opera (apparently all the other recordings, with the possible exception of the Sawallisch, have the same 6-7 cuts that are usually made with staged performances); in any case, the performances (particularly those of Solti and the Wiener Philharmoniker, as well as of Nilsson and Krause - what power!!!) make this recording an absolute must in any serious classical music collection - especially with any Straussians!

My daughter is sort of a small eater and the bag is just the right size for her, and it's also just the right size for me and my husband- we can grab one and eat the entire thing without feeling like we need to skip a meal in exchange.

The first thing you notice, right from the Overture, is the scintillating quality of the sound recording as well as the lush playing of the Vienna Philharmonic.The singers are almost all at the top of their form. I particularly like the ditty \\"In Mohrenland gefangen war\\" which Heinz Zednik imbued with great romantic longing, as well as the prison duet, rendered with heaving passion by Gosta Winbergh and Edita Gruberova. And, needless to say, Gruberova's \\"Marten aller Arten\\" is simply thrilling, as are the Janissaries' choruses.The only weak spot, in my opinion, is Martti Talvela's terribly imprecise singing as Osmin. His \\"Ha, wie will ich triumphieren\\" is a real letdown. The Osmin in Eugen Jochum's recording is my reference here.

Imagine if the Allman Brothers got angry instead of reflective and replaced all their departed members with those of Black Sabbath circa 1978. Not to say that Cable doesn't make this sound their own, where some maybe tempted to call this \\"Stoner Rock\\", truth be told, there needs to be a new genre, \\"Cable Rock!\\" But if you love bands from Man's Ruin, or Tee Pee, who tend to walk down the same path, you'll be more than happy with this gem.

I love it!The best thing for my daughter is that this bouncer sits up farther than many I have seen. It has three different positions, which is great if she goes to sleep in it, I can just recline her back.The toys are also great. She loves the teether and the rattle on it. The only modifications I have added as she has gotten older is a few more rings to the toys so she can get them in her mouth.I haven't ever used the music and vibrations with the seat, because my daughter hates the feel of the vibrations.So buy this bouncer before investing in others that can run upwards of $50!

If you want you can hear some of Seuss's creations singing the ABC song which helped my daughter remember how the alphabet went. I prefer this version of ABC because Seuss certainly does not use ordinary words or animals.

But it's still amazing that a band can play such an elaborate work live.It's sad that Yes can no longer compose music on that level. The new material is too primitive. I reject their modal style of songwriting that began with the album \\"90125\\".The orchestration doesn't matter because the compositions are so mundane. If you can't tell the difference between this and \\"Days Of Future Passed\\", I envy you.I liked the \\"Open Your Eyes\\" CD, and I hoped that it meant Yes was back on track. This new album is an embarrassment, as was \\"The Ladder\\".

Yes is one of my favorite bands, and I heartily defend even the Rabin era against naysayers. Every album from 1969 through ABWH is at least very fine. But even though they are respecting the old material in concert and can still play it well, there is no more songwriting talent.

If you like Close to the Edge or Tormato...or even Union, don't buy this [stuff]. I've tried to listen to it so many times and I alway end up hitting the stop button on the CD player. It's like Yes music in the elevator played by a fluff band directed by Lawerence Welk. Welk's stuff would be better. It's like politically correct music with no direction, no substance and no soul.

This time, though, they record with a small orchestra - and the effect is rather beautiful, if not particularly original.But then again, what's \\"not particularly original\\" for Yes would be \\"ground-breaking\\" for just about any other band. All in all, this is a pretty good effort, and slightly over an hour's worth of pretty solid Yes music. Not as outstanding or as surprisingly upbeat-rockin' as \\"Ladder,\\" their previous album, but not even remotely as dismal as \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" the one before that.Most surprising moment: Electric guitar in \\"Don't Go\\" very reminiscent of Lindsey Buckingham in Fleetwood Mac's \\"Gypsy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"ASTOUNDING! their best in 25 years","review":"I admit when I heard YES was working on a new cd without keyboards I had serious thoughts of maybe the lack of success from THE LADDER had caused Jon,Steve,Chris,and Alan to lose their minds.But in fact MAGNIFICATION is so good you honestly dont even miss the keys.The orchestrations are terrific and dramatic.MAG is easily song for song their best album since GOING FOR THE ONE.GIVE LOVE EACH DAY,WE AGREE,and IN THE PRESENCE OF are some YES's best songs ever,with DREAMTIME right with them.Chris Squire shows he is still one of the best bass players in the universe.Chris also steps up to the mike in MAG with lead vocals on the great track CAN YOU IMAGINE,which sounds like a FISH OUT OF WATER tune.SPIRIT OF SURVIVAL is an awesome,dramatic song filled great orchestrations.The albums closing track TIME IS TIME is absolutely gorgeous.I should have know better than to doubt those guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Listen and Already Pleased","review":"I just got finished my first listen and I'm very happy. We Agree is a very strong piece as is the title track, Magnification. Spirit of Survival, with it's prominent use of the orchestra, could almost be a James Bond theme. Give Love Each Day is an airy, uplifting piece with a lot of group harmony.The two longer pieces, Dreamtime and In The Pressence Of, both over 10 minutes long, will need repeated playings for me to really absorb their full impact..Overall, I'm very pleased and I know I'll be even more pleased as time goes by. The playing by all four members is as sharp as ever. There is no keyboard player on this release. However, the wonderul use of the orchestra is an interesting alternative. Any YES fan should like this CD, whether a long timer or a more recent fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable...","review":"Over the last couple of decades, every time I've picked up a Yes album, I had to play it 5 times to start getting into the tunes, and a good 10 times before I started to enjoy the album. This album is no exception. I've had the CD for more than 6 months now, and it is still the one CD I play far more often than other CDs. With the incorporation of a full orchestra, the music is more complex than their last few efforts, but also makes it more compelling to listen to the album over and over again. I give it 4 stars because the lyrics aren't as good as past efforts.Not being a fan of most 90s and 00s music, this is definitely a breath of fresh air with roots back in the 70s and 80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and elequent","review":"This is a excellent and very moving album to say the least. I almost broke into tears upon hearing the song: Give Love Each Day. This is one of the very finest pieces of music Ive heard from anyone in a long time. The album is full of fine pieces of love and light. Listening to Yes awakens my spirtual side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnified Disappointment","review":"Let me begin with a disclaimer. I have been a fan of Yes since the early 70s. That being said, this could possibly be the worst album they have ever released. The vocals are fabulous - Chris Squire has never sounded better, and Jon Anderson is still Jon Anderson. The music, however, lacks direction and focus. Steve Howe's guitar parts are sparing and essentially lost in the mix. The orchestra doesn't help this group at all. What is lacking from the \\"Yessound\\" is a talented keyboard player. There are certainly nuggets of gold to be found in this mess (Give Love Each Day is my favorite), but it is not worth sorting through the rest of the plodding arrangements to get to them. Lyrically, these guys also need to separate themselves from the Barney-like \\"I love you, you love me..\\" material. This is a major disappointment from a band that is certainly old enough to know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES at their absolute Best!!!!!","review":"The entire disc is fabulous, and the orchestral arrangements are amazing! It's not straight-up rock like, say, \\"Fragile,\\" and not as ethereal and mystical as \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" or \\"Close To The Egde,\\" but some of the songs there, all backed by a great orchestra, are the most beautiful I've ever head.In fact, two songs in particular, \\"Give Love Each Day\\" and \\"In the Presence Of,\\" are two of the most gorgeous, moving songs ever written . . . . ever! The harmonies and melodies just make me melt.I love this band, and 33 years after they formed, they are still on top of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars... for the orchestra","review":"I wonder if those claiming that this CD is the best thing since Relayer have snot in their ears. The whole CD (with few exceptions) is in 4/4! There are no mid song key changes and most of the melodies revolve around a few close notes, often only one. Without the orchestra this would be bland pop, not progressive innovation. If they were to have put this out in the 70's they would have been laughed at by bands like \\"The Enid\\" who did the orchestral rock thing much better.Yes lost it a long time ago. 90125, while not progressive either, was at least better pop, with guts and impact. Magnification represents the wimpification of a band that once had sharpened teeth and real emotional depth. Listen to The Gates of Delerium and tell me otherwise. Yes had power and grace. Now they have grown old and gone soft, as have the fans of this CD. I wouldnt be suprised if they recuited John Tesh as their new keyboardist. The orchestra gets two stars, Yes gets zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the post Trevor Rabin era","review":"I'd call Close to the Edge the high point for the early era, and 90125 the high point for the Trevor Rabin era. This is not as good as either of those, but it's better than the stuff Yes has done recently. I couldn't tolerate Open Your Eyes or Keys to Ascension, and found The Ladder lukewarm, but I actually listen to this and find myself humming the melodies in odd moments.Chris Squire gets some more attention this time around, and that helps. I found some of the melodies reminiscent of various Yes phases - not rehashed, just similar in tone.The lyrics are a bit cheesy, and the orchestra gives a different overall tone that some may not like, but on balance, I rate it a good effort. Worth buying if you like classic Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes","review":"This is a very nice lp by Yes. Way better than OYE and several steps above the Ladder. The \\"Keys\\" lps were decent enough but Mag is much better. I've heard every proper recorded song from Yes since their inception. Not a real big fan of 90125 thru Union. Talk was ok, but I don't listen to it much any longer. OYE had two alright songs, Universal Garden and The Solution. The Ladder had one good one; Homeworld, and bits/pieces of other tunes are very good. I asolutely hate \\"Lightning Strikes\\" and all the poppy stuff on OYE and Ladder. But on Magnification, after about 5 listens now, I can tell you only \\"Don't Go\\" is pop (...), but the rest of the lp really shines for the most part. Some very moving melodies and changing atmospheres. Sometimes the Orchestra leaves me a bit flat, but 80% of the time it is done very well. It's only a 4 star rating considering this and also the poor tune \\"don't go\\".

They used false advertising. It said Shooter as the genre. YOU DONT EVEN AIM OR SHOOT THE GUN. You tell the 8 soldiers you control to shoot the bad guys but they cant even aim good and they dont shoot unless you tell them to. Even if they are going to die they dont shoot. You cant even walk around you tell the soldiers where to go. Also on the box it says its based on a army training thing. I thought it would be a action packed shooter because thats what it looked like on the box, but I was wrong.

They will work great with your computer, or any other audio device with an 1/8th inch stereo plug. They produce respectable sound, and a fair amount of bass.

Imho, they never sounded more than just okay. The volume, presence and clarity simply didn't make for a pleasant listening experience. I see other reviewers are happy with theirs, so maybe I got a lemon, but the main issue is that they recently seem to have shorted out. There is some sound, but it sounds as if I'm listening to a 1950's transistor radio from across the room. These were used sparingly, about 10 times in a 3 year period, and never abused or mishandled.

I was satisfied with the frequency response and the overall accuracy of these headphones in producing sound, although I still encourage anyone who uses these to check their work on monitors as well. These headphones were comfortable for me to wear, which was a big deal because other monitoring headphones (Sennheisers, particularly) give me headaches with extended wear.

I do not mean that they do not produce over powering bass; as a comparison that typical people will understand, they produce bass somewhat comparable to a late 90s laptop speaker, even at high volume.The high range had a slight hiss, which was also distracting.After listening to them for around fifteen minutes or so, I repackaged them and sent them back to the seller. To be honest, this was the only item I have ever returned from online shopping.

These surpass the originals in many ways - bass is full, not at all muddy, crisp highs, clear mids, good stereo image.

From the beginning I didn't enjoy this. The way it was shot turned me off right from the start. The storyline wasn't much better. I had never heard of this movie but I'll buy movies I come across if they sound like they are worthwhile. This wasn't. The Bill Paxton angle was good.

It's also nice to see Orlando Bloom in a film other than a period piece and playing a character that's not necessarily a good guy all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashkenazy at his worst.","review":"Listening to this performance is not unlike drinking diluted wine. You get the basic idea of what you are supposed to be hearing but everything is slow, the piano sounds harsh, and the melodies are played weakly. Just compare Askenazy's performance of the first movements cadenza to Rachmaninoff's own recording. Rachmaninoff is exiting, and he takes off toward the end like a rocket. When the flute comes in it is magical. Askenazy on the other hand plays slowly, and feebly. The base octaves near the end of the cadenza hardly sound. However, because of the slow speed it is easier to hear some details that might not be noticed at a faster speed. The only real highlight of this recording is the exellent sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive, wonderful, BUT...","review":"Neesa Hart writes sensitively about people who have lost their loved ones and finding love again.

In between bouts of guilt she's betraying the memory of her late husband. Perfectly understandable but after there is only so much yoyo emotional trip I can take without feeling depressed myself.

As soon as our drinks (mine cranberry juice, his Diet Coke) were served, he told me that my cranberry juice was orange juice. I would put my hand on a bible and swear that it was! It tasted like fresh squeezed OJ. Within seconds he brought out memories of the names of my K-6 grade teachers and later, during the flight, he placed a quarter on my tray table and told me that it was so heavy I could not pick it up.

Now, after visiting Amazon.com, I found out that I wasn't the only one with this problem. Then I realized that the title of the album wasn't \\"All Mixed up,\\" but it was \\"The Whole Shebang.\\" I do NOT suggest buying the \\"all mixed up\\" because all it is is really weird versions of the songs from the original albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I listened to this cd in a music store earlier today and I was completely disappointed. I have the original Whole Shebang cd, which I listened to nonstop for the longest time. I couldn't stand to listen to the first 30 seconds of this one. So I decided to flip through the tracks to see if I could find one song I liked. Didn't happen. All's they did to change the songs was to add special effects, which made it sound space-age-like. And unlike the first cd, which had a good beat to each of the songs, this one was lacking. It would be impossible to sing along or even tap your foot along with this music. I think this cd was just an attempt to make money without having to come up with anything new. Very disappointed, ladies.

After popping it into my CD player I was extremely upset after realizing that what was coming out of my stereo was [not very good], and not even close to the music I had hoped to hear. I listened to all of my favorite songs just to make sure I wasn't imagining things, but to my dismay the CD was a sheer disappointment.

They've taken a good album, taken its songs, and put them in a blender. The result is many of the original songs with music that doesn't suit their basic theme - the upbeat \\"Before Me and You\\" is not far more dark and played in a minor key, same with \\"Dancing With Angels\\". \\"A Night To Remember\\" isn't gritty or grisly anymore, \\"Punishment\\" is too hokey and twangy to be believable. Then there are the songs that are almost indistinguishable from the original. \\"I will...But\\" is an interesting remix. For the most part, it sounds as if the vocal track was simply lifted from the original song and played to different music. The lyrics and melodies don't really fit in the new remixes, many sounding as if the original album is being covered by a Seattle garage/grunge band, others with a certain \\"No Doubt\\" sound to them...All in all, the remixes need to be rethought."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest CD Ever","review":"The girls of SHeDAISY hit right on with this one.

Kudos to Charles Dutoit for using real cannons (unlike some cheap and watered-down recordings) but thumbs-down for the synthesizer.(Oh, and by the way, Gene Ormandy does a better Capriccio Italien, but I have not heard a better 1812 despite the above complaint, or a better Marche Slav, than on this CD.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"NT Intro by Guthrie","review":"Great treatment.

The result is an uneasy feeling that it will topple over, especially if something were to knock against it. Compounding the problem are the feet of the tripod which make very poor contact with the ground, thus adding to its instability. The verticle control that allows for the camcorders altitude to be adjusted is jerky thus resulting in shaky recordings.

In this film, which you can tell he didn't take seriously because he barely acts, the only thing he adds is a little atmosphere. The story is also ridiculously unrealistic: the lone wolf setting out for revenge against a bunch of greasy, really bad Mexicans. He dreams of starting a ranch, has an extended family he loves, meets a (stunningly beautiful) abused woman (by the baddies, and yes, he saves her and maybe falls for her).

It looks pretty good, and is cheap, which makes it available to common people, but it really isn't worth the money. The Manual doesn't even tell the length of the saw blade so you can find a replacement. Something for post-industrial age third-world America. Junk!

But the rest of the album is just like every other rap song out there...uninspired. From an artistic standpoint, there are so many rappers with loads of more creativity than Snoop is showing now (take Aceyalone for example). Not only do his lyrics seem to be forced, but the music itself is annoyingly repetitive.All in all, this album is a waste of money...it would be better to buy the 3 or 4 good songs from itunes.

He definately comes off more loose than some of his other efforts and why not when you've become a household name. I really am not a R Kelly fan but \\"Thats Thats\\" is a super smooth track and just works. I also like that he brought on Dogg Pound & MC Eiht too.

Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't even take these for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot instros zig-zag from blues to jazz to country swing","review":"While Buck Owens, Merle Haggard and Dwight Yoakam have the most famous names, California's been the adopted home of innovative country artists since the dustbowl drove Okies west. From the honky-tonks of Bakersfield, to the guitar pyrotechnics of Speedy West and Joe Maphis, to the vibrant swing scene of 1940s Los Angeles, California often led Nashville with new instrumentation, musical composites and lyrical ideas. Though far from definitive - it's only 3 CDs, after all - this set provides a superb introduction to the many facets of West Coast country.Volume 2 collects instrumentals from guitarists Jimmy Bryant, Merle Travis, James Burton, and others. The players zig-zag from country to blues to swing to jazz, from steel to acoustic to electric to 12-string, stacking one virtuoso performance on top of another. Roy Clark and Glen Campbell demonstrate the instrumental prowess that would soon be eclipsed by TV fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid magellan products, buy Garmin","review":"I have owned two Magellan GPS units, one for my car and one for my boat.

Even with a supposed Warranty, dealing with them is a nightmare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"My first one of these, purchased Nov. 2006, malfunctioned almost immediately, sending me in U-turns and getting me lost when it suddenly shut off while navigating.My replacement was a brand new one sent by Magellan in Dec. 2006. It worked well for a short period of time before getting stuck in gps tracking and then giving me the wrong names of roads I was travelling.I've tried in vain to get a refund (spent over 2 hours calling Magellan and being disconnected when I asked to speak with someone to get my money back). I've spoken to 6 different customer service reps, all who promised I'd get a call back from one of their constantly-too-busy-for-me supervisors. You guessed it----no calls back!I'm stuck with this lousy GPS and Magellan has no interest in helping me. Stay AWAY FROM MAGELLAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ugly Zen Book","review":"This book consists of the beautiful and profound Genjokoan essay by Dogen Zenji, which takes up about ten pages in nice calligraphy. Then there is a vapid commentary on it by Rev. Maezumi, who is not up to the task. This is accompanied by pages and pages of amateurish, muddy, and thoroughly dated photographs (from the 70's) of puddles, pieces of grass, cement walls, various broken stuff, etc. Be grateful this book is out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"songs of love & love lost","review":"This is a wonderful recording, so poetic, and full of lyrical melody. Jamie, who used to be half of \\"The O'Kanes\\", a great duo back in the late '80's, has a gentle, expressive voice, with a vibrato I find enchanting...and as a songwriter he's terrific.All the songs have an \\"obsessive love and desire\\" theme running though them...\\"I Surrender\\" and \\"Pretend\\" are perhaps my favorites, but there isn't a single moment on this CD that I don't find pleasing. Emmylou Harris lends her vocal talents to tracks # 4 and # 12, and the various musicians on it are all excellent.Total time is 48:50, and the booklet insert is perfectly designed to match this CD. A simplicity in the layout, readable lyrics, 5 photos of Jamie (such casual elegance...such perfect bone structure !), it's a quality package for a quality CD. Smooth and lovely from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description misleading","review":"This was advertised as a 5 piece set - what actually arrived was a two piece set. It was for a gift so I did not have time to get it corrected and had to settle for what was shipped. Either the product was wrong or the description was wrong. Please fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping Rates","review":"An appealing tire, but once I calculated in the shipping rates it was a lot more expensive than it appeared and I sourced it locally for less. Don't be deceived, the per shipment and per pound charges are reasonable, but the tire is officially \\"5 pounds,\\" making the shipping $8 for two tires instead of the $4 you might think, and it goes up by $2.50 per tire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting for a health food bar...","review":"I typically get the brownie crunch flavor, but happened to grab one of these white chocolate chip bars by accident. It was a good accident. These are really good. I actually think I like them better than the brownie crunch. I usually don't like anything white chocolate because it's overly sweet, but this isn't. I typically buy my bars at whole foods, but they are quite expensive. I may start buying them on amazon. Only downside is that you can't pick and choose what you'd like in a box on amazon.The Good:The ingredients seem pretty good as well. Nothing screams to me as a scary lab created chemical. It's got a good amount of fiber, lots of protein and no added sugar or fake sugar (a big pet peeve of mine). It tastes very good in comparison to some other \\"healthy protein bars\\" out there that taste like chalk and smell like feet.The Bad:It does have more calories and carbs than I would like to see in this size bar. 240 calories & a whopping 27 grams of carbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent tasting low-carb bar with good nutritional profile","review":"I'm a big fan of nutrition bars as a convenient snack or meal substitute in a pinch and this bar is delicious! This was my first thinkThin bar and I found it interesting for a few reasons. The bar is enrobed by a thin layer of what looks like white chocolate. The bar itself is chewy, soft and possesses a cake-like texture which I enjoyed. It had the right amount of sweetness for me and the flavor profile is quite simple and straightforward; nothing spicy or tricky. The only thing I disliked about the bar was the slightly synthetic-tasting white chocolate flavor, but it was not so terrible that I wouldn't eat it again. I would definitely be interested in trying out the other flavors when I get a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love White Chocolate, but hate the after tast....FREE SAMPLE","review":"I am a white chocolate lover.

I save about $5.00 per box as compared to buying them at the store.I have to admit the first bar I had tasted slightly chemically... I think it must be the vitamin B I'm tasting?? But now they are absolutely delicious and I crave these bars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hungry, but stopping not an option?","review":"Take the edge off that hunger and avoid being ravenous when you can get to a stopping point to take a healthy meal. This product comes in many tasty flavors.

I do not use as a meal substitute. It has a real feel of a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Might look tasty but lacks even a touch of white chocolate flavor.

Also from now til 12-31-10 thinkthin has a coupon you can use (print alot of copies ;)) for 50 cents off a single purchase. AND NO SUGAR!!!!

Thanks think thin!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"I got a box of these yesterday, and at first I thought they were actually spoiled. After I re-read the reviews, I realized that they are just that bad. I usually try to throw in a positive, but I just cannot think of one. If they tasted good and the carbs were not nearly as high (24g per bar) I would be happy to pay the money, but for how bad they taste and how they really aren't very low-carb diet friendly, 1 star. Really, though, I wish they would have stated the carb count on the ad."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful bars! an unpleasant attempt!","review":"i received the package early tonight and it was finely packed. despite that, these bars taste awful!

If you're just looking for something yummy, this may not be your favorite. But if you're looking for zero sugar, it's almost impossible to find, and when you do find it, it usually tastes bad. In fact, there are some chocolate or chocolate/peanut butter versions of this same product, and I HATE them. Gross. But the white chocolate tastes great. Caveat: They are 230 calories per bar, which is too many calories for me, so I cut them in half and keep each half in a ziploc bag in my cupboard for a quick grab when I'm running out the door. Then we're down to only 215 calories, but still filling. I love this bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found these really tasteless","review":"This product sounded great.

Theses are the worst tasting protein bars I've ever tasted in my life. At least other brands try to make their bar taste alright, thinkthin basically said nope, not even going to try.

Plus, they are affordable and offer a great amount of protein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible taste","review":"I noticed that some people said that eating one was enough, but that's probably because of the taste. I've tried two other flavors of it before, one was chocolate, and I never liked them at all. I don't understand why some people say that it tastes like a candy bar, it looks really pretty, but then when you actually it bite into, it's terrible, b/c it's all mushy inside. Maybe buy one to try it, but don't buy in bulk unless you're sure you like it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the actual film soundtrack","review":"I have been looking for the soundtrack to Calamity Jane for years and was so excited to find this one. But I was so disappointed that it's not actually the film's soundtrack. \\"Deadwood Stage\\" sounds like it was recorded straight from the movie, but it is missing an entire portion in the middle of the song. My favorite songs \\"Windy City\\", \\"Black Hills of Dakota\\", and \\"Woman's Touch\\" are all studio re-recordings by Doris -- not the actual versions from the film. \\"Windy City\\" includes lyrics not used at all in the movie. \\"Black Hill\\" and \\"Touch\\" don't include her duet partners. Doris didn't even sing \\"It's Harry I'm Plannin' to Marry\\" in the film at all, yet, here she is singing it.What a waste and disappointment. I could have saved money and just recorded them myself straight off my DVD of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music (not exactly straight from the movie)","review":"This is a good soundtrack, with plenty of music from Calamity Jane and from other Doris Day films (Romance on the High Seas, Young Man With a Horn, My Dream is Yours).

As a person presently enslaved by 3 parrots, way too many cats, and a surprisingly tolerant boxer, I am pretty sure that Bob Tarte must have been hiding in my closet; so many of the tales he tells ring way too true to my experiences! Hilarious, poignant, accessible, insightful and validating to those of us who turn our lives and homes over to the furred, finned, feathered and such. And let it serve as a cautionary tale to those who might be tipping toward life on the other side of normal - there's still time to save yourself (and your house!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"enslaved by this book","review":"I found this book very lack luster and hard to get into.

I was expecting so much more after reading the reviews. Where they claim it was hilarious, I barely broke out in a slight grin. I had a hard time liking the characters in the story (the author himself?). I think the author's choice of words was poor in parts and he tried too hard to be funny. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Funny!","review":"This book is truly for those of us who have had animals take over their lives. I read this book shortly after I started getting chickens and I just about died from laughter over the (ahem) similarities. He writes in a very self-depreciating manner and while I could've shouted \\"idiot!\\" at the book, instead, I just laughed. If you've ever had a menagerie, this will seem a bit too uncomfortably familiar. (Only perhaps, you might be more sensible).Tarte is a clever writer and puts so many little pieces of humor in there that might be lost on those who are unobservant.Warning: I loaned my copy to a friend some months ago and haven't seen it since.

Writing with a combination of animal lust and human neurosis, of tragedy and triumph, Tarte takes us deep into the animal kingdom, where we learn the truth about the \\"Raccoon Code\\" -- and how to build a swimming pool for a duck. Tarte loves his animals and will do anything for them, even as he painfully and humorously laments his lot. This book is indispensable to childless adults who dote on their pets. They will understand this book like no other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Way to Spend a Few Summer Days","review":"I grabbed this off the shelf of my local independent bookstore, and was surprised to see the author lived in my state. Then I was even more shocked when I realized the author lived in my dad's hometown a short ways from my house! I was thrilled to be able to read the book and recognize all the landmarks and place settings. It was really refreshing.I loved the author's writing style, it is very inclusive. The reader automatically feels as if s/he is a member of the family. He was able to accurately portray the love that most pet owners feel for their pets - even when they are at first reluctant owners! It is a book well worth reading and passing on to others to enjoy (if you can bare to part with it!)I guess the moral of the story is: sometimes enslavement can be a pleasant experience if all your hard labor is in the passionate pursuit of your pet's affection. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely for animal lovers!","review":"I loved this book even though I've never experienced ducks, geese, turkeys, etc as pets. The stories about some of the Tarte's animals really left me awed that there are people who go to such lengths to care for their animals.

I've read it many times and it never fails to make me laugh out loud. Bob is so hysterical! It's not just a book about pets. It's a book about a family-2 adults that consider pets their children. And they'll put up with almost anything. Isn't that what happens to us as parents? We love them no matter what. And so do Bob and Linda. It doesn't hurt that Bob is very generous in sharing with us some very personal experiences that just endear us all to him even more. Linda is great as the calm force in his life.

The stories of the complicated relationships between the writer and his animal \\"friends\\" made turning the pages easy, and left us wanting more. Its honest and humorous portrayal of the adjustments in the authors home and in the care of all the animals due to the many personalities and temperments is rare and heart warming. Reading about the calm and the chaos, the love and the laughter touched us in a very special way. We really enjoyed reading about the connection between man and beast, and some of the spotlights on animal intelligence may make you re-think that animal friend of yours.

Not really.","review":"So many reviewers gushed praise over this book. Saying that anyone who loved animals would love it. Well...I love animals and I found it deeply troubling. A person who loves animals, wants them to be cared for by competent stewards which the author is definitely not. The author and his girlfriend purchase wild captured birds. This may have been legal at one time, but it was never a favored practice among those who care about animals. The author accounts his lack of knowledge about caring for animals. This is not funny. It is sad. The animals certainly deserve better than that. Readers deserve better than this.

I read the James Herriot books for the first time when I was 9 years old and they were frequent re-reads as I was growing up. We always had animals around when I was growing up: dogs, cats, rabbits, horses. But this book Enslaved By Ducks is just plain boring. I finally put it down about halfway through--- I couldn't make it any farther. The animals aren't sympathetic. The narrative isn't fun to read. And anybody who lets rabbits run around inside their house... is asking for it. Asking for their cables to be chewed and chair legs to be gnawed and never mind the \\"m n m's\\" all over the place!! So why is it surprising (never mind \\"funny\\") when that's what happens? I just don't get this. No stories in this book (as far as I read, anyway) are more than mildly amusing. If you haven't read All Creatures Great and Small and its sequels, go for those instead. Those stories are nothing short of wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring . . . .","review":"I agree with others who found this book boring. I didn't even make it a quarter through the book before I decided I'd had enough! It's very seldom I don't finish a book. I used to think that if I started a book, I must finish it.

I quickly figured out why it had been recommended as I too am enslaved to my pets (no birds...but plenty of cats, rabbits, fish and there have even been rats). This book is a wonderful account of Bob Tarte's life with animals, including ducks, birds and rabbits. As a fellow slave to many pets, I could completely relate to his story. I especially enjoy his quirky sense of humor and his honest accounts of dealing with depression and anxiety. I liked the variety of humorous and endearing animal stories peppered in with real life issues (i.e. ailing parents, etc.) Bob is a humble, talented writer and I would recommend ALL of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humourous take on the daily aspects of having pets","review":"Tarte writes beautifully on how pets have crept into his life since his marriage to an animal lover. Almost everyone can put themselves into either Bob's or his wives shoes. I am not one to laugh at loud that often at books, movies, etc. so I was surprised to hear myself chuckle outloud along with my smile.The book reads quite fast. However, while I enjoyed the book until the end, I felt it getting a little old. It is pretty much one story after another about all of his pets. I still wouldn't have put it down for a minute but it started to lose steam from the first chapter to the end. With that said, any pet lover would enjoy at least the first few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"ESBD review","review":"This book is a wonderful read if your an animal lover!

Fits long wheelbase, 3rd generation, Chrysler minivans. That's the GRAND Caravan, GRAND Voyager and T&C. How do I know it works? I don't. All I know is it doesn't not work. Changed it out at 168,000 miles, and the old one seemed just fine. Turned out to be a fuel pump problem. Just think it's silly to have to buy this monstrosity because the engineers decided to permanently attach 3 feet of plastic fuel line to the canister. Oh, and you have to lower the fuel tank to change it. You only need an additional 1/2 to 3/4 inch of clearance to disconnect the lines, but to get that you have to lower the tank. Another engineering masterpiece. But that's not Amazon's fault. Thank Chrysler. Amazon is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"10-year-old software incompatible with Windows XP","review":"This software was published in 1998, written for Windows 3.1.

It's a complete waste of money. Even though the DVD version was released in October of 2004 (don't be fooled by the picture on the box), the material on this DVD is at least 10 years old and really outdated. This yoga DVD must have also been done on a really low budget since it looks like it was recorded in someone's apartment.

It almost seems as if the DVD was switched! First, it is very poor quality and appears to have been filmed in the instuctor's home. Second, the instructor is obviously not pregnant and does not seem to tailor the exercises in any way toward pregant women. The video seems like it was probably filmed in the 80's (the outfits are a great indicator!) and no effort was made to make it look even slightly professionally produced.

This was following a dx of IC and no relief from prescriptions, bladder instillations, and diet modification. Definitely worth purchasing on amazon- more tabs, less $, quick shipping. I take 2 at bedtime and before any questionable stuff ( sweetener, coffee, tomato based stuff). I would say the biggest difference for me is decreased trips to urinate at night (now down to 2 from 4 or 5) plus I don't feel I have to run. I also no longer have dreams where I had to pee, so I'm guessing my bladder is feeling better! Next time I get a uti I plan to take them right away to see if they help prevent a flare.

Both the singer (Pears) and the horn here (Barry Tuckwell) here take incredible risks and as a result it has an urgency and immediacy that drags you deep into the experience of it; the Nocturne and the Elegy are particularly hair-raising. If you haven't heard it before, do yourself a favor and listen. It is one of the finest classical recordings of all time. The lyrics are worth reading, too, since the poems that Britten put to music are truly beautiful and dark, including William Blake's famous Sick Rose:O Rose, thou art sick!The invisible worm,That flies in the nightIn the howling storm,Has found out thy bedOf crimson joy:And his dark secret loveDoes thy life destroy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Some Answers","review":"After four months of a relationship that was getting more confusing every day, I read this book.

He writes the book from a very honest standpoint, clearly shown when he talks about Joshua's chess tournaments. I totally agree with Fred about how Bobby Fischer has changed the chess world. Fred was interested in chess, so his son became interested in chess. Just as my father did, in the 1972 match between Fischer and Spassky, he became interested in the game, and I am now, I'm just not a chess prodigy like Josh!

I Puritani is probably the most difficult tenor role in all of opera, sung almost entirely in the upper register. But Pavarotti's portrayal of Arturo makes this set worth owning. There is a single highlight, Pavarotti's F-sharp above High C in \\"Credeasi Misera\\" that for a moment recalls the days of the castrati and is a passage you'll play over and over again. An almost impossible note for a man to hit, yet Pavarotti delivers it with force. Remarkable. Not to be overlooked is Dame Joan Sutherland's depiction of Elvira. Awesome in its beauty and richness. This I Puritani is an absolute treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"This is a fine recording, which Amazon says it will deliver free. At the ludicrous price it's asking, it should hand-deliver it to your doorstep. Either there's a mistake in the pricing, or Amazon got taken by a distributor. In either case, one should look elsewhere; the CD is available from other domestic vendors for at least $20 less, and from UK sources for even less. As far as the recording itself, I prefer Sutherland in her earlier recording, but the tenor (Duval) there is pretty bad - though I don't think Pavarotti is all that much better. The sound of course is much better on this effort. Four stars for the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sutherland at her mature best!","review":"This is one of the greatest recordings of Bellini's masterpiece featuring Joan Sutherland not only as a most brilliant singer but also as a mature performer.

A year ago the D-Link wireless router stopped functioning, replaced it with a Cisco wireless router which works great. That combination worked great for about 9 months. Now my internet connection is constantly dropping off and I'm suspecting the cable modem as the root cause. It has been a major pain because we have Vonage phone service.

The story revolves around Macy, a teenage girl who is struggling to help support her impoverished family. She meets an 18 year old boy named James who becomes her first love. When Macy's family suddenly moves away, she loses contact with James. They never have a chance to say goodbye.What if, 30 years later, these two found each other again? Would lightening strike twice? Would he forgive her for running off without a word?I liked this book. It is a touching, bitter-sweet love story - one that will especially appeal to Christian readers. I'm looking forward to the author's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if . . .?","review":"Having read Linda Horton's first novel, \\"Time & Again\\" I was impressed by the depth of the characters, clarity of the message, and ease of the story's flow. The dialogue was tight and rang true. The story was easy to read and held my attention to the end.As a young teenager, Macy Hays showed strength and gumption. She was challenged by poverty, a dysfunctional family, and a lack of nurturing. She fought to become a successful, mature woman.Something was still lacking. An old love was re-discovered only to be lost. But the life messages left her stronger and more resilient.I would recommend this novel to women who have had to work for a living; single parents; men who came of age in the 60s; and people who have wondered, \\"What if . . .\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant Story","review":"Linda Horton gives us a poignant story of a young girl's search for love. It's painful for the reader to experience Macy's many disappointments. Often Linda's characters are cruel to our young heroine and we are thrilled when Macy's world begins to brighten.

Were these guys swattin' flies on staff paper, or what? The typography and layout are crowded and harder to read than the clean, uncluttered pages of the 3rd edition. Also, I've been told part of the rush was to incorporate more information on reading lead sheets, women composers, and more 20th century techniques.

Although the information is not presented optimally, it's all there, and you can still learn a great deal from this text (especially if you have a teacher to call upon for clarifications). Each section of every chapter provides a set of exercises, but the authors don't offer many ideas for creative applications, and they don't even feel the need to explain the importance of the information they're presenting or tell you how to use the material to make yourself a better musician.

This recording of 'The Planets' stands out for its precision, its beauty of orchestral sound, and its sheer celestial sparkle.

I don't remember how old I was or how long it took me, but I remember just loving the setting, the adventure, the mystery, the problem-solving. I still think about it literally every time someone mentions Istanbul. I may ask for this game for Christmas, even though I'm now 20. I'd like to replay it, it was GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madeline fans will love it.","review":"I bought this recently for memories' sake. I played this game as a child with my siblings over a decade ago. It was endless fun back then and when I played it again as an adult, I was surprised by how short the game actually was. It didn't seem so back then. I was a little concerned that it wouldn't work on newer Windows OSs, but it worked on my XP system and my sister's Vista system just fine.Parents of kids that are Madeline fans should definitely get this game, although I'm not too sure how the uber tech-savvy kids nowadays would react to this.I managed to get a good price for this product, and it is worth much more than what I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Are Decieving","review":"This captures the moment of sexual awakening in 3 French girls without any creepy or exploitative bent.

Though the performances are very good and the girls lovely and very appealing, the plot is clearly contrived to degrade men, especially very young boys. They are incapable of love or intimate communication, only want sex and always hurt the girls they persue, both physcially and emotionally. The message is clearly stated -- the only true love is lesbian love. Still it's a well made watchable movie. So how to rate it. I gave it two stars instead of one because it was enjoyable despite is obvious malicious intent.

BOTH sides of the issues which Christians are divided over are explained. Not only are the issues explained fairly, but Erwin Lutzer brings in the giants to defend each position; no straw men here. The Martin Luther-vs-Erasmus section over Free Will is really good. Another thing which I like is that the author lets you know his positions on the issues. This allows the reader to decide if he is being fair to the other view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on doctrines of different churches","review":"I think that this book was well written and I learned a lot about different churches doctrine.

The other reviewers favor the straight-ahead rock anthems on this CD; I prefer the ballads, which do a better job of showcasing Barton's distinctive talents: warm, expressive singing (and playing) and (most of all) lyrics that are smart without being smart-ass, witty without being precious. He has the true songwriter's gift of taking everyday patterns of speech and giving them a fresh new twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight review","review":"David Barton mixes intelligent lyrics and catchy hooks with a balanced combination of acoustic and electric instruments. An artist in the fine tradition of the singer/song writer, Barton is observant and his lyrics paint realistic pictures of the world around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Heart in Heavy Rotation","review":"David Barton's debut CD Straight hits the listener hard and fast with the the \\"Leveling Wind\\" the CD's first cut. From there, the music's a lot of hit and a little miss.Some of the songs are quite personal and thus too cryptic to follow; like a poem for a loved one that no one else would get. Powerful, but...What shines through, and make the CD so very strong is Barton's songwriting ability. The depth and clarity of his lyrics and emotion in the music makes it quite clear that he wants you to know him, and know him well. In an age of plastic performers, and rock stars, listening to Straight gives you just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"wistful.","review":"A good band with a lead singer capable of leading you elsewhere.

I'd recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine performances of a fine work","review":"The Devil's Wall is Smetana's last completed opera. The plot is rather complicated, so suffice to say it is a comic-romantic drama with, despite some rather dull and workmanlike passages, several interesting and beautiful parts - especially those given to the Lord of Rosenberg as sung, wonderfully, by Vaclav Bednar.In fact, most of the roles are filled by very able singers - Milada Subrtova is fine as Hedvika and both Libuse Domaninska and Ivo Zidek deliver well-sung roles as well. I am less sure about Antonin Votava, but that may be in part because his role of Michalek contains less striking music. Chalabala's conducting is good as always, and despite being almost 50 years old, the sound is very good - far better than, say, on the later Brandenburgers in Bohemia set under Tichy.All in all this is a very recommendable recording of what is perhaps not Smetana's best opera, but a very worthwhile one nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and brittle","review":"Thin hard plastic cracked while installing.

I was disappointed with the Wii controls, they aren't as responsive or precise as the PS2 version. The Wii version forsakes a bit in the graphics department, as well.To someone who hasn't played both, you'll enjoy either version.

I've played some great games--all the Resident Evils, Onimushas, and all but FF III, XI and XII--I'll take care of FFIII when it comes out in November.

It's amazing visually and emotionally. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okami for PS2","review":"Okami is a really fun game, especially if you enjoy puzzles.

The story is very fleshed-out and well-written. The graphics are beautiful and unique. Game controls are *very* intuative, easy to learn, and well-coded. I just love this game and cannot get enough of it! I've been trying to finish every possible thing in it just because I don't want it to end! Really, a must-have.

I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphics aren't the only draw to this beautiful game...","review":"Remember that cell-shading style from Legend of Zelda: Windwaker. Okami dishes out a similar, yet even more unique art style. The art and backgrounds are breathtaking. Once you're done taking in the surroundings, you'll notice that Okami provides gameplay to match. Wrap all that up with a compelling folktale storline and you've got quite an amazing game. This could just be one of the last few games worth buying for the Playstation 2 platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Beautiful, Enchanting","review":"Those are just some words that describe this wonderful game.

If you ever need to chill out, pop this baby in.As I played this game I was so reminded of Zelda: WindWaker and the game has many elements similar to Zelda. So, this game too is as fun, if not more fun than a Zelda game.The characters are cute and there is humor in the storyline which will have you chuckling. As you restore the dark and dreary land, flowers bloom, rivers flow, and the music becomes inspiring....you'll get chills.The controls are perfect and the Celstial Brush is so easy to use.

That fact alone is what made me stop playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and artistic","review":"I got this game for my little brothers as a Christmas gift. It was highly praised by critcs i.e.,IGN, and surely it did not disappoint. Okami portrays a terrific story based on Japanese myth and lore. Okami is quite simple, yet exceptionally fun. My brothers love it and can't put it down, and at times even I find it hard to. Okami is an incredibly artistic game, truly one of a kind, and easily one of the best games in the PS2's great library. More than worht it's asking price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This game is phenomenal in every aspect. The graphics are amazing with the characteristics of a comic book. The storyline in its own is entertaining and keeps you interested in the game.

Otherwise, the graphics are beautiful, the music is good, & there's lots to do so the game isn't going to be a short one. But there aren't enough save points in the game, the voices can start to bother you(especially when you have to keep doing a part repetitively because the brush won't work for you & if they have a long part you can't skip it)& the brush is very picky, but when you can't use it you do miss it. I'm sure once I finish it, that it'll be played over & over again though. It is very enjoyable even though certain parts of it have made me curse at it. I'm only 50 hours into it, so I'm sure there''s more cursing to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous game!","review":"Everything about this game rocks!!!

I got it when it first came out and grew up mostly with it. I have A LOT of PS2 games, lemme say that. I just bought this recently thinking it might be fun. Let me tell you, this is one of the best games. No, I don't mean on the PS2; I mean ever. I always go for the games with the highest ratings from IGN, Gamespot, Xplay, yatta, yatta, yatta. But this is something else entirely. This is less of a game and more of an experience. It's one of those games that make you glad you ever became a gamer.If you own a PS2--or Wii for that matter--don't waste your money on Deus Ex: Human Revolution or Resistance 3, or any of those just because they're new.

Okami is a fun and weird game that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game!","review":"I don't normally write reviews at all, but i made an exception for this one. If your debating on whether to try this game or not...Stop debating and buy it! The animation is very pleasant to the eye. The storyline is realy interesting because it seems to involve alot of true Japanese mythology, not that silly anime stuff. This game doesn't realy seem to mimic any games out there right now. It has that same adventurous feel that Zelda has to it though, which definately isn't a bad thing. Well, enough from me, just give it a try you won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, closest thing to Zelda on PS2","review":"This is an incredible game. I bought it based on on the reviews from EGM as well as the fact the fact that I enjoyed the Viewtiful Joe games that Clover had made. Okami is a wonderfully paced adventure game with graphics that will blow you away. The gameplay is intuitive and creative in ways that you have never seen before. It's amazing that Okami didn't sell well in the U.S., and I assume it was because people thought it might look too Japanese and that folklore it was based around would not be interesting. Don't let yourself be pushed away, you will not be disappointed! I have beaten Zelda: Twilight Princess on Wii and can say that I have enjoyed Okami just as much as I did Zelda. If you have a PS2 then you should have this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I really enjoyed this game. My only complaint is the long sequences of dialogue and cutscenes.

Key board player, David Maxwell, shines on the cut \\"WORRY WORRY,\\" not to mention TOMMY CASTRO'S BLISTERING GUITAR WORK ON 2 OTHER CUTS. If you like your blues with a rock edge, check out Cathy's \\"Let Me Be Good.\\" My favorite cut is the delta styled slow blues \\"Dark Road\\"--sounds biographical.

Psychology and the Occult is along the same lines as Synchronicity - it is the rare exploration of supernatural phenomenon by a professional psychiatrist. I found this book to be really intriguing - although be warned - it is a bit difficult and may take some time to get through, even though it is a relatively short book at under 160 pages of content. The author's professional discipline when approaching the subject, and open-mindedness is interesting. His assessment of events seems fair and he really delves into some strange occurrences. I would have given this book a perfect score if it was presented in a more approachable manner - although it is still very much worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, wish it were more applicable","review":"I loved this book! Read very easily, but packed with info. It brought up situations I hadn't even thought of, like vaccinating your kids. There were a few things I didn't like. For instance, when Erin gives advice on whether or not to support your daughter's girl scouts troop by buying cookies, she seems to think it's okay to buy them, as long as you give them to a charity. For most of us, being vegan isn't just not eating animal products, it's economics: denying our money to the industries. A lot of her advice isn't applicable at all to the majority of Americans who live in small towns. There are no vegan or even vegetarian-friendly restaurants in most of America, and the very small cities which were near (an hour away) my hometown didn't even have a health food store.Overall, though, very good book. I'm glad she breaks down possible options for dealing with each age group, especially teenagers, when it comes to being vegan. Love the recipes, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"What an excellent CD! His best ever. I was captivated from the very beginning with the opening bars of \\"Shady Grove\\". Ricky and his band absolutely smoke on this cut and it sets the tone of great musicianship for the entire album. The band switches gears from smoking on \\"Shady Grove\\" to an Irish feel on the fabulous \\"Road to Spencer\\". And the thought provoking lyrics to \\"Half Way Home Cafe\\" really cut like a knife.This CD will be one that you play over and over and is proof that even though Ricky \\"went country\\" for a number of years he did not forget how to do it. Helping his cause is the fact, that unlike many bluegrass artists, he has the money and commands the fees that allow him to hire some of the best young pickers in the business as well as being able to afford ample studio time. This can't hurt, but the final product is what counts. And this album has that great artistry and feeling that can't be bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great bluegrass and a little filler","review":"Another solid offering from Ricky and the boys. As usual, several cuts (Shady Grove, The Old Home, Road to Spencer, and Mother's Only Sleeping) are pure gold and worth the price of the CD. Some of the more \\"contemporary\\" cuts (e.g. Halfway Home Cafe) were a little too pop for my tastes, but I think Ricky's just trying to add a little variety to the mix and I appreciate that. All in all this is another outstanding CD by one of the world's greatest bluegrass bands and you should absolutely buy it if you have any interest in this type of music. Saw Ricky last summer in Austin and he and Kentucky Thunder just tore the place up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some hot pickin' going on here","review":"Holy cow, these guys are good.

Not so on this album...there's not a cull in the bunch. The musicians in this band are such that even if you don't like bluegrass, after listening to these boys pick, you will at the very least have to admire their musicianship. I happen to play myself, and I'm pretty much a traditionalist, but there's enough of hard-drivin', down-home 'grass on this one to please anyone.

I even took the car seat to the fire station to have them help me recline it more....Still my child's head would go completely foward whenever he would fall asleep in it. I don't know if mine was defected but I could not stand it... I went and got the chicco car seat and I see a huge difference. My 3 month old is more comfortable and secure without his head going completely forward.

The information is presented in a simple way that is neither too flowery nor too sparse. Divided into 6 sections, one for each cinematographer, then sub-divided for each film that is discussed. The language is not excessively technical, so a beginner should be able to understand. It is not bland for the seasoned professional though, since a lot of the techniques presented are very non-conventional. Some of the films covered are quite different than what you will find in your typical issue of American Cinematographer, whose films seem to have a limitless budget. Especially in the early part of their careers, these cinematographers, found innovation, imagination, and hard work would go a lot further toward the overrall success of the film than just a budget can allow.

A must-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generation ME Review","review":"After reading the back cover, I really looked forward to this book. When I got about half way through the book, I was very disappointed.I was required to read this book for an English Rhetoric class earlier this year. I read the book in about a day and in the end, realized, I just wasted a few hours of my life. The vast majority of this book is common sense. You don't need to write a book talking about how \\"Generation Me\\" (current generation) is more independent than the Baby Boomer Generation or that College is becoming more competitive for the current generation than the past one. If \\"Generation Me\\" was half the length and more compressed I would have rated this book higher. But it is not, and because of that I rated the book a one because the information is common sense and dragged out.Twenge's book \\"Generation Me\\" is an awful book that is well marketed. I could but only hope you do not take the time to read this poorly written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, someone is pointing it out!","review":"This is a very timely book! It's a must read for anyone working with people between the ages of 15-30. Dr. Twenge does a great job pointing out some of the personality \\"pitfalls\\" this generation is burden with as a result of the last couple decades of American cultural values and influences. She illustrates these factors founded on research yet brings them to life with cultural examples. She's not bashing this generation; she's showing us this generation as a product of the times and walks this line well. I'm smack dab in the middle of GenMe and from personal experience and interaction with a wide number of people in this age cohort, I'd say she's dead on with most of her assertions. This is a great book to stir up a fervent dialogue between parents, educators, coaches, mentors, clergy, and GenMe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Jean Twenge Hits The Mark!","review":"Finally a book that explains what I am seeing in the classroom and church every day. As a mother and a youth pastor I am thrilled to have the data and insight that Ms. Twenge has put together in her book.I used an excerpt in a sermon I preached on Sunday and I have recommended the book to several parents and co-workers. It is full of information and research that hits todays youth right on the mark! Ms. Twenges language and humor add warmth and delight to the pages. It is not only educational and helpful, but fun and easy to read.Well Done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a great read... if you're a liberal feminist","review":"I just finished this book for college and it makes me question if i choose the right university. In this book she praises tolerance, 'equality' and women's independence while insulting this generation's need for self-esteem and independence... so let me get this right, it's a good thing if a woman is independent, masculine, and doesn't get married till her late 20's but at the same time since people aren't getting married as early in life people get lonely and depressed, but there is no link between the two. No to mention the author praises a girl who 'lost her faith and gained hope in humanity' because of the church's views on homosexuals. as if losing your faith is a good thing since it was for a 'good' cause...i have never been so mad at a book before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generation self-centered and unstructured","review":"Initially I was excited by this book. As an anthropologist, the many differences between generations are a subject that never fails to fascinate. Unfortunately, while the author tosses out great statistics indicating fair research, she couches it all in an \`I, me, my, mine' framework. This focuses the book not so much on a generation that may differ from those who came before but on the author herself, her education, her college years, and her friends. The overall impression is an unstructured book justifying why they themselves are having trouble with the joys and trials of living life.If the reader is looking for another whining confused confessional please continue. If you are looking for a book that may lend insight in to why the under 30 crowd do what they do then I would recommend that you read elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Me Generation","review":"I thought this book was very insightful. I am part of this generation, and it was eye-opening and explains a lot of the inconsiderate rudeness I experience on a daily basis. This book was especially helpful, being a teacher, to understand from where many of the parents I now deal with are coming. There is a lot of finger pointing from many parents when their child has negative consequences at school for their behavior or work habits. I think all educators should read this book and rethink the focus on the \\"self-esteem--you're special just because you breathe\\" practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generation Whine","review":"I was initially intrigued by the premise of this book, but after 150 pages I finally put it down. I have never heard anyone whine so much about how hard things are for their generation (get a clue, lady! My ancestors lived in tenements and before that in thatch huts with dirt floors and regular pogroms -- when exactly did you think life was easy?). On top of that, the author is confused about her own arguments. For instance, she argues, rightfully, against silly self-esteem building exercises and over-praising students, but confuses that with the idea that a person is unique and has self-worth regardless of what they do or accomplish. Similarly, she confuses narcism with the notion that such people have too much self-esteem, when in reality, such people clearly have very little self-esteem. Her snarky tone does not help her argument."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"I find myself quoting this book to people and recommending it to just about everyone.

Dr. Twenge not only is a relentless practioner of the \\"why limit to two pages what you can redundantly pad into 20?\\" school of writing, but she lamentably forces her GenX credentials by supporting her insights with attempts at world-weary humor that tries to scream out \\"duh!\\"The overview of Boomers in chapter one is old hat -- only it's supposed to be about GenMe. Maybe she got her dates wrong? And then chapter two promises to show us how GenMe is different from the Boomers, but the profile of the former is really just an outline of what the latter matured into. Dr. Twenge doesn't seem to realize that much of what she portrays here is what happened to the USA as a whole from the '70s on, not a phenomenon that defines a single generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent understanding of today's young generation","review":"Excellent job explaining why the younger generation, and especially college students, are the way they are.Phillip WhiteSan Diego State University"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of references with a lot of skeptism","review":"I've done my own share of research on the millenials/GenY and I get that there are many points of view.

It's a gripping account of a generation and a fascinating comparison to the preceding generations. It's also terrifically engaging and funny. My favorite section was the research on self-esteem. We all assume that building someone's self-esteem should be a priority, but Jean Twenge shows that that can have some serious negative effects. She reveals that self-esteem does not appear to protect against societal ills like alcoholism or teenage pregnancy, and it doesn't appear lead to higher grades (rather, high grades bolster self-esteem). Her section on unrealistic expectations is also valuable. Telling children they can be anything they want to be is not realistic. Jean's suggestions to parents and educators about these important issues are thoughtful, sensitive, and provocative. The book is filled with humor, interesting anecdotes, and, most importantly, high quality research. I recommend this book very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Depressing and Inaccurate","review":"The way the author looks at the younger generation is utterly depressing and inaccurate.

I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not stepping in exactly the right spot...If you're looking for a decent second pad, spend a few bucks more and try out the Konami Wireless Pad for about $20 (when I bought this pad it was around $10). The difference in quality between the Konami pad that came with the game and the pad on this page is definitely worth a few bucks.One more thing: The \\"non-slip\\" on carpet is a joke.

The two main characters, Stephen Weber and Craig Bierko basically lack the requisite angst filled, anxiety ridden neuroses that we've become accustomed too.

This leads to them both breaking with their girlfriends, a feud between them, and sudden financial irresponsibility on the part of Richie...oh what a clever name too!The plot is predictable and the jokes and bits are on the stale side.

I'd say World of Glass is worth having, so buy it if you like this band, but expect a different Tristania than what you're used to.

Narratively impressive, it deals with the effect of making bad choices and the degree of which one needs to reach to be set free. Between freshly drawn characters and action-packed suspense, Hautala tells a tale of love, responsibility and forgiveness, forgiveness of others, but more importantly of oneself. Adding to the mix a drop of an unearthly apparition and a full-cup of one nasty nasty villain, and you got one exciting read that will surely please seekers of high tension everywhere.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it no stars if I could","review":"One of the worst books I've ever read.

The advice is at times completely biased and untruthful (assuming, for example, that girls who are fat must be selfish) to destructive and sexist (if your teenage girl jumps up from her seat, have her repeat the behavior and stand up more gracefully).

The Lovely 2 CU, You never know, Number 1 and White horse mixes are excellent! And Strict Machine is simply the best. I thought this was going to be the same as the Live CD's edition, but only some parts of this mix were used to extend the original version in their live shows, also it's catchy and, well, is everywhere today!Putting all together, We Are Glitter is the Best Remixes CD I've ever heard!

She was an early walker and once she learned to walk she didn't want anything to do with it. Also note, it needs to be used in a doorway that has a frame. Many of the larger doorways and openings in our home have no molding, so it had to be put up on a smaller, framed door.

The model purchased was the 8740/8750 with the straps (not holes). After struggling to slide the seat straps into the tray part as directed, we tested the seat, hooked the jumper to the door frame as directed, then placed my 18lb son in for a little fun. After 5-10 minutes of swaying, he crashed to the ground, hitting his head on the door frame on his way down. All seven straps were dislodged and he was left on the floor still in the seat. We should have guessed that if you push a strap through, even if it has tabs that are designed to hold it from comming out, the plastic can become bent and the straps may not hold as designed. It is a aweful design. The Johnny Jump-up (by Osk-Kosh B'gosh) is a much safer design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the big babys?","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 3 months she loved it!!!!! but the thing is she had grown out of it by 5 months cause she was so long. and the hight ajustment does take up enough slack for her to jump anymore. so if you have a larger then normal baby this is not the toy for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom of two in Oregon","review":"Unfortunately my son hated this Bumper Jumper. Every time we put him in it he would cry. He didn't seem to have enough control; the product moves A LOT when the baby isn't specifically jumping in it. He LOVED the Evenflo MegaSaucer. I would recommend that product over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is heaven sent!!!","review":"My 4 month old son LOVES to stand, but my arms get so tired after awhile. He now hates all of his toys like his bouncer and swing because he does not want to sit down. I read about this on the website and read all of its great review. I was not sure if he was old enough yet but when I read that 3 month old kids could use it and loved it I knew I had to get it. My son has the BEST time in this jumper. He will stay in it up to an hour and has a ball. I love how easy it is to put up and take down and the tray is awesome. My son is teething so the slobber is never ending but I don't have to wory about it getting on the carpet because the tray catches all of it.

The maximum weight is 25lb, but kids start to slow down growth around now, so he'll probably get some good use out of it for a few months. He LOVES this jumper. He's loves to bounce (quite high!) and also turn and look around from one room to the other. He's teething right now so this toy takes his mind off it for a while...!The jumper is well constructed and the clamp for the door frame is pretty sturdy. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAZARD FOR BABY","review":"I thought that this jumper would be safe, but it is not. I work at a daycare center where it is used almost everyday, until today when it broke with a child in it. One minute he was jumping, the next screaming because he had fallen to the floor. It seems that the straps attached to the 3 plastic clamps on the top broke off. Luckily he was OK, just a little scared. We called GRACO and they were surprised that it broke. I would suggest looking at other models if you are looking to purchase this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS THING ROCKS!","review":"We got one of these yesterday and it was the best thing we've gotten for our baby yet! I am the mother of a 5 month old and she has been standing (with assistance) for the last 3 months whenever she gets the chance. Now she can finally do it on her own and that newfound freedom excites her beyond belief! Within minutes she was bouncing and squealing with delight. She stayed in there for an hour the first time in it. My husband and I couldn't stop watching her because we were just enthralled with her reactions and energy. The bumpers are a great idea and the only jumper I found with them. They should be a requirement because of babies limited co-ordination. The tray is also a brilliant idea so we can put her toys right in front of her so she has her options of what to do. She even jumps and plays with her toys at the same time. I can't say enough good things about this jumper. I would recomend it to anyone with a baby!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for everyone!!","review":"My son started using this when he was about 5 months old and it's been total fun for him and everyone else. On the little handles I put plastic rings etc to add more amusement. It really helps build the legs muscles. If you do not have a frame around your door I would recommend reading the instructions to see if you can use this because I have noticed that when my son jumps back then forward the \\"grabber\\" thing does move up and down above the door. Other then that it's a wonderful piece and I love the fact that it has a tray surrounded in rubber to protect him from hitting the frame walls and protect the walls from the tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite every time","review":"I have had this jumper since my now 3 and a half year old daughter was born and used it for my now one and a half year old daughter as well too...Both girls absolutely loved it...It is very safe and durable and they got hours of enjoyment with it each day...This is definitely worth the buy! I still have mine because I am thinking about having another child...Anyhow, you will not go wrong with this item..It is worth every penny it costs which is the same I spent over 3 years ago on mine...You won't regret it...Its a good way to make a child sleepy too.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one out there!","review":"This was the second jumper I tried out with our son. The first offered no support, much unlike the Bumper Jumper. The support this jumper offers is great, the bumpers on the sides have been a great asset -- between scuff marks or other small children, the bumpers have saved us a lot of heartache! -- and the ease of adjusting the height is marvelous.

I like the jumper, and put my baby in it for the first time today, but was really disappointed. The jumper is fine, but I wish they had thought of extra ways to secure the part that clamps your wall. I can tell the thing is going to damage the wall once he starts getting really active. Also, the strap is so long, that even when you make the jumper as high as it will go, it's still not high enough for when he gets heavier. He's only 14 pounds now, and the thightening buckle is almost at the bottom. He won't be in this for long. A shame..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is way to long for me to even use","review":"My son could use this for only 1 month. By the time he could hold his head up well enough for this, which he was very early at just a couple months being very strong, no more bobble head. Maybe it's my doorways that aren't tall enough, or the cord is too long and I can't shorten it any more. I think this product was a waste. If your doorways are the typical around 6.5, 7', I wouldn't waste my time, unless you have somewhere else besides the doorway to hang this.Sorry, it's just my opinion, but I wish I could take it back and get something that my son will actually use."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT","review":"My son is almost 7 months old.

I recommend this 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING DOORWAY JUMPER!","review":"I origionally had the Partytime Jumper by Graco. I decided to go ahead and purchase this one. It was one of the best things I did. The tray has a bumper all the way around so it saves on doorway scuffs. It also has little rings that you can attach toys to to entertain. I put my daughter in it at 4 mos (w/a blanket wrapped around for support because she is really small for her age). She was very unsure at first. I tried the next day and she still was not too thrilled. I waited two weeks and now she loves it almost more than me! She is at the level of her kitten and puppy and she loves to interact with them as they go by. The downsides are that it is a little hard to pull her out when she wiggles and I wish the back was a little taller to prevent her head from getting bonked when she throws herself around.

Our home is from 1917 & the moulding above the doors is 6\\" high & 2.5\\" wide (on each side), and the clamp cannot open wide enough to fit over the top of the frame. The description says fits doorframes FROM .5 inches, so I thought we'd be safe as no maximum was specified. The clamp should be redesigned to open about 2\\" wider. If we could use this jumper, I'm sure the baby would love it...so if your home has \\"normal\\" doorframes, go ahead & order it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby product I've bought","review":"This thing is better than the Graco baby gym which I love. This products keeps my son occupied. He loves jumping and jumping. I had another jumper but it was difficult to get the baby in and out. This jumper also has a handy tray for toys, and it can be easily moved. But the best part is you can adjust the height while the baby is in the bouncer. I would recommend this product over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing CD","review":"Morena is a musical masterpiece.

I love the way each chapter begins with perspectives and advice focused on enhancing and growing positive relationships with all concerned. The combination of suggestions and advice, quick tips and activities, as well as wonderful suggestions for staying in touch if you are geographically separate, is so helpful. I'm glad that the nuances and complexities of situations are addressed in such a positive, nurturing way. This book can be a handbook for grandparent, parent and child relationships in many ways. The extensive resource list in the back is excellent as well.

The reviews certainly made me think that there would be a wealth of information in this book to do so. Alas, I was greatly disappointed. Although, it did offer a few ideas that I could try & a few I could build on, I felt this book was mainly a game & craft oriented book geared toward little ones. It didn't offer much in the way of connecting with tweeners & teenagers. I also must admit that I found a majority of the games & craft ideas to be pretty cheesy too.In summary, I was vastly disappointed with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One of the best books, I have read in a very long time.

Since I'm part Indian myself,Cloyd's(weird name)story appealed to me. Hobbs helped me understand his feelings,his rough life in foster homes,and his temper flare-ups. Cloyd's identification with the powerful bear can inspire other alienated kids to cope with problems this way.

Archos tech support claimed a 3-month battery warranty although their web site says one year- we'll see what happens when I send it in. Otherwise, it's a great product. Maybe other replacement batteries provide an air gap to prevent the squashed HDD problem, but Archos is still cranking out this same old type. I'm just going to buy more THIN batteries since my 1-yr warranty has almost expired.Well, I just got my new replacement battery after a 2-wk turnaround- it works, and it's not swollen.

I am ready the next time they come around, can't wait to hear their new and remixed material onstage. I love Soul Boat, very smooth, very liberating. Spill the Wine-I'll take that pearl!

The album is at best insignificant. Before I continue, i must say that I truly hope that Guru returns to concious hip-hop and lyrics that actually mean something...Guru, that's what I respect you for!On this album Guru's art and style degenerated into the type of disposable music common today. The lyrics are tired. Substance has been replaced by numerous expletives... and emptiness. The beats are monotonous and melodies are barely present. I got an impression that Guru is abandoning everything he once was (hopefully just musically) to gain mainstream following and more importantly make some money.I took the CD out of my CD player with great bitterness. I could not believe this was Guru. Just hope that Guru that we know would one day be back."},{"rating":"2","title":"leadin the underground","review":"Yet another hot underground LP from Mr. Guru.

It did work in our 2005 Chevy Tahoe (the vehicle we drove on the 2,500 mile trip) until you started driving down the road then it continually turned off. It wasn't a contact problem because it would start again when you pulled it out and put it back in. It would not restart until it was pulled out, wiggling around didn't work. It is totally useless to me and I would return it, however, my return time limit expired while I was on my extended trip and now I can't return it.

The device broadcasts really well, and clarity isn't typically a problem. I was also pleased with how quickly it powers up upon ignition.On longer drives, interference with other radio stations may distort the signal somewhat, but this can be remedied by changing the broadcast frequency to a clean channel. I also had the device shake loose from the cigarette lighter socket on one occasion, and it had to be pushed back in.I use this in an old model car with a cassette deck, and I am impressed with the sound quality provided by this unit in comparison to cassette-based adapters. I don't think the durability problems I've encountered with cassette-based adapters also seem not to be an issue with the unit, either, although long-term use will be necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iriver AFT 100","review":"This product worked great in my driveway.

Problem is, its idea of \\"no sound\\" and yours are likely to be quite different: if you're listening to something that's merely soft, or you have the volume turned down low, it interprets this as no sound, and shuts off with an extremely annoying, ear-splitting whine of interference. This happened to me over and over again, every 30 seconds, until I figured out what was causing it to shut off. On an iPod, the only way to avoid this is to make sure the volume on the iPod (not your car radio) is always at least 75% of the maximum, which can be difficult to maintain. Be warned: this is an extremely annoying flaw, and it indicates that the makers/designers didn't test the product well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical Design Flaw","review":"The transmission quality of this transmitter is excellent, but before you spend $45 of your hard-earned cash, you need to know this unit has a critical design flaw in the internal insulation of the stereo transmitter wire that will pretty much guarantee you only get about 6 months of problem-free use and about 9 months absolute life-time before it shorts out or you lose a channel of audio. The internal insulation of the wire is entirely too brittle, which means that the cable will very quickly break down under normal use far before the unit actually 'wears out'. Engineered obsolescence? Possibly...a more durable and pliable insulator coating could certainly have been used for pennies more in manufacturing costs.iRiver's warranty is pathetic at 90 days, so I'm not sure what recourse most users have other than to complain and not purchase this product.

The AFT 100 does store the frequencies in memory, but only as long as the device stays powered on. Once I power off the device, the AFT 100 loses all of my presets and then all three buttons default to 88.1 FM. The designer of the device also made a poor choice in placing the frequency selector at the base of the device. You need to reach down to the area of your cigarette adaptor and a press small, unresponsive button to change the frequency. If you move the device slightly, then the device powers off, and you're back at 88.1. The device comes lose from the cigarette adaptor with greater ease than it is to change frequencies. This device is sub-par, and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter better...","review":"Short: The Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter offered better quality sound and the design is superior...I purchased two FM Tuners at the same time since they both had good reviews and I *really* wanted one to work on a long road trip. The first was this iRiver one the second was the \\"Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter.\\"We wound up using the Belkin exclusively. The sound quality was much higher and the fact that it was on a long cable meant we could put it on the dash right next to the antenna to increase both the volume and quality yet further still.They both plug into the car's power supply, but this one is far larger blocking a drinks-cup holder too.So I would recommend the Belkin one over this iRiver tuner, but that being said you can do far worse than this one (as the Griffin iPod specific one I had before was yet worse still).They both only support a very limited frequency range however (less than our car's stereo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"After using a similar battey powered device to listen to my MP3 music in car, I started hating life because the batteries would die at inopportune times. This device saves that hassle. It plugs into your accessory jack or cigarette lighter for power. It is adjustable incrementally even though radio frequencies jump 2 digits, this jumps one digit at a time. Maybe outside of the US station frequencies are different. The iRiver has been flawless and never fails to hook a signal so I can play on.I recommend it highly.\\"Ellis\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This thing is terrible...I attached it to my Zen Vision 30GB and the sounds keeps cutting out and there is tons of static no matter what station I was on. I went ahead and got a new stereo in my car with an AV jack, and hooked my XM radio and the MP3 player straight to it.....it is worth the 100-200 dollars if you don;t have an AV jack..don't waste your timr with this transmitter if you want real sound"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited range...again.","review":"My radio antenna is located on the rear of the car. I assume this is the reason why there is so much static. However, the stated broadcast range should have covered the distance, hence the low rating. The cheaper Belden transmitter I wanted to replace actually worked better than the iRiver. At least I could wave it around the car until the signal came in; the iRiver's cigarette lighter location cannot be changed. For those of you with the same problem, our best solution is to go down to the car stereo shop and either get a system with an aux input or have them modify your existing radio to accept a cable connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can 500+ reviewers like this piece of junk?","review":"Extremely poor reception. Tried in friend's car and also was horrible. However, a different brand my friend purchased at Radio Shack works fantastic (fraction of the cost). With so many good reviews I thought mine must be a lemon, but then I read reviews from others that had exchanged theirs and experienced same problem. Get this, here is my bad, I trusted iriver brand so I tossed the box, receipt, etc...consumer naiveté and brand trust I guess! Anyway, now I hold a worthless piece of junk and to make matters worse am left baffled by taking guidance from overwhelming positive reviews? Could primary distributors pushing a huge inventory of high margin pieces of junk hire folks to flood positive reviews?! ;-) Yikes, I trully hope there is no truth to that!

I at times would set it to Y-100 and I could hear my music clear over this very standard and popular radio station. Never had any problems with static of squealing. And then, it broke. I pulled it out of my cigarette lighter, same as always, and pieces flew everywhere. I tried to collect all the pieces and put it back together, but it didn't work :'(So I give this product 4 stars, I wish I could give 3 1/2. Because it worked REALLY well when it worked but died way too easily. Right now I have another one, DIO (I believe that's what it is) and it just doesn't work nearly as well, didn't start playing without static until someone broke off my antenna, but it's proven to be more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me.","review":"I have owned three of these FM transmitters for my MP3 player.

The sound quality is reasonably good for a transmitter. The 3 frequency presets are very useful during longer trips. When you pass areas with different radio stations these could interfere with your \\"private program\\", so this feature provides you with the option to quickly change to a different frequency.The only reason why I just gave 4 stars is the sensitivity of the \\"auto-off\\" feature.

The auto-off feature seemed like a good idea, but during quiet passages in the music, it would suddenly turn itself off. For instance, you can't listen to Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", or many other musical selections that don't have a constant pounding base to keep the AFT-100 aware that the music is still playing. It simply won't stay on.For that reason, I don't use the AFT-100 anymore.

Honestly, I just want to go out now and buy a radio with a jack so that I can avoid the hassle of the transmitter all together.

The thing does not even come in a box.It was shipped in a bubble bag with a cheaply printed 1 page instruction manual all this in a bubble enveloppe.The product is great but not worth 40$, more like a 20$ would be fair.

This iRiver model has static and distortion even with my iPod turned to a moderate volume level!!

Decided to give it a try and I am very happy with the quality and the fact that I don't have to use batteries in the transmitter. The only thing that would have improved the iRiver transmitter for me is if it rotated someway so that the channel display and buttons were at the top since the cigarette lighter in my Jeep is at the same level as the gear shift, making it difficult to search for a clear channel when driving.

Argh!-update","review":"I purchased this item after reading reviews. Worked great the first time then it started turning off constantly. After unplugging and plugging back in it would work for a few minutes or maybe 20 min. then it would turn off! I wish it would not have the \\"instant-on, auto-off\\" \\"feature\\" as described in their instructions. Why can't it be ON when it's plugged in and OFF when you unplug it?! I emailed tech support at IRiver and have not received a response yet. I am dissapointed in this product for sure! If anyone knows the fix, please enlighten us!UPDATE: Returned product to IRiver and got a new one -- guess what SAME PROBLEM....it went out the window at 55MPH!

The one that I bought from Amazon worked fine for a few months and then the wiring must have developed a short in it because as I move the wire around, the audio goes to different speakers.

A removable audio cable could have easily avoided this problem.The warranty period is only for 90 days which seems absurd to me -- so be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after two uses","review":"I tried unplugging it and after the second time, the spring popped out along with a couple of other metal pieces rendering the unit useless.

We do live in rural KS - she drives through zero towns on her way to work - but once there, nothing breaks the signal.

It's easy to use and I like the fact I can preset 3 different stations to use. Living near New York City and traveling periodically to Northeast and Southeast Pennsylvania, I sometimes need to switch from one station to another because the reception gets very fuzzy; however, with 3 presets I can always choose another that works. Just push another button on the unit and on the radio, and you're done. Some units I looked at only had specific stations they used, while this one allows you to choose on your own. The sound quality isn't as good as using the built-in CD player in my car, but I wouldn't expect that since the sound is being carried by the radio. Still, it's good enough for listening in the car for a long trip and it's very convenient to be able to choose from any album on my iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the bucks","review":"I have used griffin itrip smart scan and this product for my ipod touch and the griffin product is way better in terms of sound quality, features and ease of use.The most annoying feature of this device is the auto shut off feature.

Not sure what caused this, but it seemed as if it lost the signal feed and would shut itself down. The second complaint I have is that eventually the wiring malfunctioned and only one side of the speakers would receive a signal. Eventually the whole thing stopped working. I would search for another more reliable device."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good performer","review":"This FM transmitter works pretty good in my SUV with my Sandisk SANSA, between songs it does gets a little static.

Definitaly try the RadioPlay and if that does not work in your area, get this little gadget. If you are in the Orlando Area, broadcast on 93.5 and it is pretty good sound quality, and if that is taken, try 92.1 or 107.3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well in local area, but need a passenger on long trips","review":"I bought this transmitter shortly after loading up my Zen Vision:M. Now I can listen to my own music in my car any time!Works great locally, but not on longer trips where the frequencies change continuously.

All in all, it's not a bad product. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"1000% markup?","review":"This is a great little gadget, works really well IMHO. Bought it in 2010 for $14.

I was going to look at buying another for my work vehicle, but for $150 I could buy a whole new car stereo with an aux input (which is best for sound btw) Someone is way too proud of this gadget and will probably not sell many in the coming year as the price is laughable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"iriver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter","review":"Well, there really is not a lot to it.

It does, but it is not perfect.

I read a lot of good reviews about it, but it's not so good. The first time I used it, the sound quality was acceptable. But, suddenly it made a squealing noise and shut off. There was no way to turn it back on. I plugged it in 15 minutes later and it worked fora little while, but then it did the same thing and would not turn back on. I think it is worth it to spend a few extra dollars to buy the better equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 6 months","review":"It worked great for 6 months and then it died with no warning. One morning it just would not power up. It held the station pretty good when it was working but there was one 5 minute section of my 20 minute commute where it always got stepped on by a powerful station broadcasting on the wrong frequency.

I live in los angeles and i notice i dont have to move the radio channel around, well not to much. If you live in a rural area the kingston will be find.

There was virtually no setup, which was nice and it is compact. I also liked that it connected into the power plug in the car. My problem was it just wouldn't play a song for very long. Once i had my MP3 player hooked up to it, it would play for about 2-5 minutes but after that it would go to static. Or it would have this annoying \\"sound\\" over the music. I think i tried virtually every channel, but i just had no luck. I ended up getting the Belkin transmitter and it works much better. Not sure if it was just my radio channels or what, but i just didn't have much luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dissappointing","review":"I bought the iriver mobile transmitter hoping that i would be able to listen to my mp3 player through my radio. I like the fact that it is easy to use and that you can choose your station, but i live in monroe and we get stations from toledo and detroit, which is a problem because most or all of the stations are occupied or have interference and the transmitter is not strong enough to block out the slight interference from far away stations. I didnt think to check to see how many stations i could use for this product, looking back, i should have. i would only recommend this transmitter if you live somewhere that there aren't many stations that you can listen to on the radio"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well for NON-IPODS","review":"I have a Creative Labs mp3 player and had a great deal of trouble finding a compatible transmitter, as most are made specifically for Ipods.

When I first turn it on I hear nothing. I unplug the reciever and plug it back in, now I hear everyother syllable. I then shut down the entire system and turn it on again then it works delightfully. No matter what I do this is how I have to do it each and every time to get it to work. There is no known upgrade for this issue yet.

It shut down after about one minute of use and didn't send a signal to the radio anymore. I had to replug it in again for it to turn back on, only to have it turn off in about a minute again. Not only did it do this but it also had a very weak signal. I had it on FM and tried every blank(static) station I could find they all sounded the same. They sounded like a weak AM station and I had to turn the volume up almost to full in order to hear it. I know there are quite a few good reviews out there for this item, don't listen it's a trap.

Unlike some other modulators by Monster, Belkin, and Griffin, the AFT 100 lets you select ANY frequency, not one of a few factory presets. I simply found an empty frequency on my radio, adjusted the AFT 100 to match, and it sounds great, with no discernable noise or interference. Auto power-off is a nice feature, since I tuck my unit out-of-sight in the armrest.I use this device with both my iPod Photo and my iRiver IFP-890T. It's convenient and works well. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is as good as it gets","review":"After trying the Belkin Tunecast, both I and II, I laid out the money for this one -- Hooray! It works! I live in a suburb just north of Chicago and drive through 3 'burbs on the way to and from work -- radio stations come and go. The IRiver lets me set 3 so as I drive I can switch easily between stations. There is a little static (mainly between tracks), but for a FM transmitter, this is probably the best you can do for the money. For those of us out there without a tape deck in our car, this is the best way to go. (If you do have a tape deck, just get a tape adapter).The price may seem high in comparison to some other transmitters, but the advantage of being plugged directly into your car (no batteries!) is worth it. Plus, the auto on and off is great. Now, when I want to play my Rio Carbon I just turn it on, plug in the IRiver cord and turn on my radio -- easy easy easy.I am so glad I bought this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Readiness is all\\" (Hamlet)","review":"This was a gift from my son, who is the techie in the family and who assures me it works better than the comparable Belkin, Griffin, etc. models.

This pocket-sized device doesn't take batteries, but should I wish to use it in the house, my son tells me that a simple, inexpensive adapter from Radio Shack will do the trick. I'm still pretty happy with my car's CD player, but should I join the MP3/iPod revolution, I'm ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does work but.......","review":"It works but it sounds like a distant radio station.

However, the sound quality was poor at best. I do live in the Houston area and there are tons of FM stations in use so finding an in between spot to use the transmitter on was quite a task. When we did program in a few blank stations the sound was good for a moment and then as soon as the car began to move it would go in and out. If I pulled along side a pick up or 18 wheeler it was all over the place with static and multiple things bleeding through. I don't know that this is a product issue or a major metropolitan radio issue. I did return the 2 we purchased since they served no purpose at all for us.

The unit consists of surface mount components, a stereo transmitter chip, and a microprocessor. After studying the circuitry for a while I was able to find the shut down circuitry and defeat it. The unit now works great.\\"If Willy (or someone) could reveal the details on how to make this modification, a whole lot of currently dissatisfied cutomers would be very, very grateful I am sure.That \\"Auto-Off\\" feature makes my unit totally worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would avoid this transmitter","review":"This transmitter worked fine for about 4 months until it broke.

Be wary!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Nice and easy to setup, by selecting your own frequency of choice (actually presetting is possible for up to 3 frequencies). It also has this nice feature where it turns-off automatically if there is no audio signal for 30 sec. So, you can leave it plugged-in.From the picture, I was worried that it may not fit into the recessed cigarette lighter port in my truck, but it actually fits very nicely and it is fairly long and slender.The quality of the sound is excellent, at least for my not so hi-fi sensitive ears and middle of the road FM car radio. It is better than the Sony cassette insert device that I used to have for listening to my portable CD player. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very low quality","review":"This transmitter has an auto off feature which prevents it from working unless your mp3 player is powered on *before* you turn this unit on.

Sound quality is fine from WV to Dulles.Any closer to DC (Reston, Fairfax, Falls Church, etc.) and theinterference makes for TERRIBLE sound quality. I have tried everyFM frequency multiple times.The auto shutoff idea would be a good one, if it gave you anycontrol at all. The problem is, you can not turn it off. Soif you pause your player for one minute, like to order foodfrom a drive-through, to look at a map, to answer your cell,this thing will time-out and your car stereo will blasts static.EXTREMELY annoying. Same if you turn on your car before youhit \\"play\\" on your player. Sit in your card and turn the keyand you are greeted with blasting static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermittant Transmission","review":"FM transmission is intermittent, one second perfect stereo, the other barely audible. Before returning the device the first time, I tried it in two different cars (Ford/Honda) thinking it might have to do with the alternator, but each with the same result. I ensured that the signal from my mp3 player was working properly, since I tested it with headphones. The car radios also work properly when listening to radio, tape, or CD. After receiving the replacement I experienced the exact same problem. This time I even tried a third car. Same result: intermittent transmission of FM signal.Unfortunately it is easier to exchange the device than trying to find technical support. Consequently I have no idea what the problem is. I returned the second device and will try a different brand, too bad, since the sound was excellent for each second I was able to hear it...what a tease!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 5 minutes","review":"It worked for 5 minutes.

It works, but most of the time I'm hearing a fuzzy noise with the songs.

I just ordered a different transmitter, so hopefully it'll be one that doesn't have the fuzzy noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I am giving this product a low score because it did not work. The extra star is because I bought the product from Buy Accessories and I expected it to be in a brand new package which it wasn't.

With that in mind it is possible that the product may very well be a great product but I was an unlucky buck.For me,the product did not work from the beginning.

Interference is constant, and if you live in an area with a lot of college stations lower in the dial, and people all around you on the highway using Sirius satellite receivers, it'll be even worse. Plus, if you listen to bootleg live shows with dead air in between tracks, the unit switches over to radio automatically until loud music comes back on. Save your money and buy one of the new generation of stereos with mini-plug auxiliary jacks or USB ports on the front that allow you to connect your MP3 player directly into the receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice gadget!","review":"This is a really great gadget! I bought it along with my new Hi-MD player, which can store 1 GB worth of music, and I use the two of them together as much as I can - it's so much more convenient than bringing out a whole stack of CDs, everytime I go for a drive.The only reason I don't give full amount of stars, is that the signal it transmits isn't as strong as I could have wished for; I often get a little interference from other radio-signals, even though I have it set for an unused frequency, and that just spoils a bit of the fun for me. :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this transmitter to go with my Zen Touch after all the glowing reviews here. It does work, I'll give it that, but the transmission is sketchy and prone to static interference, and the volume just isn't satisfactory.

For those with discerning tastes, go ahead and spend a couple hundred dollars for a direct line in, otherwise spend the $35 and be more than happy.

It's good it fits in the 12V socket and spans the frequency spectrum. But at medium MP3 player output, there's loud hissing (remember the sound of a Dolby tape in a non-Dolby player?) over the car speakers. With the MP3 output turned higher, the hissing is minor, but there was a lot of snapping and crackling around the music peaks. Does this mean I have a bad out-of-the-box Iriver unit? The device was also sensitive to the position of the MP3 player and a lot of crackling if the electric socket adapter moved a hair with car movements. it may be better than most of the competition but if this is about the best, then we should think about getting car tuner/amplifiers with a little socket for direct line input. Of course, that won't help if you travel alot in rental cars, then you're back to this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Reception is horrble, the cheap little cassette adapters work much better than thi unit.

I have only had to use two or three stations while travelling all over the Northeast, as it has done a good job of overpowering weaker FM signals. The only two drawbacks I have is that if you are listening to something that is very low (such as certain parts in soundtracks or classical pieces), it sometimes loses the connection and shuts off. That can usually be fixed by turning up the volumn on the iPod itself, but that drains battery life and decreases the quality of the sound. The other drawback is that it does not charge the iPod while playing, which can make conserving battery life tough on the long trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound quality","review":"Everything I hoped for.Easy to use, full frequency range & a great match to any quality MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"I live in NYC so there arent too many free stations out here but I have gone 4 road trips since my purchase and I have to say this product works as described.

I have trouble finding a setting (on the radio) that doesn't have a station bleeding in so the sound quality is probably more the area's fault than the transmitter's.

It does basically what it says it does in terms of broadcasting. The fading out when it doesn't detect a signal is more of a problem than I thought it would be (I had read previous reviews); soft songs or live music really cut out. The biggest issue for me was the quality. The wire for one channel eventually failed to deliver a signal after eight months, which meant that the device thought there was no signal at all, and so stopped transmitting.

If I had to say something negative about the iriver it would be that you can't tune to 87.9 fm. That's always a clear station, but most of these transmitters only go down to 88.1 fm.

The change occurs when Crash is at a dance and gets in a little fight because a girl won't dance with him. His worst enemy, his neighbor, tells him to leave her alone. He ends up understanding that even though his neighbor is a geek he is still a nice person really, and he becomes his best friend.

Webb is a cheerleader who likes to save animals and stop malls from being built. Crash's best friend Mike plays football too. Sometimes they both get mad at each other and tackle each other.

Together they shared the dream of Patsy's success, though Treva, sadly, did not live to see it.And Patsy of course, didn't live to enjoy it. Patsy's letters here are touching, moving and they make you realize how hard she had to work--music was a man's world--and how much she loved her work.

So when I returned to the states I just had to find the same item and was thrilled to find it at Amazon. This straightening iron is not only easy to use but it is very effective. It has different settings that accommodate to the state of your hair. For example, I have color-treated hair so it has breakage.

I strongly suspect that without the connection to her more famous husband, Mrs. King would not have found such a wide audience for this particular piece of work. While that may sound harsh (and even somewhat trite, considering she has a significant fan base of her own), it's true.

Mix a little Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden) with Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) and Geoffrey Tate (Queensryche) and you have Myles Kennedy. This is such an improvement over Creed, I cannot overstate the quality of the music. This is not NU- anything, but good, solid, hard driving hard rock.

It's just one of those cd's that doesn't get tiring after a couple of listens like so many others do today.

While they are not Creed Redux (which is a good thing, they have their own sound), Alter Bridge does have a similar feeling to a lot of Creed's ballads. The vocalist here, Myles, is better musically than Scott Stapp, hands down. Scott's voice was good for Creed's lyrics, but this brother Myles can WAIL, man. I like the heavier guitar emphasis, and my fave tracks are \\"Find the Real\\" and \\"Broken Wings\\".

No one was more surprised than myself to find that it is a GREAT CD and NOT because it sounds like Creed. \\"One Day Remains\\" is moving and rocking and Alter Bridge has its own sound and while some of the music occasionally reminds me of Creed, the combination of Myles Kennedy's powerful voice and Mark Tremonti's kick-butt guitar playing will have Alter Bridge forging their own way in a very short time.

I recognized and loved Mark's talent back in My Own Prison, and I was just a kid. Creed had it's run and it was good. I liked them well enough, but I knew that Stapp would always hold Tremonti back from realizing his true potentiial. Now that Mark has the reins, he is doing exactly what I knew he was capable of. Simply in my opinion the best new rock around. And as for Kennedy, he is a great addition to the crew. While I did like Stapp's growl, Kennedy is a better all around singer. And for his ooh and aahs, I like them. It shows he doesnt take himself too seriously and is willing to be part of the band rather than try to be the main attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it all before","review":"This is not the same old Creed but it's close enough to pass for a cover band. The new singer is not an improvement over Scott Stapp whose vocals while not the best were at least appropriate to the music and stood out in the same way Draiman of Disturbed does or Aaron Lewis of Staind, as well as others. This is a generic rock album laded with weak hooks and an ordinary lead singer sound we've all heard before. It's not a bad album but it's nothing special either and this is not an album that will get much if any, airplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this cd","review":"This cd is the perfect example that you can have a good guitar player , a good bassist , a good drummer , a good singer and still make songs that have no depth. This cd is very well played but is also very very boring , so before thinking about buying it listen to the song samples first. These guys can rock but I just dont like the songs they play, I don't feel them and I think they lack creativity except for the guitar solos and riffs which are really good but that doesn't change the fact that listening to this cd is like listening to some background music. It's like ambient rock music. Check out 'seven wiser' instead , it's less sophisticated but better in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they settle for this guy!","review":"I have listened to this cd front 1 to 11 about 4 times. I can honestly say that there are two songs that our tolerable. I cannot believe they settled for this guy. I can honestly say after listening to this album the 4th time that I had to rip it out of my cd player and gave it to my wife without a burning a copy. His voice is annoying and the tone is awful. I was a huge Creed fan, although, Scott's head got as big as a blimp there is no doubting his talent. I like the lyrics, music and this would have been an amazing album with Scott or someone who had a mans voice, instead of the constant squill of a karaoke singer. MT wrote some great songs, great riffs, but wasted his time auditioning and picking this guy. I predict he won't be on the next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"Okay, I admit that I did not want to buy this CD. I heard Broken Wings and I just couldn't get it out of my head. I was skeptical because I thought that it would just be one hit and the rest would be like the worst of Creed. Don't get me wrong, I like Creed, but I don't feel that their CDs are fabulous. I have all of their CDs and I don't play them very often because most of the best songs were worn out on the radio. Well, that is not the case with Alter Bridge. I actually wish I had heard more of their CD sooner. I LOVE IT! It is so good that I can't imagine anyone that likes alternative rock not liking it. You can't go by the 30 second clips either. You need to hear it all. My favorite has got to be Shed My Skin. Kennedy's vocals give me chills! Also, Watch Your Words is made for blasting on the car stereo. Borrow a friends copy or check it out at your local library. Do whatever it takes! You have to hear it to believe it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alter Bridge is the SH*T!!!","review":"I liked Creed when they were together. Stapp kinda whined on some of their songs. When they broke up, I figured they just were taking a break. I saw an ad for Alter Bridge, and saw the guys from Creed. I was in shock. I got on a checked and sure enough, I read about the break up and everything. This album rocks. Best songs have to be \\"Open Your Eyes\\" \\"Metalingus\\" \\"Find the Real\\" and \\"Down to my Last\\" Buy this album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally AwEsoMe!!","review":"Alter Bridge is a great band that plays great music. Tremonti totally rocks...his guitar riffs and solos are amazing, it goes so well with Kennedy's voice and so does the drums and bass. TRUE MUSIC! If you are looking for an album this one should be the first on your list. A MUST-HAVE!! Their ability to write, record, and perform this stuff is insane!This is what I call true music.....GO GET IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alternative from Creed","review":"I have to say I just recently found this CD. I bought 4 copies from FYE to give to my friends for different occasions. Man I cannot TELL YOU how much they LOVED the CD. First time I heard it, it was like, Angles singing. It is by far the most incredible band out there(my opinion).I'm a major fan of Creed, but when I heard this CD, I was led to beleive that Scott Stapp(Singer of Creed) was lower in music quality then Alter Bridge.I was sad at first to hear Creed broke up but when I listened to the newly formed band, I was just so happy.I never found music so enjoyable and meaningful. To tell you the truth, the 30 second sound clips is what got me into it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Awesome","review":"Ok ya for starters this is NOT CREED!!! THIS IS ALTER BRIDGE!!!! This is the next big step that creed couldn't take. Mark comes back and hes so freakin awesome!! Myles sounds pretty good. I'm almost surprised that hes not in a band already. Songs 1,2,3,5 and the rest sound so great. They SOUND EXCELLENT!!! Check it out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridging the gap","review":"I am not a passonate music fan. I don't listen to just one thing. Somedays I will play Mozart in the car and other days I will rock out to Country. I was a very unlikely fan of Creed. I reluctantly went to a CREED show with some friends and was moved by the adoration of their fans. I then bought the CD and loved it. Then they broke up. Nothing since Creed gave me the chills until AlterBridge. At first I wasn't that crazy about the singer on the cd because I was expecting the low baratone sound of Creed, until I saw them live. WOW! I have a real appreciation for the band. I especially love the bass lines. The cd is great but a live show is AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, retro sound","review":"This album sounds like an updated version of 80's metal ala Skid Row and Motley Crue. If you dig those kinds of bands like I do, you'll really like this album. The track that got me to buy it is called Miseducation and it was after I heard Sebastian Bach interviewed on a national radio show one night. It was well worth the $13 bucks or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"alter bridge is not worth it.","review":"First off if your going to change the lead singer give the group a differnt name why keep the same sound when scott stapp was in the group. everyone knows that the reason why people are going to even buy the this cd id becuase of the sound. scott stapp had the voice it was strong and powerful scott stapp made the group every song he had writen and sang was just perfect in every way. this miles kenndey dude is not going to make it the sound of band and his voices dont sound right. knowing that creed was out for about 7-8 years all thier cds made number #1. Alter Bridge is not going to make it unless they get a differnt sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminds me of the Movie Rock Star","review":"Tremonti is awesome but Scott Stapp was need (well when his ego goes away.) New singer really does suck!! Creed had flow and you can tell it is missing in this CD. Mabye in the future we'll see good music from Stapp and Tremonti seperatly but it crap wasn't it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack of the blonde swingers!","review":"That is what I think of this album. I'm sick of these \\"mega-bands\\" forming up, switching band members and such. I loved Creed before this tragedy. Creed may sound the same if you take away this blonde swinger's voice, but that's only because the only thing missing is Scott Stapp's voice. Screw this album up the ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP ME!","review":"Mayfield Four singer/guitarist Myles Kennedy couldn't sing with his previous band (or write good music) so why does he think he can now? For the review that states he wants to hit the notes... well maybe he does \\"want to\\" but that in no way means he can! The guy can't sing! I haven't heard more off key notes, tweaks in the voice, or gurgling since Cherone tried to become the next Halen vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for proving a point","review":"After all the bitching among fans about how much Tremonti was being held back by Creed, I'm glad he went out and made his own record. It proves that being held back is sometimes a good thing. Tremonti, dude, we know you can play... but the song must come first, and on this album it never does. Shame when ego takes over like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Band Bights!","review":"I have to say, I did give Alter Bridge a chance...but they DO sound too much like the group in \\"Rock Star\\" (movie with Jennifer Aniston etc.) There might be two songs on the disc that I can stomach, but overall, Myles Kennedy is an awful singer. His voice is extremely harmful to the ear drums! I just couldn't take much of some of the songs, because of his voice...I have to hand it to them (Mark Tremonti etc) for trying at least, but dudes, get a new lead singer, this one really sucks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such disappointment...","review":"I loved Creed's first album with original members Mark Tremonti on guitar, Scott Stapp on Vocals, Brian Marshall on bass, and Scott Phillips on drums. However, after that album, I think Scott Stapp was given too much control over the direction of the music and it started to really suck with their second album, and their third was even worse. Then I hear they're getting Brian Marshall back and ditching Stapp, so I get all excited. I'm hoping that I'll get to hear Brian's grungy bass and Mark's powerful guitar riffs once again like in the days of 'My Own Prison' with such kick ass songs as Ode, Illusion, and Unforgiven. This Miles guy comes in trying to sound just like Scott, but worse. So needless to say, I think it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing their touch","review":"This cd is crap. It's a bunch of recycled riffs and vocal ranges. Don't get me wrong though, Tremonti can tear a guitar to pieces, and this new sucka Myles has some decent pipes. But come on, they should have called the band what it really is. Watered down Creed riffs featuring a guy who sounds like Eddie Vedder. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and sad...","review":"creed was bad enough!! now this junk, great what next a new hanson album!!!!!! 1 star is too much!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alter Bridge ... wow","review":"Alter Bridge surprised me in the way the the musicians have stepped up since Creed. The Drummer is doing way more awesome beats than when he was in creed and of course he guitarist is so incredible. Myles Kennedy, \\"The lead singer\\" has amazing vocal range and the bassist is sweet! Alter bridge, I would have to say, is sweeter than creed. Astounding tracks: 3,5, and 8!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Myles Kennedy drops the ball","review":"Unfortunately I am not one of the Alter Bridge fans and let me tell you why. I was a huge Creed fan, I had the shirts I had the albums, I was a big Creed fan. Now when the Alter Bridge album debut came out I was eager to hear the music. I was dissapointed to find that even though the band members where there it sounded like a stappless Creed. Myles Kennedy to me has no talent whatsoever he sounds like a cross between Three Doors Down and Keith Urban. Two very good bands when mixed together=Myles Kennedy. I'm sorry to say that he didn't impress me at the least bit. Music is still the band but Kennedy doesn't live up to Scott Stapp's voice, which draws you in and keeps you there. The Great Divide got my vote, I think Scott Stapp did a better job this year than Alter Bridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"This music is insulting!!!!","review":"One horrible band has split to make two horrible bands. They're like Gremlins, please keep them away from water!!! It sounds like a horrible tribute band of every 90's has been. It could be a bunch of Guitar Center rejects playing half ass Soundgarden covers. Just terribly insulting that this type of music is produced and pushed on music listeners. Anybody who appreciates real thought provoking music should avoid this CD at all costs. This could be almost as bad as Creed, I haven't got the stomach to listen to Scott's solo album, so I can't bring him into this. These guys would do well on American Idol, because it fits that mindless, cheesy, empty droning that you hear from that show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this CD. Creed was a solid band with lots of great hits. There is not one hit single on this album. I wasted $13 on it. They need to get Scott Stapp back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proves one thing.........","review":".....that Scott Stapp wasn't the only thing that stunk about Creed!!! That guitar sound? Horrid. Those arrangements......are these guys over 15 yet? Grow up!! Those guitar solos.......horrid. No TASTE, not an ounce of subtlety ....this guy is a terrible guitar player!!!! That oh so played out mid tempo \\"heavy\\" drumming....my god, how boring a human being do you have to be to enjoy this kind of music??The new vocalist is slightly less of a mimic, but he's still doing a 90's grunge \\"thing\\" that has been tired for a LONG LONG TIME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening","review":"Alterbridge, Creed and creed soundalikes are no good. These are horrible songs by horrible bands - cheesy, watered-down, \\"safe\\" rock. Please save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"No identity!","review":"I think they sound more like a mix of CREED, and SOUNDGARDEN, than Creed and Pearl Jam. But I don't think it matters a whole lot to be honest. Because if your a fan of Creed you will probably be a fan of this. I have never been a fan of Creed, I think that they were one of the worst bands of the last ten years. I did in fact listen to the entire album and there is nothing exiting in any of the songs, they sound incredibly thought out in ways to maximize their airplay. Which just leads to nothing important or relevant in what they are playing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Good","review":"The music rocks, as it should. You can listen to the whole cd and not want to skip any of the songs. If you liked Creed's sound, you will like this CD. I've already purchased my tickets to see/hear this music played live."},{"rating":"2","title":"haven't heard a better band","review":"I got their cd the day it was relesed and I've never listened to anything so well written lyrically or musically. Tremonti and Kennedy are incredibly gifted and with Brian Marshall on bass and Phillips on the drums it doesn't get more badass than that...this is real music, the kind that gives you goosebumps the first few times you listen to it and you get that same feeling every time...their concerts are unbelievable. I just can't wait until their next album's released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is one of the best rock bands ever formed,simply because they offer something to everbody who is a fan of the genre. From the well-written melody of In Loving Memory and Open Your Eyes to the sheer ferocity and heaviness of Watch Your Words and Metalingus Alter Bridge's One Day Remains is an album that needs to be in the collection of anyone who remotely enjoys this type of music. A couple of other stand-outs on this disc are the title track with is speedy riffs and upbeat feel (which continues to make my jaw drop due to its showing that even bands formed after 2000 can actually have TALENT!!!)and Find The Real showcasing its slow yet super-catchy beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing debut album","review":"This record is just too cool. For being a debut album, Alter Bridge have done a great job on this. They got a better vocal than Creed and Mark Tremonti shreds more than before in this album. IMO, almost all of the songs are catchy and more melodic than other Creed songs that will make you desire to listen to it again and again. The guitar playing in Open Your Eyes, Find The Real and some other tracks are awesome, that we can't hardly find it in the past Creed songs. No matter a Creed fans you're or not, this album is a must buy CD. It worths your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"I bought this book and never use it.

Irregardless of that, this is a very nice collection of Sizzla tracks. Among my favorites from Disc #1 are \\"Wizer Than Dem\\", \\"Takes Only Time\\", \\"From Long Time\\", \\"Be Yourself\\", and \\"Healing Of The Nation\\". Disc #2 has a nice lineup of Kariang single releases including some nice tracks by Luciano, Bushman, Garnet Silk, Prezident Brown and Kulcha Knox among others. Overall, Liberate Yourself is an excellent Roots & Culture release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I really love this cart cover. It costs a little more than the ones in stores but I am glad I spent the money. It is easy to install on carts. The toys are cute - my 10 month old likes to play with them and make them \\"dance\\". Coverage is good. Although I have not used it with any oversize carts yet, I think it should cover them. Design is really nice - have washed it once and it washed well. Haven't used it on a high chair yet but I get so much use as a shopping cart cover it was definitely worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I am very please with the product. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I have twin boys therfore purchased 2 and they have worked our great! I have used them in shopping carts and also in highchairs in restaurants. I did find that the material has already started to fade a bit with washing but it seems quite durable. The boys like the toys that come with it and I like the fact that I can attach other toys to it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fussy mom...","review":"I'm not a fussy mom that worries constantly about all the germs my child can pick up but, the store carts/high chairs are germ farms so I thought, better safe than sorry and bought this cover. It's a good design and I love the look. The toys included are fun and handy since my daughter needs to constantly chew on things. It comes in a zippable cover bag so you can store it again after use. Good buy, glad I took the plunge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use as a play mat!!!","review":"IT advertises on the package that you can use as a mat- but don't! The animals are on strings and if they are not taken off it is a choking hazard.

We've used it a few times in different carts and high chairs, and so far, it has been great! It uses elastic and velcro, and the elastic really helps it stretch to fit standard and larger shopping carts. It is pretty cushy, so my daughter seems relatively comfortable sitting in it. In my opinion, there are 2 downsides: First, it is a little tricky to roll back up while also managing a 6-month-old. Secondly, I find the \\"Hula\\" theme and attached toys a little hokey. The cover we tried previously had a \\"Safari\\" theme and came with a crinkly \\"Zoo Map\\" which my daughter found much more entertaining. Luckily, this cover does have extra loops where I can attach some of her favorite toys. All in all, I'm happy with this cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great coverage","review":"I looked at a lot of grocery cart covers. Our grocery carts have a large piece on the handle where you have to insert a quarter to get the cart out of the line of carts. (annoying? yes!) This covers it well, along with all the places on the side that my daughter likes to chew. The tune on the animal is catchy. It's larger than others and I can't put it on with one hand, so I leave her in the car, then put her in the cart once I have this thing on. It's worth the effort and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is perfect!","review":"This cover is great. Better than many others. It covers the cart completely (even the sides) It fits on all carts...sams club, price chopper, walmart, target, etc. So many people have stopped me to ask where I purchased this while we were out. It's truly the most protective. Only drawback is that it does not fold into itself or have a carry bag, so it may seem cumbersome to until you get to your cart."},{"rating":"1","title":"WWE Unforgiven 2000","review":"This PPV was fair, but for the most part, it was rather boring. The return of Stone Cold Steve Austin was sort of interesting, as he searches for the person who ran him down with the automobile a year earlier at the 1999 Survivor Series.

What was thought to have a huge impact on story lines and a new begining for the wwf was halted when the driver who ran over stone cold was still not resolved. The matches themselves were boring and pointless. The steel cage match was not up to edge, christians, and the hardys potential and I was real disappointed beacuse they did not show much of there skills. The main event was like an ordinary match on a smackdown episode. The outcome was also real disapointing. The only upside to this ppv was the return of stone cold steve austin after 10 months.

They perform pretty well (for the money) overall, but don't expect them to last overly long. The feet are made from sheetmetal, and are prone to rust. Regulating heat can be tricky. Thermometer is functional, but just barely. Having said that, they have surprisingly good capacity. I have smoked several turkeys over time with them, and had great results.

The assembly was easy and quick, you could be smoking your first BBQ 30 minutes after this arrives. The smoker is easy to use and has held up perfectly so far (I bought it about 6 months ago). I didn't get a cover for it but so far it has held up to the elements pretty well. The only problem I saw was that the temperature gauge is very generic,,it gives you a general range of temperatures and works well enough to let you know if you are in the ballpark, I went ahead and ordered another $7 thermometer to put on it to give me more precise temps.

Needless to say, I am no longer skeptical; I truly appreciate the artistry that is Mono."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refining their own interpretations of beauty","review":"Mono continued to build their reputations as one of post-rocks most solid contenders with what was probably their tightest recording to date (2004), the Albini-produced Walking Cloud...I could argue individual tracks packed greater punch upon initial hearing with earlier work, but here was an excellent summation of everything the band had achieved thus far- intricate guitar work, bone-crunching, reverb-laden payoffs, and a commitment to melodic enormity which makes them one of only a few bands who have been able to emulate some of that Godspeed aesthetic without sounding derivative."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"How could Formica Blues be so good and Walking Cloud so bad? The first two tracks sounded like trying to listen to music standing next to a moving train. The symbols are intolerable.

Unfortunately, you do not know any of this until you actually attempt using a pen on the page's poor quality paper.

Minnie is in top form, showcasing the versatility of her instrument. Charles Stepney's production and arrangements build the bridge between what Burt Bacharach was doing at the time to what Philly greats Thom Bell and Gamble & Huff were yet to do a year or two later.This record begs to be played on the old Tube HI-FI in the living room of a space age bachelor pad. It's rare for me to buy a record and listen to it all why through and rarer yet to let it play non-stop for 2 days.As mentioned on an earlier review, the mastering has it's shortcomings but doesn't take from the beauty of the music. I'm not sure anything coming out of Chess Studios was ever up to audiophile standards. Seeing Bill Inglot's name in the \\"Special Thanks\\" list tells me they had one of the best remastering guys around.

Other than that, I am speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minnie rips into Dionne's world.","review":"The solo debut of Minnie Riperton is perhaps the best attempt at copying the classic Dionne sound. The recording was produced by Charles Stephney,Chess Record label producer who would later work with Earth, Wind & Fire.From beginiing to end the LP sounds like a tribute to the musical genius of Burt Bacharach with vocals inspired by Dionne Warwick. Minnie, ofcoursegoes to heights that Warwick never could reach. Still, Stephney guided her to mimic Dionne in her vocal delivery. At the time of this LP's release, 1969, Warwick was the leading female record seller in the US. So, Stephney must have thought to give the public more of what they were already buying. The album still holds up after all these years. I suggestbuying the digially remastered version of this obscure LP. Prior releases were badly made copies from old records and audio tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tasty plate of early-to-middle Verdi curtain raisers","review":"Muti, with his driven and straight-faced \\"objective\\" style of conducting, has never been my man, but he has to be given credit as a Verdi specialist. His early reputation was built on scrupulously following the written score and cleaning up musty performance practices at La Scala. That shows in this colleciton of Verdi preludes and overtures--half middle-period chestnuts, half early and rare--where we get clean lines, precise ensemble (maybe a bit too precise; one thinks of the U.S. Marine cORPS Band every once in a while), and an authentic feeling for a night at the opera.This last is rare on recordings. For a long time the best competition came from much grander ensembles like the Berlin Phil. under Karajan. It's refreshing for once to come closer to the real La scala, Verdi's home theater, with the pit band's leaner, crisper tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underplayed and underwhelming","review":"The notes are all there, but these are distinctly tepid and inexpressive runthroughs; entirely too polite, ironically for the theatre orchestra that has these operas in its lifeblood, having debuted most of them.

He comes to life briefly for Act 3 of Traviata, his emotions finally engaged. In short, this program doesn't add up to a satisfying musical experience. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underplayed Verdi","review":"The notes are all there, but these are distinctly tepid and inexpressive runthroughs; entirely too polite, ironically for the theatre orchestra that has these operas in its lifeblood, having debuted most of them.

But Sutherland is so stupendous in her earliest recordings decades ago that she far surpasses even the outstanding Beverly Sills. I've heard them both, and what impresses most about Sutherland is the gigantic wall of sound that almost approaches a Wagnerian dramatic soprano, especially at the E in alt. I don't recommend this one, but may I suggest a flawless Lucia, and Puritani. You can't go wrong with a Sutherland Lucia.

I love her younger recordings, but she just didn't age well, I will give her an A+ for effort, I mean she still throws out the high notes (as pinched and ugly that they are) even gives us a high e flat at the end of the mad scene. But Joan was just too old at this point to do the role justice. If you want a well accomplished recording turn to Beverly Sills, she mastered this role and recorded it in the prime of her wornderful voice. Don't waste your money on this recording unless you just love Dame Joan so much you have to have all that she recorded to the bitter end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A diva well past her sell by date","review":"Pass this recording up and head for Beverley Sills version. Sutherland is past it vocally. Her voice sounds dry and she has a problem holding the upper register for longer than a second or two. Boynage also conducts without enthusiasm a lack lustre performance. Beverley Sills may not have a weighty voice but she was at the peak of her game and is hands down better than Dame Joan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Sutherland-Donizetti combo.","review":"I own and adore Sutherland's other Donizetti recordings, but I cannot say the same for this \\"Anna Bolena\\" of hers. Being early Donizetti this opera lacks the dramatic maturity of the latter tragedies, which all the more makes the input of the leading soprano even more crucial. And simply put, Dame Joan's portrayal did not convince or move me at all. The rest of the cast is adequate vocally but seems just as reserved, dramatically, as Sutherland. Bonynge offers his usual, reliable sympathetic accompaniment but even that is insufficient to save this recording. In a nutshell, this is the one Sutherland recording which almost bored me to death.

I used it again, blowing a soft puff of air, it still read close to the maximum. Full disclosure: I am pretty sure the item was defective and may not be representative of all of them.

As others have written, it tended to be 60-80 points lower than other meters. Part of the idea as to why I got this was to have him feel in control of his asthma by being a part of the monitoring. However, this cheap product and its inaccurate readings made him feel worse cause his readings were so low.Skip this one, not just because of the money but also because it could start you off on the wrong foot with your child for daily/weekly peak flow monitoring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do anything to get this CD, even if you have to crawl!","review":"I first heard them on the WB11, my aunt and uncle gave me the CD.

The authors examination of Paul as a Gnostic leader is very revealing. The deep connections between Gnostic teachings and Neo-platonic philosophy are also very penetrating. Best of all, I think I have a better handle on the whole notion of the Holy Spirit. Its a sublimation of the Goddess Sophia, which, in turn, is a sublimation of spiritual becoming in a corporeal context. (This interpretation will resonate with process theologians.) In short, this is a stunning book which will stimulate a lot of reflection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"I loved this book. It clearly shows how religion has developed into its authoritarian nature from what should be a spiritual path. It for the first time in my understanding of Christianity show a truly spiritual side to what has become an unfortunately Hierchical authority driven religion. I believe it shows (indirectly) the reason why more and more westerners are becoming more interested in eastern traditions. Take fer example that it is integral to religious christians that the ressurection and the like must be actual events. Take the teachings of Taoism for instance that teach Lao Tzu was born at over the age of 80. I have never known a taoist teacher to enforce that idea as actual truth but more of a spiritual analogy. Finally! it seems the same is known of the monotheistic religions as well. Fantastic read! 6 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money on this","review":"I realize, of course, that my dismissal will prompt some to actually do the deed. That's understandable, and only human. But descriminating readers who already know something about Gnosticism will be able to tell from a glance in a bookstore that what I say is correct. I didn't read this book. I browsed thru it in a bookstore with great interest. Ten minutes was enough to determine that it does not deliver. And I speak not as an orthodox Christian but as a self admitted heretic. The premise that Christianity was born in paganism simply does not hold up. The Divine Mother (Sophia) was certainly present in early Christianity. But not however the pagan goddess. And there is a huge difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too Hard","review":"This is the only book I started, but never finished. Plainly, this book sucked and I'm not saying that because it offended me or my religion, I just didn't like it and thought it was poorly written.

Placido Domingo has a way of spoiling ever Wagner recording he undertakes. His German ix execrable and to me if you can't pronouce the language correctly you shouldn't be singing the opera. Too many reviewers get carried away by the starry names in the cast, and unfortunately in this opera the stars are the negatives.

This was just a badly cast production which aimed at star power and selling to the naive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I treasure a number of Solti's opera recordings. This is not one of them. The casting is all wrong-headed. Domingo does not sound idiomatic singing in German. Norman's voice is too rich for the virginal Elsa. Solti's conducting is earthbound for this most ecstatic of dramas. If you want a lyrical Lohengrin, look for Konya. If you want an incomparable Elsa, listen to Grummer. If you seek visionary conducting, try Kempe. If you want Solti at his best, purchase his Ring.

I was surprised to find that, by my standards (at least), the Meat Purveyors are very much rooted in traditional bluegrass. Some purists might object to some of the stuff here, but the hauting \\"Travel & Toil\\" and \\"Morning After\\" show a real mastery of the genre. Not that they'll let themselves be forced into a corner; their cover of \\"We Kill Evil,\\" a punk tune which sounds, in the Meat Purveyor's talented hands, as much a gospel number as left-wing manifesto, ends the album on a delighfully surreal note.

The longest piece is an actual recording of frogs. This is really for the Quintron fan who has everything else of his. It's interesting, and maybe even fun if you're in the right mood or altered state, but I was expecting...music. None of that damn-it's-hard-not-to-dance-in-my-cube music. So I'm disappointed.

The exact same thing at rumble 98, only instead of the Ortons setting Takers casket on fire, it was Kane and Paul Bearer. God, WWE is running out of storylines! What luzers!

But, on this CD something is missing. His usual enthusiasim is present, but maybe becuase of his relative youth on the Cd, or something else, the interprtation of the Mendlssohn Concerto leaves something to be desired. Its just not as beautiful and singing as his other recordings. On the contrary, he often comes across harsh and stilted. The third movement of the concerto though, posesses the charm and vitality that is typical of Bell. Also, the Bruch is still gorgeous with it's lovely lyrical middle movement and bold, joyous last movement.

His book is a wonderful bridge-builder between science and spirituality! Not many writers in academia have such a healthy balance between head and heart. Dr. Schwartz's impeccable scientific credentials are all the more impressive and credible because he is willing to take the professional risks implicit in self-disclosure within the scientific community.Dr. Schwartz has been criticized by some because he has used personal experience to point toward the truth of his G.O.D. hypothesis, instead of relying soley on logic. Well, he is in good company. Albert Einstein used his personal flight of fancy on a beam of light, as a referrence point for his world-changing theory of relativity. He simply used logic to make that truth available to others.The G.O.D.

The rest was an extremely poor excuse at science, accompanied by the author's continuing reminders of what a great scientist he is.

I read the \\"summary\\" chapter and found several false assertions about math and physics, so I read no more.

Even worse is that the blanket is cheaply made. When I pulled it out of the package, it already had threads hanging off, loose threads and snapped threads.

There's a good rendition of \\"My Home Ain't in the Hall of Fame\\", but my favorite was \\"Wild Wind\\", which has immense sing-a-long possibilities. There's a honky-tonk number called \\"High Plains Jamboree\\". There's a faint touch of The Band and Dylan in \\"Walkin'Cane\\" and \\"Goin' Nowhere Blues\\".

This is quite simply Pavarotti's best role, full of vigour and poetry. If one really wished to find something to pick on, it would perhaps be that he only rarely seems willing to sing quietly, but the feeling (in particular the desperation) and warmth he brings to the role is, as far as I know, unmatched. Freni also, in my view, outperforms e.g. Callas, at least in terms of sheer beauty of sound, although a case could be made that Callas is the superior interpreter. Panerai and Harwood are excellent as well.But if there is anything sweeping all competition aside, it is Karajan. He has simply got it all, focus on orchestral beauty as well as a taut grip on the drama and momentum. Put that together with splendid sound, and you've got a winning set. A must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling!","review":"The entire cast of this performance is terrific, but Freni and Pavarotti are particulary wonderful.

To say she was born to sing Puccini is an understatement. Her voice in this recording is absolutley ravishing. To my ears it is a perfect lyric soprano voice; expressive, sweet, with a slight darkness that gives it a marvellous tone colour.Pavarotti is just as incredible. The voice is bright, warm and expressive. Although Bjoerling sings with more tenderness in the Beecham recording, there is no lack of involvement from Pavarotti. Needless to say, when these to incredible voices blend...WOW!Karajan is slightly overindulgent...can you blame him? Tempos are spacious allowing Freni and Pavarotti create magic. The recorded sound is excellent. The whole reading may be slightly over the top, but who cares? Turn down the lights, turn up the volume, let the milk boil over and just let the wonderful sound penetrate your soul...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good purchase","review":"Sound quality was not as clear as I'd hoped but can't expect much better from this old a recording.

I decided to shop around and look for something better rather than fighting over whether the degradation of stability was a warranty issue -- I'd rather learn my lesson and get what I really wanted/needed to begin with.Feature list for this tripod and overall construction seem about average for the price.Longevity obviously was a problem.I believe that Manfrotto has put its name on a product that really doesn't deserve it.Bottom line -- you can do better. Take a look at the Slik line. The 700 is a little less expensive and blows this tripod away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, no need for weight-bag","review":"My first purchase for non-cheapo tripod setup. One thing I did not realize was that it does not come with a camera mount. You need to purchase yet another mount that connects the camera with the tripod. I later purchased the ball-mount quick-release from Manfrotto, which works well. All the cheaper light-weight tripod seems to require a weight-bag if you want the tripod to remain stable. I figured that I don't want something like wind to knock over expensive lens and camera. So in that case, $150-200 for a sturdy tripod setup (the tripod and mount) won't be such a bad thing. If you have a $200 camera, not so much.Pros:-Stable-It does not need a weight bag-Peace of mindCons:-It is heavier than your normal plastic tripod-Requires additional purchase for a complete tripod setup"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entry level tripod","review":"This is an entry level tripod for the lighter range of DSLR cameras. It works well for my Canon 60D since the 60D has a lighter body than the previous model. It is also fairly light for a metal tripod, but it seems to be sturdy enough. Of course it isn't as light as a carbon fiber tripod, but it is also a lot cheaper. It works just fine as a low end DSLR tripod, and that's all it is meant to do. It is far better than any cheap tripod found in Best Buy or some other similar store that sells the cameras that would need it.

When I saw the \\"two cup\\" description I thought of my Pyrex two cup measure, which has some head space above the two cup line and is bigger in diameter and in height too. The difference in size is caused by the fact that a portion of the liquid goes into the spout of the separator, which is also small.

To me, this was basically like a bunch of recordings of people humming Muse songs. The original tracks have so much power and emotion, but these versions seem cheap and empty. If they would have had a full orchistra it would have been awesome. The string quartet just doesn't cut it, at least not for me. Of course, this is all in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"They gave it a try, sort of. (2.5 stars)","review":"While I realize that these string quartet tribute albums are churned out at a ridiculous clip by studio musicians, I can tell they put a little more thought into this one.Overall, the track choices are good. There are the big hits: Newborn, Time is Running Out, etc., but there's also a great b-side, Map of Your Head. But the bottom line is really \\"Is this worth my money?\\"Well, probably not. It's a neat listen if you are a Muse completist (I am) but even for me, it's not really worth more than a listen or two. The goal of these string quartet tributes is to really bring out the beauty of the compositions of these otherwise heavy songs, but it seems to me that for say, Stockholm Syndrome, the original has more depth and poigniancy to it anyway.I do give them credit for the original composition, \\"Saving Grace\\", it really sounds like it could be a muse song, in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review from a classical musician","review":"I play cello in a string quartet and am a huge Muse fan as well. As far as this compilation of, perhaps, some of Muse's greatest hits, a string quartet version just doesn't depict the kind of emotional response that I get from listening to the orignal trio. I listened to some of these tracks and thought I was listening to my buddies playing Muse songs by ear and just messing around. Save your money, or better yet, for the same price go out and treat yourself to the original albums that these songs derived from (Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and Absolution)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I'll do an actual review later, but here are some of my thoughts on this album, since only one other person rated it so far. The songs all sound great, but they hardly differ from the original versions, and none of them are really that much different. Most of them sound note for note the same, but just played on the strings. This is ok because Muse has a lot of classical influence in their songs, but I wish the makers would have put more effort into this. If you're a casual fan you can skip, but if you really like string tributes or Muse you should get it. Some better string tributes, which are less basic, are the ones for Nine Inch Nails, Coldplay, and A Perfect Circle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a very good CD it starts out slow (much like a live set from these two) but in the end they dont let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"The Wonderful World that God Made is a lovely book to introduce kids to the creation story.

This is published by Rio Grande Games, which usually just oozes quality, but for this game Rio Grande went El Cheapo (and this game sells for $65 full price, one would think having better quality) . The card board(paper cut outs) are extremely thin (about 1/2 normal size), I'm always careful punching out perforated cardboard pieces so they dont rip, and one the the circle split into two pieces. The bag holding the cubes had been cut at the bottom so the pieces were free to roam in the box while the indented card board insert was already ripped and folded over. They only include two bags, one for all the cubes and one for spinners, luckily I have extra bags for organization. For some reason these bottomless bags, cut in the bottom, seem to be a trend lately, anyone notice this as well?"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT antibacterial/No triclosan","review":"I contacted Rainbow Research because my bottle does not list triclosan, nor does it say the product is antibacterial.

Products such as this lead to more and more antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, MRSA for example. Please, for the health of yourself and your family...DO NOT BUY! The problem is, we treat people with Trichlosan for a bacterial infection. If you go rubbing it on your body all the time, guess what, when you get sick your little bacteria buddies have developed a tolerance to it and will not die when you take the drug. Just use regular soap and as hot as you can stand water and you will be fine. In a hurry alcohol based products are fine to use because we don't treat bacterial infections with alcohol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"I was recommended this band because I'm a big fan of Wintersun. There isn't that much to say that others haven't, so I'll keep this short. The songs are blistering on the fretboard, and the solos actually have a VERY classical twist to them... one song even pays homage to Mozart in a direct fashion. The vocals and singing are all top-notch, bringing the best of operatic with death metal. This rates a four only because the technical skill is SO outstanding--but none of the songs really connect with me on an emotional level. It's brain music--the same as when you want to put in some classical while doing a project or homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sure Ain't \\"Buried In Oblivion\\"","review":"The new edition (vocalist Stu Block) has killed the perfect vocal line-up w/ his ridiculous, overkilled \\"80's power metal\\" screams.

There's nowhere near as much melody in the music & pitifully few vocal harmonies, further widening the gap from Oblivion. I keep listening ... hoping it'll grow on me & I'll somehow eventually get past the new festering puss-sore, nails-on-a-chalkboard style vocals, but it just ain't hap'nin.Fortunately for the band tho, it would seem I'm the odd man out b/c all these other reviews seem to be raving.

To follow in the pattern of the two larger companies, Busiek, Ross and Anderson attempted to develop their own \\"universe,\\" with inter-related characters and stories --- much the same way Batman and Superman exist in the DC universe and meet and interact.The major strength of the book is Busiek's writing. Kurt tells a more \\"grown-up\\" super-hero fable, from the perspective of a man who could fly, a news journalist, a petty criminal who discovers a hero's identity, and so forth.

They have added new, much needed, units to the other factions, additional maps, and beefed up the create a hero system. They also added a few heroes to some of the factions, like the Dale hero from the dwarven side.I heard that the War of the Ring additions are also great, but I haven't had a chance to dig into that.Overall, this expansion has peaked my interest in playing the game. I mostly play it on skirmish mode with other players. If you like the original, you will definetly like the additions with this expansion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Great Game, Much more difficult than the other Battle for Middle Earth Games.

All of this info is somewhat subject to change, and better the topic of a good magazine article.The Author (John Kumiski) no doubt has good knowledge of the fish and how to catch them. I would have better enjoyed a book formulated with his intense knowledge of the quarry and its habitat, and how to catch more of these fish.

Stevie's new vocals are out of this world, and for just the one song, the price of the cd was worth it. However, the whole cd is good! There are songs w/vocals, and some without.

I have worked with ASP for over a year, and this book was pretty much useless. The only redeeming factor was that I was able to get it from my local library, so I found out before it cost me any cash. The first part of the book delves into topics with zero explanation, and very little code, so you don't have a chance to get your feet wet with actual code, and the topics are dull and dry. The last portion of the book looks like it would be a nice reference, but honestly, why would you buy a book like this for a reference? Isn't that what the 'net is for?Two thumbs down.

It attempts to deal with Starbuck's weariness with war as well as the weariness of the population of the 12 colonies being in the depth of a thousand year war. The telepathic unicorns did not turn me off and I actually thought Starbuck's connection with one of them was carried off very well. Spectre was also a standout. This character was fleshed out more than he was in the tv show (and even in that episode, regardless of how well received it was, Spectre was one of the best guest characters to come along in BG).The Larson/Thurston novels were by far the best. (The Larson/Goulart novels were terrible, the writing horrible.) And this is the best of the first four Larson/Thurston's.

He decided to make a CD/DVD of recording the music of Mr. Johnson. He surrounded himself with great musicians and performed the music admirably. Not a true representation of Robert Johnsons music, but replaying it with EC's style and talent, backed up by guitars, piano, organ, drums and recorded in different venues that allowed EC his moment to pay homage to the man who had given him inspiration for Blues of the Americas.

It is attached to the camera by means of a two piece adaptor which is a terrible kludge. When installed, the edge of the filter can be seen through the viewfinder, obscuring the view of the subject. There has to be a better solution.Discarding those items, I am left with an overpriced AC adaptor, a cheap lens cleaning kit (I already have two) and some software which I didn't bother to try. I have no use for the tripod or for the smart media wallet. I am returning the kit and taking a trip to my local camera store.There were only a few items which interested me in the first place, and those didn't turn out to be of any value.

As with Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd, the playing is strictly cerebral, thought out, preplanned, not from the heart - not from the soul. I have only seen one player reach the level of Jimi and Stevie Ray, and that it Mato Nanji of Indigenous. Of all coinciedences, I saw him at the same New Orleans show aforementioned - Jake was opening for Indigenous.

Gorgeous music, played suberbly! Bartok combines Bach, Beethoven and Debussy with elfin wit, Hungarian folk music, and a modern attitude. With that modern attitude comes the occasional dash of dissonance, but this is music that is easily accomodated by any Romantic listener.

The tracks may not have the same depth and artistry that his music does now, but there's more to his playing here than just his technique. The two Sibelius pieces really show that he had that ability to sing with the violin, even back then. His technique, of course, is stunning, especially on Novacek's Moto Perpetuo, Sarasate's Carmen Fantasy, and Wieniawski's Variations on an Original Theme. Bell may put more passion into his rendition of Variations on an Original Theme nowdays, but it's worth it to hear how close to technical perfection he came in his recording.

Obviously these guys are very talented, this is very technical stuff.My only detraction, which I don't even know that it is one or if it is just part of the uniqueness of the album (reflected by the female T names), but it can be hard to distinguish between songs.

Many survivors stories, while compelling at times, begin to sound repetitive, and, strangely enough, leave the reader with a sense that not all has been told.It is also quite apparent that the author is a born-again Christian, as he often elects to print survivor contentions that they were saved from the storm by their personal Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Not that this is bad per se, but is does add to the repetitiveness of the narrative, and after hearing it once it seems superfluous, as well as adding a hidden agenda to the text.This is not a National Geographic-style book about Camille; it tends to stay on a base emotional level; hardly detached, never scientific, and certainly not the last word on the topic. A disappointment, in short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book. Not worth the read.","review":"Horrible book filled with numerous inaccuracies. Among the most noticeable was the part about the so-called \\"Hurricane Party\\".

It had decent sound and a good size of screen, but for all the trouble, it's not worth the money. Creative doesn't give a long enough warranty. I have a Creative sound card and sound system for my PC which have been wonderful, and my brothers each have a Vision M which has no problems, so I'm disappointed in the quality.

This requires using a paper clip to reboot it (don't leave home without one) and a nervous wait while it hopefully rebuilds the library without losing something. I have reinstalled the software 3x and ran the diagnostic at the unintelligible Creative web site to no avail.

Most significant, the documentation is grossly inadequate and fails to set forth how to utilize many of the most important features. For example, nowhere is it seen that in order to enable the resume feature when listening to an audio book, you have to shut down the unit. And nowhere does it indicate how to shut down the unit. Scrolling ahead and back is also a problem. If not done very carefully, the unit freezes and must be rebooted. The earphone connection is poor, often requiring jiggling to restore sound in both ears. The Ipod is a far superior unit. The only advantage of the Zen is its ability to use items downloaded from the public library. The Zen is a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the Major Problem.........","review":"The software doesn't work, the computer doesn't recognize the unit... .these can all be fixed.

I loved the size, the Outlook sync feature, and the FM tuner.However, it does keep freezing up when you disconnect it from a power source. And this time putting a tiny pin in the reset hole to hit the hidden button won't do anything. It won't shut off, and it's frozen on the beginning screen- it won't go anywhere else, won't hook up with the computer, and repeated attempts to reset are not working.It's very frustrating to not be able to access the reset button- one reason I think I will be moving over to the tried and true Ipod.

Once in a while I'll misplace a song and I can't find it. Also I broke off the on and off switch when my nail got caught on it while I was exercising. I still can get it on and off using a pen - but I never did like that switch. I like the \\"joystick\\" better than the ipod navigation pad.

I am a fan of Creative products and the Zen V Plus is another great one. It is really a neat looking player with a very nice looking display that is crisp. The navigation is simple to use although the little joystick is a bit tricky to get use to. I highly recommend this product both on style & function. One other bonus is that your music can be encoded using .wma format which can reduce the files sizes significantly (about 40% or so) allowing you to fit more music on it. My only complaint is that, as is typical with all non-iPod players, the accessories for the Zen V Plus (and Vision:M) are very limited and the provided software takes some time to configure properly to sync with your computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good - Randomly Stops Playing - Going Back","review":"Player stops playing songs randomly. No rhyme or reason, just stops. You have to hit play twice and the song starts where it left off. FM radio works very well, it's too bad it has bugs. I am returning mine and will try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY","review":"This player worked ok for about 3 weeks - just occasionally freezing. Then it started freezing several times a day, and the cursor would scroll down any menu without anyone touching the toggle switch. I couldn't choose any selection with the toggle because the cursor wouldn't stay on a selection. I returned it to Amazon & they exchanged it. They were great! Amazon's return department gets 5+ stars. The new player was fine for about 4 weeks & now it's again freezing constantly, but the reset button won't work. To reset, you have to let the battery run down fully, then recharge. It's really a shame, because when it's working it's a neat little player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Deal","review":"Worked great for a couple of weeks but now the firm ware quit working. This product is now not supported by Creative any more!First Amazon product to not work, all other products have been GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"light, easy to use, terrific options...highly recommend","review":"Operation and menues are very easy. Intuitive setup. Additional features -- movies, radio options are fantastic. Haven't tried sound recording and ripping audio.When installing creative software, don't really need all software installed -- I skipped audiable and few other free software packages.Many folks out there, keep mp3s in high definition recordings. Frankly, unless you're an extreme audiophile, anything over 128 bits is excessive thus you might be taking up 2-3X of space required. Zen software has a feature to optimize/compress mp3 during upload. Give it a try -- might save you lots of space.Don't forget to sign up for some podcasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable","review":"I purchased two Zen V Plus and both freeze quite often and have to be reset. The 4gb one screen has gone blank and this product is only 6 months old. If I had known I was going to have this much trouble with these units, I would have purchased cheaper products. I thought I could trust Creative Labs products. I've tried the online fixes and will send this product back to Creative Labs (for a fee of course) and I will post the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product except freezed in a week","review":"This's my first mp3 player. I purchase this one because it's the only flash memory based mp3 player that has bookmark capability. Listening to downloaded audio book is my main purpose.Menu is easy. Some functionalities need to read PC installed manual to figure out, such as how to setup bookmark.Problem is it stops working yesterday, five days after I bought it. First it froze, no button works. It recovered after I pushed reset button using a pin. In a few hours, it froze again. This time, reset is not able to bring it back. As soon as the screen is on, it froze, no matter how many times I tried. The thing I did yesterday is loading about 2G music into the player. It might have some issue when loaded with too much music, but, hey, it's a 4G player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Display went black, terrible warranty support","review":"Bought for my daughter in Sept but display began fading after a couple months and finally died in December. Annoying that it lasted just past the 30 day Amazon return, but not much more. Per Creative the cost is $25 non-refundable for \\"labor\\" diagnosing returns.That is outrageous! Over %25 of product cost for them to make it right (assuming they honor the warranty). Due to the lack of medium term reliability with the added insult of paying for warranty service, I will never buy another Creative product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Zen V plus mp3 player","review":"This works like a champ. I tried 2 other brands (shall remain nameless) and they both would freeze up out of nowhere. It works seamlessly with Rhapsody music service, which is what I use it with.

I highly recommend it.G"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work with mac","review":"If you are considering this product and you own a mac, I recommend you look elsewhere. There is a program that supposedly is supposed to work with a mac and this mp3 player (xnjb) but my mac didnt even recognize the player. In addition, I attempted to upload the firmware using my dads PC, but it failed to read the player on that too. Im not sure if it was defective or not, but it wouldnt read it on either computer. If you own a mac, go with an ipod and save your self some hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this because I didn't want to give in to the ipod monopoly. I was excited about the fm radio, but you rarely get reception. The organizer is just a waste of space. I never could figure out how to set the clock on it. But for about a year,it played back my music which is really why I bought it. Then the screen went out and I could only play the last album I listened to over and over. I downloaded updates and the recovery tool from Creative, but nothing worked and eventually the player stopped working all together. What a waste of money. And even though I didn't want an ipod, every accessory out there is designed with an ipod in mind. Sometimes, you just have to give in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Zen","review":"Great mp3 player.

This is my first MP3 player and so far, I am very pleased with it. Using the software to rip CDs was pretty easy and intuitive. Making playlists using the software was easy. The sound quality is quite good, in my opinion. The headphone shape could be better (they have a tendency to fall out of my ears if I try to walk around with them on). I haven't tried to put video on this, so I don't know how easy that is yet. I have downloaded some Zencasts, and that was easy. However, I do think people should know that they are very unlikely to be able to put 2,000 songs on this player - I believe 1,000 is the maximum one could put on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"charging from ac or car doesn't work","review":"This is a neat little device and i would rate it highly, except I purchased a charger for it and it will not charge except through the USB connection.

However, the frequent reset cancels out all of its good points.I have to reset it a couple of times every hour. I got to the point where I taped a pin to the back so I will be able to reset it where ever I go. The support site only tells you how to reset with no other advice.I'm looking to buy another player but don't think I can buy another of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I am very disappointed in this player from Creative. I own the Muvo Tx Fm by creative, and I love that player. The fidelity of the sound is incredible. The reason I did not go with another Muvo is because I needed more space so the 4gb zen v was the player I chose. Well, this player is cute and the ease of use is great, but that is where my infatuation ends. I found that a lot of my music sounds distorted when there are any bass notes played! I have changed the EQ settings over and over and it is horrible!!! I even tried just turning the EQ off. The sound was very hollow! I hate the sound on this machine!! I wish they had kept the type of sound they created on the Muvo for this player. I am contemplating sending it back for this reason alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Works well, but should come with a charger!Also, if your main focus is to watch videos, look elsewhere.

Then one of the MP3 players started to shut off for no reason and now it doesnt work. I had anther player and it worked well until one day when I plugged it into the computer. It said firmware error and was stuck on that screen. I tried to fix the problem but to no avail. Other reviews said the player stops after a year and I guess they are correct. I have two other Creative MP3 players and I really enjoy them. I hope they do not have the same problems as this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"XasPerating","review":"Nicely made, good FM radio, but refused to work with two different laptops using XP. Tried all the recommended fixes, and 10 hours later, I still had an expensive, small FM radio. Creative posts a couple of pages of recommended fixes which is a bad sign. Any product that carries such technical coattails needs a real design makeover. Maybe Bill Gates provided the technical know-how? Mine is going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...While it works","review":"I got the Zen V and I was very happy with it when I first got it, but after only 3 months the screen just went blank.

All I have been able to get is a auto response via e mail that says they will respond within 24 hours. I was never able to hold long enough to get to speak to anyone in their customer service dept.

My Last one was Creative Zen Micro which broke too just after first year so no warentee. Its headphone pin came loose. That too is suffered by many people (Search Google here too).

Nope. my iRiver Clix, niece's Nano and my MotoQ still work using those but not the ZEN. Tried Creative's \\"customer support\\".

Currently have four unabridged books, two one-hour pod casts, and several music albums and still have some memory. I'm not interested in the video, but it has some capabilities there. I recommend this product.Dennis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Just Fine... Until It Doesn't","review":"I bought the Zen V Plus because I wanted a player that could also record, something the iPods don't let you do. I discovered that it records at such a puny sound level that it's of very little use. That was fine, I still had a good mp3 player. But nope. After a few months, it suddenly locked up: none of the buttons would work. Not even the power button! There was no way to turn it off, and the battery wound down to nothing. Connecting it into my computer was no help, because the computer couldn't detect it. Creative's website has no troubleshooting tips, and neither does the owner's manual, so when your Zen Plus dies, it's gone, along with your money. I'll never buy anything from Creative again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy! You will not be disappointed","review":"The Zen V is an excellent mp3 player. I am very happy with this purchase.

This would never happen if you follow the instructions. You are supposed to plus it into a computer only after the software has been uploaded onto it.

I REPEAT THIS PRODUCT WILL BREAK. THIS DID NOT JUST HAPPEN TO ME, IT ALSO HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, AND DOZENS OF REVIEWS THAT I HAVE READ ONLINE.

The Zen V Plus is one of the few MP3 players with that capability.1st problem - the instruction manual is over 60 pages, 12 in English. None of which give adequate instruction on loading music into the player.2nd problem - it is incompatible with Windows Vista.I sent an email to tech support. Received a quick & complete reply. I was told that I needed to download 4 applications (99 Meg) to make the unit compatible with Vista, to be able to download audio books & manage files.In addition I was directed to a website to gain instruction on \\"How To\\" download music & audio books.I believe that a \\"complete\\" product should be shipped when it is sold.

I waited a minute, then tried to turn it off, but it wouldn't even do that. When I returned it that night, the light was still on. I couldn't figure out how to get the battery out, either. Getting songs on it was easy, but mine wouldn't create playlists without putting all of the songs in that entire section (album/artist) all on the playlist instead of a single song like I was trying to do.

Fortunately for me the original one started working again after the battery went flat and was recharged so I am going to give that away and hope that it continues to work.

Used it about 4 times since i bought it off Amazon, of the 4 times, it froze on me twice, once it freezes none of the functions work, cannot switch it off etc. the only way to get it working again is to reset the unit, which can be done only by a paper clip / pin (which is difficult to get on the subway or bus). Cannot return the product to Amazon as its past 30 day period, so stuck with it as long as it works.... thinking about contacting the manufacturer, may not have much luck there either.Remember to buy a box of pins along with this unit, looks like you will need it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned!!","review":"This was a great player while it lasted.

After some ridiculously awful dealings with tech support, I got my player back, with a new screen. Shortly afterwards, right after the warranty expired, my brother's ZEN's screen died.I ended up getting an iPod the next august (as part of a special promo deal with my Macbook) and it really was worth the slight extra cost. I've had no problems with it (other than the shoddy included headphones) and it is really a much better product over all.Although there are some very nice features on this player, I'd have to say that due to the experiences I have had with it, and my brother's player, I will not be purchasing any Creative mp3 players in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying software and horrid controls","review":"The control wheel and controls on this thing are horrid, screen resolution is equally as bad.

It is something that unites us all and at the same time, it shows our commitment as followers of Christ by actively participaing in prayer and the liturgies. We have studied this book in our adult Sunday school class and I have enjoyed every minute of it.

It has been a nightmare getting the TV back. My TV is basically being held hostage by Philips. The part is on back order with no end date in sight. They are the absolute worst Customer Service group that you could ever encounter. They give you nothing but canned non answers and are totally uncooperative and not helpful.

Philips offered to replace ours with a refurbished model for $450 - but when we looked up the retail price of a brand new model it was the same price!!!!

Doesnt matter what video setting you had it on (and mine was on automatic). Have to turn off and back on to fix problem.-I would lose audio from TV for no reason and I think that is a design error. Again, I have to turn off and back on to fix issue.-No sleep button.

Yes, it cooks ribs to \\"very tender.\\" My oven does that, too. As a crockpot, it leaves a great deal to be desired, because the temperature is not low enough and the seal is not good enough. The few things I've cooked (pork roast, beef short ribs, sauerkraut and kielbasa) have been fully cooked in less than half the time it used to take in my old, now-dead Rival crockpot. And it dries things out, too.It is huge, and takes up half a cupboard shelf in my kitchen.I think it's going to the rummage sale.

He is a BBQ master and we have BBQ all year, despite the temperature outside. It was lovely to go out all day and enter the house and smell the wonderful aroma of ribs cooking, ready after cooking all day in the BBQ Pit. The meat fell off the bone and melted on my tongue. I washed the pit afterwards. We had oiled the metal first with cooking oil and clean up was no harder than any other pan that had cooked meat. We cooked our ham in it on Christmas day and I think I let it cook too long. So far we believe the pit to be a winner. I would have preferred a timer so it would switch off automatically. You have to have a place to store it inbetween using it and its rather large. We put it ontop of the fridge. It's a good idea and we look forward to cooking a roast in it.

After replacing the dead battery that came with the remote control and installing the light in a very difficult location to get to, it would not operate at all with either the supplied motion sensor or with the remote control. After verifying the codes, I started experimenting and discovered that the light would operate if either the remote control or the motion sensor were activated within about a foot of the light. Needless to say, this defeats the whole purpose of having remotely located sensors or remote controls. Prior to purchasing the Heath-Zenith unit, I also have tried a similar unit made by Cooper. It worked for one day and then quit. Like I said in the beginning, this seems to be a great idea with a lack of follow-through.

I agree with most of his points on YOU ARE ALL DISEASED, but he's just not funny on this album. Carlin's attempts at humor here lie primarily in the exaggerations he uses when complaining about things, not in the subtle asides he mixes in with the complaints, as he did in BACK IN TOWN and JAMMING IN NEW YORK. The first time I heard YOU ARE ALL DISEASED, I didn't have a hearty laugh until halfway through the record. As I said before, I agree with most of his opinions here, but -- for humor -- on this album George is at the least creative and laziest point in his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no god.","review":"Truly his best work yet.

By this cd now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the George I Used to Know","review":"Like many people, I have been a George Carlin fan for a long time. I have always enjoyed his unique perspective and presentation. However, there is a disturbing trend in Carlin's comedy. George Carlin has shifted from astute observations on the inane events and occurences of our world to a disturbing bitterness that is very hard to enjoy. While at times \\"You Are All Diseased\\" is interesting and thought-provoking, most of it consists merely of bitter rants and anger. The album's angry mood culminates in the final track in which Carlin curses God. While Carlin has talked about religion before in many fun and interesting ways, he has reached an all time low in this album. If you want George Carlin at his best, look somewhere else. If you want angry bitterness that aims to shock, then this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST COMEDY CD EVER CREATED","review":"I have never laughed as hard or as often during any other CD than I have during this one. No cd has ever been as thought provoking either. From ripping on religion, to cigar smokers to over protective parents, this CD to me is the crown jewel in the George Carlin collection, every single track is funny, and the airport security track could almost be considered foreshadowing since this came out in 1998-99 and almost everything he says in the track ended up happening after 9/11. To me, that is sufficient proof that no one else is more qualified to comment on American Life than the greatest comic of all time, Mr. Carlin"},{"rating":"2","title":"God must be a man","review":"I bought this yesterday and started listening.

But, there are some problems along the way. A lot of the tracks toward the middle seem to be just a bunch of vulgarity. Not that there is a problem with that! I own all the Adam Sandler CDs, and a Chris Rock CD. I am used to the vulgarity, but on some of these tracks it seems a little pointless.

His interesting perspective on life provides many laughs, some of them quite hilarious. However, I found some of riffs unfunny, possibly at the expense of being overly preachy. Some people might argue that I just don't \\"get\\" him, but I do. I understand Carlin's shtick, and I've often found him hilarious, but it seems some of these bits just suffered from his pontificating too much for a comedy album. Personally, I look to Carlin for laughs, not social commentary (at least, not at the expense of humor), and in that respect, I think most anyone would be better served by any of Carlin's other efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carlin's extreme bitterness and poor sound quality on one CD","review":"What a sad excuse for a George Carlin CD. Bitterness and non-stop angry ranting are only supplements to George's talent but this album proves that even the best ones can have dull days. Not only that but the sound quality was horrible on this album. It is not difficult for one to listen to this album and hear the endless cutting and chopping of the sound as a result of editing.

For some reason McCartney went for this collection...for the most part lifeless, but (as usual) not without it's highlights. For my money, \\"Hope of Deliverance\\" ranks up there with the all time great Macca singles, and the two tunes co-written with Mr. Costello are fine as well (though check out the acoustic live duet with Elvis on \\"Mistress and Maid\\" on the LIPA concert recording for a little perspective on the \\"Off The Ground\\" version.)

After those, ... well, the Beatle/McCartney fans differ wildly about which others belong in this Top 5 list.However - if not at first - then in time, many Beatle/Paul McCartney fans ultimately come around to agreeing that \\"Off the Ground\\" has a legitimate claim to Paul's Top 5 Best Solo Albums Ever.The album cover may seem lame to some, with those hanging feet; or interesting to others, with the sunrise/sunset back/front theme.

This album sold pretty well, but nobody talked that much about it. And I think is better than many of Macca 'classic' albums. In fact for me it is up there with Band on the Run. All the lyrics are great, and the album is full of energy. He recorded a show for MTV (Up close), and he played songs from this album and some Beatles tunes. The new songs were up to the challenge. These songs are that good. If you still can find it, get the 'hope of deliverance' single, it includes 3 tracks that are not here but that are just as good. Really hope this album turns into a classic sometime soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor one","review":"I love Paul McCartney, but this one is quite poor. The songs sound all the same: two chords and that's all. Paul has written great things since he left the Beatles, but they're not in this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A STUMBLING ATTEMPT BY MACCA","review":"With the exception of \\"Hope of Deliverence\\" and \\"Mistress and Maid\\", this is typical substandard McCartney material. Some very nice melodies, but weak lyrics(these are the kind of lyrics that John would have gone after Paul about).Not a total loss(that would be WILD LIFE, RED ROSE SPEEDWAY and BACK TO THE EGG), but nothing to get excited about. Paul did this album by route and the songs lack substance(the b-sides from the \\"Hope of Deliverence\\" single are better than just about everything else on this album!). Paul clearly needed a co-producer that could edit his worst impulses.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor album","review":"This album is McCartney's worst since Wild Life/Red Rose Speedway. It's amazing that someone with so much talent can put out such a bad album. On a positive note, the album does contain songs with great melodies, but lyrically quite a few songs are really embarrassing.There are a couple of good songs such as Peace in the Neighborhood, Hope of Deliverance, and Off the Ground. But these songs are offset by really bad songs such as Golden Earth Girl, I Owe it All to You, and Biker Like an Icon.The lyrics to these songs are so bad, that they're unlistenable. Example: Golden Earth Girl starts out with the lyric, \\"Golden Earth Girl, female animal...\\" This from the most succesful musician in rock n roll history.Even as a hardcore McCartney fan, I can't stomach this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Just Never Know","review":"As I hear it this was some of his most original and energetic work of the time but most people don't like it. You just never know how people will react to music. Too often with a famous person the public decides in advance what they want and if what they get is any different they don't like it regardless of merits. I thought this had a fresh and rocking sound to is, but as with any piece of music any given person will either like it or they won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul McCartney - Off The Ground","review":"This CD is a good record of Paul, may be compared in quality to \\"Flowers Of Dirt\\" album which is the predecessor. There are pop songs well done and enjoyable and can be listened to over and over again without causing motion sickness easily. I believe the tracks, not necessarily in that order, are the best: \\"Off The Ground\\", \\"Hope Of Deliverance\\", \\"I Owe It All To You\\", \\"Winedark Open Sea\\" and \\"C'mon People\\". There is no bad track. It is true both for fans of Paul McCartney and for those who enjoy a good pop-rock. Very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Casette","review":"In the Casette I Have of This album There are 10 Minutes empty in Side B(Side of Cam'on People).10 Minutes unprovected That could put in There one or Two Songs More or Change one or two Song from SIDE A To Side B.The CD I Think only Ther are The song but not that Empty Space."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lost Early 90's Gem","review":"I heard this album in high school and brushed it off as older McCartney fluff, preferring The Beatles and his 70's stuff. But now having just heard it again it has aged quite well, almost like a fine wine. I remember seeing the \\"OFF THE GROUND\\" video and that song was and still is the best one. But there are very few fillers here. \\"Mistess & Maid\\" and \\"The Lover's That Never Were\\"are two other highlights. \\"Flaming Pie\\" still is his better 90's album but this is a worthy predecessor. So put this album in your cd mix with \\"Flaming Pie\\", \\"Driving Rain\\", and \\"Chaos And Creation In The Backyard\\" and have a Good Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only in Italian","review":"Do not buy this if you also want the English translation.

Time signatures and tempo markings are almost if not completely unreadable. Some pages have the barline running down the entire page despite there being three separate systems. The English is printed ABOVE the Italian, making it difficult to read, and both are in an identical font.

There is nothing new or insightful about this book. The legal pop culture references to television, movies & sensational trials - feel more like name dropping than useful information. Erin Brockovich in a law school guide? C'mon! She's never even gone to law school. Who needs to hear about how well Julia Roberts portrayed her in a law school guide?!? I did find the interview of Justice Stevens insightful...but again not enough to justify buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survival Guide sinks","review":"I expected more from JD Jungle. A barebones guide, only sparse and vague advice is given on how to study, how to brief a case, how to outline for exams, and understanding the IRAC procedure. A mere 1.5 pages were devoted to how to ace law school exams, for example. No example cases or practice briefs were provided unlike other law school prep books I have read.The only reason that I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1 was the engaging interviews in the last chapter. The chapter is entitled \\"Inspiration\\" and it did not disappoint.Such legal heavy-weights such as Erin Brockovich, Justice John Paul Stevens, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. are included in this chapter.In sum, I would recommend a different guide. Or, better yet, do it the free way~ online. I have gotten extensive feedback from online law student message boards and online advice columns (such as lawnerds)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best atlas for med school neuroscience","review":"I absolutely love this atlas!

But, that's not why I gave it a four. It was a good recording, good playing and fair taste in playing, or style. All was going well until the third movement of the second started. I've heard several recordings of it, and this has to be the one that left the worst taste in my mouth. Nothing is technically wrong, but I think he plays parts of it too fast, with too much pedal, and a myriad of other slight annoyances. The first movement of the third's cadenza is slightly irritating because of the rather slow speed it is played with. These things are very minor, and unless you happen to be a rachmaninoff nut, consider the rating a 5. But, if you are a rachmaninoff nut, consider the host of other recordings, but don't dismiss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"It doesn't get any better than this. As good, yes, but not better. I know whereof I speak; I am a pianist and teacher and I own seven cd's of the Rach 3. Each pianist has a slightly different approach--not enough to change the essence of the piece, but enough to put his own signature on it. I continue to be amazed at how many pianists can play it--being that it is recognized the world over as the most difficult concerto in the literature. Every time I hear a new pianist play either the 2nd or 3rd, I hear some phrase or section as though for the first time. Passages I never noticed in other interpretations are suddenly \\"out there\\" and give me a new and fresh take on them.

The characters prance one- demensionally from a badly researched high school history book. In particular, Ripley paints Lorenzo the Great to be too weak and womanish to be a convincing towel boy, let alone one of greatest powerbrokers in Europe's history. Aside from the many historical innaccuracies, this book is just too fanciful in its beliefs; such as that men just love to bring opinionated women on their male bonding trips and that rich and powerful men seek beautiful women merely as playthings when what they really want are cantankerous and homely soulmates.

I feel like she consulted a junior encyclopedia written in the 1920s for her history, then added the names of some Florentine artists and other personages. I was so disgusted with this that I tried to write my *own* romance set in the Italian Renaissance !!

I don't think I've ever heard her with so much control, emitting floods of glorious sound throughout the performance. Fiorenza Cossotto, who was Caballe's preferred Adalgisa, also delivers a stellar performance. And Carlo Cossutta has never been finer than here, as Pollione.

In fact, the lyrics read, for example \\"Drink, drank, drunk\\" (x3) or \\"swing\\" (x42). Dancers who just want to move a quick and energetic beat probably won't fret with the lyrics on this CD.

He has moved the message of the prayer out of the Church proper and back into street where it's enduring truths still hold. The heart of all wisdom teaching is embodied in the prayer's simple lines, \\"Where there is hatred, let me sow love.\\" What Nerburn has so effectively done in this book is tell stories that bring each line of the prayer alive and offer examples of it's profound blessing for our lives today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kent misses the boat","review":"There's a lot of good content in here, but there's a big problem, as I see it. Specifically, the chapter on the line \\"Where there is doubt, let me sow faith\\" is just completely off base. There is no way Francis would have espoused the universalist nonsense that Mr. Nerburn puts in here. He would never have thought that all religions, whether buddhist, muslim or whatever, lead to the same God. There's no way you can read Francis' writings and come away with that without some seriously revisionist thinking.In general, the author strays way too far from the Christian Gospel that Francis espoused and epitomized. What Francis was about was pointing to Christ, not just some new age rhetoric about how to live our lives, or some fuzzy feeling about the unknowable God. He pointed to Jesus who is the living hope, and the worship of whom is the chief end and aim of man. So if this is your first encounter with St. Francis, skip this book and read Englebert's or Green's biography instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent collection","review":"\\"Domain Specific...\\" is another excellent book from the \\"Fraemwork collection\\".

Revolving around the battle to hold the Chinese off until we can complete construction on three arsenal ships to sink the PLA Navy before they can land reinforcements, it rotates a lot between attempts to unseat the President in DC, the ground war fought by the President's daughter from the Gulf of Mexico right up to the Potomac River, a Special Forces trooper raising havoc behind enemy lines, and a half-Caucasian high-ranking Chinese politico running things. It's an excellent reason why the right-wing agenda of isolationism is a really bad idea for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL PAGE TURNER","review":"Chinese invasion of mainland America, unlikely, but makes for a great story. Harry weaves the story through tough battle scenes and personal characterizations. Hard to put it down. The book ends on an upbeat note, but I would love to see a sequal in which we take the war to the Chinese with the new Arsenal ships and aircraft under development.

Please write a sequal, Mr. Harry."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happens to the ending?","review":"This book is really disappointing. The ending is so abrupt it begs for a second half. The character development is too lengthy, with not enough focus on the battle scenes. In his previous books, which I enjoyed immensely, Eric L. Harry devoted equal attention to the \\"grunts\\" in battle, the ones we really cared about. In this book, I couldn't care less about the Chinese, their politics, or the president and his scandals. The ending, once again (it bugs me! :-)) is so forced. The repriation to the rebellous factions is so swift and has a brushed over feel to it. And what should be a whole half of the book, was half a page long. Unless Eric L. Harry comes out with a follow on book that blows my mind, I will start questioning his writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a review - a plea for a sequel!","review":"I've already written a review of Invasion years ago, and I'm just typing a plea for Mr Harry to finish the story - Invasion had such an abrupt ending you had to wonder why it was left that way.

I realize that you have to suspend belief to a certain degree to enjoy technothrillers, but this is quite a stretch. The reason that the best technothirllers are so good, is because they have some degree of believability. This story just didn't have that.

Harry, but he must have very little respect for the value of human life. Every other paragraph described a persons body being blown apart by shrapnel. What is even more dissgusting, is that he goes into detail about it. He also tends to favor women into that category, which is even sicker.What I cannot believe, is that Russia is totally out of the picture. Russia has second largest army in the world, and the largest nuclear arsenal. Don't tell me they just died off with the rest of Europe.I would recommend anyone reading this book, to stop reading it.

I really can find no redeeming value in it, other than the obvious humorous title and catch phrases. I am seriously at a loss as to how this woman became so popular. Maybe it is because our generation of moms (and I include myself) really don't know what we're doing and are searching, searching for someone to help guide us, and this woman just happens to be one of the funnier and do-what-feels-right advice givers. At one point in the book, she actually suggests reasoning with your toddler while they are throwing a tantrum. Please tell me that was another attempt at humor that went horribly, horribly wrong.... I say, don't waste your time on this worthless rag. You will get a few chuckles for sure, but there is nothing useful in here at all (unless you run out of toilet paper)."},{"rating":"1","title":"angry feminist author in the guise of humor","review":"This book provides a few funny moments, but is not so much a humorous take on parenting as an essay on feminist, ultra-liberal viewpoints.Three cheers to the author for acknowledging that there are many different kinds of families. And that motherhood can be so much different than acknowledged by mainstream parenting books and magazines.However, Ms. Gore allows her own politics to color the book much too frequently for my taste. I found her statement that only liberals can practice attachment parenting, and that political conservatives are insensitive parents that just let their babies cry, ridiculous if not insulting. It is great that she is a successful single mother; however she has a subtle anti-male, anti-nuclear family slant to her writing.Many may enjoy this book; I personally prefer the \\"Girlfriend\\" series by Vicki Iovine--much funnier and minus the male-bashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.. please","review":"I received this book as a gift at a baby shower. I thought it was going to be a fun read with insights on how to remain somewhat cool and not end up carrying around a Winne The Pooh diaper bag.Though there were funny moments, most of the book was angry commentary against anything and everything that didn't fit into her definition of being 'hip' (which appears to be unmarried, single mothers who live on welfare and hate anyone with different beliefs). For someone who claims to be open-minded she is sure closed to any person who is Christian, Republican, married, or has steady income. In some parts I was actually offended by what she was saying and I don't offend easily!Went straight into my middle-class Republican recycling bin after slogging through it.

She's funny & she writes about feminist issues without being too preachy. I guess my problem with this book is that it wasn't for me. I'm a liberal, young, hip mom -- but not hip enough I guess. This book is geared toward really young moms, unwed moms, poor moms, moms without traditional partners, moms without partners at all, moms without cars, moms without shelter, etc. Having a husband, a house, a car & some money in the bank made a lot of this book irrelavent. The author makes it seem that if you aren't fighting to just get by that you aren't hip. Well, fine, I'm not hip then, I guess.If you don't think you'll need to know how to get cheap legal advice to sue for custody, balance school & your kids from 4 different dads, or take the bus with your infant, you could probably just read another book.

Tight, sometimes quite progressive riffs adorned with harmonic squeals and never lacking in heaviness; this is a great new band whose guitarists come across like a hybrid of Pantera (in the super-agressive playing style and buzzsaw-like tone) and Meshuggah (in the complex time changes). Add the harsh, quasi-death metal vocal style and nihilistic lyrics, and the overall package is a great metal release. Recommended if you need a dose of the good old ultraviolence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soul beyond Compare","review":"Yes, I liked this book. I finished reading it in under 24 hours. That is a compliment all by itself! I thoroughly enjoyed the story and would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes a good believable ghost story; however the first three chapters are slow but interesting.

The recording of Mathis is actually brilliant, with the brass and strings creating some of the best music ever heard on cd. I was almost in tears the first time I heard these recordings years ago. I lost my copy and have recently purchased this recording used. Again, I stress, this is the best recording of these pieces you are likely to find.Some of the finest brass playing ever! Has an edge but never does one get a sense of the homogonized whole ever being lost... at times sounding like an organ.

Metheny, as good (and as underrated) as he is, is just going along for the ride, but that's OK, considering Ornette is the captain. This is even more intense than Free Jazz ever was, with the title track and the mammoth, epic workout \\"Endangered Species\\" standing out. This was/is a pretty radical album, and considering it was made in 1986 makes it even more remarkable. 1986 was not a year known for great jazz innovation. If they only had Yoko singing along, it would have been even more legendary than it already is. Fantastic, mind expanding music.

I think this is geared for someone who has experience with NT and wants to upgrade to Win 2000 active directory. There's nothing wrong with that. But I think perhaps the author should have been more clear on that so that people like me don't have to waste time and money to find that out. I also think that there seems to be no order to the book. It jumps around from subject to subject.

I figured, hey, I love reading, and I love food, so what could be better than a combination of the two? These stories are a meal that leave you satisfied.

To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. I didn't even finish the 2nd book b/c I was so bored with it. There is none of the usual Nora Roberts style in this book. Looks like she just wrote it to meet a deadline.

She just became unlikable.Sorry, I didn't even try to read the second story."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter disappointment","review":"if i could give this book 0 star i would. Horrible! The heroine in the first book is stuffy and overly conceited. There is nothing humble about her and as much as i tried to like her, ultimately found it impossible to do. I just could not find anything attractive in her personality, which by the way completely threw me off since the first impression of her was an absolute clash as to how her personality develops.

Delightful and humorous in its approach, a child can easily identify himself as the one who has difficulty in going to sleep, always finding just one more thing he \\"needs to do\\" before closing those eyes. I especially liked it because it showes the father putting his son to bed at night and giving him that hug and goodnight kiss.

They were packed in Chinese newspaper rather than bubble wrap, placed in an envelope and put through US mail. As a result, one spoon was broken in pieces when it arrived. Each broken spoon deducts from the bargain and increases the cost of the remaining ones since there's no point in the hassle of returning something at this price. I was willing to overlook it, but since using the spoons I'm really not impressed. They're too small for ice cream, the thickness of the spoon itself makes it uncomfortable to place in your mouth because it makes contact with your teeth, and they have no significant depth for soups. They also feel like they'd break if dropped in the sink or on the counter. I'm not glad I bought them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Beware the return policy of this company!!! Do not buy unless you KNOW what it is and you know you will not have to return it. The spoons ordered are too short and fall into the chinese bowls, meaning you have to fish the spoon out from the bottom of the bowl. Also, there is a hole in the ends of the spoons, so they look like they are meant to be hung as decorations, not usable soup spoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soup Spoons","review":"Spoons are much smaller than I expected... yes, ceramic and fit the description, but I was expecting more of a tablespoon size, not teaspoon size. The size of the spoon was not specified with the ad.

I'm not sure whether it was opened by the post office or it was sealed that way from the vendor. I will think twice next time I buy something from an FBA vendor... i.e. NOT sold by Amazon...

This book is set in England though, and even though there is still an Egyptian cast to the plot, it's more about chasing a gang of criminals in Victorian London. Amelia and her Emerson are totally charming, and in this book they appear to become even more human. Ms. Peters has a real knack for characterization. Even their precosious son Ramses become much more likeable in this outing. Amelia and Emerson are on the tail of mysterious priest who seems to leave dead bodies behind him. They get in their usual scrapes, and there's still the usual love interest in the book (although this one takes more of a secondary role in the story). The book is funny, endearing and utterly delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE EDITION?","review":"Why is this the only book in the series I'm not able to read electronically? This is a nasty trick. Amazon needs to explain..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully disappointing...","review":"I bought several Peabody mysteries based on wildly enthusistic reviews on this site. To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. The suspense level and depth of this book are on a par with Nancy Drew. Characters are so one dimensional, I was sick of them halfway through. The plot is predictable and the reader doesn't much care if the thing gets resovled or not. It is a well-constructed little formula mystery I would recommend for 10-12 year-old girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual Amelia Peabody","review":"This is not your usual \\"solve the Egyptian mystery\\". Amelia is more human, jealousy rears and the mystery takes second place. The ending is more Victorian novel than you would expect. However, it is a delightful tale of the \\"human\\" Amelia and an interesting solution to the mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes it works","review":"I was a bit sceptical at first, but I really noticed a huge difference in colour in only 3 days.

While it still worked, the pump made odd sounds, but it did function properly. It quit working completely just after the 30-day return window closed.

The water troughs were not aligned, so water poured / splashed all over the place. Further, the pump was missing parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds beautifully","review":"I love it but I gave it a rating of 4 due to the fact that the fountain was destined and ultimately placed on a wooden table and the water splashes so now I have to consider the following:a) Purchase some sort of cover without taking away from the look of the decor-or-b) Move it somewhere else - least favorite option.I have reviewed some of the comments before purchasing and some of the comments relating to the length of the cord must be old. This piece came with a long enough cord and the reach for turning it off and on is more than adequate. I love the sound and it looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Disappointed...","review":"Bought this for someone for Mother's Day. Received it in a timely fashion. Made of real slate, and beautiful, so that was excellent. However, I decided to take it out of the packaging and give it a test run before I gave it as a gift, and boy, am I glad I did. The fourth side of the reservoir was not mortared properly to the other sides, causing it to leak water when filled. It defeats the purpose of having a fountain. I would like to know who allowed this kind of poor craftsmanship off the line and into the hands of a consumer. I will be returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series helps you learn those tests!","review":"This nice, big book with wipe-clean coated pages is great to have around the home or barn. You can trace out the tests with a grease pencil or crayon (to help you learn), or stash the book in your tack trunk, and it stays nice and new. Horses can bite, stomp or lick it and it won't tear.The diagrams are big and nicely drawn step by step. Helpful, durable books and I believe the whole series is avaialable all the way up to Grand Prix.

But as far as I know, this is his only recording with piano accompaniment: in 1987, at NY's Carnegie Hall. So it's a unique opportunity to hear the familiar voice in all its pure clarity, devoid of orchestral support, and to listen to Pavarotti singing baroque songs and arias, religious music, and lieder, as well as his trademark opera arias and neapolitan songs. And the tenor gives each piece its specific meaning and style: from the spiritual unction of 'Pietà, signore' to the joy of 'La Girometta'. Great piano accompaniment, specially in Listz's sonetti."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointment","review":"The CD never arrived. I am very sorry about that.

In a section where they are telling about episodes that were not televised in the U.S. they show a picture of big breasted females. As a reader of this book, you can't overlook this picture because the female with the biggest breast is holding her big breast. On another picture in the book there is a lady with breast so big that her face looks like it is off in the distance. The closeup is on her breast.[...] This book is not the best choice for young Pokemon fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the OEM XBL Headsets","review":"A lot more comfortable than Microsoft's Xbox LIVE Headset and reasonably priced as a 3rd party option.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good until it suddenly broke","review":"When I first received this headset, I was pleased that it was much more comfortable than the standard Microsoft headset.

However, after the first month, the speaker on the headset cut out. My friends told me they could still hear me because I could speak through the microphone, but I had to listen through my TV speakers to hear their voices. A week later, I purchased another one of this product and sure enough, after less than one month, the headset speaker cut off, and I could still talk through it. If it hadn't broken the two times bought a different one of these headsets, I would have been happy with it.

When i received it in the mail i plugged it into my controller and started playing online i couldn't hear crap or talk to anybody with it. Also the way it's made feels cheap, and the regular 360 mic feels like it's built firmer and stronger than this. It was brand new but already broken.

So buy this product with caution because you never know when this piece of crap will break or if you receive it in the mail it already might be broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really cheaply made.","review":"The earpiece fell off the first time this item was dropped on the ground. Looking at the construction, I'm not sure how this could happen unless it wasn't actually attached in the first place. I've since disassembled it to try and put it back together - it's just a screw that apparently wasn't put through the earpiece molding, but it's put together in such a way that this is basically going to be impossible for me without actually soldering and stuff.

These are cheaply made, so you get what you paid for...pay a little extra and get a better pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much point in getting it","review":"I bought this because it was rather cheap, it had an ear that wasn't covered, and the reviews mainly seemed good. While I've only owned it for a matter of a few weeks and can't speak for the lasting quality, it seems well put together as of now. So why is it getting a bad review? Well, it costs more than a normal Xbox 360 headset, which I assumed would mean better quality. In actuality it's the exact opposite. While the mic does make me sound way more like I actually do as compared to the regular headset, it picks up my voice half as well as the regular Xbox headset, so others hear me quieter, and if I move the mic closer to my mouth to attempt to fix it, it picks up my breathing too. Along with this, it sits atop my head just plain uncomfortably because of the irregular curve of it and the voices I hear through it sound rather muffled. Might as well just buy the Microsoft one and save a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad mic","review":"By seeing all the good reviews and also seeing that it was made by Plantronics I thought it would be a well done mic. Though I guess you get what you paid for. The sound was very bad. You can not hear the person your talking to. Also you have to shout into the mic for them to hear you. I had other mics that were the same price but a lower brand work better than this. Its sad because I really do trust Plantronics for everything. Sad they make a bad headset for the xbox"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the buy.","review":"This headset is cheap but fulfills its purpose.

Not worth sending it back, but I definitely don't recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...","review":"You have to practically put the mic in your mouth for it to pick up your voice. Not what I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Alternative","review":"I actually purchased these because, in my excitement to get my XBox 360 up and running, I never noticed that it came with a headset. I have used both since, and these are a good alternative to the standard XBox 360 model. I do wish the the headpiece opposite the earpiece extended further down as it stops about 2 inches above my ear, but the headset stays on reliably and shouldn't come off short of you tossing your controller (which the headset plugs into) to the ground. On the plus side, the microphone is easily adjustable and seems to have a good sensitivity setting. A quality accessory, overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Experienced a poor product","review":"I have returned two of these so far. Both times the reason has been the earpiece. I was able to be heard on the mic but the audio stopped working. In a period of a minute or so, it went from full volume to about 20% to being able to hear nothing. Again, I experienced this with two different shipments of the same headset. This was VERY gently used during the short time I had it. Adult use only, no children. I applaud Amazon's return policy as it is hassle free and I did not suffer any financial loss. I'll be back to researching a better product for gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive Gamer's Dream","review":"A much better headset than the Microsoft one for around the same price. A couple reasons why...1) Thicker and better plastic used, so the head part doesn't feel as if it is about to snap in half2) The mic is easily adjusted and doesn't need to be touching your mouth for you to be heard3) Doesn't shift around on your head, and isn't uncomfortable4) The ear piece has a hinge-type movement to it, allowing a closer and better fit on your ear and head5) Comparable quality to turtle beach, without the price and exclusion of game sounds6) Perhaps most importantly, the mic controls are clearly labeled, so you don't have to guess how to turn on the mic or change the volume.I have had this mic for at least a month now, and it is a solid product. Don't hesitate to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Xbox's, but still broke","review":"This headset is better than the one the comes from Microsoft but its still not great.It does what it is supposed to do. I can talk through it on xbox live and hear others.The main problem is that these headsets are not made to last. This one snapped after a few months. I tried to tape it up but it was uncomfortable.Get some turtle beach headsets. They are quality, last a long time, and are worth it for games like COD. I am glad I did because I kept wasting money on the cheap plastic ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mic","review":"I had this mic for about 9 months until it suddenly stopped working. I'm pretty sure that I might have broken it myself though. This mic is so much better than the one that comes with your Xbox 360.

I'm about to purchase this mic again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Microsoft Headset","review":"I have gone through several XBox headsets because they broke.

Though they're definitely not black and green as the video review shows. Which was the whole reason I got them. They're the same set shown in the picture. If I had to buy them all over again, I'd probably just get the standard microsoft set. They're slightly cheaper and actually match the 360 slim controllers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Durable","review":"After going through 4 xbox headsets, one pair of turtle beach X11 and another brand I can't remember in about 8 months time, I got tired of spending money on headsets that break or short out. I ordered this one and am extremely happy to say that 6 months later this headset is still fully fuctional with no problems what so ever. And my son absolutely loves it. The sound is good, it's very durable, plugs right into the xbox controller, and my sons friends can hear him crystal clear. Extremely satisfied with this product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting the Job done so far","review":"Had this headset for about a month now and it's working just find. Havent had a major problem with it yet. The only minor problem is when playing for a long period the headset starts squeezing your head, well it atleast feels that way. But its not like an extreme discomfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small, poor mic","review":"The headset is very tight, and the way that it expands it's size actually puts lots of pressure on your head. It gave me a headache after 20 minutes of play. Also my friends had lots of trouble hearing me no matter how close the microphone was to my mouth. Finally the controls being on the wire are annoying because its hard to find the volume control or the mute button quickly and sometimes it will swing as you play. Luckily I found my original xbox headset and am using that without any trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality - Does what you expect","review":"This headset is much better than the included 360 headset. I had a wireless headset, but I got tired of charging it all the time. My wireless headset was constantly disconnecting and reconnecting. This headset is comfortable, loud enough, and low priced. I like it. Plus it's black and green for those of you with black controllers."},{"rating":"1","title":"headset.....no different than original ones","review":"i dont see the difference between these and the ones that came with the xbox to warrant the higher price. also, the mic switch is harder to get to than the original ones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio cut-outs happen all the time in Xbox Live chat","review":"Like some of the other reviewers here, I'm having issues with this device not properly transmitting audio to the headset. The microphone works fine, so other people can hear what I'm saying, but I can't hear them during long periods of time. I've tried messing with my wireless settings on my router, but WoW seems to run fine with minimal latency so I have to believe its a problem with the headset as opposed to my network configuration. It's cheap, and you get what you pay for here."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"i bought this and within a moth i found out that the wires for the mike were ripped were you talk so it was a waste of $20.00.

For my money, Taylor is the most insightful, empathetic and humane preacher around today. Her sermons lead us down paths where we travel inside our souls to discover the power and challenges of life move to percolate and be resolved. She brings the power of God into play in our daily lives.When I first started this book, I read a number of sermons together. I decided that this was not appropriate. This book should be savored, reading maybe one sermon a day. This allows time for meditation and contemplation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding a Fellow Traveler","review":"After reading quotes by Barbara Brown Taylor in a couple of other books, I checked out her book on Amazon and found it fascinating reading. I ordered the book and found it to be my own spiritual journey in another life. I couldn't put it down. It is full of expressions of her faith experience that speaks to my own. If you find yourself on the outskirts of the mainstream denominations of the Christian faith, you may find Taylor's book helpful in describing your own parameters of your faith journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL sermons!!","review":"From this author's background comes the wisdom to write profound truths wrapped inside simple stories that delight one's mental appetite and creates a savoring for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the Novice","review":"\\"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\\" can satisfy almost no one who knows the rules of the game. I'm deeply puzzled, in fact, why the book was written. Those who know the rules will gain nothing from it. The book does contain many lists that show how one can get from X to Kevin Bacon, but this information is found far more quickly on the web. Some of the lists in the book are not the most efficient, to add to the problem. Would-be-readers hoping to find a 7-degree or 8-degree Bacon number will not find one here, the only reason I can understand for purchasing a book on this subject. Perhaps it is a book that has outlived its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better in person","review":"This set is one of the cutest themes for a baby girl at babiesrus today.

Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra are simply magnificent! Ma Mere I'Oye is played with such sweetness. Le Tombeau de Couperin conveys such swirling emotions. Daphnis et Chloe is simply spellbinding. The Bolero...wow! It is hard to convey the emotions of such a wonderfully performed and engineered collection of Ravel's works here. If you love Ravel's music, you will love what Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra have done here with this exquisite collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"western influences on chinese pop culture","review":"a really good read, short, but it gets a lot of informationaccross. really covers everything from soap operas tomovies to mtv, it puts forth some very interesting viewson subjects that most books on china do not even cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Evidence?","review":"This is a \\"legal mystery\\" story centered on a criminal trial. The defendant is indicted and prosecuted on an alleged crime committed thirty years ago. The prosecution does not have a scintilla of evidence against the defendant.

There are only a few good cards like Relinquished (still, not a very good card), Megamorph, and Axe of Despair. All three of those cards can be found in starter decks (Relinquished in the Pegasus deck, Megamorph in the Kaiba evolution deck, and Axe of Despair in the Yugi evolution deck. It's also a little bit of money for something that isn't worth buying. Don't listen to the people that say that cards like Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon, and Toon Summoned Skull are good! Trust me on this, I made it to the finals of a tournament without Toons. When I first opened one of these packs, I thought I would get something great, but I didn't. To wrap it up, this is a bad buy.

This is a great gift for the holidays and any yugioh fan will LOVE it. Most boxes will contain very useful cards. Unfortionitaly I did not get the blue eyes toon dragon.

For whatever reasons, the newer knobs require larger holes.... I've been remodeling \\"mid century\\" houses lately.Pros: It's cheap. Gets the job done. If you're drilling a couple of doors for your house, buy this one and then be prepared to just throw it away.- When you're using this, stop when you're halfway through the door and clean out the sawdust. Otherwise it'll stay clogged and just spin. If it stops going in, take a screwdriver and break out sections of the wooden plug.Cons: Dulled very easily.

When I saw these available for Subscribe and Save for about the same price per oz (these are 5-pound bags), I thought I was in heaven. However, these do NOT taste the same as the bears in the 3-pound bags. Those come in gold bags and for some reason, taste sweeter. These are blander and have a little bit of an after taste.That said, I still prefer these over any other type of gummy bear.

If you've never tried them before, they can seem quite hard at first, but I think this gives them a nice texture that doesn't melt in your hand or your mouth. You can chew them and the flavor lasts and you don't end up eating as many. A great fat-free, though high sugar and calorie, candy that will last forever in the 5-pound sized bag. I recommend immediately transferring them into a gallon-sized Ziploc (or other brand) freezer bag so that they stay fresh. If they are exposed to air for a prolonged period of time, they will become even tougher and eventually impossible to chew!

They're even shaped like tiny fragments of Mount Rushmore -- doubly impressive for a German candy that never even witnessed South Dakota.If you need a solid gummie, go for Target's Market Pantry brand or whatever Area 51 concoction going on at Saratoga Sweets in Clifton Park, NY.

Everything works as advertised. The watch never fails to draw attention. The interactive instruction manual (also available on Citizen's web site) does a good job of instructing users on some of major features of the watch.I did return the watch for only one reason: I can't quickly read off the time and date from the watch. This is the major reason why I wear a watch. The busy dial and very small numbers and letters in the non-backlit and low-contrast LCD subdials affect the readability of the watch. My aging eyes just cannot cope with such small letters, and the slide rule numbers on the bezel are almost imposssible to use without resorting to a magnifying glass.Bottom line: A great watch with many features, but hard to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Eagle Skyhawk","review":"Although I have one Citizen Blue AngelSkyhawk, I was impressed with the look and readablilty of the new Black Eagle edition. The case, strap and dial are all black with white hands and reversed digital display. I have to admit the reversed digital display gets some getting used to, but the watch is worth the effort. It affords all the Skyhawk options (dual timezones on one dial, UTC subdial, AM/PM indicator, lots of alarms, countdown timer, chrono and 32 city timezones) and is a beautiful looking timepiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid watch (may be too solid)","review":"I got this watch last week and I love it so far.

Because Bret Hart is such a self important ass the bite has completely been taken out of this making of this video since they had to have his permission on everything, watch the Ultimate Warrior video for example of what I'm talking about. While something like the '97 Survivor Series is covered, it only really gives Bret's side of the story while McMahon has very little to say - in other words it's just the same thing you've already heard a million times.The matches on the video are decent and if you're a big Bret Hart fan you're going to buy it just for that, but if you're not I'd spend my money on something else like the much more interesting Jake the Snake Roberts video."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crybaby!","review":"Just when you think you hear the end of Bret Hart, he comes out with a dvd.

The only thing I wished he did was add at least the match against Ric Flair and he first won the WWE title in it's entirety. I highly recommend it to add to your WWE DVD collections.

In a time where shoot interviews and behind the scences expose's. No other wrestler put on a performance in the ring like the Best there is was and ever will be Bret Hart. Some people's intros or interviews get them over. In this case Bret Hart's heart and talent skill made him the best. Nothing else did but talent. Eventually the heat he created once he turned heel showed he could do it all. He could be the biggest face since Hogan and the biggest heel in the company. Bret was the best wrestler performer and excelled in the bestest platforms. His matches all had that big match feeling that most of the new guys can not seem to capture.

We would highly recommend this book to sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. it has high vocabulary and it is confusing because of the Japanese names, but it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Samurai'sTale","review":"This is a great book to do fo a report. If your teacher wants you to read a book about the Medieval period read this book it covers a lot about medieval Japan.

I hated it because it was so boring. The majority of my class thought it was boring also. The story is about a boy who was a samurai's son and then he was turned into a servant. After many boring chapters, he became a samurai. It sounds like an interesting book with lots of excitement. There is almost no plot. Nothing happens that is actually interesting. I made a survey in my school to see what people thought of the book. Most people thought it was boring and pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was ok","review":"the book was pretty good, but it was spoiled by the fact that i had 2 read it as a class assignment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I had to read this book for an 8th grade book critique.

It seemed so long and boring. And it was. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it was really bad. It had to many complicated names to understand and it didn't get to the point. You had to read so much just to even know were you were. There was no plot to the story it was all just scattered around. I like reading but this book was really bad and if someone asked me if they should read this book I would encourage them not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG no no","review":"This book was a truly amazing stor...NOT!!! I absolutely hated this book. It was boring and didn't really have much of a point to it. I am thirteen years old and I would never recommend this book for teenagers. If you are younger and enjoy learning about japan and war, then go ahead. Same for adults. But for 12-16 year olds, don't even pick this book up. In class, we had to write \\"cliff's notes\\" for it, and I skipped from chapter 12 to practically the ending because i didn't like it so much. I am sorry if I offend anybody who likes this book, but I despised it every moment. I hope my review helped you decide whether or not to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an action-packed page-turner!","review":"This adventure will stay with you and won't let go. We are 5 sixth graders who were assigned \\"Samurai's Tale\\" by our language arts teacher. It kept us reading for nights and we ended up finishing weeks before the deadline. This story takes you through the feudal period in Japan with a young orphan named Taro; his dream is to become a samurai just like his dad. Read The Samurai's Tale to see if Taro's dream comes true."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bland book","review":"I read this book in connection with a unit on Japanese history. There aren't too many positive things I can say about this book, but one of it's strengths is the fact that it accurately depicts the era it is placed in, and how important social rank really was. As a story however, this book was dull, slow, bland, depressing, rigid, antisocial, and boring, and there is no break in this pattern. As a book about a samurai, a fearless warrior who lives by Bushido, I expected there to be more fighting. Not only was there very little combat, but it was cut short, and sometimes even skipped. The book made me feel like I was frozen in time, and I usually attempted to forget that I had to read a few chapters daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Its a good book to read but have to pay attention to all the different names.

Another great book that makes a collector drool over the different lamps that were made during that era. Unfortunately, most of the lamps are out of the price range of your average collectors. However, if one keeps an eye out on auction websites, you might get a lucky find. For a serious collector or one who dabbles now and then into the deco world, this book is a great find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful book but little substance","review":"I must say that I was greatly anticipating this book and had preordered the book. I have been to the author's store in New Hope and, although very pricey, had thought the store offered a good selection of Art Deco Lighting, including items made by Frankart, Nuart and Ronson. I was deeply disappointed when I received the book and found no Frankarts -- often viewed by collectors of American Art Deco as some of the best lamps made during the period and highly collectible -- with a few mediocre Nuart lamps pictured. The book is beautifully photographed and very clearly is a labor of love. It is just a great shame that there is little real substance included in the book to give a good overview to those who either truly collect, or are learning more about how and what to collect, lamps from the Deco period. I hope some other author provides a better offering the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"This could have been my story","review":"When I took up this book I could not put it down until I was finished.

This item certainly fits the bill. The price is so low (for Lego products) that I really didn't expect much from it, but it turned out to be a great little set! He spends hours putting it together and acting out scenes with Tygura and the professor. He also has gotten hooked on reading the Orient Expedition comics at the Lego site, and now he's asked for more pieces from this line for Christmas!

(Her scathingly humorous analysis of Corporate America really hit home for me, a similarly shipwrecked survivor of 2, count 'em 2, international corporations that went under due to outrageously blatant executive malfeasance.)

The singer chosen to head up this version of a \\"band\\" creates a feeling similar to fingers on a chalkboard. Can't really say what Neal was thinking when he chose him. Neal is, and has been, one of the finest guitarists out there. Although he did manage to pull off a few good solo riffs on this album, it is mostly disappointing. For good quality guitar playing, you would be better served with \\"Beyond the Thunder\\" or \\"Electric World\\". Those two are classic Neal Schon at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"tryin too hard (again)","review":"neal is (was?), without a doubt, one of the finer rock players around... when he has a good band to play off of. this, like all-things-minus-steve perry, just gets on my nerves.too much, too much... bombast. the singer reminds me of sammy hagar meets meat loaf. damn, relax, man. that goes for the rest of the band, too...i keep hoping for neal to release something that moves me like \\"stone in love\\", \\"departure\\" or anything from that great 1981 tour...ugh. sorry. this disc just irritates me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Listening Time","review":"What a disappointment this album is. I figured that, given the subject matter (blues) and Neal's impressive playing capability, this album would be great. Was I ever wrong! This is definitely not Neal's best work (but, to date, is his worst). In fact, the guitar playing on some of the tracks is more of a distraction than a pleasure. Also, the mixing quality of the album is pretty bad and listening to the lead singer is like doing time -- this guy can't carry a tune to save his life. About the only good tune on the CD is the instrumental called \\"Blues for Miles\\" and even this tune sounds a bit muddy.My recommendation: Save your money by not buying this CD. If you want to hear some great guitar work by Neal, check out some of his other solo efforts or the Abraxas Poole album he did in '99 with some of his old Santana/Journey mates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blues is not Neal's forte...","review":"Although Neal is one of the best guitarists to ever grace a stage...or a recording studio, he has missed the mark with this one. Just what were you thinking, Neal, when you chose this singer. His voice is like fingernails on the proverbial chalkboard. Except for a couple of good solos here and there, this album is far from Neal's best. For those wanting to hear his better post-Journey work, tune in and turn on to \\"Beyond the Thunder\\" and \\"Electric World\\".

Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster is a triumph of stock footage and budget film-making. Shot on a small budget over the course of two weeks, the film spared every expense, making use of both free locations to film and a record amount of stock footage; a certain hillside in Puerto Rico will endear itself to you many times.We as Americans have made countless movies that stand as cultural icons. Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, I would argue, is among them for its sheer absurdity and impact on future films. It is often the golden standard against which other schlock films are judged.This film doesn't take itself too seriously. Don't judge it too harshly.

The musicianship is great, as expected, but the album as a whole lacks that certain something special. Too much of it sounds like today's forgettable mainstream country radio.

For a real 90's Burritos classic, skip this one and try \\"Eye of the Hurricane.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Weak","review":"By attempting to cut straight to the meaning of the book, you're shortchanging yourself and your own understanding of the meaning.

Pain whom, Frodo or Gollum? Lists of principal characters are just useless. But the book's greatest flaw is its attempt to link Tolkien to the primary world, in statements like \\"Tolkien's Council of Elrond is fashioned after the United Nations\\" (p. 92), or an unintentionally hilarious attempt to prove Tolkien unwordly by listing world events of the 1910s (why just that decade?) which he isn't known to have mentioned in letters (p. 7).

But you do need to be careful as the contact points should have the padding extended around the sharp edges at the bottom that catches the tablet. If your iPad shifts or you don't place it in the stand with caution, you've now got a tiny ding in your brand new iPad's aluminum bezel!Very disappointed this happened to my top of the line new iPad with 64GB and 4G the first day I used this stand. But problem can be avoided by visiting an office supply store and applying your own foam tape where necessary. I just think it should have come properly padded out of the box to avoid damage to your device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for my Xoom!","review":"Its perfectly engineered. So simple and light weight. Adjustable and stable. Get this for your tablet. On the xoom if you want it charging while on the stand you just flip it upside down.

It holds the iPad2 that is in a leather case with no problem, is very sturdy, and the rubber feet make it non-slip.Dont over pay for something this simple - get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE it","review":"This is by far the best stand I have ever had. It works landscape, portrait, this angle and that angle, folds up to almost nothing! I take this with me anywhere my ipad2 goes.There are only 2 negatives but certainly not worth returning it1) The only way to use this with the charger is in landscape mode. Like I said, not huge but worth knowing.2) It seems that most of the time when I charge my ipad2, the charger is coming from the left. When you put the ipad in landscape with the button on the left, I inevitably end up sitting the volume buttons right on one of the legs. I can adjust it to make it work pushing it to one side or adjusting the width of the legs, but it was a little frustrating right out of the box.Well worth it. I may purchase a couple of more and give them as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I purchased this stand to use with my new iPad and it just works. iPad sits solid in portrait or landscape mode, even with my iPad still inside it's leather case. I also use it with my Kindle (and it is in a leather case as well) and have zero complaints. It is small and lightweight and fits folded into the smallest space, no problem. I highly recommend this product.My only complaint: Considering it is just made from plastic, the price is a bit high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!","review":"I agree with the other reviews this is a GREAT product!!

I have a wireless key board for my iPad 2 and this stand makes it so much easier to use. It is worth the money even if you don't need to use it all the time. I use it for videos, work, games and much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand with only one small flaw","review":"This is a great little stand. Lightweight, compact, and very sturdy. The ONLY reason I would rate this stand at 4 instead of 5 stars is because the base of the stand comes in contact with the iPad's volume lever, either raising or lowering the volume, when the iPad rests horizontally on its right side. And even at that, the pads of the stand grip the iPad firmly enough that it isn't really that big of an issue. Simply rotating the iPad 180 to its other side solves the problem. Although it is irritating to have the main iPad button on the wrong side, it's a small price to pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine on the Kindle Fire 8.9","review":"Since Amazon does not have a speaker dock, or charging station for the 8.9 Kindle Fire; I purchased this stand for my device while charging. The plastic feels tough and durable. My Kindle Fire 8.9 rests easily in the grooves, even with the roo case. However, if you want to charge your device in landscape mode [i.e. horizontal], the charging port has to be facing upwards, since there's not room for the charging plug to clear the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and works fine","review":"I use this with a Nook Color. After setting it up properly, it works fine in both portrait and landscape. However, there's not enough room on the bottom of the stand to charge the Nook Color when in portrait.I do not use this for travel. It sits on my desk and I usually put the Nook Color on it in landscape so I can easily charge it.A great product, but the soft material attached to the plastic stand to keep your gadgets from scratching is pealing off. I've had this stand for a little over a year.I would recommend getting this if you need a cheap stand for your tablet. In theory, it should work with most, if not all, tablets on the market. But I would be weary of the charging situation. You probably cannot charge your device while in portrait mode if the charger is on the bottom of your device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Just what I needed, the right price, and a quality built item.

The Kiosk in the Mall wanted $40 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the best iPad stand!","review":"I bought two of these, one for me and one for a friend. Both stands are great! I'm very happy with how compact they are (they easily fit in your pocket - or in my case, my purse and bookbag) and how many different angles they allow for viewing. It works in both landscape and portrait mode, and I haven't had an issue with the charger not fitting in portrait mode - I just flip the iPad upside down and it solves the problem. I use my iPad in class, and this stand makes it so I have a sturdy surface to type, take notes, or scroll through my notes on. Would definitely buy again (I'll probably end up buying a couple more just to have as back ups in case I loose this one!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed and Cheap","review":"Pro's: portable, folds down small, lightweight, fits iPad with a case on, many options for angling iPadCon's: cheaply made plastic, rubber pads come off easy, collapses if a small amount of force from tapping/touching the iPad, at certain angles in portrait mode the charge cord either won't fit comfortably or is bent too much, overpricedBased on the cons mentioned, I'm looking for another stand that is more sturdy so I can tap/touch the iPad screen without worry of collapse and so I can comfortably charge my iPad in either landscape or portraight mode without fear that the cord will crimp.

I asked for this to support my gTablet, and it does so perfectly in horizonal position, which is the way I display my tablet most often. I haven't used it much in the vertical setting, but it seems stable enough so long as you aren't hitting the top of the tablet for typing or using any sort of force...after all, it is a touch screen!The settings for the stand are preset and click...as a general rule, I tend to leave it in one set position, so I haven't had any degradation of the notches for each of the clicking adjustments, but I can see where, with time, these notches may wear with time. For now, it is a wonderful item and I am very glad my brother had the insight to order it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple goodness","review":"Super simple stand that is portable and sturdy.The product was definitely larger then what I had imagined but anything smaller would not provide sufficient stability.

It is very sturdy to view horizontally and vertically with great angles. I was worried the bottom arms wouldn't be narrow enough to hold the tablet vertically but they have many clickable options that work fine. Honestly, there could be a better version of this stand just to shave a couple inches off the back of it. I do like having an overly sturdy stand that works perfectly though, highly recommend, I will probably get many more of these for several locations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with Pandigital Novel 7\\"","review":"Well constructed little stand. Only 4 moving parts, the 2 bottom legs,(with foam pads to prevent slipping) pull out and have 2 stop points, 1st stop point the legs are 3.5 inches apart, 2nd they are 6 inches apart. 1 inch wide V shape slots, with foam pads, hold the tablet in place. The center leg has 2 moving points, both moving points are zig zag interlocking teeth, 20 positions on the bottom section, 7 positions on the center point.

But it works just fine with the Kindle, both with and without the case, in both landscape and portrait orientations, and with or without the audio and USB/charging cables attached.And there are enough adjustments to set the Kindle to any reasonable viewing angleThe quality of the stand seems OK, but not heavy duty. I don't know how long it will last, but it is made in Taiwan (and not mainland China), and I take that as a good indicator regarding durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ideal ipad stand! (imho)","review":"i use an ipad when seeing patients, and this stand is perfect. it's very lightweight (3.0 oz/85gm), folds to the length of a typical ballpoint pen (7\\"/18cm), and is only 1\\"/27mm x 1.25\\"/30mm. despite its light weight, it's really sturdy - a high-quality item.the details are significant: each of the two hinged/movable areas on the vertical part has real hardware, with a real combination phillips/flat head screw going into a recessed nut on the other side. tho' i haven't needed to do so, it's nice knowing i can change how tight each hinge is.the plastic is substantial. i'm sure i could easily stand on it while folded with no worry of cracking or damaging it.the only thing i'd change about it would be to include the name of the manufacturer on the product iteself - *every* ipad owner who's seen it wants one, and i don't always recall the manufacturer's name.in fact, i'm going to buy another one to keep at home right now: it's an essential ipad item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but elegant","review":"Surprisingly simple but an elegant, functional design.

Works great with my kindle fire","review":"While this is advertised for the iPad and other bigger pads, I've had no problems using it with my kindle fire and it holding it securely. It's perfect for when I want to stream and watch videos on the fire. No more sore neck or shoulder from looking down constantly or trying to hold the fire in my hands. I also get to see the full display which doesn't always happen with a case. It's easy to position to a perfect viewing angle for whatever position I am in. It's also very easy and compact to pack for trips. One other thing I love about it is kitchen use. If I am cooking from an electronic cookbook, I can put my kindle in this holder, place it on the kitchen counter and see my recipe as I go along or if it's a cooking video, I can watch, pause, watch, pause and the stand doesn't fall over on me.

At first, I loved this stand.After a few month's use, I have changed my mind about this product. While the two leg pieces still work just fine, the back piece does not. The screws that hold it have loosened, and, because of the plastic it is made from, it cannot be tightened enough to hold. The weight of the iPad causes it to flop over backwards.

The so-called non-slip stand in fact every so often sends your iPad slipping and sliding, even onto the floor.

Well only thing is that the pre fabricated slots for width of tablet is notcompatible with Toshiba Thrive. The Thrive is too thick to sit in the grooves on the stand and continually falls out and remains very unstable.Not too upset because stand was cheap, but I really have no use for it. Guess I will give it to one of my friends who has an IPAD.Still happy I bought the Thrive b/c really enjoy the access of full size USB and SD Card slots but starting to realize how much thicker it is than all the other tablets."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEH at best","review":"This may be decent to use on a flat surface where you have no chance of bumping into your device. I had gotten it to use as a stand for while in bed and I think it only alright.My biggest gripe is that it does not seem like they actually had an ipad when they designed this.It is highly adjustable, but the angles where you actually get good contact on the back arm is very limited. At 45 degrees it is ROCK SOLID. The back makes full contact. At a higher angle though, just the tip of the back pad touches the surface.So if you need to hold your ipad at 45 degrees this is a great device. At a higher or lower angle the back pad barely touches and the unit is a bit unstable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a champ!","review":"I bought this to accommodate my Dell Latitude 10 tablet with the extended battery. Since a folio case is not available yet, this stand along with a neoprene sleeve make a great alternative. Fits great on an airplane tray. I purchased a sleeve with an external zipper pocket to accommodate this stand and my capacitive touch stylus,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and stable tablet stand!","review":"This is a very good stand for tablets and is surprisingly stable. The only thing I would change is the height off the table. If you have a speaker cable plugged in, it can't sit at the bottom, you have to rotate the view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, Portable, Works Great!","review":"I really like this stand it. It is very portable and light. It also functions very well and keeps the Ipad steady. Only downside is I'm not sure how long it will last, but happy so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic iPad Stand!","review":"The Arkon stand is fantastic. I was wiling to pay a little more to get this original one instead of the other, cheaper copies of it. This stand is super adjustable and can accommodate a huge number of configurations. There are felt pads everywhere that my iPad makes contact with the stand. Also, the pads on the bottom keep everything in place and ensure there is no sliding. As long as you center your iPad instead of sloppily placing it on there, it absolutely will not wobble when you press down to type on it. I love this stand and it has actually enhanced the usability and overall experience of my iPad."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Made of cheap plastic not the way the description reads in details of product used for one day and broke a waste of10 dollars"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],O={key:0},P={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",P,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(D,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-ab0cc779"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/27.md","filePath":"sponsor/27.md"}'),H={name:"sponsor/27.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
